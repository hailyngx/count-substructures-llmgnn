Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by counting the number of times a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars.

From the adjacency list, we can identify the central nodes and their neighboring nodes:

- Central node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 12, and 3.
- Central node 1 is connected to nodes 12, 4, 2, and 10.
- Central node 2 is connected to nodes 12, 13, 11, and 4.
- Central node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 11.
- Central node 4 is connected to nodes 12, 13, and 11.
- Central node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 8, and 14.
- Central node 6 is connected to nodes 13, 11, and 14.
- Central node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 0, and 10.
- Central node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 3, and 6.
- Central node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 13.
- Central node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 3, and 1.
- Central node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 4.
- Central node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 4, and 1.
- Central node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 6.
- Central node 14 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 1.

After identifying the central nodes and their neighbors, we can count the number of 3-stars. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (7, 12, 3)>
<1, (12, 4, 2)>
<2, (12, 13, 11)>
<3, (5, 9, 11)>
<4, (12, 13, 11)>
<5, (13, 8, 14)>
<6, (13, 11, 14)>
<7, (12, 0, 10)>
<8, (5, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 9, 13)>
<10, (7, 3, 1)>
<11, (3, 6, 4)>
<12, (7, 4, 1)>
<13, (5, 9, 6)>
<14, (5, 6, 1)>

Since there are 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the final answer is [14].
