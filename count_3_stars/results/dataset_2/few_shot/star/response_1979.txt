Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify which nodes can act as the center of a 3-star. Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are potential centers for 3-stars.

From the adjacency list, we find the nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors
- Node 14 has 1 neighbor
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors

Therefore, the potential central nodes for 3-stars are nodes 0, 6, and 16.

Next, we identify the 3-stars centered at these nodes:
1. 3-star with center at node 0:
    - Leaves: 2, 17, 16
    <0, (2, 17, 16)>

2. 3-star with center at node 6:
    - Leaves: 7, 8, 9
    <6, (7, 8, 9)>

3. 3-star with center at node 16:
    - Leaves: 0, 19, 3
    <16, (0, 19, 3)>

Finally, we found 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph, each represented inside <>:
[3]
