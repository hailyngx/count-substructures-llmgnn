Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars. 

Nodes that form 3-stars in this graph are:
- Node 5 has 3-stars with (7, 6, 23), (7, 11, 15), and (5, 6, 23).
- Node 11 has 3-stars with (3, 29, 25), (7, 23, 15), and (11, 7, 5).
- Node 26 has a 3-star with (2, 10, 17).

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<5, (7, 6, 23)>, <5, (7, 11, 15)>, <5, (5, 6, 23)>, <11, (3, 29, 25)>, <11, (7, 23, 15)>, <11, (11, 7, 5)>, <26, (2, 10, 17)>.
