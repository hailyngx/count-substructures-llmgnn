Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step.

1. Identify central nodes: A central node in a 3-star graph has exactly 3 neighbors. Look for nodes that satisfy this condition.

   Central nodes: Node 3, Node 6, Node 8, Node 12, Node 14
   
2. For each central node, find its adjacent nodes and check if they form a 3-star pattern.

   For central node 3:
   - (3, 11, 6, 19), (3, 11, 13, 19), and (3, 11, 17, 19) form 3-stars.
   
   For central node 6:
   - (6, 11, 7, 9), (6, 11, 7, 8), (6, 11, 7, 17), (6, 9, 0, 12), and (6, 9, 0, 10) form 3-stars.
   
   For central node 8:
   - (8, 6, 18, 14), (8, 6, 18, 12), and (8, 6, 18, 14) form 3-stars.
   
   For central node 12:
   - (12, 9, 19, 8), (12, 9, 19, 13), and (12, 9, 19, 14) form 3-stars.
   
   For central node 14:
   - (14, 16, 18, 4) forms a 3-star.
   
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
   
   <3, (11, 6, 19)>, <3, (11, 13, 19)>, <3, (11, 17, 19)>, <6, (11, 7, 9)>, <6, (11, 7, 8)>, <6, (11, 7, 17)>, <6, (9, 0, 12)>, <6, (9, 0, 10)>, <8, (6, 18, 14)>, <8, (6, 18, 12)>, <12, (9, 19, 8)>, <12, (9, 19, 13)>, <12, (9, 19, 14)>, <14, (16, 18, 4)>
   
   Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
