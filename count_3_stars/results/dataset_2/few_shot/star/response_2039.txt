Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. 
From the given edges, we can determine the degrees of each node as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 6
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 6
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 4
- Node 10 has degree 4
- Node 11 has degree 4
- Node 12 has degree 3
- Node 13 has degree 6
- Node 14 has degree 5

Next, let's identify the 3-stars by looking at the neighbors of each node to see if they form a 3-star with that node as the center.

Identifying the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, 5: <2, (4, 7, 5)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 12, 14: <9, (8, 12, 14)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2] as listed above.
