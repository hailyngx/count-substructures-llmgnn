Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go through the adjacency list to identify the 3-stars.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 14, 11, 7, and 12:
   - <0, (14, 11, 7)>
   
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 10 and 16.
   - No 3-star with node 1 as the center.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
   - No 3-star with node 2 as the center.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 10, and 5:
   - <3, (15, 10, 5)>

5. Node 4 is connected to node 9.
   - No 3-star with node 4 as the center.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 17, and 2:
   - <5, (3, 17, 2)>

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 14, 11, 13, and 16:
   - <6, (14, 11, 13)>
   - <6, (14, 11, 16)>
   
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 18, 12, 0, and 19:
   - <7, (2, 18, 12)>
   - <7, (2, 18, 19)>
   - <7, (2, 12, 0)>

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 14, 10, and 9.
   - <8, (14, 10, 9)>

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 15, 17, 8, and 4:
    - <9, (15, 17, 8)>
    - No more 3-stars with node 9 as the center since the requirement is to list them once.
    
11. Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 1:
    - <10, (3, 8, 1)>

12. Node 11 is connected to nodes 19, 0, 13, and 6:
    - <11, (19, 0, 13)>
    - No more 3-stars with node 11 as the center since the requirement is to list them once.
    
13. Node 12 is connected to nodes 18, 7, and 0:
    - No 3-star with node 12 as the center.

14. Node 13 is connected to nodes 11 and 6.
    - No 3-star with node 13 as the center.

15. Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 8, and 16:
    - No 3-star with node 14 as the center.

16. Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 9, and 18:
    - <15, (3, 9, 18)>

17. Node 16 is connected to nodes 14, 6, and 1:
    - No 3-star with node 16 as the center.

18. Node 17 is connected to nodes 9 and 5.
    - No 3-star with node 17 as the center.

19. Node 18 is connected to nodes 15, 7, and 12:
    - No 3-star with node 18 as the center.

20. Node 19 is connected to nodes 11 and 7.
    - No 3-star with node 19 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
