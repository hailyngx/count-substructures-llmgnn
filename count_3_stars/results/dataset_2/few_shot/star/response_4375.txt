Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-star configurations in the given graph. 
We will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, creating a 3-star pattern. 

After examining the adjacency list of each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
  
<1, (6, 9, 14)>
<2, (4, 16, 17)>
<3, (4, 9, 15)>
<4, (2, 3, 18)>
<6, (1, 4, 17)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<12, (10, 13, 15)>
<13, (7, 12, 15)>
<14, (1, 5, 0)>
<15, (3, 5, 16)>
<16, (0, 2, 17)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars identified: [10].
