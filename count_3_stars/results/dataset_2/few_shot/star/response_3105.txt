Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node (center) and the leaves connected to it. Since the given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can infer the following:
- The nodes are numbered from 0 to 19.
- Each node has a set of neighbors based on the adjacency list provided.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph step by step:

1. Determine the central node (center) for each potential 3-star. A center is a node connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. For each center, find the neighboring nodes as leaves to form a 3-star.

Here are the identified 3-stars inside <>:
<0, (2, 11, 13)>
<2, (5, 8, 19)>
<3, (11, 16, 0)>
<4, (18, 14, 1)>
<5, (6, 2, 18)>
<6, (5, 14, 8)>
<7, (12, 16, 18)>
<8, (6, 2, 0)>
<9, (18, 19, 16)>
<10, (17, 12, 7)>
<11, (7, 0, 3)>
<12, (7, 10, 13)>
<13, (6, 12, 0)>
<14, (4, 6, 0)>
<15, (17, 12, 13)>
<16, (7, 17, 3)>
<17, (10, 16, 15)>
<18, (4, 7, 5)>
<19, (2, 9, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
