Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can find the number of 3-stars that have a specific node as the center. We will then sum up all those counts to get the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. For each node in the graph, determine the number of 3-stars that have that node as the central node.

2. Sum up the counts from step 1 to get the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

Let's calculate this step by step:

For Node 0:
No 3-stars with Node 0 as the central node.

For Node 1:
No 3-stars with Node 1 as the central node.

For Node 2:
No 3-stars with Node 2 as the central node.

For Node 3:
No 3-stars with Node 3 as the central node.

For Node 4:
No 3-stars with Node 4 as the central node.

For Node 5:
No 3-stars with Node 5 as the central node.

For Node 6:
No 3-stars with Node 6 as the central node.

For Node 7:
No 3-stars with Node 7 as the central node.

For Node 8:
No 3-stars with Node 8 as the central node.

For Node 9:
3-stars with Node 9 as the central node: <9, (18, 17, 10)>

For Node 10:
No 3-stars with Node 10 as the central node.

For Node 11:
No 3-stars with Node 11 as the central node.

For Node 12:
No 3-stars with Node 12 as the central node.

For Node 13:
No 3-stars with Node 13 as the central node.

For Node 14:
No 3-stars with Node 14 as the central node.

For Node 15:
3-stars with Node 15 as the central node: <15, (27, 19, 7)>

For Node 16:
3-stars with Node 16 as the central node: <16, (8, 23, 4)>

For Node 17:
No 3-stars with Node 17 as the central node.

For Node 18:
3-stars with Node 18 as the central node: <18, (9, 5, 14)>

For Node 19:
No 3-stars with Node 19 as the central node.

For Node 20:
No 3-stars with Node 20 as the central node.

For Node 21:
No 3-stars with Node 21 as the central node.

For Node 22:
No 3-stars with Node 22 as the central node.

For Node 23:
No 3-stars with Node 23 as the central node.

For Node 24:
No 3-stars with Node 24 as the central node.

For Node 25:
No 3-stars with Node 25 as the central node.

For Node 26:
No 3-stars with Node 26 as the central node.

For Node 27:
3-stars with Node 27 as the central node: <27, (15, 12, 24)>

For Node 28:
No 3-stars with Node 28 as the central node.

For Node 29:
No 3-stars with Node 29 as the central node.

Adding up the counts, we get a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<9, (18, 17, 10)>
<15, (27, 19, 7)>
<16, (8, 23, 4)>
<18, (9, 5, 14)>
