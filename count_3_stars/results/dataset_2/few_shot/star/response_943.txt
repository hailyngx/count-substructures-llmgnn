Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with three edges connected are:
   - Node 3 (connected to nodes 17, 6, and 2)
   - Node 10 (connected to nodes 17, 12, and 19)
   
2. Count the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
   - Node 3 can form a 3-star with central node 3 and leaves 17, 6, and 2. (<3, (17, 6, 2)>)
   - Node 10 cannot form any 3-star as it has no pair of completely connected nodes.

Therefore, there is only one 3-star in the given graph. The final answer is [1].
