Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three edges:
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 15, 4, 0
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 11, 3, 7
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 8, 19
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 4, 10, 9
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 16, 18, 4
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 13, 2, 18
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 15, 17, 9
- Node 18: Connected to nodes 11, 12
- Node 19: Connected to nodes 17, 8, 5

2. For each of these nodes, identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3  <3, (15, 4, 0)>
- Node 4  <4, (11, 3, 7)>
- Node 6  <6, (8, 19, _)>
- Node 7  <7, (4, 10, 9)>
- Node 11  <11, (16, 18, 4)>
- Node 12  <12, (13, 2, 18)>
- Node 14  <14, (15, 17, 9)>
- Node 18  <18, (11, 12, _)>
- Node 19  <19, (17, 8, 5)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [9]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (15, 4, 0)>
<4, (11, 3, 7)>
<6, (8, 19, _)>
<7, (4, 10, 9)>
<11, (16, 18, 4)>
<12, (13, 2, 18)>
<14, (15, 17, 9)>
<18, (11, 12, _)>
<19, (17, 8, 5)>  

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
