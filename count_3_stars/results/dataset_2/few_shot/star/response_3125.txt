Response:
Step 1: Determine the 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 has 4 edges
- Node 1 has 3 edges
- Node 2 has 4 edges
- Node 3 has 3 edges
- Node 4 has 2 edges
- Node 5 has 2 edges
- Node 6 has 1 edge
- Node 7 has 3 edges
- Node 8 has 5 edges
- Node 9 has 2 edges
- Node 10 has 3 edges
- Node 11 has 4 edges
- Node 12 has 2 edges
- Node 13 has 2 edges
- Node 14 has 2 edges
- Node 15 has 4 edges
- Node 16 has 3 edges
- Node 17 has 2 edges
- Node 18 has 5 edges
- Node 19 has 4 edges

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

By identifying the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them, we find the following 3-stars: <3, (15, 0, 10)>, <10, (3, 8, 1)>, <11, (15, 9, 14)>.
Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
