Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the adjacency list to identify these 3-stars.

1. **Identify Nodes Connected to Exactly Three Others:**
   - Node 1: Connected to nodes 3, 14, and 13
   - Node 2: Connected to nodes 7, 17, and 13
   - Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 14, and 12
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 8, and 14
   - Node 5: Connected to nodes 15, and 7
   - Node 6: Connected to nodes 8, and 10
   - Node 9: Connected to nodes 10, 19, 14, and 13
   - Node 10: Connected to nodes 16, 6, 15, and 9
   - Node 12: Connected to nodes 3, 19, 0, and 13
   - Node 13: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 12, and 9
   - Node 14: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 18, and 9
   - Node 15: Connected to nodes 16, 5, 10, and 17
   - Node 16: Connected to nodes 7, 10, and 15
   - Node 17: Connected to nodes 15, 7, and 2
   - Node 19: Connected to nodes 7, 12, and 9

2. **Identify 3-Stars:**
   - From the identified nodes above, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes form the centers of 3-stars.
   - We observe that the nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 are potential central nodes for 3-stars.

3. **Count the Unique 3-Stars:**
   - Now, we need to find the leaves connected to each potential central node to identify unique 3-stars. 

4. **Unique 3-Stars:**
   - <1, (3, 14, 13)>
   - <2, (7, 17, 13)>
   - <3, (1, 14, 12)>
   - <4, (8, 14, \*)>
   - <5, (15, 7, \*)>
   - <6, (8, 10, \*)>
   - <9, (10, 19, 14)>
   - <10, (16, 6, 15)>
   - <12, (3, 19, 0)>
   - <13, (1, 2, 12)>
   - <14, (1, 3, 4)>
   - <15, (16, 5, 17)>
   - <16, (7, 10, 15)>
   - <17, (15, 7, 2)>
   - <19, (7, 12, 9)>
