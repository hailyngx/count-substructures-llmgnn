Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph. 

Let's list the possible 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (15, 11, 12)>
<3, (10, 16, 19)>
<4, (18, 14, 15)>
<5, (13, 8, 17)>
<6, (9, 8, 19)>
<9, (6, 12, 19)>
<10, (3, 11, 12)>
<11, (1, 10, 0)>
<12, (9, 1, 10)>
<13, (5, 8, 17)>
<14, (10, 11, 19)>
<15, (1, 4, 1)> - This is not a valid 3-star as node 4 is connected to 4 other nodes.
<16, (3, 18, 17)>
<17, (5, 13, 16)>
<18, (4, 16, 0)>
<19, (9, 3, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13] (listed above).
