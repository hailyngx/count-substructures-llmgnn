Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Analyze the adjacency list of each node and identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. Based on the connections, identify the 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars:

<0, (4, 12, 13)>
<1, (6, 9, 11)>
<2, (7, 10, 13)>
<3, (5, 8, 11)>
<4, (0, 8, 14)>
<6, (0, 12, 13)>
<7, (2, 10, 14)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 10, 11)>
<10, (2, 7, 9)>
<11, (1, 3, 13)>
<12, (0, 6, 7)>
<13, (0, 6, 14)>
<14, (4, 7, 13)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [14].
