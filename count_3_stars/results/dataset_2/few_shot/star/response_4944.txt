Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 12) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 13) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 8) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 13, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, 9, 13, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 12, 1, 11, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 5, 2, and node 11
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 10, 2, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 10, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 12, 0, and node 11
Node 10 is connected to node 7, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 6, 12, and node 9
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, 11, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, and node 14

Response:
Based on the given graph and adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<4, (7, 12, 3)>
<7, (4, 10, 13)>
<1, (4, 8, 3)>
<3, (4, 7, 12)>
<2, (7, 8, 13)>
<8, (1, 10, 12)>
<9, (2, 12, 11)>
<0, (5, 9, 6)>
<5, (6, 0, 10)>
<6, (7, 5, 2)>
<11, (4, 6, 9)>
<12, (4, 3, 8)>
<13, (7, 1, 14)>

Therefore, there are a total of [13] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
