Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. We notice that a 3-star is formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Now, let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (6, 9, 5)>
<1, (7, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 5)>
<4, (7, 5, 3)>
<5, (4, 6, 2)>
<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<7, (4, 2, 8)>
<8, (7, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
