Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 1, 7)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 0, 7)>
<1, (7, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (6, 1, 8)>
<2, (8, 7, 3)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (8, 2, 1)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (1, 7, 0)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (7, 0, 9)>
<6, (2, 1, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (9, 0, 2)>
<7, (5, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 4, 1)>
<7, (4, 3, 0)>
<8, (3, 7, 1)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<8, (2, 1, 3)>
<9, (6, 7, 3)>
<9, (8, 7, 0)>
<9, (7, 0, 6)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 29.]
