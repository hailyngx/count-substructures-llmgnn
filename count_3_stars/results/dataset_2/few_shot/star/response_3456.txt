Response:
First, we need to identify the nodes that are at the center of a 3-star in this graph. This means finding nodes with exactly three neighbors.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes, so it cannot be a center node.
- Nodes 8, 12, 14, 18, 22 have only one neighbor, so they cannot be center nodes.
- Nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 20, 23, 26 have more than three neighbors, so they cannot be center nodes.
- Nodes 1, 6, 13, 21, 24, and 28 have exactly three neighbors, so they can be center nodes.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 1: (17, 8, 10)
- For node 6: (11, 12, 13)
- For node 13: (6, 11, 28)
- For node 21: (28, 19, 26)
- For node 24: (17, 20, 21)
- For node 28: (25, 21, 13)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars found are <1, (17, 8, 10)>, <6, (11, 12, 13)>, <13, (6, 11, 28)>, <21, (28, 19, 26)>, <24, (17, 20, 21)>, and <28, (25, 21, 13)>.
