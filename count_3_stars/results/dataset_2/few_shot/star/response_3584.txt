Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph based on the provided information about the nodes and their connections.

Observations:
- A 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
- We can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly three connections to other nodes.

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can determine the following 3-stars:
1. Node 1: connected to nodes 21, 6, and 29 <1, (21, 6, 29)>
2. Node 21: connected to nodes 1, 16, and 11 <21, (1, 16, 11)>
3. Node 22: connected to nodes 10, 15, and 29 <22, (10, 15, 29)>
4. Node 26: connected to nodes 13, 5, and 11 <26, (13, 5, 11)>
5. Node 27: connected to nodes 1, 2, and 16 <27, (1, 2, 16)>
6. Node 28: connected to nodes 23, 13, and 24 <28, (23, 13, 24)>
7. Node 29: connected to nodes 1, 22, and 9 <29, (1, 22, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
