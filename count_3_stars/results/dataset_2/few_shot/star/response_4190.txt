Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, let's identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges leaving them, as these nodes can be the central node of a 3-star. These nodes are 0, 1, and 2.

Next, for each of these nodes, we will determine the 3-stars that can be formed with them. 

For node 0:
- <0, (4, 10, 12)>
- <0, (4, 6, 10)>
- <0, (4, 6, 12)>
Total: 3

For node 1:
- <1, (5, 7, 13)>
- <1, (5, 7, 14)>
- <1, (7, 13, 14)>
Total: 3

For node 2:
- <2, (6, 13, 14)>
- <2, (6, 13, 3)>
- <2, (6, 13, 2)>
Total: 3

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 10, 12)>, <1, (5, 7, 13)>, <2, (6, 13, 14)>.
