Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 6: Connected to 5, 1, 12
- Node 7: Connected to 4, 0, 11
- Node 12: Connected to 4, 8, 13

2. For each of the identified nodes in step 1, check if the connections form a 3-star.
   - For Node 6: 3-star pattern found: <6, (5, 1, 12)>
   - For Node 7: 3-star pattern found: <7, (4, 0, 11)>
   - For Node 12: 3-star pattern found: <12, (4, 8, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
