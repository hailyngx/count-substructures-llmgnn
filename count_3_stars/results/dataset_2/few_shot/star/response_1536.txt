Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. 
Based on the definition provided, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can find the following unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 3, 7)>
<0, (4, 3, 6)>
<1, (11, 7, 6)>
<1, (11, 7, 14)>
<2, (8, 5, 6)>
<2, (8, 5, 10)>
<3, (8, 2, 11)>
<3, (8, 2, 7)>
<4, (8, 0, 5)>
<10, (2, 7, 10)>
<11, (8, 3, 14)>
<11, (8, 3, 1)>
<12, (1, 5, 9)>
<13, (7, 9, 13)>
<14, (11, 1, 5)>

After identifying all unique 3-stars, we count the total number of unique 3-stars found in the graph and enclose the final answer inside brackets.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
