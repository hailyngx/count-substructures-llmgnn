Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Considering Node 5 as the center:
    - (5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 4) form a 3-star with center 5. <5, (9, 1, 4)>
    - (5, 0) does not form a 3-star since 0 is not directly connected to 9 or 1.
    
2. Considering Node 9 as the center:
    - (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 4) form a 3-star with center 9. <9, (5, 8, 4)>
    - (9, 1) does not form a 3-star since 1 is not directly connected to 5 or 4.
    - (9, 7) does not form a 3-star since 7 is not directly connected to 5 or 4.
    
3. Considering Node 4 as the center:
    - (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 7) form a 3-star with center 4. <4, (5, 9, 7)>
    - (4, 8) does not form a 3-star since 8 is not directly connected to 5 or 7.
    - (4, 2) does not form a 3-star since 2 is not directly connected to 5 or 9.

4. Considering Node 7 as the center:
    - (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 6) form a 3-star with center 7. <7, (9, 4, 6)>
    - (7, 1) does not form a 3-star since 1 is not directly connected to 9 or 4.

5. Considering Node 1 as the center:
    - (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 7) form a 3-star with center 1. <1, (5, 9, 7)>
    - (1, 3) does not form a 3-star since 3 is not directly connected to 5 or 9.
    
6. Considering Node 0 as the center:
    - (0, 5), (0, 1), (0, 3) form a 3-star with center 0. <0, (5, 1, 3)>
    - (0, 6) does not form a 3-star since 6 is not directly connected to 5 or 1.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
