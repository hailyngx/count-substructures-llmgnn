Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, 2, 9, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 0, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: Identify Nodes with exactly 3 connected nodes
From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 6

Step 2: Construct 3-stars from identified nodes
Let's construct the 3-stars from each of the identified nodes:

From Node 0:
<0, (3, 5, 2)>
<0, (3, 2, 9)>

From Node 1:
<1, (6, 2, 4)>
<1, (6, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>

From Node 2:
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 0)>
<2, (3, 4, 0)>

From Node 3:
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 9, 2)>
<3, (6, 9, 2)>

From Node 6:
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>

Step 3: Counting the number of unique 3-stars
The unique 3-stars identified are:
<0, (3, 5, 2)>
<0, (3, 2, 9)>
<1, (6, 2, 4)>
<1, (6, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 0)>
<2, (3, 4, 0)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 9, 2)>
<3, (6, 9, 2)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
