Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and its connected nodes. Then, we can determine if there is a 3-star around each central node.

Based on the given adjacency list, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (4, 7, 6)>
<1, (5, 8, 2)>
<2, (5, 9, 1)>
<3, (9, 0, 2)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<6, (7, 0)>
<7, (5, 4, 0)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
