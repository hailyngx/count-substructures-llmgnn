Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.
Based on the definition provided, a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 7, 1)>
- <1, (9, 6, 0)>
- <2, (9, 4, 7)>
- <3, (4, 7, 2)>
- <4, (9, 7, 3)>
- <5, (9, 6, 0)>
- <6, (5, 7, 1)>
- <7, (4, 0, 3)>
- <8, (7, 1, 3)>
- <9, (5, 4, 2)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
