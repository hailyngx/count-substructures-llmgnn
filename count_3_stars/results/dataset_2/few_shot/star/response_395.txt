Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to three other nodes in a star-like pattern. 

Let's identify all the 3-stars:
[12]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1]. 
The unique 3-star found is <12, (13, 4, 16)>.
