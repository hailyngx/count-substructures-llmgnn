Response:
Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find all the possible 3-stars in the given graph.

To do this, we can iterate through each node in the graph and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If it is, then we have found a 3-star graph with that node as the center.

Here are the 3-star graphs found in the given graph:
<6, (9, 1, 8)>
<9, (6, 18, 15)>
<8, (6, 17, 1)>
<1, (6, 16, 18)>
<12, (7, 2, 5)>
<7, (13, 12, 3)>
<10, (7, 14, 15)>
<11, (7, 12, 5)>
<4, (13, 3, 11)>
<5, (12, 19, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [10].
