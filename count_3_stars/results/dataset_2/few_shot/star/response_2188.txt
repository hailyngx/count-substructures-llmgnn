Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see the 3-star configurations:

<0, (6, 3, 6)>
<1, (6, 4, 3)>
<2, (9, 6, 4)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<6, (9, 1, 2)>
<7, (9, 4, 2)>
<8, (6, 4, 2)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 6, 3)>
<9, (5, 3, 7)>
<9, (5, 3, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
