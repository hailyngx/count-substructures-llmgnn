Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

There are three conditions for a 3-star:
1. The center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Each of these three nodes connected to the center node is not connected to each other.
3. The three nodes connected to the center node are unique.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<13, (17, 3, 28)>
<5, (19, 1, 11)>
<17, (13, 6, 29)>
<1, (5, 21, 18)>
<3, (13, 22, 27)>
<19, (5, 17, 25)>
<6, (17, 20, 14)>
<7, (12, 0, 20)>
<11, (5, 29, 26)>
<9, (2, 12, 9)>
<0, (7, 10, 23)>
<16, (25, 18, 10)>
<2, (9, 2, 12)>
<15, (26, 8, 15)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [14].
