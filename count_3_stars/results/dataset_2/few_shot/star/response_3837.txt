Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph.

Let's first list all the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (6, 2, 0)>
<1, (4, 3, 1)>
<2, (4, 3, 2)>
<3, (9, 1, 4)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 4, 6)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>

From the list above, we see that there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
