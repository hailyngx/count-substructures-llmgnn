Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We will go through each node in the graph and check if it is a part of any 3-star configuration.

The nodes with exactly three connections in the graph are:
- Node 9: connected to 7, 8,  NB 14
- Node 11: connected to 5, 14,  NB 12
- NB Node 10: connected to 5, NB 14, 11
- NB Node 1: connected to 8, 6, 14
- NB Node 3: connected to 0, 2, 12

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<9, (7, 8, 14)>
<11, (5, 14, 12)>
<10, (5, 14, 11)>
<1, (8, 6, 14)>
<3, (0, 2, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
