Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent the 3-stars in the graph. 

Checking each node in the graph:
- Node 0 is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 1 is part of a 3-star with nodes 9, 6, and 0: <1, (9, 6, 0)>
- Node 2 is part of a 3-star with nodes 9, 13, and 4: <2, (9, 13, 4)>
- Node 3 is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 4 is part of a 3-star with nodes 5, 10, and 6: <4, (5, 10, 6)>
- Node 5 is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 6 is part of two 3-stars: <6, (5, 1, 4)> and <6, (12, 11, 0)>
- Node 7 is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 8 is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 9 is part of a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 2: <9, (1, 3, 2)>
- Node 10 is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 11 is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 12 is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 13 is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 14 is not part of a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
- <1, (9, 6, 0)>
- <2, (9, 13, 4)>
- <4, (5, 10, 6)>
- <6, (5, 1, 4)>
- <6, (12, 11, 0)>
- <9, (1, 3, 2)>

Count of 3-stars = 6
