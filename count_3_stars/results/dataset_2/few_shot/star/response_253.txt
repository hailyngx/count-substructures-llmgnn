Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by looking at nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's first identify such nodes:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 21, 23, and 6.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 11, and 5.
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 18, and 6.
4. Node 14 is connected to nodes 28, 3, and 8.
5. Node 21 is connected to only 1 node (Node 0).
6. Node 28 is connected to only 1 node (Node 14).

Out of the above, only nodes 0, 2, 4, and 14 are in positions where they can form 3-star graphs. Let's analyze each one to count the 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
   - Connected to nodes 21, 23, and 6.
   - Possible 3-star: <0, (21, 23, 6)>
   
2. Node 2:
   - Connected to nodes 11 and 5.
   - Not a 3-star structure as it only has 2 connections.
   
3. Node 4:
   - Connected to nodes 18 and 6.
   - Not a 3-star structure as it only has 2 connections.
   
4. Node 14:
   - Connected to nodes 28, 3, and 8.
   - Possible 3-star: <14, (28, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2] and the unique 3-star structures found are <0, (21, 23, 6)> and <14, (28, 3, 8)>.
