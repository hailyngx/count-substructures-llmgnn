Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph can be found by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them step by step:

1. Nodes 0, 1, and 17 are connected to three other nodes each:
   - <0, (17, 7, 14)>
   - <1, (16, 15, 7)>
   - <17, (10, 0, 2)>

2. Nodes 4, 5, 8, and 12 are connected to three other nodes each:
   - <4, (18, 19, 14)>
   - <5, (12, 0, 1)>
   - <8, (11, 10, 5)>
   - <12, (11, 5, 19)>

3. Node 14 is connected to four other nodes, but it forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 0, and 19:
   - <14, (4, 0, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [7].
