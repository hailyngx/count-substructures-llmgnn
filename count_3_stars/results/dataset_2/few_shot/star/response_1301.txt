Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step by step.

First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly 3 connections:
- Node 5 has connections to nodes 6, 4, and 10.
- Node 6 has connections to nodes 5, 9, and 12.
- Node 10 has connections to nodes 5, 9, and 1.
- Node 11 has connections to nodes 4, 14, and 0.
- Node 14 has connections to nodes 8, 11, and 1.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars involving these nodes:
- For Node 5: <5, (6, 4, 10)>
- For Node 6: <6, (5, 9, 12)>
- For Node 10: <10, (5, 9, 1)>
- For Node 11: <11, (4, 14, 0)>
- For Node 14: <14, (8, 11, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
