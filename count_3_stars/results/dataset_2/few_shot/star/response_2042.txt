Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. Since each 3-star has 3 leaves and there are 30 nodes, we will count the number of nodes that have at least 3 edges connected to them. 

Nodes with 3 or more edges connected to them: 9, 26, 13, 22, 6, 28, 29, 18, 15, 20, 11, 0, 5, 24, 10.

Now, for each of these nodes, we will identify the 3-stars that can be formed with them as the center and their adjacent nodes.

1. Node 9: <9, (21, 26, 17)>
2. Node 26: <26, (6, 8, 17)>
3. Node 13: <13, (25, 23, 10)>
4. Node 22: <22, (19, 28, 0)>
5. Node 6: <6, (14, 17, 12)>
6. Node 28: <28, (29, 18, 11)>
7. Node 29: <29, (19, 5, 11)>
8. Node 18: <18, (5, 15, 21)>
9. Node 15: <15, (20, 7, 18)>
10. Node 20: <20, (10, 16, 15)>
11. Node 11: <11, (29, 23, 21)>
12. Node 0: <0, (11, 1, 7)>
13. Node 5: <5, (18, 23, 29)>
14. Node 24: <24, (4, 16, 10)>
15. Node 10: <10, (12, 25, 27)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].

<9, (21, 26, 17)>, <26, (6, 8, 17)>, <13, (25, 23, 10)>, <22, (19, 28, 0)>, <6, (14, 17, 12)>, <28, (29, 18, 11)>, <29, (19, 5, 11)>, <18, (5, 15, 21)>, <15, (20, 7, 18)>, <20, (10, 16, 15)>, <11, (29, 23, 21)>, <0, (11, 1, 7)>, <5, (18, 23, 29)>, <24, (4, 16, 10)>, <10, (12, 25, 27)>
