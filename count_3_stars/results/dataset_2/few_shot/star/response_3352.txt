Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 12) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 2) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 4) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 1)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph based on the given information, we need to identify all instances of the 3-stars in the graph.

Let's start by looking at each node and its connections to identify the 3-stars.

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (12, 7, 14)>
<7, (5, 12, 14)>
<12, (5, 9, 7)>
<14, (5, 8, 7)>
<6, (9, 3, 11)>

Count of 3-stars in total: [5]

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
