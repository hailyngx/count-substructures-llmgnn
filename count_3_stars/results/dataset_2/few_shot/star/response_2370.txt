Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 1 (neighbors: 19, 12, 18)
   - Node 2 (neighbors: 11, 18)
   - Node 3 (neighbors: 15, 12, 8)
   - Node 4 (neighbors: 9, 3, 7)
   - Node 5 (neighbors: 9, 12, 18)
   - Node 6 (neighbors: 14, 8, 13)
   - Node 7 (neighbors: 15, 4, 13)
   - Node 8 (neighbors: 16, 3, 14)
   - Node 10 (neighbors: 11, 9)
   - Node 12 (neighbors: 5, 3, 1)
   - Node 14 (neighbors: 17, 6, 8)
   - Node 18 (neighbors: 5, 1, 2)
   - Node 19 (neighbors: 1, 0)

2. List all possible 3-stars:
   <1, (19, 12, 18)>
   <2, (11, 18, 5)>
   <3, (15, 12, 8)>
   <4, (9, 3, 7)>
   <5, (9, 12, 18)>
   <6, (14, 8, 13)>
   <7, (15, 4, 13)>
   <8, (16, 3, 14)>
   <9, (16, 5, 10)>
   <10, (11, 10, 9)>
   <11, (1, 12, 5)>
   <12, (17, 6, 14)>
   <13, (5, 18, 2)>
   <14, (19, 1, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
