Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. A central node in a 3-star graph will always have a degree of 3. From the given adjacency list, we can see that the central nodes are node 2, node 17, and node 19.

Now, let's identify the leaves connected to each central node to find the 3-stars present in the graph:

For central node 2:
- Leaves connected to node 2: 8, 0, 9
Therefore, the 3-star with node 2 as the center is <2, (8, 0, 9)>

For central node 17:
- Leaves connected to node 17: 8, 4, 12, 6, 7
Therefore, the 3-star with node 17 as the center is <17, (8, 4, 12)> and <17, (8, 4, 6)>.

For central node 19:
- Leaves connected to node 19: 0, 7, 15
Therefore, the 3-star with node 19 as the center is <19, (0, 7, 15)>.

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we have:
- <2, (8, 0, 9)>
- <17, (8, 4, 12)>
- <17, (8, 4, 6)>
- <19, (0, 7, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
