Response:
Finding the 3-stars in the given graph involves locating nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify these 3-stars:

1. <0, (7, 15, 9)>
2. <1, (16, 18, 8)>
3. <2, (16, 12, 9)>
4. <3, (6, 19, 18)>
5. <4, (6, 17, 5)>
6. <5, (13, 17, 10)>
7. <6, (3, 7, 15)>
8. <7, (0, 11, 19)>
9. <8, (1, 11, 14)>
10. <9, (0, 2, 11)>
11. <10, (5, 19, 17)>
12. <11, (7, 9, 8)>
13. <13, (5, 14, 18)>
14. <14, (13, 8)>
15. <15, (0, 16, 6)>
16. <16, (1, 5, 15)>
17. <17, (5, 15, 4)>
18. <18, (1, 3, 13)>
19. <19, (3, 7, 10)>

There are a total of [19] 3-stars in the given graph.
