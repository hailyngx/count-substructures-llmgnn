Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. A 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-star structures:
<8, (13, 28, 15)>
<13, (8, 25, 2)>
<2, (13, 20, 16)>
<18, (27, 3, 21)>
<6, (28, 21, 17)>
<27, (18, 3, 21)>
<1, (28, 25, 24)>
<15, (8, 11, 10)>
<10, (15, 23, 5)>
<21, (6, 4, 27)>
<17, (6, 0, 20)>
<19, (11, 4, 24)>
<7, (13, 16, 29)>
<9, (22, 12, 24)>
<16, (7, 12, 20)>
<0, (22, 17, 25)>
<20, (2, 16, 27)>
<23, (10, 21, 0)>
<22, (9, 0, 25)>
<25, (13, 22, 1)>
<14, (9, 24, 14)>

There are [20] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
