Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2)

Node 7 is connected to node 3, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern). 

Let's go through the adjacency list of each node to find all 3-stars:

<b>
1. Node 0: (5, 9, 6)  
2. Node 1: (5, 9, 4)  
3. Node 2: (5, 3, 7)  
4. Node 3: No 3-star  
5. Node 4: No 3-star  
6. Node 5: (9, 2, 1)  
7. Node 6: No 3-star  
8. Node 7: No 3-star  
9. Node 8: (9, 1, 4)  
10. Node 9: (5, 6, 8)  
</b>

From the above, we have identified the following unique 3-stars:

1. <0, (5, 9, 6)>
2. <1, (5, 9, 4)>
3. <2, (5, 3, 7)>
4. <5, (9, 2, 1)>
5. <8, (9, 1, 4)>
6. <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
