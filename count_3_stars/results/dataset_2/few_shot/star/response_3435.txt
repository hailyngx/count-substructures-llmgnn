Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes with exactly three connections:
   - Node 17 is connected to nodes 3, 10, and 0.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 10, and 27.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 10, 12, and 22.
   - Node 22 is connected to nodes 7, 6, and 8.
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 17, 14 and 9.
   - Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 29.
   - Node 15 is connected to nodes 6, 21, and 26.
   - Node 16 is connected to nodes 29 and 2.
   - Node 21 is connected to nodes 28, 23, and 22.
   - Node 24 is connected to nodes 8, 28, and 11.

2. Count all unique 3-stars:
   - <17, (3, 10, 0)>
   - <5, (3, 10, 27)>
   - <7, (10, 12, 22)>
   - <22, (7, 6, 8)>
   - <0, (17, 14, 9)>
   - <14, (0, 8, 29)>
   - <15, (6, 21, 26)>
   - <16, (29, 2)>
   - <21, (28, 23, 22)>
   - <24, (8, 28, 11)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
