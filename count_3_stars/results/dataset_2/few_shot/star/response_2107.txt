Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided.

Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 7 as the leaves, with 5 as the center.
Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 6 as the leaves, with 9 as the center.

Now, we can count the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
