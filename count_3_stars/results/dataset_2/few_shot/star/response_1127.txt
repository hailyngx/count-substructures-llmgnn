Response:
The given graph has a total of 30 nodes and 90 edges. We will count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph. 

<11, (7, 8, 25)>
<16, (8, 10, 15)>
<6, (1, 27, 28)>
<9, (7, 15, 9)>
<2, (17, 29, 2)>
<29, (10, 22, 25)>
<22, (5, 10, 23)>
<23, (18, 27, 22)>
<4, (7, 19, 24)>
<7, (4, 9, 11)>
<20, (7, 12, 25)>
<0, (3, 17, 0)>
<1, (6, 10, 26)>
<28, (6, 27, 28)>
<18, (12, 21, 23)>
<3, (0, 13, 17)>
<13, (3, 13, 13)>
<17, (0, 2, 27)>
<8, (11, 16, 24)>
<24, (4, 8, 27)>
<19, (4, 14, 19)>
<15, (9, 16, 15)>
<27, (6, 17, 23)>
<12, (14, 18, 20)>
<14, (4, 12, 14)>
<5, (10, 21, 22)>
<10, (1, 5, 16)>
<25, (11, 20, 29)>
<26, (1, 26, 26)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars listed above.
