Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 2, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 5, 2)>
2. <1, (4, 8, 5)>
3. <2, (6, 5, 0)>
4. <3, (6, 9, 0)>
5. <4, (8, 0, 1)>
6. <5, (2, 1, 0)>
7. <6, (9, 7, 3)>
8. <7, (6, 9, 0)>
9. <8, (9, 4, 1)>
10. <9, (6, 8, 3)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
