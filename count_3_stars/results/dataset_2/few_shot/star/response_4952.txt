Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

We will go through each node and check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors:

- For Node 0: (0, 3, 9) forms a 3-star.
- For Node 1: (1, 3, 14) forms a 3-star.
- For Node 2: (2, 9, 14) forms a 3-star.
- For Node 4: (4, 9, 13) forms a 3-star.
- For Node 7: (7, 12, 14) and (7, 11, 13) form 3-stars.
- For Node 9: (9, 4, 10) form a 3-star.
- For Node 10: (10, 11, 14) forms a 3-star.
- For Node 11: (11, 7, 8) and (11, 5, 6) form 3-stars.
- For Node 12: (12, 1, 3) forms a 3-star.
- For Node 14: (14, 1, 10) and (14, 2, 9) form 3-stars.

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have:
<0, (3, 9, 11)>, <1, (3, 14, 12)>, <2, (9, 14, 10)>, <4, (9, 13, 5)>, <7, (12, 14, 11)>, <7, (11, 13, 5)>, <9, (4, 10, 2)>, <10, (11, 14, 7)>, <11, (7, 8, 11)>, <11, (5, 6, 4)>, <12, (1, 3, 7)>, <14, (1, 10, 14)>, <14, (2, 9, 14)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
