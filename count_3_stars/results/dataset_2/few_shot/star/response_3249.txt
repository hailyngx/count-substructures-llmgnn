Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (6, 1, 12)>
2. <1, (6, 9, 3)>
3. <2, (6, 4, 13)>
4. <3, (1, 11, )>
5. <4, (8, 11, 2)>
6. <5, (8, 10, 14)>
7. <6, (9, 1, 7)>
8. <7, (6, 10, 14)>
9. <8, (9, 4, 5)>
10. <9, (6, 8, 1)>
11. <10, (8, 5, 0)>
12. <11, (6, 3, 4)>
13. <12, (9, 8, 0)>
14. <13, (11, 2, 14)>
15. <14, (1, 5, 13)>

There are total of [15] 3-stars in the graph.
