Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can identify each 3-star by finding nodes connected in the shape of a star with the given conditions. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all the 3-stars in the graph:
    - Start by checking all nodes that have 3 edges (degree 3) connected to them. These nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star.
    - For each such node, check if the three connected nodes form a triangle with the center node by being connected to each other. If they do, it forms a 3-star.
    
2. List the unique 3-stars:
    <1, (2, 8, 5)>
    <2, (1, 9, 4)>

3. Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars found: [2]
