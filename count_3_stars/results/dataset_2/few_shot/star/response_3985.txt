Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- For each node, we will check if there are exactly three edges connected to it, which can form a 3-star.

Here is the list of unique 3-stars <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)> found:
<3, (15, 7, 17)>
<5, (3, 9, 13)>
<9, (5, 8, 18)>
<11, (16, 10, 18)>
<12, (0, 1, 19)>
<15, (3, 1, 19)>
<16, (11, 0, 17)>
<17, (16, 3, 0)>
<18, (11, 9, 8)>
<19, (15, 0, 12)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
