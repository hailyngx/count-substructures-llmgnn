Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 15) (16, 13) (16, 4) (16, 6) (5, 17) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 12) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 4) (1, 15) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 4) (14, 15) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 18) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 14) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 10) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 10) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 12) (10, 13) (10, 7) (12, 9) (12, 19) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 18) (18, 8) (18, 0) (4, 16) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 14)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 15, 7, and 11.
   - Node 10 is connected to nodes 13, 7, and 17.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars based on the identified nodes:
   - There are 2 unique 3-stars: <1, (15, 7, 11)> and <10, (13, 7, 17)>.
