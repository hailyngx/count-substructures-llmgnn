Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<2, (1, 0, -)>
<3, (4, 0, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (9, 8, 4)>
<6, (7, 0, -)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<9, (5, 8, 1)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
