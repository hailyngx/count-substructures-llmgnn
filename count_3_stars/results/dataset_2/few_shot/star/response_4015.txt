Response:
Step 1: Identify the possible 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly three connections.
Based on the given adjacency list, we identify the following nodes with exactly three connections:  
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 6 only.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 2 only.
- Node 28: Connected to nodes 2 only.
These nodes cannot form 3-stars since they do not have a center with exactly three connections.

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars in the graph.
Based on the given edges and adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:  
- <4, (14, 13, 26)>
- <5, (8, 15, 29)>
- <1, (17, 11, 20)>
- <16, (23, 10, 24)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
Unique 3-stars found:
- <4, (14, 13, 26)>
- <5, (8, 15, 29)>
- <1, (17, 11, 20)>
- <16, (23, 10, 24)>
