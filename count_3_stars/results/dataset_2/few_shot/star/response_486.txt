Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. For each node, check if it is the center of a 3-star:
    
    - For Node 0: (0, 9, 6, 7) is a 3-star.
    - For Node 1: (1, 5, 8, 4) is a 3-star.
    - For Node 2: (2, 5, 6, 7) is a 3-star.
    - For Node 3: (3, 9, 4, 7) is a 3-star.
    - For Node 4: (4, 8, 1, 7) is a 3-star.
    - For Node 5: (5, 9, 1, 8) is a 3-star.
    - For Node 6: (6, 5, 2, 7) is a 3-star.
    - For Node 7: (7, 6, 4, 0) is a 3-star.
    - For Node 8: (8, 5, 1, 4) is a 3-star.
    - For Node 9: (9, 5, 8, 3) is a 3-star.

All the 3-stars have been found.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<<0, (9, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 8, 4)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (9, 4, 7)>, <4, (8, 1, 7)>, <5, (9, 1, 8)>, <6, (5, 2, 7)>, <7, (6, 4, 0)>, <8, (5, 1, 4)>, <9, (5, 8, 3)>>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
