Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
To find the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the adjacency list for each node and list down all the 3-stars we find:

<0, (6, 7, 3)>
<1, (9, 4, 8)>
<2, (9, 4, 5)>
<3, (5, 6, 0)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (6, 0, 1)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [9].
