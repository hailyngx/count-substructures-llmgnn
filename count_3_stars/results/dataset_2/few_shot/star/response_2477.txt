Response:
First, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 13, and 3. So, <5, (9, 13, 3)> is a 3-star.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 10, and 1. So, <11, (9, 10, 1)> is a 3-star.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 14. So, <13, (5, 9, 14)> is a 3-star.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 14, and 6. So, <12, (9, 14, 6)> is a 3-star.

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars found: [4]

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
