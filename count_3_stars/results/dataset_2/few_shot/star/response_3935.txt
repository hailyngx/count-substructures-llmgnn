Response:
First, let's find the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors, which is a requirement for them to be a center of a 3-star.

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 4 (neighbors: 6, 13, 0)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 8, 14, 1)

Next, let's check the neighbors of these nodes to see if they can form 3-stars.

For Node 4:
- Node 6: (4, 6, 13), (4, 6, 10)
- Node 13: (4, 13, 10), (4, 13, 14)
- Node 0: (4, 0, 5)

For Node 9:
- Node 8: (9, 8, 13), (9, 8, 5)
- Node 14: (9, 14, 6), (9, 14, 13)
- Node 1: (9, 1, 12), (9, 1, 7)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:
<4, (6, 13, 10)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (14, 13, 6)>, <9, (1, 7, 12)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
