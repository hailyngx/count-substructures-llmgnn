Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern in the graph based on the definition provided. Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

[9]
