Response:
Let's find 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, we identify the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes are: 11, 29, 3, 8, 2, 13, 0, 9, 6, 4, 7, 5, 7, 26.

Now, we look for each 3-star centered at these nodes:
1. Node 11: <11, (16, 2, 25)>
2. Node 29: <29, (27, 8, 25)>
3. Node 3: <3, (16, 28, 26)>
4. Node 8: <8, (29, 4, 14)>
5. Node 2: <2, (11, 24, 17)>
6. Node 13: <13, (24, 9, 7)>
7. Node 0: <0, (23, 4, 15)>
8. Node 9: <9, (13, 22, 17)>
9. Node 6: <6, (5, 21, 7)>
10. Node 4: <4, (8, 23, 0)>
11. Node 7: <7, (13, 5, 6)>
12. Node 5: <5, (4, 15, 6)>
13. Node 26: <26, (16, 3, 27)>, <26, (6, 12, 16)>


So, there are [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
