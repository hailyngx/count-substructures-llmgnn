Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

From the edges provided, we can identify that the 3-stars in this graph are:
1. <4, (7, 12, 13)>
2. <7, (4, 11, 15)>
3. <14, (7, 13, 17)>
4. <17, (13, 16, 4)>
5. <2, (18, 10, 6)>
6. <3, (11, 19, 8)>
7. <1, (5, 15, 10)>
8. <9, (18, 1, 15)>
9. <16, (12, 17, 0)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 9.]
