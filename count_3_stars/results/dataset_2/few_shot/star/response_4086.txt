Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star graph patterns in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 1, and 4: <0, (9, 1, 4)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 3: <1, (6, 7, 3)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 8: <2, (5, 6, 8)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 4: <3, (1, 7, 4)>
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 2, and 8: <5, (6, 2, 8)>
6. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 1: <6, (5, 9, 1)>
7. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 1, and 8: <7, (9, 1, 8)>
8. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 3, and 7: <8, (5, 3, 7)>
9. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 0: <9, (6, 7, 0)>

Counting these unique 3-stars gives us the answer: [9].
