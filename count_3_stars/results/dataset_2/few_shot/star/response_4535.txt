Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 0) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 3) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 10, 11, 12, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 14, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 13, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 14, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 14, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 1, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 1, 13, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 11, 14, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 11, 0, and node 3
Node 14 is connected to node 7, 6, 12, and node 3

Response:
Here is the list of unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (5, 6, 1)>
<0, (5, 13, 3)>
<1, (4, 10, 11)>
<1, (4, 12, 14)>
<5, (2, 8, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<4, (9, 13, 3)>
<7, (8, 4, 5)>
<7, (8, 6, 14)>
<6, (9, 7, 14)>
<6, (9, 2, 5)>
<10, (11, 1, 4)>
<11, (10, 1, 12)>
<13, (11, 0, 3)>
<14, (12, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
