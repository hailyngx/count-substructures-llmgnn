Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can iterate through each node as a potential center of a 3-star and check if it satisfies the definition of a 3-star. 

Here is the step-by-step process to find and count the 3-stars:

1. Identify the nodes that form a 3-star around each potential center. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves).

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars found in the graph.

Let's begin the process:

- For Node 0:
  - Node 0 is connected to: 5, 9, 4, 3, 2
  - <0, (5, 9, 4)>
  - <0, (5, 3, 2)>

- For Node 1:
  - Node 1 is connected to: 4, 6, 2
  - <1, (4, 6, 2)>

- For Node 2:
  - Node 2 is connected to: 1, 8, 0
  - <2, (1, 8, 0)>

- For Node 3:
  - Node 3 is connected to: 5, 7, 0, 6
  - <3, (5, 7, 0)>

- For Node 4:
  - Node 4 is connected to: 9, 7, 8, 0, 1
  - <4, (9, 7, 8)>

- For Node 5:
  - Node 5 is connected to: 6, 8, 0, 3, 7
  - <5, (6, 8, 3)>

- For Node 6:
  - Node 6 is connected to: 5, 1, 3
  - <6, (5, 1, 3)>

- For Node 7:
  - Node 7 is connected to: 5, 9, 4, 3
  - <7, (5, 9, 4)>

- For Node 8:
  - Node 8 is connected to: 5, 9, 4, 2
  - <8, (5, 9, 4)>

- For Node 9:
  - Node 9 is connected to: 8, 4, 7, 0
  - <9, (8, 4, 7)>

After considering all potential center nodes, we have found the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 9, 4)>, <0, (5, 3, 2)>, <1, (4, 6, 2)>, <2, (1, 8, 0)>, <3, (5, 7, 0)>, <4, (9, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 8, 3)>, <6, (5, 1, 3)>, <7, (5, 9, 4)>, <8, (5, 9, 4)>, <9, (8, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
