Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 5) (14, 10) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 2) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 14, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, 13, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 13, 12, 2, and node 10
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 12, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 13, 0, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 10, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 12, 11, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 11
Node 9 is connected to node 11, 14, 10, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 9, 14, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 14, 3, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 1
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 12, 0, 5, and node 10

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of one central node connected to three leaf nodes. Let's find all such 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (6, 13, 7)>
<3, (4, 13, 12)>
<4, (6, 12, 7)>
<11, (9, 7, 8)>
<12, (9, 7, 14)>
<14, (9, 0, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
