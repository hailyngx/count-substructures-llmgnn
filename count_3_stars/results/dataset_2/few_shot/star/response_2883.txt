Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. 

First, let's list the unique 3-stars. 

<0, (10, 3, 13)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 4, 14)>
<3, (9, 6, 10)>
<4, (9, 7, 12)>
<5, (9, 2, 14)>
<6, (3)>
<7, (4, 11, 13)>
<8, (8, 12, 1)>
<9, (5, 4, 13)>
<10, (7, 0, 3)>
<11, (5, 7, 3)>
<12, (4, 8, 14)>
<13, (9, 7, 10)>
<14, (5, 12, 2)>

Now, we need to count the total number of unique 3-stars.
