Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique structures where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (7, 1, 5)>
2. <1, (9, 3, 10)>
3. <2, (6, 9, 4)>
4. <3, (4, 1, 5)>
5. <4, (6, 13, 11)>
6. <5, (7, 3, 12)>
7. <6, (9, 2, 4)>
8. <7, (12, 0, 10)>
9. <8, (6, 9, 12)>
10. <9, (6, 8, 2)>
11. <10, (7, 1, 13)>
12. <11, (4, 13)>
13. <12, (9, 7, 3)>
14. <13, (4, 14, 2)>
15. <14, (7, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
