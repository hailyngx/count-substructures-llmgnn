Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as potential centers of the 3-stars. Based on the given adjacency list, we find the following nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 1 is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 4 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 5 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 7 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 8 is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 9 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 10 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 12 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 13 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 14 is connected to 6 nodes.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:
- For Node 0: Not a center node of a 3-star.
- For Node 1: Not a center node of a 3-star.
- For Node 4: <4, (0, 11, 14)>
- For Node 5: <5, (3, 7, 14)>
- For Node 7: <7, (5, 8, 14)>
- For Node 9: <9, (6, 11, 13)>
- For Node 10: <10, (0, 2, 14)>
- For Node 12: <12, (6, 3, 7)>
- For Node 13: Not a center node of a 3-star.
- For Node 14: Not a center node of a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is given by the total number of unique 3-stars identified, which is 6. So, the answer is [6].
