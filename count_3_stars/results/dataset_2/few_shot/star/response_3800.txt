Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the given information.

Starting with the central nodes (nodes with exactly 3 edges):
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors: 27 and 21
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors: 17 and 18
- Node 22 has 2 neighbors: 27 and 17
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 21, 20, 6, 1
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 8 and 0
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 4, 28, 24, 16
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 7, 26, 6, 24
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors: 15, 29, 22
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 4, 20, 25, 18
- Node 5 has only 1 neighbor: 19
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 7 and 1
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 14, 23, 22
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 19, 3, 29
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors: 21, 13
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 25
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: 8, 13, 25, 2
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors: 17, 20
- Node 23 has 2 neighbors: 17, 3
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: 27, 21, 19, 12
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 10, 28, 25
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors: 0, 16, 28, 13
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 16 and 28
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 14, 26, 0
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors: 7, 0, 11
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: 8, 1, 18

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars: 
<15, (27, 29, 21)>
<14, (17, 18, 22)>
<7, (21, 20, 6)>
<4, (8, 0, 16)>
<8, (4, 28, 24)>
<1, (7, 26, 6)>
<27, (15, 29, 22)>
<0, (4, 20, 25)>
<17, (14, 23, 22)>
<12, (19, 3, 29)>
<16, (4, 8, 25)>
<28, (8, 13, 25)>
<13, (10, 28, 25)>
<25, (0, 16, 28)>
