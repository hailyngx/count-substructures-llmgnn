Response:
Based on the given information, we can determine the number of 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 23, 14, and node 29
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 15, 25, 0, and node 9
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 22, 25, 4, and node 11
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 27, 8, 12, and node 24

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
- There are 4 unique 3-stars: <10, (7, 23, 14)>, <12, (15, 25, 0)>, <13, (22, 25, 4)>, <15, (27, 8, 24)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
