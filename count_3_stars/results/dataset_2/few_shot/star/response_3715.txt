Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 7, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

Counting the number of 3-stars:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 1, and 2. (<0, (9, 1, 2)>)
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 2, and 8. (<1, (3, 2, 8)>)
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and 1. (<2, (6, 9, 1)>)
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 1, and 5. (<3, (6, 1, 5)>)
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 7. (<5, (3, 4, 7)>)
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and 1. (<8, (6, 9, 1)>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
