Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. 

Based on the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 12, 14)>
<1, (3, 8, 13)>
<2, (10, 11, 9)>
<3, (1, 11, 6)>
<4, (5, 12, 14)>
<5, (8, 10, 12)>
<6, (3, 7, 14)>
<7, (6, 8, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (2, 5, 10)>
<10, (2, 11, 9)>
<11, (3, 2, 10)>
<12, (4, 5, 13)>
<13, (1, 12, 14)>
<14, (0, 6, 4)>

Since we have listed all unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
