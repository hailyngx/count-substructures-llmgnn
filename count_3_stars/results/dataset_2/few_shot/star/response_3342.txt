Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. Let's break down the process step by step:

1. Identify all nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 4 has 4, 7, 8, 10 as neighbors.
   - Node 5 has 7, 8, 0, 2, 14 as neighbors.
   - Node 7 has 4, 3, 10, 9, 5, 8 as neighbors.
   - Node 8 has 4, 7, 6, 5, 10 as neighbors.
   - Node 10 has 4, 7, 8 as neighbors.
   - Node 11 has 1, 0, 14 as neighbors.
   - Node 14 has 3, 9, 11, 5 as neighbors.

2. For each node identified in step 1, check if it forms a 3-star.
   
   For example:
   - Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, 10 as leaves.
   
   List of 3-stars found:
   - <4, (7, 8, 10)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is therefore: [1].
