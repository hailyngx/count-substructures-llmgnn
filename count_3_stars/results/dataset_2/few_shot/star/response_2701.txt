Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 13, and 5. So, <3, (0, 13, 5)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 9, and 13. So, <4, (8, 9, 13)> is a 3-star.
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 19, and 12. So, <5, (3, 19, 12)> is a 3-star.
4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 17, 10, and 11. So, <7, (17, 10, 11)> is a 3-star.
5. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 0. So, <9, (4, 8, 0)> is a 3-star.
6. Node 12 is connected to nodes 15, 5, and 9. So, <12, (15, 5, 9)> is a 3-star.
7. Node 16 is connected to nodes 15, 14, and 2. So, <16, (15, 14, 2)> is a 3-star.
8. Node 17 is connected to nodes 14, 18, and 7. So, <17, (14, 18, 7)> is a 3-star.
9. Node 18 is connected to nodes 17, 10, and 7. So, <18, (17, 10, 7)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
