Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find sets of nodes where each set contains one center node and three connected leaf nodes. Let's identify these 3-stars:

1. <0, (18, 7, 15)>
2. <1, (2, 11, 7)>
3. <2, (1, 7, 15)>
4. <3, (17, 13, 10)>
5. <4, (8, 14, 15)>
6. <5, (12)>
7. <6, (8)>
8. <7, (2, 0, 11)>
9. <8, (4, 14, 6)>
10. <9, (10, 11, 16)>
11. <10, (17, 13, 19)>
12. <11, (4, 8, 7)>
13. <12, (18, 0, 14)>
14. <13, (10, 18, 3)>
15. <14, (4, 8, 12)>
16. <15, (2, 4, 0)>
17. <16, (15, 9)>
18. <17, (10, 3)>
19. <18, (0, 12, 13)>
20. <19, (10, 15)>

Since we have found 20 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the final answer is [20].
