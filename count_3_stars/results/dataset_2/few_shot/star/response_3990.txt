Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (6, 9, 15)>
2. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (4, 5, 18)>
3. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 14, 15)>
4. Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (3, 6, 15)>
5. Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (8, 6, 17)>
6. Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (0, 7, 17)>
7. Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (5, 7, 11)>
8. Node 17 forms a 3-star: <17, (11, 12, 14)>
9. Node 18 forms a 3-star: <18, (2, 6, 7)>
10. Node 19 forms a 3-star: <19, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
