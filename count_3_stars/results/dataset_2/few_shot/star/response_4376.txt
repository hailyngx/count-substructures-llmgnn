Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These would represent the central node of a 3-star. 

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (9, 4, 1)>
<0, (9, 4, 2)>
<1, (7, 6, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<7, (6, 8, 1)>
<9, (4, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  
<0, (9, 4, 1)>
<0, (9, 4, 2)>
<1, (7, 6, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<7, (6, 8, 1)>
<9, (4, 2, 3)>
