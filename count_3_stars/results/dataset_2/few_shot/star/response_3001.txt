Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (10, 2, 14)>
<1, (4, 7, 17)>
<2, (13, 0, 7)>
<3, (19, 12, 15)>
<4, (10, 1, 17)>
<5, (18, 15, 19)>
<6, (10, 16, 12)>
<7, (16, 11, 13)>
<8, (16, 11, 17)>
<9, (16, 15, 12)>
<10, (4, 17, 0)>
<11, (7, 17, 14)>
<12, (3, 15, 9)>
<13, (7, 2, 12)>
<14, (0, 11, 17)>
<15, (19, 9, 5)>
<16, (7, 8, 6)>
<17, (1, 11, 10)>
<18, (19, 5, 0)>
<19, (3, 18, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
