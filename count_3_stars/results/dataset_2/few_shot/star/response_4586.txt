Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- Since there are 30 nodes in total, each 3-star can have the central node with 30 choices.
- The 3-star has 3 leaves connected to the central node.
- The degrees of the leaves in the 3-star are all 1 because they are only connected to the central node.
