Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 5, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 1, and node 0

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Now, looking at the adjacency lists of each node, we can identify the 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (9, 5, 7)>
<1, (9, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 0)>
<3, (1, 7, 5)>
<4, (6, 9, 1)>
<5, (3, 0, 7)>
<6, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (6, 1, 3)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
