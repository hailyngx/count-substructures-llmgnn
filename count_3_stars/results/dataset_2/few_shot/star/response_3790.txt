Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

First, let's analyze the nodes that have 3 connections (degree 3). These nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars:
- Nodes 10, 1, 16, and 17 have degree 3.

Now, let's check the neighbors of these nodes to see if they form 3-stars:
1. For Node 10:
    - Neighbors: 11, 15, 3, 7, 16
    - 3-Stars: <10, (11, 15, 16)>, <10, (3, 7, 16)>

2. For Node 1:
    - Neighbors: 17, 2, 13, 4
    - 3-Stars: <1, (17, 13, 4)>

3. For Node 16:
    - Neighbors: 10, 15, 12, 4
    - 3-Stars: <16, (10, 15, 12)>

4. For Node 17:
    - Neighbors: 1, 13, 9, 19, 7
    - 3-Stars: <17, (1, 13, 19)>, <17, (13, 9, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are: <10, (11, 15, 16)>, <10, (3, 7, 16)>, <1, (17, 13, 4)>, <16, (10, 15, 12)>, <17, (1, 13, 19)>.
