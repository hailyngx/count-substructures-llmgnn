Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 11) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 12) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 0) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 12) (2, 11) (2, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 1, 11, and node 12
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 11, 14, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 11, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 10, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 10, 11, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 13, 0, 3, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 14, 10, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 10, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 0, 12, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 7, 13, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 1, 14, 0, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 13, 3, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 12, and node 10
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 1, 6, and node 11

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three edges. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars, and the nodes they are connected to will form the leaves.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 9, 12)>
<1, (8, 11, 14)>
<3, (5, 6, 12)>
<4, (10, 11, 6)>
<5, (9, 13, 0)>
<6, (4, 14, 10)>
<7, (9, 10, 8)>
<8, (7, 0, 12)>
<10, (4, 7, 13)>
<11, (4, 1, 14)>
<12, (8, 13, 3)>
<13, (5, 12, 10)>
<14, (5, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
