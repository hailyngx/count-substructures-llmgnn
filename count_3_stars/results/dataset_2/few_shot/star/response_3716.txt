Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can potentially form a 3-star. These are the nodes with exactly three neighbors. Looking at the adjacency list, we find the following nodes with exactly three neighbors: 2, 7, 13.

Next, we will find the 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- For Node 2, the possible 3-stars are <2, (7, 12, 14)>, <2, (11, 12, 14)>, and <2, (11, 13, 14)>.
- For Node 7, we can form <7, (0, 10, 2)>.
- For Node 13, the only 3-star is <13, (6, 2, x)>, where node x is not specified in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4. So, the answer is [4].
