Response:
We can find the 3-stars by identifying nodes that are connected via edges and then checking if there are two more nodes connected to them forming a 3-star pattern. Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

Node 0:
- (0, 5, 4, 3) forms a 3-star <0, (5, 4, 3)>
- (0, 5, 4, 1) forms a 3-star <0, (5, 4, 1)>
- (0, 4, 3, 1) forms a 3-star <0, (4, 3, 1)>

Node 1:
- (1, 4, 8, 0) forms a 3-star <1, (4, 8, 0)>
- (1, 4, 0, 2) forms a 3-star <1, (4, 0, 2)>
- (1, 8, 2, 7) forms a 3-star <1, (8, 2, 7)>

Node 2:
- (2, 7, 1, 3) forms a 3-star <2, (7, 1, 3)>

Node 3:
- (3, 7, 2, 8) forms a 3-star <3, (7, 2, 8)>
- (3, 0, 2, 1) does not form a 3-star
- (3, 8, 7, 0) does not form a 3-star

Node 4:
- (4, 9, 7, 6) forms a 3-star <4, (9, 7, 6)>

Node 5:
- (5, 9, 8, 0) forms a 3-star <5, (9, 8, 0)>

Node 6:
- (6, 4, 8) does not form a 3-star

Node 7:
- (7, 9, 4, 3) forms a 3-star <7, (9, 4, 3)>
- (7, 3, 8, 2) forms a 3-star <7, (3, 8, 2)>

Node 8:
- (8, 5, 4, 7) forms a 3-star <8, (5, 4, 7)>
- (8, 6, 4, 7) does not form a 3-star

Node 9:
- (9, 5, 8, 4) forms a 3-star <9, (5, 8, 4)>

Therefore, the 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (5, 4, 3)>, <0, (5, 4, 1)>, <0, (4, 3, 1)>, <1, (4, 8, 0)>, <1, (4, 0, 2)>, <1, (8, 2, 7)>, <2, (7, 1, 3)>, <3, (7, 2, 8)>, <4, (9, 7, 6)>, <5, (9, 8, 0)>, <7, (9, 4, 3)>, <7, (3, 8, 2)>, <8, (5, 4, 7)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)>.

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [14]
