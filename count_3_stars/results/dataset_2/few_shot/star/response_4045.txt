Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Look at each node in the graph:
- Node 0 is not connected as a 3-star.
- Node 1 is part of a 3-star: <1, (13, 12, 8)>
- Node 2 is not connected as a 3-star.
- Node 3 is not connected as a 3-star.
- Node 4 is part of two 3-stars: <4, (7, 9, 0)> and <4, (11, 13, 14)>
- Node 5 is part of two 3-stars: <5, (7, 3, 14)> and <5, (12, 14, 10)>
- Node 6 is not connected as a 3-star.
- Node 7 is part of two 3-stars: <7, (4, 0, 6)> and <7, (10, 14, 5)>
- Node 8 is not connected as a 3-star.
- Node 9 is not connected as a 3-star.
- Node 10 is not connected as a 3-star.
- Node 11 is part of two 3-stars: <11, (4, 13, 14)> and <11, (9, 12, 4)>
- Node 12 is part of a 3-star: <12, (1, 11, 5)>
- Node 13 is part of a 3-star: <13, (1, 11, 14)>
- Node 14 is not connected as a 3-star.

2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
- <1, (13, 12, 8)>
- <4, (7, 9, 0)>
- <4, (11, 13, 14)>
- <5, (7, 3, 14)>
- <5, (12, 14, 10)>
- <7, (4, 0, 6)>
- <7, (10, 14, 5)>
- <11, (4, 13, 14)>
- <11, (9, 12, 4)>
- <12, (1, 11, 5)>
- <13, (1, 11, 14)>

[The total number of 3-stars is 10].
