Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 9, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (7, 1, 2)>
2. <1, (3, 6, 9)>
3. <2, (3, 1, 0)>
4. <3, (7, 1, 9)>
5. <4, (7, 5, 0)>
6. <5, (4, 3, 6)>
7. <6, (7, 1, 8)>
8. <7, (4, 0, 3)>
9. <8, (3, 0, 6)>
10. <9, (7, 1, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [10].
