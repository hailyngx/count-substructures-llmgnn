Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 8) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 11) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 10, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 11, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 13, 0, 10, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 12, 6, 10, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 12, 1, 6, 10, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 11, 10, and node 3
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 12, 13, 1, and node 14
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 13, 11, and node 8
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 12, and node 11
Node 14 is connected to node 4, and node 11

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (13, 10, 14)>
2. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (7, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
