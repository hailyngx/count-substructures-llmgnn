Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1)

Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and treat that node as the center of a possible 3-star. Then, we can check if the neighbors of the center node are connected to each other, forming the edges of the star. 

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors (4, 8, 3, 2) which is more than 3, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors (5, 4, 8, 6, 2) which is more than 3, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
3. Node 2 has 3 neighbors (9, 0, 1), forming a 3-star with center 2. <2, (9, 0, 1)>
4. Node 3 has 5 neighbors (5, 9, 4, 6, 0) which is more than 3, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors (7, 0, 1, 3) which is more than 3, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
6. Node 5 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 7), forming a 3-star with center 5. <5, (1, 3, 7)>
7. Node 6 has 4 neighbors (7, 8, 1, 3) which is more than 3, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
8. Node 7 has 4 neighbors (5, 9, 4, 6) which is more than 3, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
9. Node 8 has 4 neighbors (9, 0, 6, 1) which is more than 3, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
10. Node 9 has 4 neighbors (8, 2, 3, 7) which is more than 3, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Therefore, there are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <2, (9, 0, 1)> and <5, (1, 3, 7)>.

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
