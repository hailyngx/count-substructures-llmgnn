Response:
The task is to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves).

Let's first identify all 3-stars in the graph by checking each node as the potential central node:

For each node, we will find all unique 3-stars it belongs to. Let's list them:

<2, (29, 13, 15)>
<2, (29, 22, 13)>
<2, (29, 3, 13)>
<29, (27, 1, 2)>
<29, (27, 2, 12)>
<29, (27, 2, 15)>
<7, (21, 15, 10)>
<7, (21, 15, 9)>
<7, (21, 15, 17)>
<21, (28, 9, 7)>
<21, (28, 9, 4)>
<21, (28, 9, 25)>
<10, (7, 15, 9)>
<11, (17, 1, 15)>
<6, (9, 25, 12)>
<6, (9, 25, 28)>
<6, (9, 25, 7)>
<9, (28, 25, 6)>
<9, (28, 25, 14)>
<9, (28, 25, 7)>
<5, (0, 22, 2)>
<0, (14, 18, 8)>
<0, (14, 18, 17)>
<0, (14, 18, 8)>
<0, (14, 18, 17)>
<0, (14, 18, 17)>
<0, (14, 18, 17)>
<0, (14, 23, 5)>
<0, (5, 22, 2)>
<4, (13, 3, 2)>
<4, (13, 21, 12)>
<4, (13, 21, 12)>
<12, (29, 6, 9)>
<12, (29, 6, 4)>
<12, (29, 6, 24)>
<22, (5, 2, 29)>
<15, (17, 1, 11)>
<15, (17, 1, 27)>
<15, (17, 1, 11)>
<15, (17, 1, 27)>
<15, (17, 1, 27)>
<15, (17, 1, 11)>
<15, (17, 1, 27)>
<15, (17, 1, 11)>
<15, (17, 1, 27)>
<15, (17, 1, 27)>

After listing all unique 3-stars, we count the total number of them. The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [41].
