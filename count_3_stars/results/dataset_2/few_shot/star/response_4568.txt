Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars we find: 
<1, (2, 4, 10)>
<12, (0, 8, 15)>
<13, (11, 14, 16)>
<14, (2, 18, 10)>
<16, (13, 18, 19)>
<17, (10, 11, 18)>
<18, (16, 14, 17)>

There are a total of [7] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
