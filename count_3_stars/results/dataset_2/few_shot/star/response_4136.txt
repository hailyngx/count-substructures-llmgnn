Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 13) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 6) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 12) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 14) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 10, 11, and node 14
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 11, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 11, 6, and node 12
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 13, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 13, 14, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 10, and node 12
Node 8 is connected to node 13
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 7, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 0, and node 7
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 10, 0, 13, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 13, 14, 7, and node 2
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 11, 8, 12, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 6, 0, 12, and node 4

Response:
Finding 3-star graphs involves identifying nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (5, 10, 14)>  
2. <1, (6, 11, 3)>  
3. <2, (9, 11, 6)>  
4. <4, (14, 6, 9)>  
5. <5, (9, 7, 13)>  
6. <6, (13, 14, 2)>  
7. <9, (5, 4, 7)>  
8. <10, (7, 0, 11)>  
9. <11, (1, 10, 13)>  
10. <12, (9, 13, 14)>  
11. <13, (5, 11, 8)>  
12. <14, (6, 0, 12)>
  
Since each 3-star is uniquely connected within the graph, there are in total [12] 3-stars.
