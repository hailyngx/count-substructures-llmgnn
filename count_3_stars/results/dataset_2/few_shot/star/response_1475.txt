Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars based on the given information:

- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 15 as leaves: <11, (5, 6, 15)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 18, 13, and 14 as leaves: <4, (18, 13, 14)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 9, and 14 as leaves: <8, (2, 9, 14)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 19, 5, and 14 as leaves: <13, (19, 5, 14)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 2, and 6 as leaves: <0, (7, 2, 6)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 2, and 19 as leaves: <15, (17, 2, 19)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 12, and 5 as leaves: <10, (7, 12, 5)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 15, and 14 as leaves: <19, (13, 15, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
