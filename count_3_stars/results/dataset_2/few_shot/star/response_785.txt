Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which forms a 3-star pattern with that node at the center.

Given the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (8, 10, 14)>
2. Node 1: <1, (13, 7, 12)>
3. Node 2: <2, (6, 0, 1)>
4. Node 3: <3, (10, 0, 12)>
5. Node 4: <4, (5, 10, 14)>
6. Node 5: <5, (6, 12, 4)>
7. Node 6: <6, (5, 10, 11)>
8. Node 7: <7, (9, 11, 12)>
9. Node 8: <8, (9, 13, 14)>
10. Node 9: <9, (8, 11, 7)>
11. Node 10: <10, (11, 0, 3)>
12. Node 11: <11, (9, 10, 7)>
13. Node 12: <12, (5, 9, 7)>
14. Node 13: <13, (8, 1)>
15. Node 14: <14, (8, 10, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
