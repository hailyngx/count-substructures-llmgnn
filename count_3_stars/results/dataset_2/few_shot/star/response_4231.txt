Response:
We can count the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 10 is connected to 15 and 14. (Node 10 is not part of any 3-star as it doesn't have exactly three neighbors).

2. Identify 3-stars:
   - For each node with exactly three neighbors, consider it as the central node and list its neighbors. Check if the neighbors are connected to each other (forming a 3-star). 
   
   - The possible 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
   
   <0, (9, 1, 17)>
   <0, (9, 5, 18)>
   <0, (9, 18, 17)>
   <0, (1, 17, 18)>
