Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 10) (1, 14) (1, 18) (3, 19) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 18) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 15) (12, 13) (12, 14) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 15) (7, 11) (7, 17) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 7) (17, 18) (4, 14) (4, 6) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 14) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 0) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 18) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 2) (18, 1) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 0) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14)

Node 18 is connected to node 1, 13, 10, 17, and node 0
Node 19 is connected to node 3, 13, and node 14

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (0, 10, 15)>
<1, (14, 18, 2)>
<10, (5, 11, 6)>
<11, (10, 7, 15)>
<13, (8, 12, 2)>
<14, (1, 12, 4)>
<16, (8, 17, 15)>
<17, (5, 8, 7)>
<18, (1, 13, 0)>
<19, (3, 13, 14)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [9].
