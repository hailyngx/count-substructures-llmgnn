Response:
The center node for each 3-star can be found from the node with degree 3 in the adjacency list. Let's first identify the center nodes:

- Center nodes: 24, 11, 16, 11, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Now, let's find the leaves for each center node:

- Center node 24: No possible 3-star
- Center node 11: (11, 6, 5), (11, 6, 27)
- Center node 16: (16, 9, 5)
- Center node 5: (5, 3, 6)
- Center node 6: (6, 11, 27)
- Center node 7: (7, 0, 25)
- Center node 8: (8, 4, 27)
- Center node 9: (9, 1, 16), (9, 10, 16)
- Center node 12: (12, 3, 17), (12, 3, 26)
- Center node 13: (13, 27, 3)
- Center node 14: (14, 18, 1), (14, 3, 18)
- Center node 15: (15, 19, 29)
- Center node 17: (17, 12, 18), (17, 19, 29)
- Center node 18: (18, 2, 17), (18, 14, 17)
- Center node 20: No possible 3-star
- Center node 21: (21, 20, 22)
- Center node 23: No possible 3-star
- Center node 25: (25, 2, 22), (25, 7, 22)
- Center node 26: (26, 12, 2), (26, 10, 2)
- Center node 27: (27, 0, 6), (27, 8, 6)
- Center node 28: No possible 3-star
- Center node 29: (29, 0, 2), (29, 15, 19)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [19]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<11, (6, 5, 27)>, <16, (9, 5, )}, <5, (3, 6, 11)>, <7, (0, 25, 7)>, <8, (4, 27, 8)>, <9, (1, 16, 9)>, <9, (10, 16, 9)>, <12, (3, 17, 12)>, <12, (3, 26, 12)>, <13, (27, 3, 13)>, <14, (18, 1, 14)>, <14, (3, 18, 14)>, <15, (19, 29, 15)>, <17, (12, 18, 17)>, <17, (19, 29, 17)>, <18, (2, 17, 18)>, <18, (14, 17, 18)>, <21, (20, 22, 21)>, <25, (2, 22, 25)>, <25, (7, 22, 25)>, <26, (12, 2, 26)>, <26, (10, 2, 26)>, <27, (0, 6, 27)>, <27, (8, 6, 27)>, <29, (0, 2, 29)>, <29, (15, 19, 29)>.
