Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration.

Let's start by looking at each node and their neighbors to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (9, 7, 8)>
   - <0, (7, 1, 3)>
   [Total: 2]

2. Node 1:
   - <1, (5, 7, 6)>
   - <1, (7, 0, 2)>
   [Total: 2]

3. Node 2:
   - <2, (9, 1, 3)>
   [Total: 1]

4. Node 3:
   - <3, (5, 4, 0)>
   - <3, (4, 7, 0)>
   [Total: 2]

5. Node 4:
   - <4, (9, 7, 8)>
   [Total: 1]

6. Node 5:
   - <5, (6, 1, 7)>
   [Total: 1]

7. Node 6:
   - <6, (5, 9, 1)>
   [Total: 1]

8. Node 7:
   - <7, (5, 4, 0)>
   - <7, (4, 8, 0)>
   [Total: 2]

9. Node 8:
   - <8, (4, 7, 0)>
   [Total: 1]

10. Node 9:
   - <9, (6, 4, 2)>
   [Total: 1]

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [13]
