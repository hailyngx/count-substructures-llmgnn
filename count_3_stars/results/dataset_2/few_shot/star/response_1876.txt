Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify each possible 3-star in the graph. A 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three leaf nodes. 

By analyzing the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-stars in the given graph. Let's list them:

<0, (5, 14, 10)>
<1, (7, 11, 12)>
<2, (4, 10, 13)>
<3, (9, 7, 11)>
<4, (0, 6, 2)>
<5, (8, 0, 7)>
<6, (4, 11, 14)>
<7, (5, 9, 13)>
<8, (5, 0, 6)>
<9, (11, 3, 7)>
<10, (11, 0, 2)>
<11, (9, 3, 1)>
<12, (10, 3, 1)>
<13, (7, 14, 2)>
<14, (0, 6, 13)>

These are all the unique 3-stars in the graph. Now, to find the total number of 3-stars, we count the number of unique 3-stars. 

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
