Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 14) (8, 19) (8, 16) (13, 12) (13, 19) (13, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 3) (2, 18) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 19) (11, 12) (11, 15) (1, 4) (1, 18) (1, 0) (17, 5) (17, 15) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 11) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 14) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 10) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 12) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 0) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 14) (10, 16) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 15, and node 12
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 18, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 18, and node 16
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 19, 11, and node 17
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 19, and node 16
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 15, and node 14
Node 10 is connected to node 16

Node 18 is connected to node 2, and node 1
Node 19 is connected to node 8, 13, 5, and node 11

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 5, and 1
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 19
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 19, and 12
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 3, and 11
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 13, and 9
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 17, and 9
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 2, and 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (7, 5, 1)>
<5, (4, 6, 19)>
<11, (5, 19, 12)>
<12, (13, 3, 11)>
<14, (7, 13, 9)>
<15, (11, 17, 9)>
<16, (8, 2, 10)>
