Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8)

Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Given the information about the graph, we can determine the number of 3-stars by examining each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. A 3-star centered at node X consists of node X and the three nodes connected to node X. We will count all unique 3-stars in the graph.

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: <0, (5, 9, 7)> and <0, (5, 2, 8)> and <0, (9, 7, 8)>
2. Node 1: No 3-stars centered at node 1.
3. Node 2: <2, (9, 4, 7)> and <2, (9, 7, 8)> and <2, (4, 7, 8)>
4. Node 3: <3, (9, 4, 7)> and <3, (4, 7, 8)> and <3, (9, 4, 1)> and <3, (4, 1, 7)>
5. Node 4: <4, (7, 1, 3)> and <4, (7, 1, 8)>
6. Node 5: No 3-stars centered at node 5.
7. Node 6: No 3-stars centered at node 6.
8. Node 7: <7, (4, 0, 3)> and <7, (0, 3, 8)>
9. Node 8: <8, (9, 2, 7)> and <8, (9, 6, 7)> and <8, (9, 2, 0)> and <8, (6, 2, 7)>
10. Node 9: <9, (2, 3, 4)> and <9, (2, 3, 8)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars found above, we get a total of [15] 3-stars in the graph.
