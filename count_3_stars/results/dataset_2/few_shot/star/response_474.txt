Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the number of instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (9, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (5, 9, 0)>
<3, (5, 8, 2)>
<4, (7, 1, 6)>
<5, (6, 2, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 4)>
<7, (5, 4, 6)>
<8, (6, 0, 3)>
<9, (6, 2, 1)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are 9 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
