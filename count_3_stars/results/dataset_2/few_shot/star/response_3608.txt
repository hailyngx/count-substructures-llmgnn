Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by looking at each node that has exactly three neighbors. Let's identify these nodes first:

- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 10 has 1 neighbor
- Node 19 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors

Nodes 8, 10, 19, and 5 do not create any 3-stars in this graph. However, node 26 can potentially be part of a 3-star if it is connected to two nodes that share a common neighbor.

Let's look at node 26's neighbors: nodes 6 and 18. Both nodes 6 and 18 are connected to node 24 and node 28. Therefore, node 26, node 6, and node 18 form a 3-star: <26, (6, 18, 24)>. 

Finally, output the final answer inside brackets []:
