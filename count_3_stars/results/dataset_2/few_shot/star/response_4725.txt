Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 13, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 14, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 10, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, 14, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, 10, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 0, 14, 12, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 11
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 3, 11, and node 12
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 10, 14, 13, and node 8
Node 12 is connected to node 1, 10, and node 6
Node 13 is connected to node 11, 0, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 11, and node 6

Response:
There are [(60/2) = 30] edges in the graph since each edge is counted twice in the given list. 

To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify the central nodes and their respective leaves. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

After carefully examining the adjacency list for each node, the 3-stars in this graph are: 
<0, (5, 4, 6)>
<1, (9, 7, 14)>
<2, (9, 3, NA)>
<3, (5, 1, 10)>
<4, (5, 7, 14)>
<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<6, (7, 0, 14)>
<7, (4, 6, 1)>
<8, (9, 11, NA)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<10, (5, 3, 11)>
<11, (4, 10, 14)>
<12, (1, 10, 6)>
<13, (11, 0, 6)>
<14, (5, 4, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
