Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 0, and 9: <5, (1, 0, 9)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 3, and 0: <9, (6, 3, 0)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 2: <4, (1, 6, 2)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 2: <6, (4, 7, 2)>
5. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 1, and 8: <3, (7, 1, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
