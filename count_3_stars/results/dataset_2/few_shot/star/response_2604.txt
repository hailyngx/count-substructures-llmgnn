Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 0) (1, 8) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, 3, 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 2, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-star graph patterns in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-star patterns:

<Node 6, (9, 7, 2)>
<Node 6, (9, 8, 4)>
<Node 6, (7, 9, 4)>
<Node 6, (2, 8, 4)>

Therefore, we have found 4 unique 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

The final answer is [4].
