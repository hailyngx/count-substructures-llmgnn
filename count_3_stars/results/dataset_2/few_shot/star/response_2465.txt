Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

- From Node 0: <0, (6, 9, 10)>
- From Node 1: <1, (8, 12, 2)>
- From Node 2: <2, (11, 8, 5)>
- From Node 3: No 3-star as it has less than 3 connected nodes.
- From Node 4: <4, (6, 9, 10)>
- From Node 5: <5, (11, 7, 2)>
- From Node 6: <6, (7, 3, 4)>
- From Node 7: <7, (6, 11, 12)>
- From Node 8: <8, (4, 2, 0)>
- From Node 9: No 3-star as it has less than 3 connected nodes.
- From Node 10: <10, (11, 0, 4)>
- From Node 11: <11, (10, 7, 13)>
- From Node 12: <12, (11, 7, 13)>
- From Node 13: <13, (11, 4, 12)>
- From Node 14: No 3-star as it has less than 3 connected nodes.

Count of 3-stars: [11]
