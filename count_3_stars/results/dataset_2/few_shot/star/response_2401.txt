Response:
Let's analyze the graph to identify the 3-stars:

Starting from each node, we look for the 3-star configurations. In a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

For example, starting from node 0: (0, 5, 6) forms a 3-star. Similarly, there are other 3-star configurations in the graph.

From the given edges and adjacency list, we can find the following 3-stars: 
<0, (5, 6)>
<1, (3, 8, 15)>
<2, (11, 18, 19)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (11, 12, 13)>
<5, (0, 9, 18)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (12, 15, 16)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 9)>
<10, (2, 10, 18)>
<11, (2, 4, 11)>
<12, (4, 7, 12)>
<13, (4, 13, 14)>
<14, (13, 14, 17)>
<15, (1, 7, 12)>
<16, (7, 12, 15)>
<17, (14, 15, 17)>
<18, (2, 5, 18)>
<19, (2, 18, 19)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found gives us a total of [19] 3-stars.
