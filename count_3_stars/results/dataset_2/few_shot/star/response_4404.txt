Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each occurrence where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's go step by step.

The 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (7, 3, 6)>
<2, (5, 7, 3)>
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<5, (9, 2, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
