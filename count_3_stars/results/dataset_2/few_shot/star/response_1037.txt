Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 7) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 12, and node 13
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 10, 6, 2, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 10, 0, 9, 14, 5, and node 13
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 10, 7, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 11, 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 5, 13, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 11, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 0, 8, and node 4
Node 10 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 14, 13, 6, and node 8
Node 12 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 11, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 14 is connected to node 11, 12, and node 4

Response:
We can start by identifying the unique 3-star configurations in the given graph. 

Let's list them: 
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 12, 13)>
<3, (1, 10, 6)>
<4, (10, 5, 13)>
<5, (1, 10, 7)>
<6, (3, 11, 0)>
<7, (0, 5, 13)>
<8, (11, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 0, 8)>
<10, (3, 4, 5)>
<11, (14, 6, 8)>
<12, (3, 2, 14)>
<13, (11, 7, 4)>
<14, (12, 11, 4)>

Now, we need to count how many 3-star configurations there are in total.
