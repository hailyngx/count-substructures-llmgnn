Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We can identify these 3-star structures by looking at the adjacency list for each node.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (15, 16, 1)>
<1, (18, 20, 14)>
<2, (12, 27, -)>
<3, (7, 19, -)>
<4, (18, 5, -)>
<5, (21, 10, 1)>
<6, (26, 16, 23)>
<7, (3, 19, 27)>
<8, (10, 15, 9)>
<9, (29, 8, -)>
<10, (21, 15, 8)>
<11, (17, 20, -)>
<12, (2, 13, 14)>
<13, (0, 12, 25)>
<14, (12, 1, -)>
<15, (10, 0, 8)>
<16, (0, 25, 6)>
<17, (26, 28, 11)>
<18, (4, 26, 25)>
<19, (7, 0, 3)>
<20, (10, 8, 11)>
<21, (10, 5, -)>
<23, (25, 6, -)>
<24, (29, 25, 27)>
<25, (18, 16, 23)>
<26, (18, 6, 17)>
<27, (2, 7, 28)>
<28, (17, 27, -)>
<29, (9, 24, -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get 29 in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [29].
