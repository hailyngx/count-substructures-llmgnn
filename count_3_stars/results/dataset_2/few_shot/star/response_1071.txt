Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars by looking at each node and its connections. 

Starting with Node 0:
- 3-star: <0, (4, 7, 6)>
- 3-star: <0, (4, 2, 7)>

Moving to Node 1:
- 3-star: <1, (6, 3, 5)>
- 3-star: <1, (3, 8, 5)>

Next, Node 2:
- No 3-star since it only has two connections.

Node 3:
- 3-star: <3, (9, 5, 1)>
- 3-star: <3, (9, 2, 1)>

Node 4:
- 3-star: <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- 3-star: <4, (7, 5, 8)>

Node 5:
- 3-star: <5, (6, 1, 3)>
- 3-star: <5, (6, 3, 8)>
- 3-star: <5, (6, 8, 1)>
- 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 8)>

Node 6:
- 3-star: <6, (9, 5, 1)>
- 3-star: <6, (9, 0, 5)>

Node 7:
- 3-star: <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- 3-star: <7, (0, 8, 4)>

Node 8:
- 3-star: <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- 3-star: <8, (4, 5, 7)>

Node 9:
- 3-star: <9, (6, 5, 1)>
- 3-star: <9, (6, 1, 3)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
