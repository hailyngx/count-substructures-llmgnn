Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 5, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the adjacency list for each node:

- Node 0 is connected to node 3, 1, 9: <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6: <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 8: <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 8: <3, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, 9: <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, 8: <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 9: <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 6: <7, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 8 is connected to node 3, 2, 5: <8, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4: <9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
