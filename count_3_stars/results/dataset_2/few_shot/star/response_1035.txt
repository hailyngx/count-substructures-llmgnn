Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify them first.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 19, and ? (Only 2 connections, not a 3-star)
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 17, 15, and 6 (3-star)
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 19, and ? (Only 2 connections, not a 3-star)
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 12, 14, and 13 (3-star)
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 13, 10, and 17 (3-star)
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 11, 15, and 18 (3-star)
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 12, 1, and 14 (3-star)
- Node 7 is connected to node 0 (Not a center of a 3-star)
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 16, 17, and 18 (3-star)
- Node 9 is connected to node 18, 2, and 14 (3-star)
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 4, 18, and 19 (3-star)
- Node 11 is connected to node 16 and 5 (Not a center of a 3-star)
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, and 3 (Not a center of a 3-star)
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 16, 4, and 3 (3-star)
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 13 (3-star)
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 1, and 5 (Not a center of a 3-star)
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 13 and 8 (3-star)
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 1 (3-star)
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 8, 9, and 5 (3-star)
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 10 (3-star)

So, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (17, 15, 6)>
<3, (12, 14, 13)>
<4, (13, 10, 17)>
<5, (11, 15, 18)>
<6, (12, 1, 14)>
<8, (16, 17, 18)>
<9, (18, 2, 14)>
<10, (4, 18, 19)>
<16, (11, 13, 8)>
<17, (4, 8, 1)>
<18, (8, 9, 5)>
<19, (0, 6, 10)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
