Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is at the center of a 3-star and count the number of leaves connected to it.

Considering the information provided, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 7, and 12: <6, (1, 7, 12)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 7, 13, and 10: <4, (7, 13, 10)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 11, and 12: <10, (4, 11, 12)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 4, and 0: <7, (6, 4, 0)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 3, and 0: <13, (4, 3, 0)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 10, and 5: <12, (6, 10, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
