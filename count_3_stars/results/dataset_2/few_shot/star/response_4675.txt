Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

We can see that a 3-star is formed by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Using the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph.

The 3-stars in this graph are:
- <0, (9, 4, 8)>
- <1, (5, 4, 7)>
- <2, (5, 9, 7)>
- <4, (9, 7, 0)>
- <5, (9, 6, 2)>
- <6, (5, 9, 1)>
- <7, (4, 2, 8)>
- <8, (7, 6, 0)>
- <9, (5, 6, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
