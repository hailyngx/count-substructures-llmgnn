Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star patterns in the graph:

From the adjacency list, the 3-star patterns are as follows:
<0, (8, 14, 10)>
<1, (3, 14, -)>
<2, (13, 0, -)>
<3, (4, 1, 9)>
<4, (7, 13, 11)>
<5, (7, 0, 10)>
<6, (9, 11, -)>
<7, (4, 10, 8)>
<8, (7, 9, 10)>
<9, (3, 8, 6)>
<10, (7, 8, 13)>
<11, (4, 6, 9)>
<12, (3, 8, 6)>
<13, (4, 2, -)>
<14, (1, 9, 0)>

Count of 3-star patterns in the graph: [14]
