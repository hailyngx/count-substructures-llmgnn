Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we should look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, which forms a 3-star. Based on the adjacency list provided, the 3-stars in the graph can be identified as follows:

<0, (5, 9, 6)>
<1, (7, 3, 2)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 1, 2)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<5, (8, 0, -)>
<6, (9, 4, 2)>
<7, (9, 4, 2)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
