Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<0, (4, 2, 9)>
<1, (17, 16, 9)>
<2, (0, 12, 9)>
<3, (11, 18, 13)>
<4, (8, 0, 15)>
<5, (19, 15, 7)>
<6, (17, 18, 6)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 14, 16)>
<9, (0, 2, 1)>
<10, (15, 18, 13)>
<11, (8, 3, 13)>
<12, (2, 14, 13)>
<13, (14, 11, 19)>
<14, (8, 12, 16)>
<15, (4, 5, 10)>
<16, (8, 14, 1)>
<17, (1, 6, 9)>
<18, (3, 10, 6)>
