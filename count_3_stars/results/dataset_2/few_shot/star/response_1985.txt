Response:
First, we can identify all the 3-stars in the graph based on the adjacency list. Here are the 3-stars:

<2, (20, 14, 4)>
<4, (23, 19, 28)>
<5, (8, 10, 16)>
<7, (11, 0, 6)>
<9, (11, 19, 13)>
<10, (15, 5, 16)>
<12, (22, 21, 16)>
<14, (21, 16, 2)>
<15, (22, 25, 10)>
<16, (10, 12, 14)>
<19, (29, 4, 13)>
<20, (29, 26, 2)>
<21, (25, 3, 12)>
<22, (18, 27, 15)>
<24, (22, 11, 4)>
<25, (18, 15, 21)>
<26, (20, 29, 2)>
<27, (22, 17, 1)>
<28, (15, 4)>
<29, (20, 0, 19)>

Since there are 21 unique 3-stars listed above, the final answer is [21].
