Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars where one node is the center and the other three nodes are connected to that center node. Let's go step-by-step to find the 3-stars in the graph:

Observations:
1. The graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges.
2. 3-stars can be formed by considering a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Identifying 3-stars:
1. From the adjacency list and edge information, we can identify the potential 3-stars:
    - Node 3: (3, 15, 17, 6), (3, 15, 17, 12)
    - Node 5: (5, 9, 13, 18)
    - Node 9: (9, 5, 17, 10), (9, 5, 17, 19)
    - Node 17: (17, 3, 9, 1), (17, 3, 9, 6), (17, 3, 19, 9)

Counting the 3-stars:
1. <3, (15, 17, 6)>
2. <3, (15, 17, 12)>
3. <5, (9, 13, 18)>
4. <9, (5, 17, 10)>
5. <9, (5, 17, 19)>
6. <17, (3, 9, 1)>
7. <17, (3, 9, 6)>
8. <17, (3, 19, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
