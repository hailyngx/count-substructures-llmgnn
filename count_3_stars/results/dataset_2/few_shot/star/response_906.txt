Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 0, and 18. Based on this information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
    - <1, (4, 7, 0)>
    - <1, (4, 7, 18)>
    - <1, (0, 7, 18)>

2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 28, 26, 19, and 20. Based on this information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
    - <2, (28, 26, 19)>
    - <2, (28, 26, 20)>
    - <2, (28, 19, 20)>

3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 25, 26, and 22. Based on this information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
    - <3, (25, 26, 22)>

4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 19, 1, and 17. Based on this information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
    - <4, (7, 19, 1)>
    - <4, (7, 19, 17)>
    - <4, (1, 19, 17)>

5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 15, 24, 12, and 20. Based on this information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
    - <5, (15, 24, 12)>
    - <5, (15, 24, 20)>
    - <5, (15, 12, 20)>

6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 24, and 12. Based on this information, we can identify the following 3-star:
    - <8, (13, 24, 12)>

7. Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 17, 15, and 9. Based on this information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
    - <10, (11, 17, 15)>
    - <10, (11, 17, 9)>
    - <10, (11, 15, 9)>

8. Node 12 is connected to nodes 8, 28, 20, 5, and 14. Based on this information, we can identify the following 3-star:
    - <12, (8, 28, 20)>

9. Node 14 is connected to nodes 7, 18, and 12. Based on this information, we can identify the following 3-star:
    - <14, (7, 18, 12)>

10. Node 15 is connected to nodes 10, 17, and 5. Based on this information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
    - <15, (10, 17, 5)>

11. Node 20 is connected to nodes 21, 2, 12, and 5. Based on this information, we can identify the following 3-star:
    - <20, (21, 2, 12)>

12. Node 23 is connected to nodes 0, 16, 28, and 19. Based on this information, we can identify the following 3-star:
    - <23, (0, 28, 19)>

13. Node 24 is connected to nodes 8, 5, and 29. Based on this information, we can identify the following 3-star:
    - <24, (8, 5, 29)>

14. Node 26 is connected to nodes 3, 25, and 2. Based on this information, we can identify the following 3-star:
    - <26, (3, 25, 2)>

Since we have listed all the unique 3-stars, we can count them and provide the final answer:
