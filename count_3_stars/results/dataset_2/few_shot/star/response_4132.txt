Response:
First, let's analyze the graph to find all the 3-star structures. 

Upon examining the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes 4, 1, 3, 8, 9, and 13 are central nodes with 3 connections each. Therefore, we need to find the leaves connected to these central nodes.

For node 4, the 3-star structures are: 
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (7, 8, 10)>
- <4, (7, 9, 10)>
- <4, (7, 1, 3)>
Total: 4

For node 1, the 3-star structures are: 
- <1, (4, 5, 13)>
- <1, (4, 3, 13)>
- <1, (4, 12, 13)>
- <1, (3, 5, 13)>
- <1, (3, 12, 13)>
Total: 5

For node 3, the 3-star structures are: 
- <3, (4, 11, 6)>
- <3, (4, 0, 14)>
- <3, (1, 11, 6)>
- <3, (1, 0, 14)>
- <3, (5, 11, 6)>
- <3, (5, 0, 14)>
Total: 6

For node 8, the 3-star structures are: 
- <8, (4, 11, 12)>
- <8, (4, 5, 14)>
- <8, (4, 12, 14)>
- <8, (11, 5, 12)>
- <8, (11, 5, 14)>
- <8, (5, 12, 14)>
Total: 6

For node 9, the 3-star structures are: 
- <9, (4, 7, 12)>
- <9, (4, 10, 12)>
- <9, (4, 2, 13)>
- <9, (7, 10, 12)>
- <9, (7, 2, 13)>
- <9, (10, 2, 13)>
Total: 6

For node 13, the 3-star structures are: 
- <13, (7, 10, 2)>
- <13, (7, 6, 2)>
- <13, (1, 10, 2)>
- <13, (1, 14, 2)>
- <13, (10, 6, 2)>
- <13, (10, 14, 2)>
Total: 6

Adding up the unique 3-star structures, we get a total of **27**.

Therefore, the count of 3-stars in the given graph is **[27]**.
