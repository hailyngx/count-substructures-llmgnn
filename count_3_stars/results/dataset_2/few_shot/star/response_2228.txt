Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. From the adjacency list, we find the following potential 3-stars:
   - Node 2: (16, 24, 9)
   - Node 5: (16, 25, 11)
   - Node 9: (27, 21, 20)
   
2. Let's analyze each potential 3-star:
   - Node 2: (16, 24, 9) forms a 3-star. 
      <2, (16, 24, 9)>
   
   - Node 5: (16, 25, 11) does not form a 3-star as node 5 is not a central node.

   - Node 9: (27, 21, 20) does not form a 3-star as node 9 is not a central node.
   
3. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
   The unique 3-star found is <2, (16, 24, 9)>.
