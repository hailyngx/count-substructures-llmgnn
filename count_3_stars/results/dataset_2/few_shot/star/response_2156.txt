Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central node and its adjacent nodes.  
Given the adjacency list, we can see that:
- Node 1 has 6, 9, 3, 2, and 5 as its adjacent nodes.
- Node 7 has 6, 9, 8, 0, and 2 as its adjacent nodes.
- Node 2 has 9, 1, 3, 4, and 5 as its adjacent nodes.

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars by looking at nodes that are adjacent to exactly 3 nodes (other than the central node).
- Node 1 has 3 adjacent nodes that form a 3-star: (1, 5, 2)
- Node 2 has 3 adjacent nodes that form a 3-star: (2, 4, 5)
- Node 7 has 3 adjacent nodes that form a 3-star: (7, 8, 2)

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
There are 3 unique 3-stars found.

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (5, 2, 1)>
<2, (4, 5, 2)>
<7, (8, 2, 7)>
