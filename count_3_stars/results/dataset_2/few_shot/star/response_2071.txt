Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for sets of four nodes where one node is connected to the other three nodes, forming a 3-star shape. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Look for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 3
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 4, and 8
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 4, and 13

2. Identify the 3-stars:
   - <6, (9, 7, 3)>
   - <7, (6, 4, 8)>
   - <3, (6, 4, 13)>
   
The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (9, 7, 3)>, <7, (6, 4, 8)>, <3, (6, 4, 13)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
