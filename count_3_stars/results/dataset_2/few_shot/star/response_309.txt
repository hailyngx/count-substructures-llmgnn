Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- For Node 0: There are no 3-stars with Node 0 as the center.
- For Node 1: <1, (4, 7, 12)>
- For Node 2: <2, (13, 6, 14)>
- For Node 3: There are no 3-stars with Node 3 as the center.
- For Node 4: <4, (7, 10, 6)>
- For Node 5: <5, (8, 12, 14)>
- For Node 6: <6, (7, 13, 4)>
- For Node 7: <7, (4, 11, 6)>
- For Node 8: There are no 3-stars with Node 8 as the center.
- For Node 9: There are no 3-stars with Node 9 as the center.
- For Node 10: There are no 3-stars with Node 10 as the center.
- For Node 11: <11, (7, 14, 9)>
- For Node 12: There are no 3-stars with Node 12 as the center.
- For Node 13: There are no 3-stars with Node 13 as the center.
- For Node 14: There are no 3-stars with Node 14 as the center.

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [8].
