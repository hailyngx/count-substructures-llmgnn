Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 3: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star <4, (13, 8, 14)>.
- Node 5: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 6: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 8: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star <9, (1, 21, 24)>.
- Node 10: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 11: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 12: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 13: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 14: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 15: Forms a 3-star <15, (29, 25, 26)>.
- Node 16: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 17: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 18: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 19: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 20: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 21: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 22: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 23: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 24: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 25: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 26: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 27: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 28: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 29: Does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <4, (13, 8, 14)> and <9, (1, 21, 24)>.
