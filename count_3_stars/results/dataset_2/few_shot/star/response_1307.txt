Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we will look for each node that has exactly 3 neighbors and form 3-stars around them with their neighbors. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
1. <3, (11, 7, 12)>
2. <5, (16, 8, 12)>
3. <6, (16, 9, 19)>
4. <9, (16, 6, 18)>
5. <12, (3, 10, 5)>
6. <15, (11, 18, 13)>
7. <16, (1, 9, 5)>
8. <17, (10, 0, 0)>
9. <18, (15, 9, 2)>
10. <19, (6, 14, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
