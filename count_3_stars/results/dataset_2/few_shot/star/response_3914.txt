Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 10) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 12) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 13) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 14, and node 11
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 14, 11, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 13, 12, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 14, and node 10
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 12, 0, 8, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 11, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 14, and node 13
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 0, 14, and node 8
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 10
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, 11, and node 10

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
Here are the 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 6, 13)> 
<4, (7, 14, 11)> 
<7, (9, 12, 4)> 
<14, (6, 0, 11)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
