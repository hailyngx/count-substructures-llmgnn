Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 11) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 10) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, 1, 14, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 11, and node 14
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 12, 10, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 11, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 10, 2, 11, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 14, and node 10
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, 12, and node 13
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 13, 14, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 12, and node 11
Node 14 is connected to node 3, 8, 12, and node 2

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list:
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 2)>
- <2, (6, 7, 10)>
- <3, (11, 12, 14)>
- <4, (7, 8, 10)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <7, (4, 1, 2)>
- <8, (9, 4, 14)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
- <10, (2, 4, 6)>
- <11, (3, 4, 12)>
- <12, (11, 13, 14)>
- <13, (9, 11, 12)>
- <14, (3, 8, 12)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have found 14 in total. 
Therefore, the final answer is [14].
