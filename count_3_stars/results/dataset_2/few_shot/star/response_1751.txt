Response:
In order to count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down the 3-stars found in this graph:
<5, (9, 6, 10)>
<9, (5, 28, 11)>
<4, (7, 13, 28)>
<13, (4, 2, 1)>
<15, (19, 23, 28)>
<10, (5, 12, 24)>
<12, (10, 18, 1)>
<6, (5, 14, 23)>
<7, (4, 21, 17)>
<8, (25, 2, 19)>
<21, (7, 3, 16)>
<16, (21, 6, 0)>
<17, (7, 25, 18)>
<20, (19, 24, 22)>
<23, (21, 6, 26)>
<22, (29, 28, 20)>

Now, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [15].
