Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 10) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 0) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 11) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 13)

Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 11, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 14, 7, 11, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 2, 12, 10, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 14, and node 11
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 11, 14, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 8, 6, and node 13
Node 12 is connected to node 9, and node 7
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 7, 0, and node 11
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 6, and node 0

Response:
First, let's find the central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the adjacency list, these central nodes are nodes: 5, 6, 11, and 14.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars for each central node:
- For central node 5: (5, 9, 11), (5, 6, 10)
- For central node 6: (6, 5, 11), (6, 7, 13), (6, 14, 0)
- For central node 11: (11, 5, 9), (11, 1, 8), (11, 6, 13)
- For central node 14: (14, 9, 1), (14, 6, 0)

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 11, 5)>, <5, (6, 10, 5)>, <6, (5, 11, 6)>, <6, (7, 13, 6)>, <6, (0, 14, 6)>, <11, (9, 5, 11)>, <11, (1, 8, 11)>, <11, (6, 13, 11)>, <14, (1, 9, 14)>, <14, (6, 0, 14)>
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
