Response:
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:
<8, (23, 9, 19)>
<23, (8, 14, 29)>
<19, (8, 23, 4)>
<4, (9, 19, 22)>
<5, (6, 29, 20)>
<6, (5, 28, 7)>
<7, (26, 6, 27)>
<9, (8, 25, 4)>
<10, (20, 13, 24)>
<11, (9, 13, 11)>
<12, (22, 29, 24)>

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars: 10

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
