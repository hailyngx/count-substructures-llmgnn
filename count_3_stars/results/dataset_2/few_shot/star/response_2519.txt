Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided and the given edges and adjacency list.

We'll start by listing the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (6, 4, 7)>
<1, (5, 8, 7)>
<2, (9, 3, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
So, the final answer is: [3]
