Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where there is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's go through each node and its connections to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 8, 11, 12, 10, 5, 2
  - No 3-star here as it has 6 connections.
  
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 4, 3, 6
  - No 3-star here as it has 3 connections but not in the required star pattern.
  
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 3, 13, 0, 14, 5
  - No 3-star here as it has 5 connections.
  
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 11, 10, 6, 2
  - <3, (1, 11, 10)> - Forms a 3-star centered at node 3.
  
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 8, 1, 11
  - <4, (8, 1, 11)> - Forms a 3-star centered at node 4.
  
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 11, 12, 0, 10, 2
  - <5, (11, 12, 10)> - Forms a 3-star centered at node 5.
  
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, 9, 10, 12
  - No 3-star here as it has 6 connections.
  
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 10, 9, 8
  - No 3-star here as it has 3 connections but not in the required star pattern.
  
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 4, 7, 0, 6
  - <8, (4, 7, 6)> - Forms a 3-star centered at node 8.
  
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 7, 6
  - No 3-star here as it has 2 connections.
  
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 7, 3, 6, 0, 5
  - No additional 3-star here as the existing one at node 5 covers the connections of node 10 already.
  
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 4, 3, 14, 0, 5
  - No additional 3-star here as the existing one at node 5 covers the connections of node 11 already.
  
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 13, 6, 5, 0
  - No 3-star here as it has 4 connections.
  
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 12, 2
  - No 3-star here as it has 2 connections.
  
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 11, 2
  - No 3-star here as it has 2 connections.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<3, (1, 11, 10)>  
<4, (8, 1, 11)>  
<5, (11, 12, 10)>
