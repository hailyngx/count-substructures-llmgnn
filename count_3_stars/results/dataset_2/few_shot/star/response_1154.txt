Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's follow these steps:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Check if these nodes form a 3-star structure around the central node.
3. Count the unique 3-stars found in the graph.

Let's proceed with step 1:

From the adjacency list, the following nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1: (8, 13, 17), and node 14
- Node 3: (8, 16, 19), and node 14
- Node 4: (13, 5, 19)
- Node 9: (12, 11)

Now let's check if these nodes form 3-star structures:

- For Node 1: <1, (8, 13, 17)>
- For Node 3: <3, (8, 16, 19)>, <3, (14, 3, 16)>
- For Node 4: <4, (13, 5, 19)>
- For Node 9: <9, (12, 11, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
