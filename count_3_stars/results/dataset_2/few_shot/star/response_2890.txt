Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<6, (9, 1, 12)>
<1, (6, 20, 26)>
<22, (18, 14, 11)>
<3, (22, 11, 13)>
<4, (18, 25, 29)>
<17, (5, 1, 16)>
<23, (14, 7, 10)>
<16, (17, 28, 0)>
<26, (6, 20, 1)>
<29, (25, 4, 16)>
<18, (22, 4, 24)>
<5, (17, 24, 0)>
<14, (22, 8, 23)>
<20, (25, 26, 1)>
<21, (27, 17, 0)>
<0, (16, 28, 5)>

Counting all the 3-stars listed above, we find that there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
