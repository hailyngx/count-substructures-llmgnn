Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. For each node in the graph, check if it is the center of a 3-star.
2. If a node is the center of a 3-star, identify the three other nodes connected to it.
3. Count the unique 3-stars found.

Let's go through the graph and find the 3-stars:

- <0, (3, 8, 10)>
- <1, (9, 11, 13)>
- <2, (4, 7, 12)>
- <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- <4, (2, 11, 14)>
- <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- <6, (10, 12, 13)>
- <7, (2, 10, 13)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>
- <10, (0, 6, 7)>
- <11, (0, 1, 4)>
- <12, (1, 2, 6)>
- <13, (1, 6, 7)>
- <14, (4, 13)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
