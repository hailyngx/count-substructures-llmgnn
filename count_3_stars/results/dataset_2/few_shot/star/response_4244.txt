Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking at each node and its connections. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can see that the nodes with connections to exactly three other nodes would be the potential centers of 3-stars in the graph. Let's identify those nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to 5 other nodes but only has 3 unique connections (20, 10, 24).
- Node 2 is connected to 2 other nodes, not a candidate.
- Node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes with unique connections (19, 26, 4).
- Node 6 is connected to 2 other nodes, not a candidate.
- Node 8 is connected to 3 other nodes with unique connections (29, 16, 12).
- Node 15 is connected to 4 other nodes but only has 3 unique connections (1, 23, 12).
- Node 19 is connected to 5 other nodes but has 3 unique connections (3, 25, 10).
- Node 20 is connected to 4 other nodes but only has 3 unique connections (17, 21, 27).
- Node 22 is connected to 5 other nodes but has 3 unique connections (17, 16, 28).
- Node 24 is connected to 5 other nodes but only has 3 unique connections (13, 1, 23).
- Node 28 is connected to 3 other nodes with unique connections (16, 15, 22).
- Node 29 is connected to 4 other nodes but only has 3 unique connections (8, 5, 21).

Based on the criteria for a 3-star, the nodes that could potentially be the centers of 3-stars in this graph are: 0, 3, 8, 15, 19, 20, 22, 24, 28, 29.

Next, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (20, 10, 24)>
<3, (19, 26, 4)>
<8, (29, 16, 12)>
<15, (1, 23, 12)>
<19, (3, 25, 10)>
<20, (17, 21, 27)>
<22, (17, 16, 28)>
<24, (13, 1, 23)>
<28, (16, 15, 22)>
<29, (8, 5, 21)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
