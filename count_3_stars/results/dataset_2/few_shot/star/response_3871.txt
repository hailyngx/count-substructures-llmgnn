Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star.

Based on the adjacency list given, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<4, (7, 13, 14)>
<7, (4, 15, 18)>
<3, (1, 12, 19)>
<2, (17, 9, 15)>
<5, (7, 2, 18)>
<12, (3, 10, 16)>
<16, (4, 10, 19)>

Each of these 3-stars is unique in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
