Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that act as the center of each 3-star. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can determine the number of 3-star graphs by identifying which nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes along edges. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (11, 1, 15)>
<2, (8, 17, 22)>
<5, (24, 21, 27)>
<19, (not connected to any other nodes)>
