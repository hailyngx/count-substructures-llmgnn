Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 11, 4)>
<1, (3, 2, 0)>
<2, (1, 8, 17)>
<3, (15, 1, 17)>
<4, (15, 17, 0)>
<8, (13, 2, 9)>
<9, (8, 18, 4)>
<10, (17, 19, 10)>
<11, (15, 2, 0)>
<13, (15, 8, 16)>
<14, (13, 9, 6)>
<15, (3, 13, 4)>
<16, (3, 13, 6)>
<17, (3, 10, 2)>
<18, (2, 19, 9)>
<19, (10, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
