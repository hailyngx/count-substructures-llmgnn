Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <3, (1, 21, 8)>
2. <4, (0, 5, 9)>
3. <5, (4, 15, 21)>
4. <10, (14, 15, 20)>
5. <11, (7, 22, 24)>
6. <12, (1, 17, 25)>
7. <13, (6, 17, 26)>
8. <14, (10, 17, 26)>
9. <16, (1, 15, 19)>
10. <17, (1, 12, 20)>
11. <19, (16, 22, 27)>
12. <20, (10, 17, 18)>
13. <21, (3, 5, 6)>
14. <24, (2, 7, 10)>
15. <26, (13, 14, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
