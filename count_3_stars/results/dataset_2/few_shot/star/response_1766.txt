Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star configuration, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the adjacency list for each node, let's identify the 3-stars:

1. From node 0:
   <0, (1, 4, 9)>   

2. From node 1:
   <1, (0, 7, 9)>  
   <1, (2, 4, 7)>  

3. From node 2:
   <2, (1, 4, 5)>   

4. From node 3:
   <3, (4, 5, 6)>  

5. From node 4:
   <4, (0, 3, 6)>  
   <4, (2, 3, 5)>  

6. From node 5:
   <5, (2, 3, 4)>  
   <5, (3, 4, 6)>  

7. From node 6:
   <6, (3, 4, 5)>  
   <6, (4, 5, 9)>  

8. From node 7:
   <7, (1, 6, 9)>  

9. From node 9:
   <9, (0, 1, 6)>  
   <9, (1, 6, 7)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
