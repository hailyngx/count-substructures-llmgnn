Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and identify the 3-stars centered at those nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors:
    - Node 23 has 2 neighbors.
    - Node 21 is not connected to any other nodes.
    - All other nodes have more or fewer than three neighbors.

2. Identify 3-stars:
    - 3-stars can be formed at nodes that have three neighbors, and the other end nodes connected to those three neighbors.
    - We will list the unique 3-stars in the format <central node, (leaf node 1, leaf node 2, leaf node 3)>.

3. List of 3-stars identified:
    - <0, (5, 8, 18)>
    - <1, (3, 15, 23)>
    - <3, (1, 13, 15)>
    - <4, (2, 10, 11)>
    - <5, (0, 7, 20)>
    - <6, (26, 28, 25)>
    - <7, (5, 12, 29)>
    - <9, (16, 17, 26)>
    - <12, (7, 19, 24)>
    - <13, (1, 14, 3)>
    - <15, (1, 25, 3)>
    - <16, (9, 18, 29)>
    - <17, (8, 19, 20)>
    - <18, (0, 10, 16)>
    - <19, (12, 17, 26)>
    - <20, (5, 12, 17)>
    - <22, (7, 29, 22)>
    - <24, (12, 19, 29)>
    - <25, (15, 3, 6)>
    - <27, (10, 19, 27)>
    - <28, (23, 1, 6)>
    - <29, (7, 16, 22)>
   
4. Count the number of 3-stars: 
    - There are 21 unique 3-stars identified.
