Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 2) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 10, 11, 8, 14, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 11, 8, and node 14
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 10, 6, 14, 13, and node 12
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 11, 14, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 11, 10, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 10 is connected to node 7, 11, 0, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 10, 1, 0, 6, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 11, 13, 2, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 0, 12, and node 2
Node 14 is connected to node 6, 0, 1, and node 2

Response:
Based on the given information, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:

<5, (9, 6, 3)>
<9, (5, 2, 10)>
<4, (8, 3, 5)>
<7, (3, 11, 10)>
<10, (7, 11, 0)>
<11, (7, 1, 6)>
<8, (5, 4, 7)>
<6, (5, 11, 14)>
<0, (10, 11, 14)>
<2, (9, 10, 6)>
<3, (5, 4, 7)>
<1, (11, 8, 14)>
<12, (11, 13, 2)>
<13, (0, 12, 2)>
<14, (6, 0, 1)>

By counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [15] 3-stars in the graph.
