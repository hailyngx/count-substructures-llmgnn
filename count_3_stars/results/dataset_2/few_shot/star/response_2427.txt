Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 2

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided. 
A 3-star in a graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the connections, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 8)>

Now, we can count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
There are 10 unique 3-stars identified. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
