Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by counting the number of 3-stars around each node. Let's list the 3-star configurations for each node:

<0, (3, 15, 28)>
<1, (3, 11, 25)>
<2, (5, 19, 26)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (10, 17, 20)>
<5, (2, 13, 26)>
<6, (7)>
<7, (6, 9, 15)>
<8, (3, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 11)>
<10, (4, 16, 27)>
<11, (1, 9, 13)>
<12, (11, 23, 28)>
<13, (5, 11, 25)>
<14, (12)>
<15, (0, 7, 20)>
<16, (10, 26)>
<17, (4)>
<18, (19, 25, 29)>
<19, (2, 24, 26)>
<20, (4, 15, 25)>
<21, (18, 23)>
<22, (19, 29)>
<23, (12, 13, 21)>
<24, (19, 25, 3)>
<25, (1, 13, 18)>
<26, (5, 16, 19)>
<27, (10)>
<28, (0, 12, 9)>
<29, (0, 18, 4)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars:
