Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 5, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 7, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the graph. To be considered a 3-star, there must be a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (6, 8, 2)>
2. <1, (6, 5, 0)>
3. <2, (9, 4, 5)>
4. <3, (9, 4, 2)>
5. <4, (6, 8, 5)>
6. <5, (6, 4, 2)>
7. <6, (9, 5, 1)>
8. <7, (6, 8, 0)>
9. <8, (4, 0, 7)>
10. <9, (6, 2, 3)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-star configurations in the given graph.
