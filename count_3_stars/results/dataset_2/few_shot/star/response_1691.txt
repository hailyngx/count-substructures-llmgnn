Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph and then count them. 

Let's find the 3-stars step by step:
1. Identify the central node and its connected nodes for each node based on the adjacency list.
2. Determine if there are any 3-stars formed by each node being the central node.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For Node 0:
    Central Node: 0
    Connected Nodes: 5, 6, 1, 8
    No 3-stars with Node 0 as the central node.

2. For Node 1:
    Central Node: 1
    Connected Nodes: 5, 9, 0
    No 3-stars with Node 1 as the central node.

3. For Node 2:
    Central Node: 2
    Connected Nodes: 5, 9, 6, 8
    No 3-stars with Node 2 as the central node.

4. For Node 3:
    Central Node: 3
    Connected Nodes: 7, 4, 8
    No 3-stars with Node 3 as the central node.

5. For Node 4:
    Central Node: 4
    Connected Nodes: 6, 3, 8
    No 3-stars with Node 4 as the central node.

6. For Node 5:
    Central Node: 5
    Connected Nodes: 2, 1, 0, 7
    <5, (2, 1, 0)>, <5, (2, 1, 7)>, <5, (2, 0, 7)>

7. For Node 6:
    Central Node: 6
    Connected Nodes: 9, 2, 8, 4, 0
    No 3-stars with Node 6 as the central node.

8. For Node 7:
    Central Node: 7
    Connected Nodes: 5, 9, 3, 8
    No 3-stars with Node 7 as the central node.

9. For Node 8:
    Central Node: 8
    Connected Nodes: 6, 3, 4, 2, 0, 7
    <8, (6, 4, 2)>, <8, (6, 4, 0)>, <8, (6, 2, 0)>, <8, (4, 2, 0)>

10. For Node 9:
    Central Node: 9
    Connected Nodes: 6, 2, 1, 7
    No 3-stars with Node 9 as the central node.

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [4]

Unique 3-stars found: 
    <5, (2, 1, 0)>
    <5, (2, 1, 7)>
    <5, (2, 0, 7)>
    <8, (6, 4, 2)>
    <8, (6, 4, 0)>
    <8, (6, 2, 0)>
    <8, (4, 2, 0)>
