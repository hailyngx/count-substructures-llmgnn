Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (2, 1, 4)>
<9, (8, 2, 3)>
<4, (5, 1, -)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (5, 3, 2)>
<3, (9, 7, 1)>
<6, (7, 2, 8)>
<0, (9, 7, 8)>
<8, (9, 7, 1)>
<2, (5, 9, 1)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars found: [10].
