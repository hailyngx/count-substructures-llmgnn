Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. In this case, any node connected to exactly three other nodes can be the center of a 3-star.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (7, 8, 2)>
<2, (9, 8, 1)>
<3, (9, 6, 2)>
<4, (5, 7, 6)>
<5, (9, 6, 4)>
<6, (5, 8, 4)>
<7, (9, 4, 1)>
<8, (9, 7, 6)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
