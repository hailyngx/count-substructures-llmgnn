Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that satisfy the definition of a 3-star graph, where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 14, 11)>
<1, (3, 15, 2)>
<2, (9, 18, 17)>
<3, (1, 11, 0)>
<4, (9, 18, 10)>
<5, (9, 10, 16)>
<6, (7, 8, 17)>
<7, (6, 13, 8)>
<8, (19, 16, 17)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<10, (5, 4, 19)>
<11, (3, 0, 1)>
<13, (9, 14, 7)>
<14, (0, 13, 7)>
<15, (1, 2, 3)>
<16, (5, 8, 17)>
<17, (2, 19, 6)>
<18, (3, 2, 4)>
<19, (3, 17, 8)>

There are 19 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [19].
