Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 9, 5, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
There are three 3-star graphs in the given graph. 
So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
