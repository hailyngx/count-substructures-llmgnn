Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present. A 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <5, (0, 4, 14)>
2. <9, (2, 10, 14)>
3. <4, (5, 12, 10)>
4. <7, (1, 13, 11)>
5. <1, (0, 14, 7)>
6. <3, (1, 8, 9)>
7. <2, (0, 8, 9)>
8. <8, (3, 10, 14)>
9. <10, (2, 8, 4)>
10. <11, (7, 14, 12)>
11. <12, (3, 4, 11)>
12. <13, (5, 6, 7)>
13. <14, (5, 9, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
