Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, 14, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 2, 11, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 11, 3, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 0, 12, 13, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 14, and node 13
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 10, and node 11
Node 14 is connected to node 7, 6, 10, and node 11

Response:
Step 1: Identify all the 3-star configurations in the graph.  
Let's look at the nodes and their connections.
- Node 0: (7, 3, 8)
- Node 1: (2, 12)
- Node 2: (9, 1, 8)
- Node 3: (9, 7)
- Node 4: (8, 11)
- Node 5: (9, 6, 12)
- Node 6: (5, 4, 14)
- Node 7: (5, 0, 3, 14)
- Node 8: (4, 7, 1, 2, 11)
- Node 9: (5, 2, 11, 3, 12)
- Node 10: (0, 12, 13, 14)
- Node 11: (9, 4, 8, 14, 13)
- Node 12: (5, 9, 1, 10)
- Node 13: (10, 11)
- Node 14: (7, 6, 10, 11)

Step 2: List the unique 3-stars in the graph.
- <0, (7, 3, 8)>
- <1, (2, 12, 8)>
- <2, (9, 1, 8)>
- <3, (9, 7, 0)>
- <4, (8, 11, 4)>
- <5, (9, 6, 12)>
- <6, (5, 4, 14)>
- <7, (5, 0, 3, 14)>
- <8, (4, 7, 1, 2, 11)>
- <9, (5, 2, 11, 3, 12)>
- <10, (0, 12, 13, 14)>
- <11, (9, 4, 8, 14, 13)>
- <12, (5, 9, 1, 10)>
- <13, (10, 11)>
- <14, (7, 6, 10, 11)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars found.
