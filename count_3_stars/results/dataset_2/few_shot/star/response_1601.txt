Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by calculating the number of connected triples for each node where one node is the center and the other two are the leaves.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 2 3-stars (<0, (29, 26)>, <0, (16, 12)>)
- Node 1: 3 3-stars (<1, (15, 28)>, <1, (15, 22)>, <1, (15, 18)>)
- Node 2: 0 3-stars
- Node 3: 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star (<4, (5, 15)>)
- Node 5: 1 3-star (<5, (9, 26)>)
- Node 6: 1 3-star (<6, (17, 28)>)
- Node 7: 1 3-star (<7, (29, 5)>)
- Node 8: 0 3-stars
- Node 9: 2 3-stars (<9, (29, 22)>, <9, (22, 28)>)
- Node 10: 0 3-stars
- Node 11: 0 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star (<12, (11, 23)>)
- Node 13: 0 3-stars
- Node 14: 0 3-stars
- Node 15: 1 3-star (<15, (17, 8)>)
- Node 16: 1 3-star (<16, (6, 22)>)
- Node 17: 1 3-star (<17, (10, 15)>)
- Node 18: 0 3-stars
- Node 19: 0 3-stars
- Node 20: 0 3-stars
- Node 21: 0 3-stars
- Node 22: 0 3-stars
- Node 23: 0 3-stars
- Node 24: 0 3-stars
- Node 25: 0 3-stars
- Node 26: 0 3-stars
- Node 27: 0 3-stars
- Node 28: 1 3-star (<28, (20, 6)>)
- Node 29: 1 3-star (<29, (2, 7)>)

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [13]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (29, 26)>
<0, (16, 12)>
<1, (15, 28)>
<1, (15, 22)>
<1, (15, 18)>
<4, (5, 15)>
<5, (9, 26)>
<6, (17, 28)>
<7, (29, 5)>
<12, (11, 23)>
<15, (17, 8)>
<16, (6, 22)>
<17, (10, 15)>
