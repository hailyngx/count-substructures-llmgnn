Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the given definition.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- <0, (9, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 8, _)>
- <2, (9, 7, 3)>
- <3, (6, 0, 2)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <6, (5, 7, 3)>
- <7, (6, 9, 4)>
- <8, (4, 1, 3)>
- <9, (2, 7, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [9].
