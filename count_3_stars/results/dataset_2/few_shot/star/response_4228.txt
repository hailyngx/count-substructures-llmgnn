Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we should look for nodes that have exactly three neighboring nodes and form a 3-star pattern. 

From the adjacency list, we can identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 3, and 0. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<5, (6, 7, 0)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (6, 3, 0)>

Since we found 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the final answer is [3].
