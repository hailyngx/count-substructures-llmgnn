Response:
There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  

Here are the unique 3-stars:  
<0, (2, 4, 16)>  
<0, (4, 11, 13)>  
<1, (5, 14, 18)>  
<1, (14, 18, 1)>  
<4, (11, 13, 17)>  
<4, (7, 11, 18)>  
<7, (11, 17, 18)>  
<13, (4, 5, 17)>  

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
