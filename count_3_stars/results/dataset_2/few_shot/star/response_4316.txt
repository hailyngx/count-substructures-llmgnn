Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 7, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (6, 1, 3)>
<1, (6, 3, 2)>
<2, (9, 1, 3)>
<3, (9, 1, 0)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 1, 0)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (9, 3, 4)>
<9, (8, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
