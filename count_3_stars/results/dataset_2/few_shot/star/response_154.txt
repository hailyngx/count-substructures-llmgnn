Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly 3 connections are: 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. 

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- For node 2: No 3-stars as it only has 2 connections.
- For node 3: No 3-stars as it only has 2 connections.
- For node 4: No 3-stars as it only has 2 connections.
- For node 6: <6, (17, 16, 0)>
- For node 7: No 3-stars as it only has 2 connections.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1.
