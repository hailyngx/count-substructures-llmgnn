Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph provided:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 13, and 4: <1, (3, 13, 4)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 10, and 9: <3, (1, 10, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 5, and 14: <8, (13, 5, 14)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 0: <13, (1, 8, 0)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 2, and 11: <0, (13, 2, 11)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 0, and 14: <2, (3, 0, 14)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8, and 7: <5, (3, 8, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 12: <4, (1, 2, 12)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 0, and 10: <9, (3, 0, 10)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 12: <11, (0, 4, 12)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 8 and 13: <6, (8, 13)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 5, and 14: <7, (8, 5, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
