Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of a central node and its three connected nodes. 

Let's go through each node to check if it forms a 3-star. 

For example:
- Node 0 is not a central node in any 3-star as it is connected to only two other nodes.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (7, 5, 6)>
- Node 2 is not a central node in any 3-star as it is connected to only one other node.
- Node 3 is not a central node in any 3-star as it is connected to only three other nodes, and they do not form a 3-star with it as the central node.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (7, 12, 9)>
- Node 5 is not a central node in any 3-star as it is connected to only three other nodes.
- Node 6 is not a central node in any 3-star as it is connected to only three other nodes.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (4, 0, 9)>
- Node 8 is not a central node in any 3-star as it is connected to only three other nodes.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (4, 7, 12)>
- Node 10 is not a central node in any 3-star as it is connected to only three other nodes.
- Node 11 is not a central node in any 3-star as it is connected to only two other nodes.
- Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (4, 5, 13)>
- Node 13 is not a central node in any 3-star as it is connected to only three other nodes.
- Node 14 is not a central node in any 3-star as it is connected to only three other nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3.
