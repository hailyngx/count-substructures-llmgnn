Response:
Based on the given graph and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected in a star pattern with one central node and three leaves. Let's list the unique 3-stars below:

<1, (5, 17, 10)>
<2, (11, 16, 9)>
<3, (28, 29, 17)>
<4, (27, 22, 24)>
<5, (22, 29, 1)>
<6, (21, 24, 14)>
<9, (28, 11, 15)>
<15, (25, 17, 9)>
<16, (22, 20, 4)>
<24, (27, 6, 4)>
<26, (21, 17, 23)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
