Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and check if it forms a 3-star. 

Let's go through each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 8, 12, 10 but it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 3, 6, 10, 13, 7 but it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 5, 11, 13 but it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 9, 1, 10, 6, 4 which forms a 3-star <3, (1, 6, 4)>.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: 5, 9, 3, 8, 12, 14 which forms two 3-stars: <4, (8, 12, 14)> and <4, (5, 9, 3)>.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 13, 2, 4 but it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 12, 13 which forms a 3-star <6, (1, 3, 13)>.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 8, 12, 14 which forms a 3-star <7, (1, 8, 14)>.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 4, 11, 0, 7 which forms a 3-star <8, (4, 11, 7)>.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 4, 10, 3 but it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 9, 1, 3, 0, 13 which forms a 3-star <10, (9, 1, 13)>.
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors: 8, 2 but it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 14, 0 which forms a 3-star <12, (4, 7, 14)>.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 5, 1, 6, 2, 10 which forms a 3-star <13, (1, 6, 10)>.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 12 but it doesn't form a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (1, 6, 4)>, <4, (8, 12, 14)>, <4, (5, 9, 3)>, <6, (1, 3, 13)>, <7, (1, 8, 14)>, <8, (4, 11, 7)>, <10, (9, 1, 13)>, <12, (4, 7, 14)>, <13, (1, 6, 10)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
