Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3)

Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
   - Possible 3-star with center at node 0: <0, (5, 9, 4)>
   - Possible 3-star with center at node 0: <0, (5, 4, 2)>

2. Node 1:
   - No 3-stars centered at node 1 since it has more than three neighbors.

3. Node 2:
   - No 3-stars centered at node 2 since it has less than three neighbors.

4. Node 3:
   - No 3-stars centered at node 3 since it has more than three neighbors.

5. Node 4:
   - Possible 3-star with center at node 4: <4, (5, 7, 0)>
   - Possible 3-star with center at node 4: <4, (5, 7, 1)>

6. Node 5:
   - Possible 3-star with center at node 5: <5, (6, 2, 8)>
   - Possible 3-star with center at node 5: <5, (6, 4, 0)>

7. Node 6:
   - No 3-stars centered at node 6 since it has more than three neighbors.

8. Node 7:
   - Possible 3-star with center at node 7: <7, (4, 3, 6)>
   - Possible 3-star with center at node 7: <7, (4, 3, 1)>

9. Node 8:
   - No 3-stars centered at node 8 since it has less than three neighbors.

10. Node 9:
   - No 3-stars centered at node 9 since it has less than three neighbors.

Count of 3-stars: [8]
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 9, 4)>, <0, (5, 4, 2)>, <4, (5, 7, 0)>, <4, (5, 7, 1)>, <5, (6, 2, 8)>, <5, (6, 4, 0)>, <7, (4, 3, 6)>, <7, (4, 3, 1)>
