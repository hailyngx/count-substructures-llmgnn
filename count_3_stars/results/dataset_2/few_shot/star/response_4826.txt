Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
- Node 0: degree = 4
- Node 1: degree = 4
- Node 2: degree = 5
- Node 3: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 5
- Node 5: degree = 3
- Node 6: degree = 2
- Node 7: degree = 4
- Node 8: degree = 5
- Node 9: degree = 4

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars in the graph.
- Since a 3-star has one center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with degree 3.
- In this graph, Node 5 is connected to three nodes: 9, 6, 8. This forms a 3-star with Node 5 as the center and nodes 9, 6, 8 as the leaves. 
- Similarly, Node 8 is also connected to three nodes: 5, 9, 4. This forms another 3-star with Node 8 as the center and nodes 5, 9, 4 as the leaves.

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars.
- There are 2 unique 3-stars found: 
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
