Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (7, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 2, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's start by listing out all the 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 2)>
<1, (5, 2, 4)>
<3, (5, 4, 2)>
<2, (6, 1, 8)>
<8, (5, 1, 2)>
<0, (5, 6, 4)>
<7, (9, 5, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
