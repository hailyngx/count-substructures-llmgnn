Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph can be counted by examining each node and finding how many 3-stars it is a part of. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, we need to identify nodes that have exactly three neighbors connected to them.

Based on the given adjacency list, the following nodes have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 5 has 28, 18, and 23 as neighbors
- Node 7 has 29, 18, and 16 as neighbors
- Node 11 has 21, 10, and 23 as neighbors
- Node 12 has 10, 20, and 17 as neighbors

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (28, 18, 23)>
<7, (29, 18, 16)>
<11, (21, 10, 23)>
<12, (10, 20, 17)>

So, the final answer is [4].
