Response:
Let's analyze the graph to identify the 3-stars.

1. Based on the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with degree 3 and directly connected to node 11 are nodes 1, 5, and 17.

2. Now, we will look at each potential 3-star involving the central node 11:

    - For node 1 as one of the leaves, the corresponding 3-star is <11, (1, 8, 16)>.
    - For node 5 as one of the leaves, the corresponding 3-star is <11, (5, 7, 17)>.
    - For node 17 as one of the leaves, the corresponding 3-star is <11, (17, 0, 16)>.

3. Count the unique 3-stars:

    <11, (1, 8, 16)>
    <11, (5, 7, 17)>
    <11, (17, 0, 16)>
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
