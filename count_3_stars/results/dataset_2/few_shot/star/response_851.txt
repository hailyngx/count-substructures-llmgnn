Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars with the given node as the center. 

Based on the adjacency list, the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 2
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 14, 4, and 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 13, 10, 11, and 0
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 11, 7, 0, 14, and 10
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 12, 10, and 14
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 13, 8, 1, and 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, 10, and 12
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 1, 3, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 14, and 0
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 2, and 4
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 2, and 12
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 11, and 4
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, and 2
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 3, and 4

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (9, 3, 2)>
- <1, (5, 14, 4)>
- <2, (13, 10, 11)>
- <3, (1, 14, 10)>
- <4, (1, 12, 14)>
- <5, (6, 8, 7)>
- <6, (5, 9, 7)>
- <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- <8, (5, 9, 7)>
- <9, (6, 8, 14)>
- <10, (6, 3, 2)>
- <11, (3, 2, 12)>
- <12, (6, 11, 4)>
- <13, (5, 2, 0)>
- <14, (9, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
