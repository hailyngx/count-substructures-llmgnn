Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided.

A 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Identify the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them:
   - Node 1 has 3 edges (5, 6, 7) connected to it.
   - Node 2 has 1 edge connected to it.
   - Node 3 has 3 edges (5, 6, 0) connected to it.
   - Node 4 has 3 edges (6, 7, 8) connected to it.
   - Node 5 has 3 edges (1, 6, 7) connected to it.
   - Node 6 has 3 edges (1, 5, 8) connected to it.
   - Node 7 has 3 edges (1, 4, 5) connected to it.
   - Node 8 has 3 edges (5, 6, 4) connected to it.
   - Node 9 has 3 edges (5, 7, 8) connected to it.

2. For each of the identified nodes from step 1, we check if the nodes they are connected to form a 3-star around them. If they do, we list them.

   Here are the 3-stars found:
   <1, (5, 6, 7)>
   <3, (5, 6, 0)>
   <4, (6, 7, 8)>
   <5, (1, 6, 7)>
   <6, (1, 5, 8)>
   <7, (1, 4, 5)>
   <8, (5, 6, 4)>
   <9, (5, 7, 8)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars listed above.
