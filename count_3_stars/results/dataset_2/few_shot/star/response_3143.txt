Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By analyzing the given graph data, we can identify the unique 3-stars as follows:

<3, (14, 18, 7)>
<10, (16, 9, 7)>
<16, (11, 12, 4)>
<18, (13, 19, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
