Response:
In this graph, a 3-star can be identified by locating the central node and its three adjacent nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph step by step.

First, let's identify the candidates for central nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 1: (1, 6, 7, 3, 5, 8)
- Node 4: (4, 9, 7, 2, 0)
- Node 6: (6, 5, 1, 7)
- Node 7: (7, 6, 9, 4, 1)

Now, let's list out the 3-stars:
<1, (6, 7, 3)>   (1 is the central node, and it is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 3)
<1, (6, 7, 5)>   (1 is the central node, and it is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 5)
<1, (7, 9, 4)>   (1 is the central node, and it is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 4)
<1, (7, 4, 8)>   (1 is the central node, and it is connected to nodes 7, 4, and 8)

<4, (9, 7, 2)>   (4 is the central node, and it is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 2)
<4, (9, 7, 0)>   (4 is the central node, and it is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 0)
<4, (7, 6, 1)>   (4 is the central node, and it is connected to nodes 7, 6, and 1)
<4, (7, 6, 9)>   (4 is the central node, and it is connected to nodes 7, 6, and 9)

<6, (5, 1, 7)>   (6 is the central node, and it is connected to nodes 5, 1, and 7)

<7, (6, 5, 1)>   (7 is the central node, and it is connected to nodes 6, 5, and 1)
<7, (6, 9, 4)>   (7 is the central node, and it is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 4)

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
