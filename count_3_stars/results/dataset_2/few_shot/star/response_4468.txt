Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each occurrence of a 3-star, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node and see if it forms any 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes (5, 1, 3)
- Node 1: <1, (0, 3, 2)>
- Node 2: No 3-star as it is connected to 5 nodes (5, 9, 6, 1, 4)
- Node 3: No 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes (6, 1, 0, 8)
- Node 4: No 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes (9, 1, 2)
- Node 5: No 3-star as it is connected to 5 nodes (9, 2, 8, 0, 7)
- Node 6: No 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes (9, 3, 2, 8)
- Node 7: No 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes (5, 9, 8)
- Node 8: No 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes (5, 6, 3, 7)
- Node 9: <9, (5, 6, 4)>

After examining all nodes, we found two unique 3-stars:
1. <1, (0, 3, 2)>
2. <9, (5, 6, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
