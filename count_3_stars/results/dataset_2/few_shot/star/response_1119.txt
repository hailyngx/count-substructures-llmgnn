Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- For Node 0, there are no 3-stars as the maximum number of edges from the central node (Node 0) is 3.
- For Node 1, there are no 3-stars as the maximum number of edges from the central node (Node 1) is 4.
- For Node 2, there is one 3-star: <2, (6, 1, 3)>
- For Node 3, there are no 3-stars as the maximum number of edges from the central node (Node 3) is 4.
- For Node 4, there are no 3-stars as the maximum number of edges from the central node (Node 4) is 2.
- For Node 5, there are no 3-stars as the maximum number of edges from the central node (Node 5) is 4.
- For Node 6, there are no 3-stars as the maximum number of edges from the central node (Node 6) is 5.
- For Node 7, there are no 3-stars as the maximum number of edges from the central node (Node 7) is 4.
- For Node 8, there are no 3-stars as the maximum number of edges from the central node (Node 8) is 4.
- For Node 9, there are no 3-stars as the maximum number of edges from the central node (Node 9) is 5.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

The only 3-star found in the graph is <2, (6, 1, 3)>.
