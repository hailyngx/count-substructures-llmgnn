Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 9 has 3-star <9, (26, 14, 1)>
- Node 26 has 3-star <26, (9, 17, 8)>
- Node 14 has 3-star <14, (9, 26, 17)>
- Node 17 has 3-star <17, (26, 14, 4)>
- Node 12 has 3-star <12, (27, 20, -)>
- Node 3 has 3-star <3, (9, 6, -)>
- Node 4 has 3-star <4, (17, 19, 2)>
- Node 8 has 3-star <8, (26, 11, 0)>
- Node 28 has 3-star <28, (5, -, -)>
- Node 15 has 3-star <15, (27, 25, -)>
- Node 27 has 3-star <27, (15, 22, 13)>
- Node 5 has 3-star <5, (28, 18, 13)>
- Node 13 has 3-star <13, (27, 5, 6)>
- Node 21 has 3-star <21, (19, 23, 22)>
- Node 2 has 3-star <2, (4, 22, 23)>
- Node 22 has 3-star <22, (27, 21, 10)>
- Node 0 has 3-star <0, (8, -, -)>
- Node 10 has 3-star <10, (22, 16, -)>
- Node 6 has 3-star <6, (29, 13, 3)>
- Node 7 has 3-star <7, (11, 2, -)>
- Node 1 has 3-star <1, (9, 11, -)>
- Node 20 has 3-star <20, (12, 16, -)>
- Node 19 has 3-star <19, (4, 16, 23)>
- Node 18 has 3-star <18, (14, 17, 5)>
- Node 23 has 3-star <23, (21, 19, 2)>
- Node 16 has 3-star <16, (5, 10, 20)>
- Node 25 has 3-star <25, (15, 18, -)>

Hence, there are 26 unique 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer is [26].
