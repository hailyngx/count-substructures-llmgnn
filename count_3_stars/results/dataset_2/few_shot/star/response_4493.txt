Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided.

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars through central nodes:

1. 3-star with central node 0: (0, 8, 12)
2. 3-star with central node 1: (1, 6, 8)
3. 3-star with central node 2: (2, 7, 9)
4. 3-star with central node 3: (3, 13, 17)
5. 3-star with central node 4: (4, 16, 17)
6. 3-star with central node 5: (5, 9, 13)
7. 3-star with central node 6: (6, 1, 3)
8. 3-star with central node 7: (7, 2, 15)
9. 3-star with central node 8: (8, 0, 17)
10. 3-star with central node 9: (9, 2, 15)
11. 3-star with central node 10: (10, 11, 12)
12. 3-star with central node 11: (11, 14, 19)
13. 3-star with central node 12: (12, 0, 10)
14. 3-star with central node 13: (13, 3, 5)
15. 3-star with central node 14: (14, 3, 11)
16. 3-star with central node 15: (15, 2, 7)
17. 3-star with central node 16: (16, 3, 4)
18. 3-star with central node 17: (17, 3, 8)
19. 3-star with central node 18: No 3-star as it only has one connection.
20. 3-star with central node 19: (19, 5, 11)

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are 20 different 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [20]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 8, 12>, 
<1, 6, 8>, 
<2, 7, 9>, 
<3, 13, 17>, 
<4, 16, 17>, 
<5, 9, 13>, 
<6, 1, 3>, 
<7, 2, 15>, 
<8, 0, 17>, 
<9, 2, 15>, 
<10, 11, 12>, 
<11, 14, 19>, 
<12, 0, 10>, 
<13, 3, 5>, 
<14, 3, 11>, 
<15, 2, 7>, 
<16, 3, 4>, 
<17, 3, 8>, 
<19, 5, 11>.
