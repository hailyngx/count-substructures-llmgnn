Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
Based on the definition of a 3-star graph (center node connected to exactly three other nodes), we can identify the following 3-stars:

<7, (21, 16, 29)>
<21, (7, 28, 12)>
<23, (11, 24, 0)>
<17, (29, 27, 2)>
<29, (7, 17, 25)>
<28, (21, 13, 10)>
<9, (4, 2, 1)>
<11, (23, 24, 0)>
<13, (28, 25, 15)>
<14, (21, 26, 26)>
<19, (18, 22, 6)>
<5, (11, 0, 10)>
<3, (4, 22, 20)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
Inside brackets, I provided the final count of 3-stars in the given graph.
