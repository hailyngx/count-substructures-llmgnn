Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 14) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 9) (12, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 10, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 0, 12, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 12, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, 1, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 10, 11, 8, 13, 14, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 14, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 14, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 13, 2, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, 1, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 0, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 10, and node 5
Node 12 is connected to node 13, 2, 9, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 12
Node 14 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 5

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (10, 8, 2)>
<1, (4, 7, 2)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 9, 12)>
<4, (7, 2, 1)>
<5, (10, 11, 8)>
<6, (14, 7, 5)>
<7, (4, 14, 2)>
<8, (7, 13, 5)>
<9, (3, 1, 12)>
<10, (11, 0, 5)>
<11, (4, 10, 5)>
<12, (13, 2, 9)>
<13, (8, 5, 12)>
<14, (7, 6, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
