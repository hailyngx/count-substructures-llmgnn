Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly three neighbors. Then, we check if those neighbors are connected to each other, forming a 3-star pattern around the central node.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (4, 7, 22)>
<3, (17, 23, 28)>
<8, (0, 12, 14)>
<8, (8, 12, 16)>
<13, (6, 11, 29)>
<18, (14, 28, 18)>
<19, (10, 22, 24)>

Total number of 3-stars: [7]
