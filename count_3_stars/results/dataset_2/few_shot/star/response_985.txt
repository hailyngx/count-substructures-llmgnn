Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

A 3-star requires a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's iterate through each node in the graph and check if it satisfies the conditions of being a central node in a 3-star.

Nodes along with their respective neighbors forming 3-stars:
- <0, (6, 8, 7)>
- <1, (9, 4, 12)>
- <2, (9, 4, 14)>
- <3, (6, 7, 4)>
- <4, (9, 1, 3)>
- <5, (6, 8, 13)>
- <6, (9, 5, 3)>
- <7, (3, 11, 0)>
- <8, (10, 11, 5)>
- <9, (6, 4, 2)>
- <10, (9, 11, 8)>
- <11, (6, 10, 7)>
- <12, (1, 11, 8)>
- <13, (5, 14)>
- <14, (0, 2, 13)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
