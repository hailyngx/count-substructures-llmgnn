Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. Then, for each of these nodes, we check if they form a 3-star. Let's start by listing the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0
- Node 14
- Node 1
- Node 6
- Node 8

Next, we examine each of these nodes to determine if they form a 3-star. Note that a 3-star consists of a center node and 3 leaves connected to the center.

Examining Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 14, 13, and 2. It forms a 3-star: <0, (14, 13, 2)>.

Examining Node 14:
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 9, and 13. It forms a 3-star: <14, (0, 9, 13)>.

Examining Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 11, and 9. It forms a 3-star: <1, (6, 11, 9)>.

Examining Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 12. It forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 12)>.

Examining Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 10, and 11. However, it does not form a 3-star as it has 4 neighbors.

Therefore, the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (14, 13, 2)>, 
<14, (0, 9, 13)>, 
<1, (6, 11, 9)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 12)>.
