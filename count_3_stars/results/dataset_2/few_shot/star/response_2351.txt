Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 12) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 10)

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided.

The graph has a total of 15 nodes. To find the number of 3-stars, we need to identify each node that acts as the center of a 3-star and list the three connected nodes (leaves). 

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:  
<5, (9, 13, 11)>  
<9, (5, 11, 10)>  
<0, (10, 3, 11)>  
<14, (6, 7, 4)>  
<2, (1, 10, 0)>  
<8, (6, 12, 0)>  
<3, (11, 6, 4)>  
<12, (9, 8, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
