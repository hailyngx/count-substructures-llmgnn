Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, 2, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For Node 6:
    - <6, (0, 3, 7)>
    - <6, (4, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (0, 4, 8)>
    
2. For Node 9:
    - <9, (4, 6, 7)>

3. For Node 3:
    - <3, (0, 1, 6)>
    - <3, (1, 4, 5)>

4. For Node 4:
    - <4, (6, 8, 9)>

5. For Node 8:
    - <8, (1, 4, 6)>

6. For Node 0: 
    - No 3-star centered at Node 0.
    
7. For Node 1:
    - No 3-star centered at Node 1.
    
8. For Node 2:
    - No 3-star centered at Node 2.
    
9. For Node 5:
    - No 3-star centered at Node 5.
    
10. For Node 7:
    - No 3-star centered at Node 7.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
