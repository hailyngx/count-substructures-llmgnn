Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0

Response:
Given the connectivity information provided, we can identify the 3-star structures in the graph. 

The unique 3-star configurations in this graph are: 
<0, (6, 9, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 5)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 0)>
<4, (7, 8, 3)>

Counting the total number of 3-star structures in the graph gives us a total of [5].
