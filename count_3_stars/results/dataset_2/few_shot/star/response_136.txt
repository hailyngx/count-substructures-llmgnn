Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify each 3-star by finding all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars with that node as the center. 

Based on the given adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (10, 3, 17)>
<1, (11, 16, 23)>
<4, (5, 19, 24)>
<6, (10, 21, 17)>
<8, (26, 21, 17)>
<9, (29, 14, 12)>
<13, (27, 10, 19)>
<14, (9, 13, 12)>
<17, (6, 2, 24)>
<18, (20, 23, 8)>
<22, (25, 28, 19)>
<23, (26, 20, 11)>
<25, (20, 13, 22)>
<26, (23, 15, 8)>
<28, (11, 22, 7)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars found: 15

Therefore, the final answer is: [15]
