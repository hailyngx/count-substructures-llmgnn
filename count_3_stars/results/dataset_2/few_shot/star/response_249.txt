Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star shape. Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (9, 23, 8)>
<9, (5, 27, 13)>
<27, (9, 29, 17)>
<17, (27, 29, 18)>
<29, (27, 17, 7)>
<18, (17, 26, 19)>
<26, (18, 15, 11)>
<8, (5, 10, 0)>
<1, (24, 11, 21)>
<3, (22, 24, 10)>
<7, (29, 28, 24)>
<23, (5, 4, 14)>
<2, (19, 16, 26)>
<0, (10, 12, 5)>
<6, (18, 16, 26)>
<12, (10, 13, 27)>
<13, (27, 24, 12)>
<14, (25, 10, 23)>
<15, (26, 21, 28)>
<19, (18, 2, 16)>
<20, (22, 10, 3)>

There are a total of [21] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
