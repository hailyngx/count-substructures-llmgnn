Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 2

Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star is formed when a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided graph, we can identify the 3-stars by observing nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

Let's find the 3-stars and count them:
1. Node 0: (9, 4, 6)
2. Node 1: (5, 7, 2)
3. Node 3: (7, 1, 6)
4. Node 8: (9, 3, 2)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [4]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (9, 4, 6)>
<1, (5, 7, 2)>
<3, (7, 1, 6)>
<8, (9, 3, 2)>
