Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars:

1. <10, (11, 3, 7)>
2. <11, (10, 19, 0)>
3. <14, (10, 3, 13)>
4. <7, (10, 12, 2)>
5. <12, (11, 7, 1)>
6. <2, (7, 3, 1)>
7. <3, (10, 14, 2)>
8. <4, (18, 9, 16)>
9. <5, (6, 8, 17)>
10. <6, (5, 15, 16)>
11. <8, (5, 16, 1)>
12. <9, (4, 15, 17)>
13. <13, (14, 15, 0)>
14. <15, (6, 13, 9)>
15. <16, (6, 4, 8)>
16. <17, (5, 4, 19)>
17. <18, (11, 4, 1)>
18. <19, (11, 17, 16)>

Count of 3-stars: 18
[18]
