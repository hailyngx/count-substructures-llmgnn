Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, let's look for nodes that satisfy this condition.

- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 10. Thus, <6, (9, 5, 10)> is a 3-star.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 14. Thus, <9, (6, 8, 14)> is a 3-star.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 11, and 10. Thus, <1, (3, 11, 10)> is a 3-star.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 13. Thus, <2, (6, 8, 13)> is a 3-star.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 14, and 4. Thus, <3, (6, 14, 4)> is a 3-star.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 11, and 7. Thus, <5, (6, 11, 7)> is a 3-star.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 13, 11, and 14. Thus, <7, (13, 11, 14)> is a 3-star.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 2. Thus, <8, (9, 1, 2)> is a 3-star.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 5. Thus, <10, (6, 1, 5)> is a 3-star.

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we have a total of 9 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [9].
