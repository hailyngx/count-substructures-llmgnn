Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Starting from each node, check if there are exactly three neighbors.
2. If the node has three neighbors and those three neighbors are connected to each other through the central node, then it forms a 3-star.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- From node 0: (11, 5, 7) forms a 3-star. <0, (11, 5, 7)>
- From node 3: (5, 10, 6) forms a 3-star. <3, (5, 10, 6)> and (0, 13, 19) forms another 3-star. <3, (0, 13, 19)>
- From node 4: (7, 12, 15) forms a 3-star. <4, (7, 12, 15)>
- From node 8: (16, 19, 15) forms a 3-star. <8, (16, 19, 15)>
- From node 11: (16, 19, 18) forms a 3-star. <11, (16, 19, 18)>
- From node 12: (10, 15, 4) forms a 3-star. <12, (10, 15, 4)>
- From node 13: (0, 19, 3) forms a 3-star. <13, (0, 19, 3)>
- From node 18: (11, 9, 14) forms a 3-star. <18, (11, 9, 14)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (11, 5, 7)>
- <3, (5, 10, 6)>
- <3, (0, 13, 19)>
- <4, (7, 12, 15)>
- <8, (16, 19, 15)>
- <11, (16, 19, 18)>
- <12, (10, 15, 4)>
- <13, (0, 19, 3)>
- <18, (11, 9, 14)>
