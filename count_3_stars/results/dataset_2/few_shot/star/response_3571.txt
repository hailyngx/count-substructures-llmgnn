Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected in a 3-star pattern, where one node is the center and the other three nodes are the leaves.

From the given adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. Node 1 as the center with leaves 6, 10, and 12. This forms the 3-star <1, (6, 10, 12)>.
2. Node 6 as the center with leaves 1, 2, and 4. This forms the 3-star <6, (1, 2, 4)>.
3. Node 9 as the center with leaves 4, 10, and 13. This forms the 3-star <9, (4, 10, 13)>.
4. Node 13 as the center with leaves 8, 11, and 14. This forms the 3-star <13, (8, 11, 14)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
