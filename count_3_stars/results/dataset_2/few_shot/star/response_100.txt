Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 3

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 0, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>

All the 3-stars have been identified. There are [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
