Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (19, 6, 10)>
<1, (17, 6, 14)>
<2, (11, 8, 19)>
<3, (12, 8, 18)>
<4, (7, 9, 15)>
<5, (16, 7, 12)>
<6, (16, 1, 0)>
<7, (4, 15, 5)>
<8, (2, 9, 3)>
<9, (4, 8, 15)>
<10, (5, 0, 10)>
<11, (19, 18, 17)>
<12, (5, 16, 3)>
<13, (17, 9, 14)>
<14, (2, 1, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
