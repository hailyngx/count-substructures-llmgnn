Response:
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 0: Connected to 3 nodes (20, 21, 26)
   - Node 3:  Not connected to any other nodes.
   - Node 6: Connected to 1 node (12)
   - Node 10: Connected to 4 nodes (22, 21, 12, 18)
   - Node 11: Connected to 1 node (28)
   - Node 16: Connected to 1 node (17)
   - Node 17: Connected to 1 node (16)
   - Node 26: Connected to 3 nodes (0, 20, 2)
   
2. Count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
    - For node 0: <0, (20, 21, 26)>
    - For node 10: <10, (22, 21, 12)>
    - For node 26: <26, (0, 20, 2)>
    
3. Output the final answer inside brackets []: 
    - [3] 
    
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3.
