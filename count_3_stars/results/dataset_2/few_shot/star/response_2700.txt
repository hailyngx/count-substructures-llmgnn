Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be counted by looking at each node and identifying how many 3-stars it is a part of. A 3-star is formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and list down the 3-stars:

- <0, (9, 11, 13)>
- <1, (10, 12, 1)>
- <2, (4, 7, 14)>
- <3, (8, 11, 14)>
- <4, (2, 10, 12)>
- <5, (9, 11, 14)>
- <6, (11, 13, 14)>
- <7, (2, 4, 7)>
- <8, (3, 9, 13)>
- <9, (0, 8, 10)>
- <10, (1, 4, 8)>
- <11, (0, 5, 13)>
- <12, (1, 3, 4)>
- <13, (0, 6, 8)>
- <14, (2, 3, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars is [14].
