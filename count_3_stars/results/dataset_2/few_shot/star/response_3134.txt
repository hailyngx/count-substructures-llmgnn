Response:
Let's identify the 3-star configurations in this graph:

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (12, 14, 18)>
   
2. Node 4:
   - <4, (1, 5, 13)>
   - <4, (5, 11, 17)>
   
3. Node 5:
   - <5, (4, 8, 11)>
   
4. Node 12:
   - <12, (0, 11, 8)>
   
5. Node 14:
   - <14, (0, 7, 15)>
   
6. Node 17:
   - <17, (3, 5, 6)>
   
7. Node 18:
   - <18, (0, 10, 19)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get [7].
