Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 1

Response:
We need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's first identify the nodes that can act as centers of a 3-star:

- Node 5 is connected to 4, 6, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to 1, 4, and 8
- Node 6 is connected to 3, 5, and 7
- Node 4 is connected to 0, 5, and 7
- Node 7 is connected to 0, 1, and 6
- Node 1 is connected to 2, 7, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to 0, 1, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to 5 and 6

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
