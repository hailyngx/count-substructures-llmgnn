Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 1) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 10, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 2, 14, and node 13
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 13
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 11, 10, 9, 5, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 13, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 11, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1

Node 8 is connected to node 4, 10, 9, 5, 0, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, and node 14
Node 10 is connected to node 3, 11, 0, and node 8
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 3, 10, 5, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 3, 11, and node 8
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 1, 13, and node 9

Response:
Based on the given graph information, there are a total of 7 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (7, 3, 6)>
<1, (7, 2, 14)>
<1, (3, 13, 14)>
<3, (1, 11, 5)>
<4, (7, 8, 13)>
<7, (4, 11, 9)>
<13, (4, 1, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
