Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph by looking at each node and its neighbors.

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 11, and 7: <0, (8, 11, 7)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 2, and 9: <1, (8, 2, 9)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 3, and 14: <2, (10, 3, 14)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 6, and 4: <3, (7, 6, 4)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 3, and 9: <7, (8, 3, 9)>
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 0, and 1: <8, (13, 0, 1)>
7. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 14: <9, (0, 7, 14)>
8. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 11, and 2: <10, (13, 11, 2)>
9. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 14, and 0: <11, (10, 14, 0)>
10. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 14, and 6: <12, (8, 14, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
