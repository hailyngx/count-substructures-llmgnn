Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes one by one and identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: (0, 9, 10, 8), (0, 9, 14, 12)
- Node 1: (1, 9, 4, 11)
- Node 2: (2, 5, 9, 13), (2, 1, 6, 13)
- Node 3: No 3-stars
- Node 4: (4, 7, 9, 14)
- Node 5: No 3-stars
- Node 6: No 3-stars
- Node 7: (7, 4, 9, 14)
- Node 8: (8, 9, 11, 13), (8, 0, 12, 14)
- Node 9: (9, 7, 4, 14), (9, 8, 1, 0)
- Node 10: No 3-stars
- Node 11: No 3-stars
- Node 12: No 3-stars
- Node 13: No 3-stars
- Node 14: (14, 0, 9, 12)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (9, 10, 8)>, <0, (9, 14, 12)>, <1, (9, 4, 11)>, <2, (5, 9, 13)>, <2, (1, 6, 13)>, <4, (7, 9, 14)>, <7, (4, 9, 14)>, <8, (9, 11, 13)>, <8, (0, 12, 14)>, <9, (7, 4, 14)>, <9, (8, 1, 0)>, <14, (0, 9, 12)>.

Count of 3-stars: [11]
