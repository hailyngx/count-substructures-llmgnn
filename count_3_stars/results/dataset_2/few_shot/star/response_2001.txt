Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the central node of each potential 3-star by checking nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. Then, we will check if the neighbors of the central node are indeed connected to each other forming a 3-star pattern. 

Based on the provided adjacency list, the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors are nodes 0, 3, and 8. We will now check the connections to determine which of these nodes form 3-stars. 

- For node 0:
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 8. Let's check if nodes 2 and 8 are connected to each other: 
        - Nodes 2 and 8 are connected to each other, so <0, (2, 8)> is a 3-star.

- For node 3:
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 1. Let's check if nodes 4 and 1 are connected to each other:
        - Nodes 4 and 1 are connected to each other, so <3, (4, 1)> is a 3-star.

- For node 8:
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 5, and 2. Let's check the connections between these nodes:
        - Nodes 7 and 5 are connected to each other and to node 8, forming a 3-star. So, <8, (7, 5, 2)> is a 3-star.

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 8)>, <3, (4, 1)>, and <8, (7, 5, 2)>.
