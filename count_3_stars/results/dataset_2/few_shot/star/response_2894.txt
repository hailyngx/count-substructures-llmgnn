Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 11, 14, 13, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 10, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 12, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 12
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 10, 4, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 3
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 0, 8, 4, and node 13
Node 11 is connected to node 3, 10, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 11, and node 7
Node 13 is connected to node 3, 10, and node 0

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 10, and 14: <0, (1, 10, 14)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 3, and 6: <1, (5, 3, 6)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 4: <2, (5, 8, 4)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 11, and 14: <3, (9, 11, 14)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 10, and 2: <4, (5, 10, 2)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 12, and 4: <5, (2, 12, 4)>
7. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 10, and 4: <8, (9, 10, 4)>
8. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 0, and 13: <10, (11, 0, 13)>
9. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 11, and 7: <12, (5, 11, 7)>
10. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 10, and 0: <13, (3, 10, 0)>
11. Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 0: <14, (1, 3, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
