Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 8) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 12) (5, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 2) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 11, 8, 12, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 11, 14, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, 9, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 14, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 12, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 14
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 11, 13, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 10, and node 2
Node 10 is connected to node 1, 11, 13, 9, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 10, 0, 8, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 11, 5, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 10, and node 8
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 3, 10, 5, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From the adjacency list, we can see that the 3-star centered at node 1 has leaves 3, 11, and 14: <1, (3, 11, 14)>
- The 3-star centered at node 3 has leaves 4, 2, and 9: <3, (4, 2, 9)>
- The 3-star centered at node 10 has leaves 1, 13, and 9: <10, (1, 13, 9)>
- The 3-star centered at node 11 has leaves 0, 8, and 12: <11, (0, 8, 12)>
- The 3-star centered at node 14 has leaves 5, 6, and 10: <14, (5, 6, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
