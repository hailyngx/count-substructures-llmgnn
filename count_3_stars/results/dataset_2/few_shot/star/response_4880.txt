Response:
Let's find the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (7, 1, 13)>
2. <1, (4, 12, 0)>
3. <2, (9, 7, 14)>
4. <3, (4)>
5. <4, (8, 12, 10)>
6. <5, (7, 14, 13)>
7. <6, (7, 10, 11)>
8. <8, (6, 4, 14)>
9. <9, (2, 14, 10)>
10. <11, (6, 8, 14)>
11. <12, (9, 4, 10)>
12. <13, (6, 9, 5)>
13. <14, (9, 8, 11)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [13]
