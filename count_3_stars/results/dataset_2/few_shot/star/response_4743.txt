Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 6, 0, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph based on the information provided.

1. Identify 3-stars:
- We need to find nodes that are connected in a star pattern with a central node and three leaves.
- Since a 3-star has exactly 4 nodes (1 central node and 3 leaf nodes), we will look for such configurations in the given graph.

2. Count the 3-stars:
From the given adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 6: <4, (5, 9, 6)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 1: <8, (9, 3, 1)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 7: <6, (5, 4, 7)>
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 7: <0, (9, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 7: <2, (9, 4, 7)>

3. Final count:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph as identified above.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

Final Answer: [5]
