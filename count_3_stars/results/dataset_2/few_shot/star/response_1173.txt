Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of instances where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star. Let's count the number of such occurrences. 

The node with its adjacent nodes that form a 3-star are as follows:
- Node 1: (29, 24, 12)
- Node 6: (9, 26, 16)
- Node 9: (6, 8, 24)
- Node 12: (1, 10, 29)
- Node 13: (8, 16, 24)
- Node 14: (21, 3, 25)
- Node 15: (11, 10, 22)
- Node 16: (6, 13, 26)
- Node 17: (4, 11, 5)
- Node 19: (29, 7, 14)
- Node 20: (8, 24, 1)
- Node 22: (4, 11, 15)
- Node 23: (21, 26, 5)
- Node 24: (1, 9, 13)
- Node 28: (18, 11, 22)
- Node 29: (1, 12, 19)

Hence, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
