Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (9, 6, 11)>
<1, (3, 2, 19)>
<2, (1, 8, 18)>
<3, (16, 5, 1)>
<4, (13, 18, 11)>
<5, (19, 12, 3)>
<6, (11, 3, 0)>
<7, (5, 8, 10)>
<8, (2, 7, 18)>
<9, (15, 14, 0)>
<10, (7, 2, 18)>
<11, (16, 19, 13)>
<12, (5, 17, 18)>
<13, (11, 4, 18)>
<14, (9, 15, 0)>
<15, (16, 9, 17)>
<16, (11, 15, 3)>
<17, (12, 15, 18)>
<18, (16, 3, 2)>
<19, (11, 5, 1)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [19] 3-stars in the given graph.
