Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, 6, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern). 

By examining the given graph details, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (3, 6, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

This solution describes the step-by-step process of identifying and counting the 3-stars in the graph.
