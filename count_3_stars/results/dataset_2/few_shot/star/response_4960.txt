Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list, the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0 connects to nodes 12, 6
- Node 1 connects to node 13
- Node 2 connects to nodes 8, 6, 10
- Node 3 connects to node 4
- Node 4 connects to nodes 3, 8, 12, 6, 17
- Node 5 connects to nodes 9, 17, 15
- Node 6 connects to nodes 4, 2, 0, 15
- Node 7 connects to nodes 8, 12, 15, 14
- Node 8 connects to nodes 4, 2, 12, 7
- Node 9 connects to node 5
- Node 10 connects to nodes 12, 2, 19
- Node 11 connects to nodes 16, 14, 19, 17
- Node 12 connects to nodes 4, 8, 7, 10, 0
- Node 13 connects to nodes 1, 15
- Node 14 connects to nodes 11, 7, 19
- Node 15 connects to nodes 5, 7, 6, 13
- Node 16 connects to nodes 11, 19
- Node 17 connects to nodes 11, 5, 4, 18
- Node 18 connects to node 17
- Node 19 connects to nodes 11, 16, 14, 10

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<4, (3, 8, 12)>
<15, (5, 7, 6)>
<11, (16, 14, 19)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
