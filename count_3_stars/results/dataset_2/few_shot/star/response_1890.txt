Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<1, (11, 3, 6)>
<3, (15, 0, 1)>
<4, (8, 12, 9)>
<6, (1, 17, 14)>
<7, (10, 12, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 17)>
<11, (16, 10, 1)>
<12, (11, 4, 7)>
<13, (5, 17, 13)>
<14, (3, 18, 19)>
<15, (3, 0, 2)>
<16, (11, 0, 5)>
<17, (12, 13, 6)>
<19, (1, 14, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [14].
