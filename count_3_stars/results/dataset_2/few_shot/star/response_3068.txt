Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

Looking at the adjacency list, the possible central nodes are 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5 since these nodes have a degree of 4 or less. We can now analyze each central node to find the 3-stars.

For central node 0:
- <0, (9, 11, 7)> is a 3-star centered at node 0.
- <0, (9, 14, 2)> is a 3-star centered at node 0.

For central node 1:
- <1, (11, 7, 12)> is a 3-star centered at node 1.
- <1, (11, 8, 2)> is a 3-star centered at node 1.

For central node 3:
- <3, (6, 8, 14)> is a 3-star centered at node 3.
- <3, (6, 13, 12)> is a 3-star centered at node 3.
- <3, (8, 13, 14)> is a 3-star centered at node 3.

For central node 4:
- There is no 3-star centered at node 4.

For central node 5:
- There is no 3-star centered at node 5.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 11, 7)>
<0, (9, 14, 2)>
<1, (11, 7, 12)>
<1, (11, 8, 2)>
<3, (6, 8, 14)>
<3, (6, 13, 12)>
<3, (8, 13, 14)>
