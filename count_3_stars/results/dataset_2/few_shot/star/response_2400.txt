Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 9, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, 0, and node 4

Response:
First, we need to find all possible 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star is formed when a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and check if they form a 3-star.

Starting from each node:
- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 2. <0, (5, 6, 2)>
- Node 1: Does not form a 3-star as it has 4 connections.
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4. <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 3: Does not form a 3-star as it has 3 connections but not in the right configuration.
- Node 4: Does not form a 3-star as it has 4 connections.
- Node 5: Does not form a 3-star as it has 5 connections.
- Node 6: Does not form a 3-star as it has 3 connections but not in the right configuration.
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5. <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 8: Does not form a 3-star as it has 2 connections.
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 4. <9, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are: 
<0, (5, 6, 2)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>.

Counting all unique 3-stars, we find a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
