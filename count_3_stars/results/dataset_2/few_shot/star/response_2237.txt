Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where there is a node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the different 3-stars:

<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 0, 2)>
<8, (9, 4, 7)>
<9, (8, 4, 2)>

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
