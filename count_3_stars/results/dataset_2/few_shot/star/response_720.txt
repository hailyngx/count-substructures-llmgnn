Response:
Step 1: Identify Nodes with Exactly 3 Neighbors
Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are ideal candidates for the central node of a 3-star. Here are the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 7, 6, and 13.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 10 has 1 neighbor.

Step 2: Create 3-Stars
1. For Node 18:
   - <18, (7, 6, 13)>
   - <18, (7, 6, 15)>

2. For Node 3:
   - No 3-star can be formed as it only has 1 neighbor.

3. For Node 10:
   - No 3-star can be formed as it only has 1 neighbor.

Step 3: Count the Total Number of 3-Stars
- Total number of 3-stars = 2

[Total number of 3-stars: 2]

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
