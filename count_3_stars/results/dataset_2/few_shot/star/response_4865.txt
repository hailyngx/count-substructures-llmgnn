Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, 2, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<6, (1, 7, 4)>
<6, (8, 9, 4)>
<6, (4, 7, 1)>
<6, (8, 7, 1)>
<9, (8, 1, 4)>
<9, (4, 1, 7)>
<9, (1, 8, 6)>
<4, (6, 9, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (6, 4, 0)>
<7, (4, 6, 1)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 3, 5)>
<8, (6, 1, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 4)>
<8, (6, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 2, 3)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
