Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 7, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-stars:

<1, (9, 3, 2)>
<3, (6, 1, 7)>
<6, (9, 3, 8)>
<8, (6, 9, 1)>
<9, (6, 8, 2)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above gives us a total of [5].
