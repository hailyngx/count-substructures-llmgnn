Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 14) (6, 15) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 2) (3, 17) (3, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 16) (7, 2) (16, 5) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 10) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 7) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 0) (17, 9) (17, 3) (11, 5) (11, 1) (19, 16) (19, 0) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 15)

Node 14 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 15
Node 15 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 7, and node 14
Node 16 is connected to node 5, 7, 19, and node 10
Node 17 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 18 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 19 is connected to node 16, and node 0

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can find the 3-stars by identifying the central node and its three connected nodes. Let's go ahead and list the unique 3-stars:

<5, (9, 8, 11)>
<9, (5, 17, 14)>
<13, (8, 4, 2)>
<15, (5, 6, 1)>
<16, (5, 7, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
