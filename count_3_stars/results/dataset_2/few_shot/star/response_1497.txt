Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 6, and 1: <5, (9, 6, 1)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 7: <9, (5, 8, 7)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 0, and 1: <4, (8, 0, 1)>
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 3, and 1: <7, (9, 3, 1)>
5. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 1, and 6: <2, (9, 1, 6)>
6. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 1, and 2: <6, (5, 1, 2)>
7. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 6: <8, (9, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
