Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that can be the central node of a 3-star. A central node must be connected to exactly three other nodes.
  - Nodes 4, 5, 7, and 8 meet this criteria.

Step 2: For each central node, identify the unique 3-stars.
  - For node 4:
    - <4, (9, 7, 0)>
    - <4, (9, 6, 3)>
  - For node 5:
    - <5, (9, 8, 3)>
  - For node 7:
    - <7, (6, 4, 1)>
  - For node 8:
    - <8, (5, 6, 2)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
  - Total = 4

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
