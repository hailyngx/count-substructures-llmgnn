Response:
We can count the number of 3-stars by examining each node and its neighbors to see if there are any 3-stars centered at that node. A 3-star centered at a node consists of the center node and the three nodes it is connected to.

Let's go through each node and identify any 3-stars:

- For Node 0, there is a 3-star: <0, (3, 10, 2)>
- For Node 1, there are no 3-stars centered at Node 1.
- For Node 2, there is a 3-star: <2, (11, 13, 7)>
- For Node 3, there is no 3-star centered at Node 3.
- Node 4 does not have any 3-stars.
- For Node 5, there is a 3-star: <5, (1, 6, 13)>
- For Node 6, there is no 3-star centered at Node 6.
- For Node 7, there are two 3-stars: <7, (1, 8, 13)> and <7, (9, 14, 2)>
- For Node 8, there is one 3-star: <8, (11, 4, 6)>
- Node 9 does not have any 3-stars.
- For Node 10, there is one 3-star: <10, (11, 0, 12)>
- Node 11 does not have any 3-stars.
- For Node 12, there is a 3-star: <12, (10, 4, 5)>
- For Node 13, there is no 3-star centered at Node 13.
- For Node 14, there is a 3-star: <14, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (3, 10, 2)>
<2, (11, 13, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 13)>
<7, (1, 8, 13)>
<7, (9, 14, 2)>
<8, (11, 4, 6)>
<10, (11, 0, 12)>
