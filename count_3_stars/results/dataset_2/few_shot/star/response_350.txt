Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all possible occurrences of 3-stars. 

From the adjacency list provided, we can see that the nodes that are directly connected to each node. Let's list out the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (9, 2, 6)>
<1, (3, 8, 7)>
<2, (4, 0, -)>
<3, (5, 1, 7)>
<4, (5, 1, 2)>
<5, (9, 8, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (5, 9, 1)>
<8, (5, 1, 3)>
<9, (5, 7, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
