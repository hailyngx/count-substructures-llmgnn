Node 6 is connected to node 3, 10, 8, 13, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 11, 10, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 11, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 2, 0, 14, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 12, and node 13
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 12 is connected to node 10, 0, 13, 6, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 10, 2, 5, 12, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 2, 0, and node 9

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves as follows:
- Central node 0: Leaves (4, 14, 12)
- Central node 1: Leaves (7, 3, 14)
- Central node 2: Leaves (9, 13, 14)
- Central node 3: Leaves (1, 6, 8)
- Central node 4: Leaves (0, 10, 11)
- Central node 5: Leaves (1, 8, 13)
- Central node 6: Leaves (3, 10, 8), (6, 13, 12)
- Central node 7: Leaves (11, 10, 9)
- Central node 8: Leaves (3, 11, 5)
- Central node 9: Leaves (7, 2, 0), (9, 14, 12)
- Central node 10: Leaves (4, 7, 6), (10, 13, 12)
- Central node 11: Leaves (4, 7, 8)
- Central node 12: Leaves (10, 0, 13), (12, 6, 9)
- Central node 13: Leaves (10, 2, 5), (13, 6, 12)
- Central node 14: Leaves (1, 2, 0)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 14, 12)>
<1, (7, 3, 14)>
<2, (9, 13, 14)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 10, 11)>
<5, (1, 8, 13)>
<6, (3, 10, 8), (6, 13, 12)>
<7, (11, 10, 9)>
<8, (3, 11, 5)>
<9, (7, 2, 0), (9, 14, 12)>
<10, (4, 7, 6), (10, 13, 12)>
<11, (4, 7, 8)>
<12, (10, 0, 13), (12, 6, 9)>
<13, (10, 2, 5), (13, 6, 12)>
<14, (1, 2, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
