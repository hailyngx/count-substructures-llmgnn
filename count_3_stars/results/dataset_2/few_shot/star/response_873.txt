Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all the 3-star configurations. A 3-star consists of a central node and three other nodes that are connected to the central node but not directly connected to each other. 

Upon examining the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-star configurations:
- <0, (4, 1, 14)>
- <1, (5, 11, 12)>
- <2, (9, 0, 6)>
- <3, (9, 7, *)> (Node 3 is connected to node 9 and node 7, and it can connect to any other node for the 3rd point in the star)
- <4, (9, 7, 6)>
- <5, (9, 1, 7)>
- <6, (4, 8, 11)>
- <7, (5, 4, 3)>
- <8, (9, 7, 6)>
- <9, (5, 8, 4)>
- <10, (9, 14, 2)>
- <11, (5, 1, 6)>
- <12, (1, 8, 14)>
- <13, (0, 10, 6)>
- <14, (0, 12, 10)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-star configurations in the given graph.
