Response:
Let's count the number of 3-star configurations in the given graph. 

From the adjacency list, we can identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

1. Central node: 0
    Leaves: 4, 7, 8
    <0, (4, 7, 8)>

2. Central node: 1
    Leaves: 5, 11, 9
    <1, (5, 11, 9)>

3. Central node: 2
    Leaves: 5, 6, 14
    <2, (5, 6, 14)>

4. Central node: 3
    Leaves: 5, 6, 12
    <3, (5, 6, 12)>
    <3, (5, 8, 9)>
    
5. Central node: 4
    Leaves: 7
    <4, (7, 0, 0)>

6. Central node: 5
    Leaves: 6, 13, 2
    <5, (6, 13, 2)>
    <5, (6, 11, 3)>
    
7. Central node: 6
    Leaves: 10
    <6, (10, 6, 8)>

8. Central node: 7
    Leaves: 14, 13
    <7, (14, 13, 0)>
    
9. Central node: 8
    Leaves: 12, 14, 10
    <8, (12, 14, 3)>

10. Central node: 9
    Leaves: 13, 1, 14
    <9, (13, 1, 14)>

Total number of 3-stars: 10
