Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. Let's start by looking at each node's connections to see which nodes form 3-stars.

- For Node 0: Not part of any 3-star.
- For Node 1: <1, (15, 4, 21)>
- For Node 2: Not part of any 3-star.
- For Node 3: <3, (26, 17, 29)>
- For Node 4: <4, (1, 10, 16)>
- For Node 5: <5, (22, 25, 10)>
- For Node 6: <6, (24, 23, 12)>
- For Node 7: Not part of any 3-star.
- For Node 8: Not part of any 3-star.
- For Node 9: <9, (26, 24, 29)>
- For Node 10: <10, (22, 4, 8)>
- For Node 11: Not part of any 3-star.
- For Node 12: Not part of any 3-star.
- For Node 13: Not part of any 3-star.
- For Node 14: Not part of any 3-star.
- For Node 15: <15, (1, 21, 19)>
- For Node 16: Not part of any 3-star.
- For Node 17: <17, (29, 3, 26)>
- For Node 18: <18, (22, 2, 8)>
- For Node 19: Not part of any 3-star.
- For Node 20: Not part of any 3-star.
- For Node 21: Not part of any 3-star.
- For Node 22: <22, (18, 5, 10)>
- For Node 23: <23, (21, 6, 5)>
- For Node 24: <24, (9, 28, 16)>
- For Node 25: Not part of any 3-star.
- For Node 26: <26, (9, 29, 16)>
- For Node 27: <27, (22, 29, 3)>
- For Node 28: Not part of any 3-star.
- For Node 29: <29, (26, 17, 27)>

After identifying all the 3-stars, we count the unique ones:

<1, (15, 4, 21)>, <3, (26, 17, 29)>, <4, (1, 10, 16)>, <5, (22, 25, 10)>, <6, (24, 23, 12)>, <9, (26, 24, 29)>, <10, (22, 4, 8)>, <15, (1, 21, 19)>, <17, (29, 3, 26)>, <18, (22, 2, 8)>, <22, (18, 5, 10)>, <23, (21, 6, 5)>, <24, (9, 28, 16)>, <26, (9, 29, 16)>, <27, (22, 29, 3)>, <29, (26, 17, 27)>

Count: [16]
