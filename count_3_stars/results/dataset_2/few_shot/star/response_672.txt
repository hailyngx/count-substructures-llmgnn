Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify all the possible 3-star structures in the graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (9, 4, 1)> <br>
2. Node 2: <2, (7, 1, 6)> <br>
3. Node 3: <3, (5, 7, 0)> <br>
4. Node 4: <4, (5, 7, 8)> <br>
5. Node 6: <6, (4, 7, 3)> <br>
6. Node 8: <8, (9, 4, 2)> <br>
7. Node 9: <9, (8, 7, 0)> <br>

Now count the total number of 3-stars: [7].
