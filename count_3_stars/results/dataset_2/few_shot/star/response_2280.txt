Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 1

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
  - From the adjacency list, we can see that Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 0, and 3. This forms a 3-star with Node 5 as the center and nodes 9, 6, and 0 as the leaves. <5, (9, 6, 0)>
  - Similarly, Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 0, and 3. This forms a 3-star with Node 4 as the center and nodes 7, 8, and 0 as the leaves. <4, (7, 8, 0)>
  - Also, Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 8. This forms a 3-star with Node 1 as the center and nodes 9, 3, and 8 as the leaves. <1, (9, 3, 8)>
  - Two separate 3-stars are formed by Node 2: <2, (4, 3, 8)> and <2, (7, 0, 3)>
  - Finally, Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 0, forming the 3-star <6, (5, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
