Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the unique 3-stars.

From the provided adjacency list, we can determine the following 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (3, 2, 9)>
2. <1, (17, 15, 8)>
3. <2, (13, 7, 0)>
4. <3, (0, 17, 4)>
5. <4, (11, 3, 18)>
6. <5, (10, 15)>
7. <6, (11, 17)>
8. <7, (2, 14)>
9. <8, (1, 13, 9)>
10. <9, (10, 8, 18)>
11. <10, (11, 12, 9)>
12. <11, (10, 19, 6)>
13. <12, (10, 14)>
14. <13, (16, 8, 2)>
15. <14, (13, 12, 7)>
16. <15, (1, 18, 19, 5)>
17. <16, (13)>
18. <17, (1, 3, 6)>
19. <18, (4, 9, 15)>
20. <19, (11, 8, 15)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars from the list above gives us a total count of 20.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
