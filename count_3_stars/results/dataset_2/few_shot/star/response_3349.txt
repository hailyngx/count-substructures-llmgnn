Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the unique 3-stars in the graph.

In this graph, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down all possible 3-stars:

<3, (4, 0, 2)>
<8, (17, 19, 5)>
<11, (7, 17, 5)>
<16, (6, 18, 13)>

Now, we can count the total number of 3-stars by counting the occurrences of each unique 3-star:

Total number of 3-stars: [4]
