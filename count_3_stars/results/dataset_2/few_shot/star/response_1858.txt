Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's first identify the central node and leaves for each potential 3-star based on the edges provided:

- For node 0: <0, (14, 2, 10)>
- For node 2: <2, (0, 5, 17)>
- For node 3: <3, (17, 8, 13)>
- For node 4: <4, (8, 12, 10)>
- For node 5: <5, (17, 13, 19)>
- For node 6: <6, (9, 7, 16)>
- For node 7: <7, (6, 11, 19)>
- For node 8: <8, (4, 3, 13)>
- For node 9: <9, (6, 15, -)>
- For node 10: <10, (4, 0, 5)>
- For node 11: <11, (6, 14, 7)>
- For node 12: <12, (17, 13, 4)>
- For node 13: <13, (5, 12, 3)>
- For node 14: <14, (0, 11, -)>
- For node 15: <15, (9, 13, 12)>
- For node 16: <16, (6, 18, -)>
- For node 17: <17, (3, 12, 5)>
- For node 18: <18, (7, 3, 15)>
- For node 19: <19, (7, 5, -)>

Now, we have listed all the unique 3-stars. By counting these, we can find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.

The number of 3-stars in the graph is: [18]
