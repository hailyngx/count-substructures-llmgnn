Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars:

1. Consider each node one by one and check if it is the center of a 3-star.
2. For each node, identify its neighbors and see if there are any pairs of neighbors that are also connected. If such pairs exist, the node is the center of a 3-star.
3. List down all unique 3-stars found.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (6, 3, 9)>
<1, (15, 6, 9)>
<2, (10, 5, 11)>
<3, (19, 14, 0)>
<4, (8, 5, 16)>
<5, (17, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 0, 15)>
<7, (13, 10, 5)>
<8, (13, 4, 14)>
<9, (1, 11, 0)>
<10, (17, 7, 2)>
<11, (19, 2, 9)>
<12, (8, 17, 18)>
<13, (8, 15, 7)>
<14, (8, 3, 19)>
<15, (13, 1, 16)>
<16, (4, 15, 18)>
<17, (10, 12, 5)>
<18, (12, 16, 3)>
<19, (11, 3, 14)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [19].
