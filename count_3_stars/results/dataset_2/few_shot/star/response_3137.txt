Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
    - Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
    - Node 14 has 1 neighbor.
  
2. Identify nodes that are the center of a 3-star:
    - Node 0 is the center of 2 3-stars: <0, (7, 10, 15)> and <0, (7, 11, 12)>
    - Node 1 is the center of 1 3-star: <1, (10, 12, 16)>
    - Node 2 is the center of 1 3-star: <2, (7, 6, 8)>
    - Node 3 is the center of 1 3-star: <3, (8, 9, 17)>
    - Node 5 is the center of 1 3-star: <5, (7, 12, 16)>
    - Node 6 is the center of 1 3-star: <6, (7, 8, 13)>
    - Node 8 is the center of 1 3-star: <8, (3, 6, 13)>
    - Node 11 is the center of 1 3-star: <11, (0, 9, 18)>
    - Node 16 is the center of 1 3-star: <16, (1, 14, 15)>
    - Node 17 is the center of 1 3-star: <17, (9, 18, 19)>
  
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
   - Total number of unique 3-stars: 10
   
So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 10, 15)>, <0, (7, 11, 12)>, <1, (10, 12, 16)>, <2, (7, 6, 8)>, <3, (8, 9, 17)>, <5, (7, 12, 16)>, <6, (7, 8, 13)>, <8, (3, 6, 13)>, <11, (0, 9, 18)>, <16, (1, 14, 15)>
