Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 5, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 9, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 2

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 1, and 3: <0, (7, 1, 3)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 9: <1, (5, 7, 9)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and 0: <2, (6, 9, 0)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 8: <3, (4, 7, 8)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 5, and 6: <4, (7, 5, 6)>
6. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 1: <7, (0, 5, 1)>
7. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 1, and 2: <9, (6, 1, 2)>

So, there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
