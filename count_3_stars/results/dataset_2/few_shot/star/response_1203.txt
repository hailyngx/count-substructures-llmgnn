Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each possible 3-star pattern, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list out the unique 3-stars we can find in the graph:
<2, (10, 17, 12)>
<3, (10, 5, 19)>
<4, (18, 5, 13)>
<5, (4, 13, 3)>
<10, (15, 19, 2)>
  
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
