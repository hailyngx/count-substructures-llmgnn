Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- From node 0: <0, (9, 1, 4)>
- From node 1: <1, (5, 3, 4)>
- From node 7: <7, (5, 6, 4)>
- From node 8: <8, (9, 2, 0)>
- From node 2: <2, (6, 8, -)>
- From node 3: <3, (9, 6, 1)>
- From node 4: <4, (6, 1, 7)>
- From node 5: <5, (6, 1, 7)>
- From node 6: <6, (5, 9, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
