Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

By examining the adjacency list for each node, we can see that the central nodes along with their connected leaves are as follows:
- Node 0: (9, 1, 3) -> <0, (9, 1, 3)>
- Node 1: (5, 6, 0) -> <1, (5, 6, 0)>
- Node 2: (9, 3, 8) -> <2, (9, 3, 8)>
- Node 3: No 3-star
- Node 4: (5, 9, 6) -> <4, (5, 9, 6)>
- Node 5: (9, 6, 1) -> <5, (9, 6, 1)>
- Node 6: (5, 1, 7) and (4, 8) -> <6, (5, 1, 7)> and <6, (4, 8)>
- Node 7: No 3-star
- Node 8: (6, 3, 2) -> <8, (6, 3, 2)>
- Node 9: (5, 4, 2) -> <9, (5, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
