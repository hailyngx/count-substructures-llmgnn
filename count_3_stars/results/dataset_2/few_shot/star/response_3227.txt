Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For each node, check if it is the center of a 3-star pattern.
2. If a node is the center, list the adjacent nodes as leaves to identify the 3-star.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (16, 6, 5)>
<2, (7)>
<3, (16, 13, 9)>
<4, (11, 9, 13)>
<6, (15, 17, 9)>
<8, (16, 13, 18)>
<9, (3, 14, 6)>
<13, (3, 8, 12)>
<15, (0, 6, 12)>
<16, (11, 1, 3)>
<17, (6, 12, 5)>
<18, (8, 19, 0)>
<19, (11, 14, 18)>

There are 13 unique 3-stars found in the given graph. So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
