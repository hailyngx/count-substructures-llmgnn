Response:
Let's find the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

1. Node 5:
    - (5, 9, 14)
    - (5, 8, 14)
    - (5, 0, 14)
    
2. Node 9:
    - (9, 5, 0)
    - (9, 5, 14)
    - (9, 5, 8)
    
3. Node 0:
    - (0, 5, 13)
    - (0, 5, 7)
    - (0, 5, 9)
    
4. Node 11:
    - (11, 1, 4)
    - (11, 1, 7)
    - (11, 7, 12)
    
5. Node 2:
    - (2, 3, 13)
    - (2, 3, 12)
    - (2, 3, 4)

6. Node 8:
    - (8, 5, 13)
    - (8, 5, 6)
    - (8, 5, 10)

7. Node 12:
    - (12, 8, 10)
    - (12, 8, 11)
    - (12, 8, 2)

8. Node 13:
    - (13, 0, 2)
    - (13, 0, 8)

9. Node 14:
    - (14, 5, 9)
    - (14, 5, 7)
    - (14, 5, 4)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16]. 
The unique 3-stars are <5, (9, 14, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 14)>, <0, (5, 13, 7)>, <11, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 13, 12)>, <8, (5, 13, 6)>, <12, (8, 10, 11)>, <13, (0, 2, 8)>, and <14, (5, 9, 7)>.
