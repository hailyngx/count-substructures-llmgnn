Response:
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. For each node, identify the neighbors it is connected to:

- Node 0: {11, 1}
- Node 1: {6, 16, 0}
- Node 2: {9, 11, 18, 6}
- Node 3: {5, 14}
- Node 4: {11, 18, 12, 6, 17}
- Node 5: {9, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 1}
- Node 7: {5, 13, 10, 18, 15}
- Node 8: {12}
- Node 9: {5, 2, 13}
- Node 10: {13, 11, 7, 14}
- Node 11: {10, 0, 4, 2}
- Node 12: {8, 13, 4, 19}
- Node 13: {9, 12, 10, 7}
- Node 14: {10, 15, 3}
- Node 15: {7, 14}
- Node 16: {18, 1}
- Node 17: {4}
- Node 18: {2, 4, 16, 7}
- Node 19: {12}

2. For each node, count the number of 3-stars it is a part of:

- Node 0: 0
- Node 1: 1
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 4
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 0
- Node 10: 1
- Node 11: 0
- Node 12: 1
- Node 13: 1
- Node 14: 2
- Node 15: 0
- Node 16: 0
- Node 17: 0
- Node 18: 2
- Node 19: 0

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

- <1, (6, 16, 0)>
- <4, (18, 17, 6)>
- <4, (11, 12, 18)>
- <4, (6, 17, 18)>
- <7, (15, 10, 14)>
- <7, (18, 13, 10)>
- <12, (8, 19, 13)>

Thus, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [7].
