Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible combinations where a node is at the center and is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph along with their central node and connected nodes:
<0, (16, 19, 8)>
<1, (9, 4, 1)>
<2, (4)>
<3, (15, 10, 12)>
<4, (14, 15, 1)>
<5, (11, 8, 17)>
<6, (10, 13, 6)>
<7, (9, 12, 7)>
<8, (16, 5, 18)>
<9, (8, 1, 7)>
<10, (17, 3, 15)>
<11, (16, 5, 0)>
<12, (16, 3, 7)>
<13, (12, 6, 18)>
<14, (17, 18, 4)>
<15, (3, 10, 4)>
<16, (11, 0, 12)>
<17, (5, 14, 10)>
<18, (14, 8, 13)>
<19, (8, 0, 19)>

Count of 3-stars: [20]
