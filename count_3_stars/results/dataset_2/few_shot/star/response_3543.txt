Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the possible 3-stars formed by the nodes based on the given information. 

1. Node 0: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to only one node. 

2. Node 1: Possible 3-stars:
   - <1, (4, 12, 16)>
   
3. Node 2: Possible 3-stars:
   - <2, (8, 13, 6)>
   - <2, (8, 14, 6)>
   - <2, (13, 15, 7)>
   - <2, (13, 5, 14)>
   
4. Node 3: Possible 3-stars:
   - <3, (12, 0, 16)>
   
5. Node 4: Possible 3-stars:
   - <4, (12, 1, 19)>
   - <4, (12, 3, 19)>
   - <4, (2, 12, 19)>
   
6. Node 5: Possible 3-stars:
   - <5, (13, 14, 11)>
   
7. Node 6: Possible 3-stars:
   - <6, (2, 7, 16)>
   
8. Node 7: Possible 3-stars:
   - <7, (11, 13, 6)>
   
9. Node 8: Possible 3-stars:
   - <8, (2, 13, 5)>
   
10. Node 9: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to only one node. 

11. Node 10: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to only two nodes.

12. Node 11: Possible 3-stars:
    - <11, (14, 7, 13)>
    
13. Node 12: Possible 3-stars:
    - <12, (4, 19, 1)>
    
14. Node 13: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to only three nodes.

15. Node 14: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to only three nodes.

16. Node 15: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to only two nodes.

17. Node 16: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to only three nodes.

18. Node 17: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to only three nodes.

19. Node 18: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to only two nodes.

20. Node 19: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to only three nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 12, 16)>, <2, (8, 13, 6)>, <2, (8, 14, 6)>, <2, (13, 15, 7)>, <2, (13, 5, 14)>, <3, (12, 0, 16)>, <4, (12, 1, 19)>, <5, (13, 14, 11)>, <6, (2, 7, 16)>, <11, (14, 7, 13)>
