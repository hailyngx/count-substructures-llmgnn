Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<2, (5, 9, 3)>
<5, (9, 2, 6)>
<7, (4, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
