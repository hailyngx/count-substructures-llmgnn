Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 11, 16, and 8 form a 3-star with central node 16 and leaves 11 and 8. <16, (11, 8)>
- Similarly, nodes 8, 17, and 9 form a 3-star with central node 8 and leaves 17 and 9. <8, (17, 9)>
- Also, nodes 5, 19, and 1 form a 3-star with central node 5 and leaves 19 and 1. <5, (19, 1)>
- Nodes 6, 18, and 8 form a 3-star with central node 8 and leaves 18 and 6. <8, (18, 6)>
- Lastly, nodes 4, 15, and 12 form a 3-star with central node 15 and leaves 4 and 12. <15, (4, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
