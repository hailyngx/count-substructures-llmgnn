Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the provided information step by step:

1. First, we identify the nodes that are central nodes in 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

- Node 3 is connected to 15, 0, and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to 15, 9, and 0.
- Node 1 is connected to 6, 5, and 18.
- Node 5 is connected to 1, 10, and 13.
- Node 6 is connected to 9, 1, and 17.
- Node 10 is connected to 15, 5, and 16.
- Node 12 is connected to 7, 17, and 8.
- Node 13 is connected to 5, 16, and 18.
- Node 14 is connected to 8, 18, and 16.
- Node 18 is connected to 1, 13, and 19.

2. Now, we construct the list of unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (15, 0, 2)>
<7, (15, 9, 0)>
<1, (6, 5, 18)>
<5, (1, 10, 13)>
<6, (9, 1, 17)>
<10, (15, 5, 16)>
<12, (7, 17, 8)>
<13, (5, 16, 18)>
<14, (8, 18, 16)>
<18, (1, 13, 19)>

3. Finally, we count the number of unique 3-stars:
