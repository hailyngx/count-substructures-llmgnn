Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 10, and 13, forming a 3-star <1, (3, 10, 13)>.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 14, and 6, forming a 3-star <3, (1, 14, 6)>.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 8, forming a 3-star <4, (1, 8)>.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 19, forming a 3-star <6, (3, 7, 19)>.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 16, and 15, forming a 3-star <8, (4, 16, 15)>.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 18, and 0, forming a 3-star <11, (9, 18, 0)>.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 13, 17, and 18, forming a 3-star <12, (13, 17, 18)>.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 15, forming a 3-star <14, (3, 15)>.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 6, 19, and 15, forming a 3-star <16, (6, 19, 15)>.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 5, 8, forming a 3-star <17, (5, 8)>.

So, there are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the output is [10].
