Response:
We first identify the central node of each potential 3-star, which should have exactly three neighbors. Then we check if those three neighbors are also connected to each other. 

Let's go through the nodes and identify the 3-stars:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 9, 1, 3, 2, and 4. These neighbors form a 3-star: <6, (9, 1, 4)>
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 6, 8, 4, 1, 7, and 0. These neighbors form two 3-stars: <9, (6, 1, 4)> and <9, (6, 7, 4)>
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: 6, 9, 7, 0, 5, and 2. These neighbors form a 3-star: <4, (6, 9, 7)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 6, 9, 7, and 5. These neighbors do not form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 9, 4, 0, 3, and 1. These neighbors do not form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 6 and 4. These neighbors do not form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 9, 0, and 3. These neighbors do not form a 3-star.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 9, 4, 7, and 8. These neighbors do not form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 4 and 1. These neighbors do not form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, and 8. These neighbors do not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are: <6, (9, 1, 4)>, <6, (9, 1, 4)>, <9, (6, 1, 4)>, and <9, (6, 7, 4)>. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
