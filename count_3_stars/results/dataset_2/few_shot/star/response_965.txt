Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the adjacency list to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 -> (2, 3, 18), (0, 12), so <0, (2, 3, 18)>. One 3-star found.

2. Node 2 -> (4, 8), (2, 0), so <2, (4, 8, 0)>. One 3-star found.

3. Node 3 -> (0, 19, 6), so <3, (0, 19, 6)>. One 3-star found.

4. Node 4 -> (19, 5), (4, 2), so <4, (19, 5, 2)>. One 3-star found.

5. Node 5 -> (16, 4, 7), (5, 15), so <5, (16, 4, 7)>. One 3-star found.

6. Node 6 -> (17, 19, 12), (6, 10, 3), so <6, (17, 19, 12)>, <6, (6, 10, 3)>. Two 3-stars found.

7. Node 11 -> (16, 9, 8), so <11, (16, 9, 8)>. One 3-star found.

8. Node 14 -> (1, 18, 12), (14, 15), so <14, (1, 18, 12)>. One 3-star found.

9. Node 16 -> (11, 1, 8), (16, 5), so <16, (11, 1, 8)>. One 3-star found.

10. Node 19 -> (4, 18, 10), (19, 3, 6), so <19, (4, 18, 10)>, <19, (19, 3, 6)>. Two 3-stars found.

In total, we found 11 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [11].
