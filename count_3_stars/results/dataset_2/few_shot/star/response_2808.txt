Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0: No 3-star centered at node 0.
2. Node 1: <1, (5, 2, 6)> is a 3-star with node 1 as the center.
3. Node 2: <2, (5, 1, 6)> is a 3-star with node 2 as the center.
4. Node 3: No 3-star centered at node 3.
5. Node 4: <4, (9, 7, 8)> is a 3-star with node 4 as the center.
6. Node 5: <5, (9, 2, 8)> is a 3-star with node 5 as the center.
7. Node 6: No 3-star centered at node 6.
8. Node 7: No 3-star centered at node 7.
9. Node 8: No 3-star centered at node 8.
10. Node 9: <9, (5, 4, 8)> is a 3-star with node 9 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

<1, (5, 2, 6)>, <2, (5, 1, 6)>, <4, (9, 7, 8)>, <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <9, (5, 4, 8)>
