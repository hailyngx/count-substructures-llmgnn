Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (7, 1, 12)>
<0, (7, 2, 13)>
<0, (7, 12, 11)>
<0, (1, 2, 13)>
<1, (9, 3, 10)>
<2, (5, 6, 10)>
<3, (11, 14, 10)>
<4, (9, 7, 12)>
<5, (2, 10, 7)>
<6, (3, 2, 6)>
<7, (5, 4, 0)>
<8, (12)>
<9, (4, 1, 13)>
<13, (9, 0, 14)>
<14, (7, 3, 11)>

Counting the distinct 3-stars, we find a total of [14] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
