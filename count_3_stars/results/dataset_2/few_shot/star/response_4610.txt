Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the adjacency list provided, the central nodes are: 
- Node 1
- Node 4
- Node 8
- Node 11
- Node 17

Now, let's find the 3-stars using these central nodes: 

- For central node 1:
    - <1, (12, 13, 11)>
    - <1, (12, 13, 10)>
    
- For central node 4:
    - <4, (18, 19, 5)>
    - <4, (18, 10, 15)>
    - <4, (19, 3, 11)>
    
- For central node 8:
    - <8, (2, 14, 17)>
    
- For central node 11:
    - <11, (17, 1, 19)>
    - <11, (17, 1, 11)>
    
- For central node 17:
    - <17, (8, 16, 15)>
    - <17, (16, 7, 12)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
