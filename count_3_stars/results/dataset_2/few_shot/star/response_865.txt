Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0)

Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with 3 connections are nodes 0, 2, and 9. Since a 3-star requires the center node to have exactly 3 connections, these nodes can potentially form 3-stars.

Now, let's check if each of these nodes can form 3-stars:
1. **Node 0**: Cannot form a 3-star because it is connected to nodes 7, 3, and 1 which are not directly connected to each other.
2. **Node 2 (Center)**: Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 8. These two nodes are also connected to each other which means that node 2 can be the center of a 3-star. <2, (5, 8, x)> where x is the node not connected to 2, 5, or 8.
3. **Node 9 (Center)**: Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 7. These nodes are not directly connected to each other, so node 9 cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the only 3-star in the given graph is <2, (5, 8, x)>. 

Finally, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
