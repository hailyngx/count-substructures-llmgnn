Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Based on the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 8, 7)>
<1, (5, 9, 6)>
<2, (4, 8, 1)>
<3, (5, 2, 7)>
<4, (9, 8, 2)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 0)>
<8, (9, 6, 4)>
<9, (8, 4, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
