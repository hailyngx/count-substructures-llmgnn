Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. 

Given the adjacency list and the list of edges, we can start by listing all the 3-stars.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 3, 6)>
<1, (3, 2, 8)>
<2, (4, 1, 0)>
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<4, (5, 0, 6)>
<5, (9, 6, 4)>
<6, (5, 4, 3)>
<8, (9, 7, 1)>

Now we can count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
