Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 5, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph by identifying the central node and its adjacent nodes.

Given the adjacency list:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 9, 7
- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 7
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 8 has neighbors: 6, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 8

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (3, 4, 5)>
2. <0, (4, 1, 7)>
3. <1, (6, 2, 7)>
4. <2, (1, 6, 9)>
5. <3, (0, 4, 7)>
6. <4, (0, 1, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have [6]. So, the answer is [6].
