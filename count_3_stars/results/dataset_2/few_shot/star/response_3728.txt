Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern, i.e., a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<10, (23, 28, 29)>
<11, (0, 17, 23)>
<14, (6, 7, 12)>
<21, (2, 5, 18)>
<23, (8, 10, 11)>
<24, (7, 8, 9)>
<25, (0, 4, 5)>
<27, (12, 16, 18)>
<29, (7, 10, 25)>

Counting the unique 3-stars identified above, we get a total of [9] 3-stars.
