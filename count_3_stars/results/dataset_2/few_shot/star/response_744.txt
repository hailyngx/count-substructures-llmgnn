Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's break it down step by step:

First, let's list out the nodes with their connections:
- Node 0: (14, 8)
- Node 1: (11, 16, 6, 14, 10)
- Node 2: (16, 9, 8, 12)
- Node 3: (9, 18)
- Node 4: (7)
- Node 5: (9, 6)
- Node 6: (5, 1, 17, 10, 13)
- Node 7: (4, 12, 17)
- Node 8: (0, 2)
- Node 9: (11, 5, 2, 17, 3)
- Node 10: (6, 19, 1)
- Node 11: (1, 9, 13)
- Node 12: (7, 2, 15)
- Node 13: (11, 6, 19)
- Node 14: (0, 1)
- Node 15: (12, 19, 17)
- Node 16: (1, 2)
- Node 17: (9, 7, 6, 19, 15)
- Node 18: (3)
- Node 19: (15, 17, 10, 13)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<9, (11, 5, 2)>
<6, (5, 1, 17)>
<1, (11, 16, 14)>
<13, (11, 6, 19)>
<2, (16, 9, 8)>
<7, (4, 12, 17)>
<17, (9, 7, 6)>
<0, (14, 8, 0)>
<10, (6, 19, 10)>
<3, (9, 18, 3)>
<12, (7, 2, 15)>
<15, (12, 19, 17)>
