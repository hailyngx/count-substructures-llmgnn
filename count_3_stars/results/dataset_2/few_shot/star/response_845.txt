Response:
There are several ways we can count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. One way is to manually identify each 3-star by looking for patterns within the edges. The other way is to utilize the adjacency list provided for each node.

Let's start by looking at the adjacency list of each node to find all 3-stars.

Starting from Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 10, 12, and 4.
- Since Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 12, and 4, this forms a 3-star with Node 0 as the center and nodes 5, 12, and 4 as the leaves. <0, (5, 12, 4)>

Moving on to Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 14, 3, and 19.
- Since Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 14, and 19, this forms a 3-star with Node 1 as the center and nodes 9, 14, and 19 as the leaves. <1, (9, 14, 19)>

Continue this process for each node to identify all unique 3-stars.

After thoroughly examining each node's adjacency list, we find the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 12, 4)>
<1, (9, 14, 19)>
<7, (5, 12, 19)>
<8, (9, 14, 13)>
<10, (17, 0, 16)>
<13, (17, 8, 15)>
<14, (17, 8, 1)>
<15, (9, 13, 4)>
<16, (17, 8, 15)>
<17, (14, 10, 13)>
<18, (9, 4)>
<19, (1, 7, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
