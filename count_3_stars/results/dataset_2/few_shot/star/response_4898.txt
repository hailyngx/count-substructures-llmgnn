Node 14 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 8, 12, and node 13

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

Nodes with 3 connections:
- Node 1 is connected to 7 and 12
- Node 2 is connected to 9, 13, and 14
- Node 4 is connected to 5, 9, and 7
- Node 7 is connected to 4, 11, and 1
- Node 10 is connected to 5, 3, and 11

Next, let's list the 3-stars:

<1, (7, 12, x)>
<2, (9, 13, 14)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (4, 11, 1)>
<10, (5, 3, 11)>

Now, we can count the total number of 3-stars by counting the unique instances listed above:
