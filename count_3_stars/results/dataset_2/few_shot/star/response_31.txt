Response:
Starting from each node, we can check if there is a 3-star around it. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars we find:

<0, (27, 10, 23)>
<1, (16, 0, 21)>
<2, (11, 18, 17)>
<3, (16, 17, 24)>
<4, (27, 12, 25)>
<5, (18, 12, 23)>
<6, (11, 9, 12)>
<7, (11, 26, 24)>
<8, (29, 19, 25)>
<9, (13, 6, 20)>
<10, (0, 29, 26)>
<11, (16, 7, 6)>
<12, (6, 4, 5)>
<13, (25, 9, 1)>
<14, (12, 15, 5)>
<15, (5, 14, 24)>
<16, (11, 21, 1)>
<17, (2, 3, 16)>
<18, (2, 5, 23)>
<19, (22, 8, 25)>
<20, (9, 26, 20)>
<21, (16, 27, 29)>
<22, (19, 8, 25)>
<23, (10, 5, 0)>
<24, (21, 7, 3)>
<25, (13, 22, 19)>
<26, (10, 20, 7)>
<27, (21, 4, 0)>
<28, (29)>
<29, (8, 21, 10)>

There are 30 unique 3-stars found in the graph. So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].
