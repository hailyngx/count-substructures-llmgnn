Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (9, 4, 7)>
<2, (9, 4, 7)>
<3, (8, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (9, 0, 4)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars gives us a total of 9.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
