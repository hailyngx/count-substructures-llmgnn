Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors and form a 3-star structure.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 7
- Node 8
- Node 12
- Node 17

Therefore, the possible 3-stars in the graph can be formed around these nodes. Let's go ahead and count the number of 3-stars in the graph step by step.

1. Analyzing Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 13, and 8.
   - There are 3 different combinations possible for 3-stars around Node 1:
     <1, (3, 13, 8)>, <1, (13, 3, 8)>, <1, (8, 3, 13)>
  
  For Node 1, there are 3 unique 3-stars.

2. Analyzing Node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 11 and 15.
   - There are no 3-star structures around Node 2.

3. Analyzing Node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 11 and 13.
   - There are no 3-star structures around Node 7.

4. Analyzing Node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to node 1.
   - There are no 3-star structures around Node 8.

5. Analyzing Node 12:
   - Node 12 is connected to nodes 13 and 15.
   - There are no 3-star structures around Node 12.

6. Analyzing Node 17:
   - Node 17 is not connected to any other nodes, hence cannot form a 3-star structure.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is the sum of the 3-stars found around each eligible node.

[Total number of 3-stars: [3]]
