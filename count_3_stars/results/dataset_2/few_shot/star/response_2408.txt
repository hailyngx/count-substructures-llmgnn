Response:
Let's identify all the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph based on the information provided. 

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-star subgraphs:
1. Node 0: <0, (9, 8, 19)>
2. Node 1: <1, (9, 12, 18)>
3. Node 2: <2, (17, 19, 11)>
4. Node 3: <3, (9, 10, 27)>
5. Node 4: <4, (29, 15, 0)>
6. Node 5: <5, (19, 10, 27)>
7. Node 6: <6, (15, 0, 16)>
8. Node 7: <7, (12, 25, 11)>
9. Node 8: <8, (13, 0, 24)>
10. Node 9: <9, (3, 1, 0)>
11. Node 10: <10, (5, 3, 20)>
12. Node 11: <11, (7, 22, 25)>
13. Node 12: <12, (7, 17, 1)>
14. Node 13: <13, (8, 26, 27)>
15. Node 14: <14, (28, 18, 2)>
16. Node 15: <15, (4, 6, 16)>
17. Node 16: <16, (28, 29, 15)>
18. Node 17: <17, (12, 23, 2)>
19. Node 18: <18, (14, 15, 1)>
20. Node 19: <19, (5, 2, 29)>
21. Node 20: <20, (26, 27, 10)>
22. Node 21: <21, (25, 29, 19)>
23. Node 22: <22, (11, 24, 7)>
24. Node 23: <23, (28, 17, 24)>
25. Node 24: <24, (8, 22, 23)>
26. Node 25: <25, (7, 21, 11)>
27. Node 26: <26, (13, 20, 27)>
28. Node 27: <27, (13, 5, 3)>
29. Node 28: <28, (16, 14, 23)>
30. Node 29: <29, (4, 21, 16)>

Since each 3-star subgraph is unique, there are 30 different 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
