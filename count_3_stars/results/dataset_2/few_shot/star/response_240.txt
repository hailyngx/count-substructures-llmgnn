Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Based on the adjacency list provided, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows: 
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (7, 9, 5)>
<3, (5, 0, _)>
<4, (7, 0, 1)>
<5, (6, 2, 3)>
<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<7, (4, 0, 9)>
<8, (6, 9, 0)>
<9, (7, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
