Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the unique 3-stars where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Given the graph and its adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 7: <1, (2, 4, 7)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7: <3, (1, 5, 7)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 6: <4, (1, 5, 6)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6: <5, (3, 4, 6)>

There are no other 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
