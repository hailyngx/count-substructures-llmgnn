Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

From the adjacency list, we can see the nodes that are directly connected to each node. Now, let's count the number of 3-stars involving each node as the center:

1. Node 1: (11, 18, 8) - 1 3-star
2. Node 3: (10, 5, 18) - 1 3-star
3. Node 4: (19, 5, 6) - 1 3-star
4. Node 5: (3, 4, 18), (12, 2, 15) - 2 3-stars
5. Node 6: (13, 4, 7) - 1 3-star
6. Node 8: (1, 19, 14) - 1 3-star
7. Node 9: (10, 13, 17) - 1 3-star
8. Node 10: (3, 0, 9) - 1 3-star
9. Node 12: (13, 19, 5), (14, 19, 15) - 2 3-stars
10. Node 13: (12, 9, 6) - 1 3-star
11. Node 14: (8, 7, 12) - 1 3-star
12. Node 15: (19, 2, 12) - 1 3-star
13. Node 16: No 3-stars as it only has one connected node
14. Node 17: (9, 19, 18) - 1 3-star
15. Node 18: (1, 3, 17) - 1 3-star
16. Node 19: (8, 17, 4), (15, 2, 12) - 2 3-stars
17. Node 0: No 3-stars as it only has two connected nodes
18. Node 2: No 3-stars as it only has two connected nodes
19. Node 7: No 3-stars as it only has two connected nodes

Count of 3-stars involving each node as the center:
1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 16

[16] 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (11, 18, 8)>, 
<3, (10, 5, 18)>, 
<4, (19, 5, 6)>, 
<5, (3, 4, 18)>, <5, (12, 2, 15)>, 
<6, (13, 4, 7)>, 
<8, (1, 19, 14)>, 
<9, (10, 13, 17)>, 
<10, (3, 0, 9)>, 
<12, (13, 19, 5)>, <12, (14, 19, 15)>, 
<13, (12, 9, 6)>, 
<14, (8, 7, 12)>, 
<15, (19, 2, 12)>, 
<17, (9, 19, 18)>, 
<18, (1, 3, 17)>, 
<19, (8, 17, 4)>, <19, (15, 2, 12)>
