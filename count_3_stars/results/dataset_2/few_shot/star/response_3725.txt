Response:
First, let's identify the possible 3-star configurations in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them out:

<14, (17, 27, 16)>
<17, (14, 16, 14)>
<7, (21, 12, 18)>
<21, (7, 10, 13)>
<22, (5, 24, 0)>
<23, (2, 3, 9)>
<12, (7, 18, 15)>
<6, (25, 8, 13)>
<28, (21, 10, 7)>
<19, (26, 10, 27)>
<26, (19, 25, 20)>
<1, (15, 2, 16)>
<8, (6, 26, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 3)>
<10, (7, 19, 27)>
<25, (6, 26, 4)>
<11, (26, 0, 0)>
<0, (11, 11, 11)>
<3, (23, 9, 9)>
<16, (17, 1, 24)>
<24, (22, 16, 4)>
<13, (21, 6, 29)>
<2, (23, 1, 1)>
<20, (26, 16, 4)>
<29, (8, 13, 4)>
<5, (22, 18, 4)>
<18, (7, 12, 16)>
<4, (1, 25, 24)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars from the above list.
Total number of 3-stars: [30]
