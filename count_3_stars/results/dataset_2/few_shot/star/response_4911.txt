Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 4) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 3) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 11) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 3) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 14, and node 10
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 4, and node 11
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 14, 13, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, 7, 13, and node 10
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 13, 10, 1, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 13, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 11, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 14, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 10, 12, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 10, 13, 0, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 0, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 2, 12, 4, and node 1
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 9, 14, 2, 4, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes.
Based on the adjacency list provided, the central nodes are:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 9, 14, and 10
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 7, 4, and 11
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 9, 14, and 13
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 5, 8, and 7
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 6, 13, and 10
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 6, 13, and 3
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 5, 11, and 4
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 14, 3, and 1
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 10, 12, and 3
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 9, 8, and 11

Next, let's count the number of 3-star subgraphs in the graph:
- Node 0: <0, (9, 14, 10)>
- Node 1: <1, (7, 4, 11)>
- Node 2: <2, (9, 14, 13)>
- Node 3: <3, (5, 8, 7)>
- Node 4: <4, (6, 13, 10)>
- Node 5: <5, (6, 13, 3)>
- Node 6: <6, (5, 11, 4)>
- Node 7: <7, (14, 3, 1)>
- Node 8: <8, (10, 12, 3)>
- Node 12: <12, (9, 8, 11)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
