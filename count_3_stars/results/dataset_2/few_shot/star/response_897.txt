Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify the central node and its adjacent nodes:
- From the adjacency list, we can see that Node 5 has the highest degree (4) compared to any other node, so we will consider Node 5 as the central node.
- The adjacent nodes of Node 5 are 9, 8, 4, and 3.

2. Count the number of possible 3-stars:
- For each adjacent node of Node 5, we will check if there exists a 3-star configuration.
- Node 9: (5, 9, 4), (5, 9, 3) [We have two unique 3-stars]
- Node 8: (5, 8, 3) [We have one unique 3-star]
- Node 4: (5, 4, 14) [We have one unique 3-star]
- Node 3: (5, 3, 6), (5, 3, 12) [We have two unique 3-stars]

3. List the unique 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 4, 3)>, <5, (9, 3, 4)>, <5, (8, 4, 3)>, <5, (4, 14, 5)>, <5, (3, 6, 5)>, <5, (3, 12, 5)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
