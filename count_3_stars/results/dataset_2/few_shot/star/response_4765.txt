Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes in each 3-star configuration. 

Let's go through the graph step-by-step and identify all the 3-stars:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that Node 5 has connections with nodes 9, 2, 8, and 0. This forms a 3-star with Node 5 as the central node and nodes 9, 2, and 8 as the leaves. <5, (9, 2, 8)>

2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 4, 3, and 1. This also forms a 3-star with Node 9 as the central node and nodes 5, 8, and 4 as the leaves. <9, (5, 8, 4)>

3. Similarly, the following 3-stars are formed:
   - <5, (9, 8, 0)>
   - <8, (5, 9, 4)>
   - <4, (9, 8, 2)>
   - <9, (5, 8, 1)>

Thus, there are four unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [4].
