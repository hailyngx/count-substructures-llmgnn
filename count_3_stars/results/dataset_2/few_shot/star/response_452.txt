Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph and list them out, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph.

1. Identify 3-star patterns:
   - In a 3-star graph, there should always be one central node connected to exactly three other nodes. So, we need to look for nodes that have 3 edges connected to them, indicating that they are central nodes of 3-stars.

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
   - We will list out the unique 3-stars found and count them. Each unique 3-star will be represented using the format <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>.

Let's find and count the 3-stars:

1. <0, (9, 6, 8)>
2. <0, (9, 3, 7)>
3. <1, (2, 4, 7)>
4. <2, (6, 1, 7)>
5. <2, (6, 3, 4)>
6. <4, (9, 1, 8)>
7. <4, (9, 2, 8)>
8. <7, (5, 9, 1)>
9. <7, (5, 2, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
