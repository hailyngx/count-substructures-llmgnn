Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
There are a total of 30 nodes and 90 edges in the graph.

To find 3-stars:
1. Identify nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each of these nodes, count the number of unique 3-stars they form.

From the adjacency list:
Nodes 0, 18, 21, and 28 are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's count the number of 3-stars they form:

1. For Node 0: (0, 27, 15, 24), (0, 15, 2, 20), (0, 24, 6, 26) [<0, (27, 15, 24)>, <0, (15, 2, 20)>, <0, (24, 6, 26)>]
2. For Node 18: (18, 27, 28, 20) [<18, (27, 28, 20)>]
3. For Node 21: (21, 7, 16, 3) [<21, (7, 16, 3)>]
4. For Node 28: (28, 27, 4, 26) [<28, (27, 4, 26)>]

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [8]
