Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 7, 12)>
<1, (3, 10, 0)>
<2, (6, 10, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 5)>
<4, (6, 9, 2)>
<5, (3, 8, 5)>
<6, (9, 14, 10)>
<7, (3, 10, 0)>
<8, (3, 11, 2)>
<9, (6, 4, 14)>
<10, (6, 1, 11)>
<11, (10, 14, 8)>
<12, (9, 0, 14)>
<13, (6, 7, 12)>
<14, (6, 9, 10)>

There are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
