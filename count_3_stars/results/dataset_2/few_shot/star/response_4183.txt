Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (3, 8) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 4) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 0, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go through each node and its connections to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
    - Forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 5, 2: <0, (9, 5, 2)>
    - Forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 5, 8: <0, (9, 5, 8)>
    - Forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 2, 4: <0, (5, 2, 4)>

2. Node 1:
    - Forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 5, 8: <1, (9, 5, 8)>
    - Forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 2, 4: <1, (5, 2, 4)>
    - Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, 7: <1, (2, 8, 7)>

3. Node 2:
    - Forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, 4: <2, (5, 8, 4)>
    - Forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 3, 7: <2, (8, 3, 7)>

4. Node 3: (No 3-stars as it is connected to only two other nodes)

5. Node 4:
    - Forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, 2: <4, (6, 9, 2)>
    - Forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 1, 7: <4, (9, 1, 7)>
    - Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, 7: <4, (1, 8, 7)>

6. Node 5: 
    - Forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 2, 1: <5, (6, 2, 1)>
    - Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, 7: <5, (2, 8, 7)>
    - Forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 1, 7: <5, (8, 1, 7)>

7. Node 6: (No 3-stars as it is connected to only one other node)

8. Node 7: (No 3-stars as it is connected to only two other nodes)

9. Node 8: (No 3-stars as it is connected to only four other nodes)

10. Node 9:
    - Forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 1, 7: <9, (4, 1, 7)>
    - Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, 8: <9, (1, 5, 8)>
    - Forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 0, 4: <9, (5, 0, 4)>

Total 3-stars found: 12
