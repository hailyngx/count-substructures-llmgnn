Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that act as the center of a 3-star and then find the corresponding leaves.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (14, 7, 11)>
<0, (14, 9, 11)>
<1, (16, 4, 19)>
<1, (16, 1, 18)>
<2, (15, 17, 5)>
<2, (15, 17, 2)>
<2, (15, 17, 11)>
<3, (15, 8, 2)>
<3, (15, 8, 5)>
<3, (15, 8, 6)>
<4, (1)>
<5, (8, 2, 17)>
<6, (8, 19, 16)>
<7, (0, 12, 16)>
<8, (3, 15, 13)>
<9, (0, 12, 19)>
<9, (0, 9, 19)>
<10, (17, 19, 6)>
<11, (17, 0, 12)>
<11, (17, 0, 18)>
<12, (7, 16, 11)>
<13, (8)>
<14, (17, 0, 11)>
<15, (3, 2, 8)>
<16, (7, 1, 18)>
<17, (14, 10, 2)>
<18, (16, 1, 19)>
<19, (10, 6, 18)>
<19, (10, 1, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
