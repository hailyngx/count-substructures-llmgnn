Response:
Let's list the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (13, 14, 9)>
<1, (13, 10, 11)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 13, 12)>
<4, (7, 2, 9)>
<5, (7, 13, 12)>
<6, (8, 10, 12)>
<7, (4, 12, 11)>
<8, (9, 6, 4)>
<9, (8, 11, 0)>
<10, (13, 11, 6)>
<11, (7, 10, 1)>
<12, (7, 5, 6)>
<13, (5, 3, 0)>
<14, (7, 0, 3)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
