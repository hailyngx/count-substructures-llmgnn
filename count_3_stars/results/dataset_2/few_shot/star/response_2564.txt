Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. 

From the given adjacency list, the nodes that satisfy this criteria are:
- Node 3: Connected to node 6 and node 19
- Node 9: Connected to node 10
- Node 17: Connected to node 15

Next, we identify the leaves of the 3-stars by finding nodes that are directly connected to the center node. 

For Node 3:
- <3, (6, 19, _)>  (the leaf node for this 3-star could either be 6 or 19)

For Node 9:
- <9, (10, _ ,_)>

For Node 17:
- <17, (15, _ ,_)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (6, 19, _)>
<9, (10, _ ,_)>
<17, (15, _ ,_)>
