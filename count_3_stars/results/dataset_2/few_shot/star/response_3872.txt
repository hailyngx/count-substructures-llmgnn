Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star requires a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (7, 8, 2)>
<1, (4, 6, 2)>
<2, (5, 1, 8)>
<3, (9, 7, 1)>
<4, (5, 6, 1)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (9, 4, 1)>
<7, (5, 9, 0)>
<8, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (6, 8, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
