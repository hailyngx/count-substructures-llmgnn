Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, which have a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will first go through each node and identify if it forms any 3-star.

Based on the provided information, we know the following connections: 

Node 0: Connected to nodes 25, 28
Node 1: Connected to nodes 25, 7, 24
Node 2: Connected to nodes 24, 28
Node 3: Connected to nodes 7, 17, 10
Node 4: Connected to nodes 13, 22, 27
Node 5: Connected to nodes 29, 27, 23, 12
Node 6: Connected to nodes 13, 21, 14
Node 7: Connected to nodes 3, 28, 18, 1
Node 8: Connected to nodes 13, 9, 16, 11
Node 9: Connected to nodes 8, 15, 16
Node 10: Connected to node 3
Node 11: Connected to nodes 8, 15, 12
Node 12: Connected to nodes 19, 5, 15, 11
Node 13: Connected to nodes 8, 17, 4, 6
Node 14: Connected to nodes 6, 21, 27
Node 15: Connected to nodes 9, 23, 11, 12, 24
Node 16: Connected to nodes 8, 9, 18
Node 17: Connected to nodes 3, 13, 27
Node 18: Connected to nodes 25, 16, 7
Node 19: Connected to nodes 26, 22, 12
Node 20: Connected to nodes 22, 23
Node 21: Connected to nodes 6, 14, 24
Node 22: Connected to nodes 20, 19, 4
Node 23: Connected to nodes 20, 5, 15
Node 24: Connected to nodes 2, 21, 1, 15
Node 25: Connected to nodes 1, 0, 18
Node 26: Connected to node 19
Node 27: Connected to nodes 4, 14, 17, 5
Node 28: Connected to nodes 2, 0, 7
Node 29: Connected to node 5

Let's now identify the unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 24, 7)>
<2, (28, 0, 24)>
<3, (7, 17, 13)>
<5, (29, 27, 23)>
<12, (19, 15, 5)>
<15, (9, 23, 11)>
<18, (25, 16, 7)>
<19, (26, 22, 12)>
<20, (22, 23, 5)>
<21, (6, 14, 24)>
<24, (2, 21, 1)>
<26, (19, 22, 4)>
<27, (4, 14, 17)>
<28, (0, 7, 2)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
