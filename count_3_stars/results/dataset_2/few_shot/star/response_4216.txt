Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Let's go through each node and its connections to identify the 3-stars:

- For Node 0: No 3-stars as it has connections to only 3 nodes.
- For Node 1: One 3-star <1, (12, 16, 7)>.
- For Node 2: No 3-stars as it has connections to only 3 nodes.
- For Node 3: One 3-star <3, (15, 12, 13)>.
- For Node 4: No 3-stars as it has connections to only 2 nodes.
- For Node 5: No 3-stars as it has connections to only 2 nodes.
- For Node 6: No 3-stars as it has connections to only 3 nodes.
- For Node 7: No 3-stars as it has connections to only 2 nodes.
- For Node 8: No 3-stars as it has connections to only 2 nodes.
- For Node 9: One 3-star <9, (4, 19, 7)>.
- For Node 10: No 3-stars as it has connections to only 2 nodes.
- For Node 11: No 3-stars as it has connections to only 2 nodes.
- For Node 12: One 3-star <12, (17, 16, 1)>.
- For Node 13: No 3-stars as it has connections to only 3 nodes.
- For Node 14: No 3-stars as it has connections to only 3 nodes.
- For Node 15: No 3-stars as it has connections to only 3 nodes.
- For Node 16: No 3-stars as it has connections to only 3 nodes.
- For Node 17: No 3-stars as it has connections to only 4 nodes.
- For Node 18: No 3-stars as it has connections to only 4 nodes.
- For Node 19: No 3-stars as it has connections to only 2 nodes.

Based on the analysis above, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars found: 
<1, (12, 16, 7)>
<3, (15, 12, 13)>
<9, (4, 19, 7)>
