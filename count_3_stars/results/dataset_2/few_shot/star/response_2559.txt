Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 12) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 13) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 2) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 11, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 11, 13, 6, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 11, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 12, 13, 10, and node 11

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star and then count them. 

Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (9, 1, 6)>
2. <1, (9, 3, 11)>
3. <2, (11, 13, 6)>
4. <3, (9, 1, 7)>
5. <4, (8, 12, 13)>
6. <5, (9, 8, 10)>
7. <6, (12, 0, 2)>
8. <7, (9, 1, 3)>
9. <8, (5, 3, 4)>
10. <9, (5, 1, 7)>
11. <10, (5, 4, 2)>
12. <11, (1, 3, 4)>
13. <12, (4, 7, 14)>
14. <13, (4, 14, 2)>
15. <14, (5, 12, 13)>

There are 15 unique 3-stars found in the graph, so the count is [15].
