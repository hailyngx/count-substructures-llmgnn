Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0)

Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze each node's connections to identify the 3-stars.

Let's go through each node:
- Node 0 is not part of any 3-star as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- <1, (5, 9, 6)> forms a 3-star.
- <2, (5, 9, 6)> forms a 3-star.
- Node 3 is not part of any 3-star as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 4 is not part of any 3-star as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- <5, (9, 2, 1)> forms a 3-star.
- <6, (9, 1, 2)> forms a 3-star.
- Node 7 is not part of any 3-star as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- <8, (1, 4, 2)> forms a 3-star.
- <9, (5, 6, 4)> forms a 3-star.

Count of 3-stars: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (5, 9, 6)>, <2, (5, 9, 6)>, <5, (9, 2, 1)>, <6, (9, 1, 2)>, <8, (1, 4, 2)>
