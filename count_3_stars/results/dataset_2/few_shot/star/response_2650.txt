Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We can use the given adjacency list to determine this. Then, we can construct all possible 3-stars with these central nodes and count how many unique ones exist.

Central nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to 3 nodes: 9, 7, 3
- Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes: 5, 9, 3
- Node 2 is connected to 2 nodes: 5, 8
- Node 4 is connected to 4 nodes: 5, 9, 6, 3
- Node 5 is connected to 5 nodes: 9, 6, 2, 1, 4
- Node 7 is connected to 3 nodes: 9, 0, 6
- Node 8 is connected to 3 nodes: 7, 3, 6

Based on the central nodes identified above, we can construct the unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 7, 3)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<7, (9, 0, 6)>
<8, (7, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
