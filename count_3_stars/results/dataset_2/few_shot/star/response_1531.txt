Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
First, we identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can find them by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 

From the adjacency list provided, we observe the following nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors 9, 7, 1
- Node 3: neighbors 5, 7, 8

Next, we list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (9, 7, 1)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>

Following this, we count the total number of 3-stars found in the graph, which is [2].
