Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of nodes that form 3-stars where one node is the center and the other three nodes are connected to the center node.

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (9, 7, 6)>
<1, (6, 8, 2)>
<2, (4, 0, 1)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<4, (5, 7, 3)>
<5, (9, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
<0, (9, 7, 6)>, <1, (6, 8, 2)>, <2, (4, 0, 1)>, <3, (5, 9, 4)>, <4, (5, 7, 3)>, <5, (9, 4, 3)>
