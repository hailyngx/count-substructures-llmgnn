Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node and three connected nodes. 

Now, we will go through each node and identify the 3-stars it is a part of:

- From node 0, we have a 3-star with center 0 and leaves 7, 14, 2. <0, (7, 14, 2)>
- From node 1, we have a 3-star with center 1 and leaves 4, 3, 14. <1, (4, 3, 14)>
- From node 2, we have a 3-star with center 2 and leaves 1, 13, 12. This is the only 3-star from node 2. <2, (1, 13, 12)>
- From node 3, we have a 3-star with center 3 and leaves 4, 1, 11. <3, (4, 1, 11)>
- From node 4, we have a 3-star with center 4 and leaves 7, 5, 3. This is the only 3-star from node 4. <4, (7, 5, 3)>
- From node 5, we have a 3-star with center 5 and leaves 4, 7, 11. This is the only 3-star from node 5. <5, (4, 7, 11)>
- From node 6, we have a 3-star with center 6 and leaves 8, 14, 2. <6, (8, 14, 2)>
- From node 7, we have a 3-star with center 7 and leaves 4, 12, 0. This is the only 3-star from node 7. <7, (4, 12, 0)>
- From node 8, we have a 3-star with center 8 and leaves 13, 9, 6. <8, (13, 9, 6)>
- From node 9, we have a 3-star with center 9 and leaves 3, 8, 12. <9, (3, 8, 12)>
- From node 10, we have a 3-star with center 10 and leaves 13, 12, 2. This is the only 3-star from node 10. <10, (13, 12, 2)>
- From node 11, we have a 3-star with center 11 and leaves 4, 3, 5. This is the only 3-star from node 11. <11, (4, 3, 5)>
- From node 12, we have a 3-star with center 12 and leaves 7, 1, 9. <12, (7, 1, 9)>
- From node 13, we have a 3-star with center 13 and leaves 8, 2, 10. This is the only 3-star from node 13. <13, (8, 2, 10)>
- From node 14, we have a 3-star with center 14 and leaves 1, 0, 6. This is the only 3-star from node 14. <14, (1, 0, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
