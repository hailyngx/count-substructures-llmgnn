Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. 

From the adjacency list, we identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (5, 12, 10)>
2. <1, (4, 8, 13)>
3. <2, (7, 10, 13)>
4. <3, (5, 4,)>
5. <4, (8, 1, 11)>
6. <5, (9, 0, 3)>
7. <6, (12, 0, 14)>
8. <7, (5, 9, 12)>
9. <8, (9, 4, 10)>
10. <9, (5, 8, 14)>
11. <10, (8, 0, 2)>
12. <11, (4, 8, 13)>
13. <12, (9, 7, 13)>
14. <13, (12, 11, 0)>
15. <14, (9, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
