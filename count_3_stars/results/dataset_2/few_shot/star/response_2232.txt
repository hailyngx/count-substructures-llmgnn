Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by considering each node as the center and counting the number of 3-stars around it.

Let's find the 3-stars:
1. Node 0: No 3-stars.
2. Node 1: No 3-stars.
3. Node 2: No 3-stars.
4. Node 3: No 3-stars.
5. Node 4: No 3-stars.
6. Node 5: Two 3-stars: <5, (11, 15, 7)> and <5, (1, 10, 8)>.
7. Node 6: No 3-stars.
8. Node 7: No 3-stars.
9. Node 8: No 3-stars.
10. Node 9: One 3-star: <9, (11, 16, 10)>.
11. Node 10: No 3-stars.
12. Node 11: No 3-stars.
13. Node 12: No 3-stars.
14. Node 13: No 3-stars.
15. Node 14: No 3-stars.
16. Node 15: No 3-stars.
17. Node 16: No 3-stars.
18. Node 17: No 3-stars.
19. Node 18: No 3-stars.
20. Node 19: No 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars are <5, (11, 15, 7)>, <5, (1, 10, 8)>, and <9, (11, 16, 10)>.
