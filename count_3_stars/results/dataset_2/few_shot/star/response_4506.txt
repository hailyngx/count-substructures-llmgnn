Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be counted by examining each node to see how many 3-stars it is a part of. Since a 3-star has a center connected to three other nodes, we need to find nodes that satisfy this condition.

Looking at the given graph, we can see that the nodes and their connections form the following 3-stars:
<0, (7, 8, 14)>
<1, (6, 9, 11)>
<2, (10, 12, 8)>
<3> (cannot form a 3-star as it only has one connection)
<4> (cannot form a 3-star as it only has one connection)
<5> (cannot form a 3-star as it only has three connections)
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<7, (6, 11, 12)>
<8, (9, 10, 2)>
<9, (6, 8, 1)>
<10, (6, 11, 8)>
<11, (10, 7, 1)>
<12, (7, 4, 2)>
<13> (cannot form a 3-star as it only has four connections)
<14> (cannot form a 3-star as it only has two connections)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
<0, (7, 8, 14)>
<1, (6, 9, 11)>
<2, (10, 12, 8)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<7, (6, 11, 12)>
<8, (9, 10, 2)>
<9, (6, 8, 1)>
<10, (6, 11, 8)>
<11, (10, 7, 1)>
<12, (7, 4, 2)>
