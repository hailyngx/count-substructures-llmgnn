Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition given.

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 13, and 8: <5, (9, 13, 8)>
2. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 1: <8, (5, 4, 1)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 8: <4, (5, 9, 8)>
4. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 4: <9, (5, 6, 4)>
5. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8: <1, (5, 6, 8)>
6. Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 1, and 13: <2, (8, 1, 13)>
7. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 14, and 10: <3, (4, 14, 10)>
8. Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 12: <6, (9, 1, 12)>
9. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 13, and 10: <7, (2, 13, 10)>
10. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 4, and 13: <0, (6, 4, 13)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
