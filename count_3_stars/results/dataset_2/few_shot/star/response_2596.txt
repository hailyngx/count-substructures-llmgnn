Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars by finding all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (1, 0, 18)>
<12, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (11, 15, 19)>
<7, (15, 17, 7)>
<4, (11, 16, 5)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
