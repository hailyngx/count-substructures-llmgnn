Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three adjacent nodes connected to it. 

1. **Counting 3-stars with the central node of 0:**
   - 3-star 1: <0, (9, 4, 7)>
   - Total: 1

2. **Counting 3-stars with the central node of 1:**
   - 3-star 2: <1, (7, 8, 2)>
   - Total: 1

3. **Counting 3-stars with the central node of 2:**
   - 3-star 3: <2, (6, 4, 7)>
   - 3-star 4: <2, (6, 8, 1)>
   - Total: 2

4. **Counting 3-stars with the central node of 3:**
   - No 3-stars with 3 as the central node

5. **Counting 3-stars with the central node of 4:**
   - 3-star 5: <4, (6, 8, 0)>
   - 3-star 6: <4, (6, 3, 8)>
   - Total: 2

6. **Counting 3-stars with the central node of 5:**
   - 3-star 7: <5, (6, 7, 8)>
   - Total: 1

7. **Counting 3-stars with the central node of 6:**
   - 3-star 8: <6, (5, 3, 2)>
   - Total: 1

8. **Counting 3-stars with the central node of 7:**
   - 3-star 9: <7, (0, 2, 5)>
   - Total: 1

9. **Counting 3-stars with the central node of 8:**
   - 3-star 10: <8, (9, 4, 2)>
   - 3-star 11: <8, (9, 4, 5)>
   - 3-star 12: <8, (9, 5, 0)>
   - Total: 3

10. **Counting 3-stars with the central node of 9:**
    - No 3-stars with 9 as the central node

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
