Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all possible 3-stars based on the provided adjacency list. 

Based on the definition of a 3-star, we are looking for a central node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<3, (7, 16, 5)>
<6, (11, 7, 12)>
<7, (11, 17, 12)>
<9, (16, 18, 13)>
<11, (6, 16, 15)>
<12, (7, 0, 1)>
<13, (17, 10, 15)>
<15, (11, 4, 13)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
