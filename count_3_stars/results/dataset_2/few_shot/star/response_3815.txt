Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's go through the adjacency list of each node to identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 11, 8, 14, 2, and 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 11, 14, 13, and 12
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 0, and 13
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 6, and 2
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 12, 4, and 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 4, and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 10, 0, and 12
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 10, 4, 14, 0, and 6
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 14 and 13
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 8, 7, and 14
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 1, 0, and 13
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 7, and 13
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 11, 2, and 12
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 10, 8, and 0

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 8, 14)>
- <0, (3, 8, 2)>
- <1, (11, 14, 13)>
- <1, (11, 13, 12)>
- <4, (5, 8, 6)>
- <4, (5, 8, 2)>
- <5, (6, 4, 7)>
- <6, (5, 3, 8)>
- <7, (5, 10, 12)>
- <8, (3, 10, 4)>
- <8, (3, 10, 14)>
- <8, (3, 10, 0)>
- <8, (4, 14, 6)>
- <8, (4, 14, 0)>
- <11, (1, 13, 12)>
- <13, (9, 11, 12)>
- <14, (9, 10, 0)>

Therefore, there are [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
