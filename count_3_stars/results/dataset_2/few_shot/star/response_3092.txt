Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (14, 8) (14, 6) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (1, 11) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 12)

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars present in the given graph.

Based on the definition, a 3-star will have a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can see that nodes 4, 7, and 8 are central nodes with three connections each. 

Let's list down the 3-stars present in the graph:

<4, (7, 8, 13)>
<7, (4, 6, 11)>
<8, (4, 10, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
