Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars and then count them.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <1, (9, 14, 12)>
2. <3, (14, 5, 13)>
3. <6, (12, 0, 11)>
4. <10, (4, 0, 13)>
5. <5, (9, 13, 2)>
6. <0, (5, 6, 10)>
7. <2, (5, 4, 8)>
8. <4, (5, 10, 8)>
9. <8, (9, 4, 2)>
10. <7, (9, 13, 11)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars identified: [10]
