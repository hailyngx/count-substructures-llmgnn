Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all unique instances of 3-stars. 

The 3-star structures in this graph can be represented as follows:
<5, (9, 8, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 3)>
<6, (9, 1, 4)>
<1, (6, 3, 7)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<4, (6, 1, 0)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (5, 4, 2)>
<8, (5, 7)>
<2, (9, 6, 0)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
