Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 9, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 6, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 0 is connected to 2 other nodes.
- Node 1 is connected to 4 other nodes.
- Node 2 is connected to 6 other nodes.
- Node 3 is connected to 4 other nodes.
- Node 4 is connected to 3 other nodes.
- Node 5 is connected to 4 other nodes.
- Node 6 is connected to 3 other nodes.
- Node 7 is connected to 4 other nodes.
- Node 8 is connected to 2 other nodes.
- Node 9 is connected to 5 other nodes.

Step 2: Find all possible 3-stars in the graph.

    <1, (4, 9, 6)>
    <2, (3, 6, 9)>
    <3, (7, 1, 2)>
    <4, (9, 5, 1)>
    <5, (4, 7, 3)>
    <6, (4, 1, 9)>
    <7, (3, 5, 2)>
    <8, (7, 9, 5)>
    <9, (4, 6, 2)>

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars. 

    There are [9] 3-stars in the given graph. (in brackets)
