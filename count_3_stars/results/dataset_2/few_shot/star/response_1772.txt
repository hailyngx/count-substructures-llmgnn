Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<4, (7, 11, 17)>
<7, (4, 1, 17)>
<1, (7, 3, 10)>
<3, (1, 12, 18)>
<0, (12, 2, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 0)>
<5, (6, 18, 16)>
<6, (5, 17, 2)>
<8, (16)>
<9, (0, 11, 19)>
<10, (1, 14, 15)>
<11, (4, 17, 19)>
<12, (3, 0, 15)>
<13, (15)>
<14, (19, 10)>
<15, (13, 10, 12)>
<16, (8, 5)>
<17, (4, 7, 6)>
<18, (7, 3, 5)>
<19, (1, 14, 11)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
