Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star configuration. Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars:

Node 0: (9, 16, 19)
Node 1: No 3-star
Node 2: (15, 9, 16)
Node 3: No 3-star
Node 4: No 3-star
Node 5: (15, 17, 1), (15, 13, 7), (17, 13, 7)
Node 6: No 3-star
Node 7: (17, 5, 10)
Node 8: (13, 9, 12)
Node 9: (15, 8, 2), (15, 0, 2)
Node 10: No 3-star
Node 11: No 3-star
Node 12: No 3-star
Node 13: (8, 9, 12), (8, 5, -)
Node 14: No 3-star
Node 15: (3, 9, 2)
Node 16: (18, 0, 2)
Node 17: (14, 6, 7), (14, 5, 7)
Node 18: (14, 4, 11), (14, 11, 16), (4, 11, 16)
Node 19: No 3-star

<0, (9, 16, 19)>, <2, (15, 9, 16)>, <5, (15, 17, 1)>, <5, (15, 13, 7)>, <5, (17, 13, 7)>, <7, (17, 5, 10)>, <8, (13, 9, 12)>, <9, (15, 8, 2)>, <9, (15, 0, 2)>, <13, (8, 9, 12)>, <13, (8, 5, -)>, <15, (3, 9, 2)>, <16, (18, 0, 2)>, <17, (14, 6, 7)>, <17, (14, 5, 7)>, <18, (14, 4, 11)>, <18, (14, 11, 16)>, <18, (4, 11, 16)>

Finally, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [17].
