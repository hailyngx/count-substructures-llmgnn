Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

Based on the given information, the central nodes can be any of the nodes from 0 to 19. To find the 3-stars, we need to look for nodes connected to a central node and see if there are any sets of 3 other nodes connected to that central node. 

By examining the adjacency list, we can see that the possible 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (14, 8, 13)>
<2, (16, 6, 7)>
<3, (8, 7, 4)>
<5, (13, 12, 16)>
<6, (14, 2, 15)>
<7, (2, 3, 19)>
<8, (0, 11, 17)>
<10, (16, 9, 18)>
<12, (5, 15, 18)>
<13, (0, 5, 17)>
<14, (0, 6, 18)>
<15, (13, 1, 6)>
<16, (2, 5, 18)>
<17, (8, 13, 17)>
<18, (14, 1, 16)>
<19, (7, 3, 19)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
