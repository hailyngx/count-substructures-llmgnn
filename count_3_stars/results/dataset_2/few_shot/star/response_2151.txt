Response:
First, let's identify the center nodes having exactly three adjacent nodes. These would be the potential centers of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 13, 4, and 12.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 12, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 4.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 7, 0, and 13.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each potential center node:
1. For Node 1:
   - <1, (3, 5, 9)>
   [1]

2. For Node 2:
   - <2, (13, 4, 12)>
   [1]

3. For Node 6:
   - <6, (3, 12, 7)>
   [1]

4. For Node 9:
   - <9, (1, 8, 4)>
   [1]

5. For Node 11:
   - <11, (7, 0, 13)>
   [1]

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
