Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected in a 3-star pattern with one node being the center and the other three nodes being the leaves.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes have the following connections that form a 3-star:
1. Node 2 with neighbors 12, 14, 15
2. Node 4 with neighbors 11, 22, 5
3. Node 5 with neighbors 4, 10, 13
4. Node 6 with neighbors 1, 11, 28
5. Node 9 with neighbors 0, 3
6. Node 12 with neighbors 2, 14, 26
7. Node 13 with neighbors 5, 21, 29
8. Node 14 with neighbors 0, 2, 11, 12
9. Node 16 with neighbors 1, 15, 25
10. Node 18 with neighbors 25, 27
11. Node 20 with neighbors 1, 7, 27
12. Node 22 with neighbors 3, 4, 12, 24
13. Node 25 with neighbors 0, 2, 10, 18
14. Node 26 with neighbors 12, 19, 22
15. Node 27 with neighbors 18, 19, 20, 29
16. Node 28 with neighbors 6, 14, 21

By counting the occurrences of each node being in a 3-star pattern, we can find the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph. Let's denote the number of occurrences of each node being in a 3-star as follows:
- Node 2: 3 occurrences
- Node 4: 3 occurrences
- Node 5: 3 occurrences
- Node 6: 3 occurrences
- Node 9: 1 occurrence
- Node 12: 2 occurrences
- Node 13: 1 occurrence
- Node 14: 2 occurrences
- Node 16: 1 occurrence
- Node 18: 2 occurrences
- Node 20: 1 occurrence
- Node 22: 2 occurrences
- Node 25: 1 occurrence
- Node 26: 1 occurrence
- Node 27: 1 occurrence
- Node 28: 1 occurrence

Therefore, by summing up the occurrences of each node being in a 3-star, we get a total of 27 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
