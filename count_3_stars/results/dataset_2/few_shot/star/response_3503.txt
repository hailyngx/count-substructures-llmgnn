Response:
The central node of a 3-star graph will always have degree 3. Therefore, we need to find all nodes with degree 3 and check their neighbors to see if they form a 3-star configuration.

Let's go through the nodes one by one:

- Node 0 has degree 3 but does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has degree 4, so it's not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 2 has degree 4, so it's not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 3 has degree 4, so it's not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 4 has degree 4, so it's not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 5 has degree 3 and forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 14, and 20. <5, (9, 14, 20)>
- Node 6 has degree 2, so it's not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 7 has degree 3 but does not form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has degree 3 but does not form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has degree 2, so it's not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 10 has degree 2, so it's not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 11 has degree 3 but does not form a 3-star.
- Node 12 has degree 2, so it's not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 13 has degree 3 but does not form a 3-star.
- Node 14 has degree 2, so it's not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 15 has degree 2, so it's not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 16 has degree 3 but does not form a 3-star.
- Node 17 has degree 5, so it's not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 18 has degree 1, so it's not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 19 has degree 1, so it's not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 20 has degree 2, so it's not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 21 has degree 4, so it's not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 22 has degree 4, so it's not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 23 has degree 4, so it's not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 24 has degree 3 but does not form a 3-star.
- Node 25 has degree 3 but does not form a 3-star.
- Node 26 has degree 3 but does not form a 3-star.
- Node 27 has degree 4, so it's not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 28 has degree 3 but does not form a 3-star.
- Node 29 has degree 2, so it's not a central node of a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <5, (9, 14, 20)>.
