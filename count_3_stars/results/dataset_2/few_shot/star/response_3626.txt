Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph by looking for nodes that have exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes. 

We can start by looking at each node and counting the number of 3-stars it is part of. 

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 5: <1, (2, 4, 5)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8: <5, (1, 7, 8)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 7: <6, (1, 4, 7)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 9: <8, (2, 5, 9)>
Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 9: <0, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-star graphs in the given graph. So, the count of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
