Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the following 3-star combinations exist:
<0, (5, 1, 11)>
<1, (9, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 12)>
<4, (10, 0, 14)>
<5, (6, 2, 0)>
<6, (5, 11, 7)>
<7, (9, 3, 10)>
<8, (9, 1, 3)>
<9, (8, 1, 7)>
<10, (11, 8, 7)>
<11, (10, 14, 0)>
<12, (9, 3, 8)>
<13, (1, 10, 6)>
<14, (11, 0, 4)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
