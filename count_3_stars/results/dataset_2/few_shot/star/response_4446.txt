Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will act as the centers of the 3-stars.

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 12
- Node 13
- Node 14
- Node 17
- Node 21
- Node 25

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
1. <1, (6, 10, 23)>
2. <4, (0, 12, 19)>
3. <5, (8, 28, 29)>
4. <6, (16, 18, 1)>
5. <12, (4, 8, 28)>
6. <13, (22, 25, 27)>
7. <14, (21, 24, 28)>
8. <17, (11, 21, 25)>
9. <21, (10, 14, 17)>
10. <25, (13, 17, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
