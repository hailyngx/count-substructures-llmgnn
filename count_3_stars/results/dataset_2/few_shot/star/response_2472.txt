Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 8) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 10) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 11) (12, 1) (16, 12) (16, 9) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 13) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 1) (19, 17) (19, 6) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 2) (1, 12) (1, 18) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 1) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 9) (13, 1) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 12, 18, 2, and node 13
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 14, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 15
Node 4 is connected to node 10, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 10, 18, 11, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 12, and node 19

Node 14 is connected to node 15, 7, 2, and node 13
Node 15 is connected to node 3, 13, and node 14
Node 16 is connected to node 12, and node 9
Node 17 is connected to node 19, 8, and node 7
Node 18 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 1
Node 19 is connected to node 17, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph based on the given adjacency list and edges. 

1. <5, (0, 10, 18)>
2. <12, (1, 11, 16)>
3. <13, (1, 9, 15)>
4. <14, (2, 7, 15)>
5. <17, (7, 8, 19)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [5] 3-stars.
