Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the adjacency list and the given edges, we can identify all the 3-stars in the graph.

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 18, 19)>
<1, (0, 6, 15)>
<2, (0, 5, 11)>
<3, (8, 19, -)>
<4, (13, 14, -)>
<5, (2, 10, 12)>
<6, (1, 7, 13)>
<7, (6, 14, 16)>
<8, (3, 16, 18)>
<9, (12, -,-)>
<10, (5, 11, 17)>
<11, (2, 10, 14)>
<12, (5, 9, 17)>
<13, (4, 6, 7)>
<14, (4, 7, 18)>
<15, (1,-, -)>
<16, (7, 8, 10)>
<17, (10, 11, 12)>
<18, (0, 8, 14)>
<19, (0, 3, 12)>

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
