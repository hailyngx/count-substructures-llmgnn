Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided information, we can identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 10, 17, 1
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 6
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 10, 12
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 3, 5, 17
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 4, 12
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 16, 1, 19
- Node 7: Connected to node 9
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 13, 17, 3
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 16, 3
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 2, 5, 14
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 13, 12, 18
- Node 15: Connected to nodes 16, 19

Now, let's list out the unique 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (10, 17, 1)>
- <1, (0, 6, 16)>
- <2, (10, 12, 14)>
- <4, (3, 5, 17)>
- <5, (4, 12, 14)>
- <6, (1, 16, 19)>
- <8, (3, 13, 17)>
- <11, (3, 16, 19)>
- <12, (2, 14, 5)>
- <14, (13, 12, 18)>
- <15, (16, 19, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[11]
