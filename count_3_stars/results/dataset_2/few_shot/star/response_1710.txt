Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's identify these 3-stars.

The given graph has the following 3-stars:

1. <4, (12, 3, 10)>
2. <7, (3, 5, 1)>
3. <10, (4, 12, 8)>
4. <1, (7, 6, 12)>
5. <2, (11, 13, 14)>
6. <3, (4, 7, 0)>
7. <5, (7, 10, 6)>
8. <6, (11, 13, 5)>
9. <8, (10, 13, 9)>
10. <9, (0, 14, 3)>
11. <11, (14, 6, 2)>
12. <12, (4, 10, 8)>
13. <13, (10, 8, 2)>
14. <14, (11, 9, 1)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
