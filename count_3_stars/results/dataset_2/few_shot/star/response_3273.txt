Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Observations:
- From the adjacency list, we can see the connections between nodes.
- A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
- We need to find all such configurations in the graph.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, and 10: <1, (2, 8, 10)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 10: <1, (5, 8, 10)>
3. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 10: <1, (2, 5, 10)>
4. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 13: <1, (2, 5, 13)>
5. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 10, and 13: <1, (2, 10, 13)>

6. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 13: <3, (2, 6, 13)>
7. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 13: <3, (4, 6, 13)>
8. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 13: <3, (2, 4, 13)>

9. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 11, and 14: <7, (8, 11, 14)>
10. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 12, and 14: <7, (8, 12, 14)>
11. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 11, and 14: <7, (2, 11, 14)>
12. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, and 14: <7, (2, 8, 14)>
13. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 11, and 8: <7, (2, 11, 8)>

14. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 12, and 13: <10, (0, 12, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
