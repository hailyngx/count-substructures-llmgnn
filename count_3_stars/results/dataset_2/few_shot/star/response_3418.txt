Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star by locating the central node and its three neighboring nodes connected to it. 

From the given information, we can find the 3-stars as follows:

1. <0, (4, 6, 1)>
2. <0, (4, 6, 3)>
3. <0, (4, 6, 3)>
4. <1, (7, 3, 0)>
5. <3, (4, 6, 1)>
6. <3, (4, 6, 2)>
7. <4, (5, 7, 0)>
8. <4, (5, 7, 9)>
9. <4, (5, 7, 3)>
10. <6, (9, 7, 3)>
11. <6, (9, 7, 4)>
12. <9, (8, 2, 7)>
13. <9, (8, 2, 6)>
14. <9, (8, 2, 4)>

Therefore, there are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
