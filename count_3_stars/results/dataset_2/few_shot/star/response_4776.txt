Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, 9, 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the possible 3-stars could have central nodes at: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

After analyzing the graph, we find the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<1, (5, 8, 4)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 4)>
<4, (5, 6, 3)>
<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 3)>
<7, (6, 9, 3)>
<8, (5, 1)>
<9, (2, 1, 7)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.     
So, the final answer is [10].
