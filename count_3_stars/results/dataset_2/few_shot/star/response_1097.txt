Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the given graph and the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 2, 3)>
<0, (5, 7, 3)>
<0, (5, 2, 7)>
<0, (7, 2, 3)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<2, (9, 4, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 2)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
