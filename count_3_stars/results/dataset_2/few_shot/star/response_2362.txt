Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (9, 17, 22)>
<1, (14, 23, 25)>
<2, (10, 13, 24)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 23)>
<6, (7, 20, 28)>
<7, (4, 11, 21)>
<10, (19, 28, 29)>
<12, (16, 17, 29)>
<13, (2, 5, 20)>
<14, (1, 23, 26)>
<15, (20, 24, 15)>
<16, (12, 27, 16)>
<19, (10, 19, 25)>
<21, (7, 19, 29)>
<22, (0, 18, 22)>
<24, (2, 15, 24)>
<25, (1, 19, 25)>
<26, (14, 27, 26)>
<27, (16, 26, 27)>
<28, (6, 10, 28)>
<29, (10, 12, 21)>

There are a total of 22 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [22].
