Node 18 is connected to node 7, 11, and node 14
Node 19 is connected to node 1, and node 10

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Nodes 0, 2, and 4 form a 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 13)>
- Nodes 1, 5, and 19 form a 3-star: <1, (5, 19, 13)>
- Nodes 2, 4, and 17 form a 3-star: <2, (4, 17, 7)>
- Nodes 5, 10, and 1 form a 3-star: <5, (10, 1, 13)>
- Nodes 7, 9, and 17 form a 3-star: <7, (9, 17, 16)>
- Nodes 8, 15, and 6 form a 3-star: <8, (15, 6, 9)>
- Nodes 9, 13, and 1 form a 3-star: <9, (13, 1, 11)>
- Nodes 11, 18, and 5 form a 3-star: <11, (18, 5, 0)>
- Nodes 12, 15, and 13 form a 3-star: <12, (15, 13, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
