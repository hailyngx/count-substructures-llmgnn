Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

    1. For each node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If it is, we have found a 3-star. List it as <center, (leaves)>.

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:

    <0, (1, 11, 19)>
    <1, (0, 3, 13)>
    <2, (14, 16, 26)>
    <3, (1, 15, 17)>
    <4, (1, 13, 22)>
    <5, (23, 24)>
    <6, (15, 24, 29)>
    <7, (11, 25, 28)>
    <8, (9, 14, 26)>
    <9, (0, 8, 29)>
    <11, (0, 7, 27)>
    <12, (19, 23)>
    <13, (1, 4, 28)>
    <14, (2, 8, 20)>
    <15, (3, 6, 18)>
    <16, (2, 20)>
    <17, (3, 20, 21)>
    <19, (0, 10, 24)>
    <20, (14, 16, 17)>
    <21, (17, 25, 28)>
    <22, (4)>
    <23, (5, 11, 12)>
    <24, (5, 6, 15)>
    <25, (7, 21, 27)>
    <26, (2)>
    <27, (11, 25, 28)>
    <28, (0, 7, 13)>
    <29, (6, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars and putting the final answer inside brackets:

    [27]
