Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. In a 3-star, one node is the center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 7, 5)>
2. <1, (4, 6, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 7, 8)>
4. <3, (7, 9, 8)>
5. <4, (1, 9, 8)>
6. <5, (0, 8, 7)>
7. <6, (1, 4)>
8. <7, (0, 4, 3)>
9. <8, (2, 4, 3)>
10. <9, (4, 1, 7)>

Now that we have identified all the unique 3-stars in the graph, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
