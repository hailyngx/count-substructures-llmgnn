Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Starting from each node, we can check if it is the center of a 3-star by examining its adjacency list. 

Here are the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (4, 2, 9)>
<2, (9, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<6, (9, 2, 4)>
<7, (5, 2, 0)>
<8, (4, 2, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 3)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [10]
