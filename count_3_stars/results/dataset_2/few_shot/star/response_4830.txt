Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with only 3 connections are nodes 1, 10, 12, 14, and 23. 
    - For node 1: <1, (15, 22, 5)>
    - For node 10: <10, (15, 22, 5)>
    - For node 12: <12, (8, 28, 3)>
    - For node 14: <14, (20, 23, 5)>
    - For node 23: <23, (20, 14, 5)>

2. From the provided edges, we can identify additional 3-stars:
    - <8, (12, 28, 26)>
    - <15, (1, 10, 22)>
    - <16, (9, 27, 5)>
    - <26, (25, 8, 29)>
    - <27, (5, 21, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
