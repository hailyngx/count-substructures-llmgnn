Response:
First, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Based on the given adjacency list and edge connections, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 11, 14)>
<3, (1, 10, 14)>
<4, (11, 15, 19)>
<5, (3, 15, 18)>
<6, (7, 11, 19)>
<7, (9, 16, 6)>
<9, (0, 10, 7)>
<10, (3, 8, 9)>
<11, (1, 2, 6)>
<14, (0, 1, 15)>
<15, (2, 4, 14)>
<18, (0, 3, 5)>
<19, (4, 6, 17)>

Next, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars.
