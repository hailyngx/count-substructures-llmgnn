Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to count all possible combinations of a central node and its three connected nodes.

Let's list all unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 6, 1)>
<1, (5, 7, 2)>
<2, (9, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 4, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [4].
