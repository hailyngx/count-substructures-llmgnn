Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 6) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 1) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 10, 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 12, 8, 9, 6, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 12, 5, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 13, 8, 6, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 11, 13, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 11, 12, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 12, 0, 14, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 10, 11, 13, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 0, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 9, 6, 5, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 11, 7, 2, 14, 6, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 3, 9, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 7, 12, and node 13

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:

<6, (11, 12, 3)>
<7, (12, 14, 0)>
<8, (5, 3, 1)>
<12, (11, 7, 2)>
<13, (5, 9, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
