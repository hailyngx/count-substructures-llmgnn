Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the adjacency list to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 14, and 13. Since node 0 has exactly three connections, it forms a 3-star. 
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 17, 4, 16, and 5. However, it doesn't form a 3-star as it has four connections.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 9 and 14. It doesn't form a 3-star as it has only two connections.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 17 and 14. It doesn't form a 3-star as it has only two connections.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 18, 19, 5, and 1. It doesn't form a 3-star as it has four connections.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 14, and 1. It doesn't form a 3-star as it has three connections but is not a central node.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 7 and 13. It doesn't form a 3-star as it has only two connections.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 6 and 17. It doesn't form a 3-star as it has only two connections.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 18. It doesn't form a 3-star as it has only two connections.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 15, 2, and 16. It forms a 3-star with itself as the central node.
11. Node 10 is connected to nodes 15, 11, 18, and 13. It doesn't form a 3-star as it has four connections.
12. Node 11 is connected to nodes 15, 10, 13, and 12. It forms a 3-star with itself as the central node.
13. Node 12 is connected to nodes 11 and 19. It doesn't form a 3-star as it has only two connections.
14. Node 13 is connected to nodes 6, 10, 11, and 0. It forms a 3-star with itself as the central node.
15. Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 2, 0, and 5. It doesn't form a 3-star as it has four connections.
16. Node 15 is connected to nodes 10, 9, 11, and 16. It forms a 3-star with itself as the central node.
17. Node 16 is connected to nodes 15, 9, and 1. It forms a 3-star with itself as the central node.
18. Node 17 is connected to nodes 3, 1, and 7. It forms a 3-star with itself as the central node.
19. Node 18 is connected to nodes 10, 8, and 4. It forms a 3-star with itself as the central node.
20. Node 19 is connected to nodes 4 and 12. It doesn't form a 3-star as it has only two connections.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: <0, (8, 14, 13)>, <9, (15, 2, 16)>, <11, (15, 10, 13)>, <13, (6, 10, 11)>, <15, (10, 9, 16)>, <16, (15, 9, 1)>, and <17, (3, 1, 7)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
