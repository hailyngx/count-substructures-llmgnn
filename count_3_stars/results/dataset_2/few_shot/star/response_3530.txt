Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From the adjacency list, we can see that the total degree of each node, i.e., the number of edges connected to each node, is as follows:
    - Node 0: degree = 3
    - Node 1: degree = 5
    - Node 2: degree = 2
    - Node 3: degree = 5
    - Node 4: degree = 3
    - Node 5: degree = 3
    - Node 6: degree = 3
    - Node 7: degree = 4
    - Node 8: degree = 3
    - Node 9: degree = 4
    - Node 10: degree = 1
    - Node 11: degree = 1
    - Node 12: degree = 3
    - Node 13: degree = 5
    - Node 14: degree = 4
    - Node 15: degree = 3
    - Node 16: degree = 1
    - Node 17: degree = 3
    - Node 18: degree = 1
    - Node 19: degree = 3

- We observe that for a 3-star to exist, the center node must have a degree of 3 and the leaf nodes must have a degree of 1.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<2, (1, 13, 17)>
<10, (4, 0, 18)>
<11, (14, 3, 8)>
<16, (19, 6, -)>
<18, (4, 0, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
