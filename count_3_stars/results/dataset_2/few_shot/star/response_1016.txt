Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Since a central node in a 3-star is connected to exactly three other nodes, we can find all the nodes that have 3 neighbors. These nodes will be the potential central nodes of 3-stars.

From the adjacency list:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 12 (connected to 13, 9, 29), 14 (connected to 26, 27, 7), 19 (connected to 2, 14, 6), 21 (connected to 3, 25, 2)

Now, for each potential central node, let's check their neighboring nodes to form 3-stars:

1. For central node 12:
   - <12, (13, 9, 29)> 
   
2. For central node 14:
   - <14, (26, 27, 7)>
   
3. For central node 19:
   - <19, (2, 14, 6)>
   
4. For central node 21:
   - <21, (3, 25, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
