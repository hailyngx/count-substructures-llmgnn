Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

By examining the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the possible 3-stars. Let's list them:

<1, (6, 15, 18)>
<2, (6, 12, 4)>
<3, (14, 5, 19)>
<4, (16, 15, 2)>
<5, (11, 6, 14)>
<6, (5, 1, 2)>
<7, (16, 9, 12)>
<8, (17, 10, 0)>
<10, (8, 2, 18)>
<11, (16, 13, 5)>
<12, (7, 2, 19)>
<13, (11, 19, 10)>
<14, (3, 5)>
<15, (7, 1, 4)>
<16, (11, 7, 17)>
<17, (16, 8)>
<18, (1, 10)>
<19, (12, 5, 3)>

Now let's count the number of unique 3-stars we have listed above.
