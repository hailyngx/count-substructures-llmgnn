This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 11) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 4) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 10) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 11
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 11, 10, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 12, 0, 13, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 14, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 12, 2, 13, 14, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 13, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 10
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 11, 14, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 12, and node 10
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 10
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 12, 13, and node 8
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 2, 10, and node 8
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, 4, and node 10
Node 14 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 2, 11)>
<1, (6, 11, 10)>
<2, (3, 12, 13)>
<3, (7, 14, 2)>
<4, (9, 12, 13)>
<5, (6, 13, 0)>
<6, (5, 1, 10)>
<7, (3, 11, 14)>
<8, (1, 3, 12)>
<9, (4, 10, 12)>
<10, (9, 6, 1)>
<11, (1, 7, 0)>
<12, (4, 2, 10)>
<13, (5, 7, 4)>
<14, (3, 7, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 14.
