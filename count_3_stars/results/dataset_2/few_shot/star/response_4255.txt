Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph based on the definition provided.

Starting with the center node, we will look for nodes that are directly connected to it. We will then form 3-stars with the center node and the three connected nodes.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (4, 7, 12)>
<1, (3, 6, 5)>
<2, (3, 14, 0)>
<3, (4, 1, 11)>
<4, (7, 9, 13)>
<5, (1, 12, 10)>
<6, (1)>
<7, (4, 12, 0)>
<8, (3, 13, 11)>
<9, (4, 7, 13)>
<10, (1, 13, 14)>
<11, (3, 8, 14)>
<12, (7, 1, 5)>
<13, (4, 7, 8)>
<14, (2, 0, 11)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
