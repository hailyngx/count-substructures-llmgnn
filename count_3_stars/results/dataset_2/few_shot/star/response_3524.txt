Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, 9, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern.

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-stars as it is connected to 4 nodes not forming a star.
- Node 1: <1, (3, 6, 5)>
- Node 2: No 3-stars as it is connected to 3 nodes not forming a star.
- Node 3: No 3-stars as it is connected to 4 nodes not forming a star.
- Node 4: <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 5: <5, (1, 6, 0)>
- Node 6: No 3-stars as it is connected to 4 nodes not forming a star.
- Node 7: <7, (5, 6, 0)>
- Node 8: No 3-stars as it is connected to 3 nodes not forming a star.
- Node 9: No 3-stars as it is connected to 5 nodes not forming a star.

Count of 3-stars: [3]  
Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 6, 5)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 0)>
