Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. For each node, find all its neighboring nodes. Identify nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 has 4 neighboring nodes: 4, 9, 2, 5
- Node 1 has 4 neighboring nodes: 3, 5, 9, 7
- Node 2 has 4 neighboring nodes: 3, 4, 6, 0
- Node 3 has 4 neighboring nodes: 1, 7, 6, 2
- Node 4 has 4 neighboring nodes: 8, 2, 9, 0
- Node 5 has 4 neighboring nodes: 1, 8, 7, 0
- Node 6 has 4 neighboring nodes: 3, 8, 7, 2
- Node 7 has 4 neighboring nodes: 1, 3, 6, 5
- Node 8 has 4 neighboring nodes: 4, 9, 5, 6
- Node 9 has 4 neighboring nodes: 1, 4, 8, 0

2. Looking at the neighboring nodes of each node, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 9, and 5: <0, (4, 9, 5)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 9, and 7: <1, (3, 9, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6: <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 6: <3, (1, 7, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 9, and 0: <4, (2, 9, 0)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 7: <5, (1, 8, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8, and 7: <6, (3, 8, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5: <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 6: <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8: <9, (1, 4, 8)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [10]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10.
