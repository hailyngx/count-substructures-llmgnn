Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the potential centers of the 3-stars.
    
    Potential center nodes: 9, 26, 5, 10, 14, 24
    
Step 2: For each potential center node, check if the nodes connected to it form a 3-star.

    <9, (26, 5, 20)> - forms a 3-star
    <5, (9, 29, 11)> - forms a 3-star
    <10, (6, 3, 18)>
    <14, (27, 16, 19)> - forms a 3-star
    <24, (5, 0, 16)>
    
Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars identified.

    Total number of 3-stars: [4]
    
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
    
Unique 3-stars found:
    <9, (26, 5, 20)>
    <5, (9, 29, 11)>
    <14, (27, 16, 19)>
    <24, (5, 0, 16)>
