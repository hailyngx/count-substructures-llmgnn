Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the 3-stars:

<12, (27, 7, 6)>
<27, (12, 3, 28)>
<7, (12, 27, 6)>
<6, (12, 7, 25)>
<0, (22, 8, 10)>
<14, (23, 20, 10)>
<17, (20, 8, 5)>
<105, (20, 23, 21)>
<16, (28, 24, 1)>
<8, (17, 9, 22)>
<9, (8, 29, 25)>
<22, (0, 8, 10)>
<18, (29, 15, 19)>
<11, (29, 24, 19)>
<15, (28, 18, 1)>
<19, (22, 11, 29)>
<21, (5, 23, 26)>

There are a total of [17] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
