Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's follow the steps:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 1, and 9.
   - Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 5, 12, and 6.
   - Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 8, 5, and 14.
   - Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 13, 7, and 6.
   - Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 13, 9, and 10.

2. List the unique 3-stars found:
   - <2, (3, 1, 9)>
   - <4, (5, 12, 6)>
   - <10, (8, 5, 14)>
   - <11, (13, 7, 6)>
   - <14, (13, 9, 10)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [5]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
