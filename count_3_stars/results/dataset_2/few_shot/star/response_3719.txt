Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 9, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's consider each node as the potential center of a 3-star and check if it satisfies the 3-star definition. 

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph: 
<0, (7, 1, 3)>
<1, (4, 7, 3)>
<2, (4, 1, 5)>
<3, (7, 1, 0)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<5, (7, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 9, 6)>
<7, (4, 0, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 5)>
<9, (3, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
