Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star and then count them.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (6, 2, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 1)>
<4, (7, 0, 14)>
<7, (5, 4, 0)>
<2, (5, 8, 0)>
<3, (6, 9, 14)>
<6, (5, 8, 14)>
<8, (2, 14, 6)>
<0, (9, 4, 7)>
<10, (5, 0, 14)>
<1, (9, 4, 11)>
<11, (4, 13, 1)>
<12, (9, 13, 1)>
<13, (7, 12, 11)>
<14, (4, 8, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
