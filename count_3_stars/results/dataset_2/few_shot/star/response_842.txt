Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the 3-stars present in the graph based on the given adjacency list. Then we can count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Based on the given adjacency list, the 3-stars in this graph are:

<0, (14, 1, 2)>
<1, (9, 0, 2)>
<2, (10, 4, 0)>
<3, (4, 8, 14)>
<4, (5, 8, 2)>
<5, (6, 12, 4)>
<6, (5, 11, 8)>
<7, (9, 11, 13)>
<8, (11, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 13)>
<10, (11, 2, 14)>
<11, (10, 7, 13)>
<12, (5, 6, 3)>
<13, (9, 11, 7)>
<14, (10, 6, 3)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: [14].
