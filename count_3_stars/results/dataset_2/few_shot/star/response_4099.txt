Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (12, 1) (12, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 2) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 14, 10, 13, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 9, 12, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 9, 13, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 10, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 5, 14, 10, and node 11
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, 13, and node 8
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, 14, and node 12
Node 11 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 1, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 9
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 10

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for each node in the graph that is connected to exactly three other nodes. We can then identify the 3-stars by considering each of these nodes as the center of a potential 3-star.

Nodes with 3 connections:
- Node 2 is connected to 4, 7, 11
- Node 8 is connected to 1, 3, 5
- Node 12 is connected to 1, 10
- Node 13 is connected to 0, 4, 9
- Node 14 is connected to 0, 5, 6

Therefore, there are 5 potential 3-stars in the graph.
