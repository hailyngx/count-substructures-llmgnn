Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step based on the definition provided.

1. Look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the central nodes of 3-star graphs. From the adjacency list, the nodes that meet this criteria are:
   - Node 8 (connected to 6, 19, 3)
   - Node 10 (connected to 28, 3)
   - Node 17 (connected to 15, 4)
   - Node 19 (connected to 16, 8)
   - Node 21 (connected to 14, 26)
   - Node 22 (connected to 28, 24)

2. For each of the central nodes identified, list out the three leaves connected to them. Check if these leaves are connected to each other forming a 3-star pattern.

    - For Node 8:
      Leaves: 6, 19, 3
      3-star: None
    - For Node 10:
      Leaves: 28, 3
      3-star: <10, (28, 3, 18)>
    - For Node 17:
      Leaves: 15, 4
      3-star: None
    - For Node 19:
      Leaves: 16, 8
      3-star: <19, (16, 11, 28)>
    - For Node 21:
      Leaves: 14, 26
      3-star: None
    - For Node 22:
      Leaves: 28, 24
      3-star: None

3. Counting the total number of unique 3-stars found:
   - <10, (28, 3, 18)>
   - <19, (16, 11, 28)>
   
   [Total number of 3-stars: 2] 
   [2]
