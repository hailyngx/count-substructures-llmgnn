Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify these 3-stars step by step:

1. Nodes with 3 connections:
   - Node 9: (9, 6, 21), (9, 6, 12)
   - Node 26: (26, 19, 15), (26, 19, 3)
   - Node 6: (6, 9, 24), (6, 9, 15)
   - Node 25: (25, 3, 0), (25, 3, 20)
   - Node 12: (12, 9, 27), (12, 9, 5)
   - Node 0: (0, 3, 25), (0, 3, 4)
   - Node 4: (4, 0, 8), (4, 0, 18)
   - Node 8: (8, 3, 4), (8, 3, 19)
   - Node 17: (17, 29, 7)
   - Node 7: (7, 8, 17), (7, 8, 11)
   - Node 24: (24, 6, 18), (24, 6, 5)
   - Node 23: (23, 29, 1), (23, 29, 19)
   - Node 11: (11, 20, 7), (11, 20, 2)
   - Node 21: (21, 9, 8), (21, 9, 14)

2. Putting them in the format <center, leaves>:
   - <9, (6, 21, 12)>
   - <26, (19, 15, 3)>
   - <6, (9, 24, 15)>
   - <25, (3, 0, 20)>
   - <12, (9, 27, 5)>
   - <0, (3, 25, 4)>
   - <4, (0, 8, 18)>
   - <8, (3, 4, 19)>
   - <17, (29, 7, 17)>
   - <7, (8, 17, 11)>
   - <24, (6, 18, 5)>
   - <23, (29, 1, 19)>
   - <11, (20, 7, 2)>
   - <21, (9, 8, 14)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
