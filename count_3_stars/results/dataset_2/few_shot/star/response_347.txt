Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that the possible center nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

2. For each possible center node, we will look for sets of three nodes that are directly connected to the center node.

3. Count the unique 3-stars found. 

Here are the unique 3-stars identified:
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<9, (5, 1, 13)>
<4, (7, 8, 13)>
<7, (4, 3, 14)>
<8, (4, 13, 0)>
<13, (5, 9, 4)>
<10, (11, 0, 14)>
<11, (10, 12, 7)>
<12, (8, 11, 2)>
<6, (5, 4, 12)>
<3, (7, 6, 14)>
<1, (5, 9, 14)>
<2, (5, 4, 13)>
<0, (8, 13, 10)>
<14, (7, 10, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
