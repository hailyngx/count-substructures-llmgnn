Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
There are multiple ways to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. One way is to iterate through each node and check if there are exactly three edges connected to it, forming a 3-star. I will do this step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 3 has 2 edges connected, so it is not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 edges connected to it: (5,1), (5,4), and (5,7). Node 5 is the center of a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 edges connected, so it is not a center of a 3-star.

Step 2: Identify the leaves connected to the center nodes found in Step 1:
- For Node 5: Leaves are 1, 4, 7.
  <5, (1, 4, 7)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.
- Total 3-stars: [1]

Here is the final answer inside brackets: [1].
The unique 3-star found is <5, (1, 4, 7)>.
