Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the adjacency list of each node to find the 3-stars:

- **Node 6:** (1, 5, 7)
    - <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- **Node 9:** (6, 13, 15)
    - <9, (6, 13, 15)>
- **Node 1:** (6, 11, 18)
    - <1, (6, 11, 18)>
- **Node 3:** (4, 12, 16)
- **Node 4:** (3)
- **Node 5:** (2, 6, 11)
- **Node 7:** (6, 12, 13)
- **Node 0:** (8, 13)
- **Node 2:** (5, 15)
- **Node 8:** (0, 18)
- **Node 10:** (14, 12, 17)
- **Node 11:** (1, 5, 14)
- **Node 12:** (3, 7, 10)
- **Node 13:** (0, 7, 9)
- **Node 14:** (10, 11, 17)
- **Node 15:** (2, 9, 17)
- **Node 16:** (3, 9)
- **Node 17:** (10, 11, 15)
- **Node 18:** (1, 8, 9)
- **Node 19:** (14, 18)

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars:
- <1, (6, 11, 18)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <9, (6, 13, 15)>
- <10, (14, 11, 17)>
- <15, (2, 9, 17)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
