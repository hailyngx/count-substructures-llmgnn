Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 14) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 12) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 3) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 10) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 12, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 13, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 13, 11, 14, 2, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 10, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 13, 10, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 10, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 11, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 13, 1, 0, and node 10
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 13, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 3, 11, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, 10, 9, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 5, 13, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<4, (7, 8, 14)>
<7, (4, 2, 1)>
<8, (4, 11, 12)>
<5, (6, 13, 14)>
<6, (5, 1, 10)>
<13, (2, 3, 9)>
<3, (13, 11, 14)>
<11, (8, 3, 12)>
<1, (7, 9, 6)>
<0, (6, 12, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
