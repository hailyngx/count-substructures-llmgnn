Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure.
    
    Let's start by examining each node:
    
    - Node 0: Connected to 5, 9, 7, 8, and 2
    - Node 1: Connected to 5, 4, 6, 3, 2, and 8
    - Node 2: Connected to 5, 9, 4, 1, and 0
    - Node 3: Connected to 6, 1, and 8
    - Node 4: Connected to 7, 8, 1, and 2
    - Node 5: Connected to 2, 1, and 0
    - Node 6: Connected to 9, 7, 1, and 3
    - Node 7: Connected to 4, 0, and 6
    - Node 8: Connected to 4, 1, 3, and 0
    - Node 9: Connected to 6, 2, and 0

Based on the connections listed for each node, we can identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

<5, (2, 1, 0)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 0)>
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<7, (4, 0, 6)>
<6, (9, 7, 1)>
<8, (4, 1, 3)>
<9, (6, 2, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
