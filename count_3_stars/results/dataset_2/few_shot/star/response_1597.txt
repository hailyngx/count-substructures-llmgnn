Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 0)>
<6, (4, 7, 1)>
<7, (4, 3, 2)>
<8, (9, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
