Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can go through each node and identify how many three-node stars it participates in. 

Starting with Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 2, 3, and 13.
    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 0, 11, and 10.
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 0, and 13.
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 5, and 0.
    - Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 2, and 0.
Based on these connections, we find <0, (7, 2, 13)>.

Moving on to Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 12, 8, 11, and 14.
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 3, 1, and 12.
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 13, 10, 5, and 1.
    - Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 10, 14, and 1.
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 10, 3, and 1.
    - Node 11 is connected to nodes 7, 5, 14, and 1.
    - Node 14 is connected to nodes 12, 11, 1, and 10.
Based on these connections, we find <1, (9, 4, 12)>, <1, (9, 8, 14)>, and <1, (4, 12, 14)>.

Following the same procedure for the remaining nodes, we find:
- Node 2 does not participate in any 3-stars.
- Node 3 participates in <3, (9, 8, 5)>.
- Node 4 participates in <4, (7, 13, 10)>, <4, (7, 1, 11)>, and <4, (13, 1, 11)>.
- Node 5 participates in <5, (6, 11, 3)>.
- Node 6 participates in <6, (9, 5, 11)>.
- Node 7 participates in <7, (4, 0, 10)> and <7, (4, 1, 11)>.
- Node 8 participates in <8, (10, 3, 1)>.
- Node 9 participates in <9, (6, 2, 12)>.
- Node 10 participates in <10, (12, 14, 1)>.
- Node 11 participates in <11, (7, 5, 14)>.
- Node 12 participates in <12, (9, 10, 14)>.
- Node 13 does not participate in any 3-stars.
- Node 14 does not participate in any 3-stars.

Counting the total number of 3-stars found, we have a total of 16 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which can be represented as:
<0, (7, 2, 13)>, <1, (9, 4, 12)>, <1, (9, 8, 14)>, <1, (4, 12, 14)>, <3, (9, 8, 5)>, <4, (7, 13, 10)>, <4, (7, 1, 11)>, <4, (13, 1, 11)>, <5, (6, 11, 3)>, <6, (9, 5, 11)>, <7, (4, 0, 10)>, <7, (4, 1, 11)>, <8, (10, 3, 1)>, <9, (6, 2, 12)>, <10, (12, 14, 1)>, <11, (7, 5, 14)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
