Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 1

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 8 as its leaves.
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, and 8 as its leaves.
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 0 as its leaves.
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 6 as its leaves.
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 0 as its leaves.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5. 
So, the final answer is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (9, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 0)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<6, (9, 4, 0)>
