Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

From the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can find the following 3-stars:

<0, (4, 1, 2)>
<1, (7, 3, 11)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 13, 11)>
<4, (7, 2, 14)>
<5, (7, 13, 10)>
<6, (9, 11, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 1)>
<8, (7, 6, 14)>
<9, (3, 6, 12)>
<10, (5, 2, 14)>
<11, (1, 3, 6)>
<12, (9, 13, 0)>
<13, (3, 5, 12)>
<14, (4, 8, 13)>

The total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is therefore [14].
