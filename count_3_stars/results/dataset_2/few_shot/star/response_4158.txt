Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 1) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 3) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 3) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 14, 10, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 13, 12, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 12, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 11, and node 10
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 12, 0, 3, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 11, 4, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 12, 10, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 11
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 7, 12, 0, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 3
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, 10, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 1
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 12, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 11)>
<6, (11, 4, 13)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 12, 14)>
<8, (9, 4, 2)>
<13, (6, 4, 1)>
<12, (5, 7, 2)>
<0, (5, 14, 10)>
<2, (8, 12, 3)>
<3, (5, 4, 2)>
<11, (9, 6, 3)>
<10, (5, 7, 12)>
<1, (8, 13, 12)>
<14, (4, 7, 0)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars identified: [15].
