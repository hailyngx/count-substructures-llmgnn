Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 9, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph to count them.

From the provided information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (6, 9, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 3, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (7, 5, 2)>
<5, (4, 7, 1)>
<6, (3, 9, 2)>
<7, (4, 5, 0)>
<8, (1, 9, 5)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>

So, there are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
