Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

It's given that the graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. We can start by listing the nodes and their connections to determine the 3-star configurations.

Checking the given adjacency list for each node and noting the 3-star patterns we find:
- Node 5: (14, 24, 28)
- Node 9: (13, 17, 3)
- Node 1: (22, 26, 28)
- Node 3: (9, 21, 26)
- Node 7: (0, 10, 26)
- Node 17: (11, 23, 29)
- Node 14: (4, 13, 23)
- Node 20: (6, 16, 27)
- Node 11: (24, 25, 17)
- Node 15: (19, 23, 28)

Counting the unique 3-star configurations:
<5, (14, 24, 28)>
<9, (13, 17, 3)>
<1, (22, 26, 28)>
<3, (9, 21, 26)>
<7, (0, 10, 26)>
<17, (11, 23, 29)>
<14, (4, 13, 23)>
<20, (6, 16, 27)>
<11, (24, 25, 17)>
<15, (19, 23, 28)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
