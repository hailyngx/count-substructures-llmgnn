Response:
Based on the given graph and adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes with 3 edges (degree 3) - these nodes can be centers of 3-stars:
- Node 4 has edges with nodes 7, 16, and 11.
- Node 21 has edges with nodes 10, 27, and 22.
- Node 24 has edges with nodes 21, 6, and 11.
- Node 18 has edges with nodes 25, 29, and 26.

2. Identify 3-stars with the identified center nodes:
- For Node 4:
    <4, (7, 16, 11)>
- For Node 21:
    <21, (10, 27, 22)>
- For Node 24:
    <24, (21, 6, 11)>
- For Node 18:
    <18, (25, 29, 26)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, so the answer is [4].]
