Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star graph must have a central node with exactly three leaves. 

Since the graph has 10 nodes, let's analyze each node to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: It is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 5. <0, (6, 7, 8)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 1: It is connected to nodes 3, 2, and 8. <1, (3, 2, 8)> is a 3-star.
3. Node 2: It is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7. <2, (1, 3, 7)> is a 3-star.
4. Node 3: It is connected to nodes 9, 1, 2, 5, 8, and 4. <3, (9, 1, 2)>, <3, (9, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)> are the 3-stars from this node.
5. Node 4: It is connected to nodes 6, 3, 7, and 5. <4, (6, 3, 7)> is a 3-star.
6. Node 5: It is connected to nodes 6, 3, 4, and 2. <5, (6, 3, 4)> is a 3-star.
7. Node 6: It is connected to nodes 5, 7, 4, and 0. <6, (5, 7, 4)> is a 3-star.
8. Node 7: It is connected to nodes 6, 9, 4, 0, and 2. <7, (6, 9, 4)> is a 3-star.
9. Node 8: It is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 0. <8, (1, 3, 0)> is a 3-star.
10. Node 9: It is connected to nodes 3 and 7. No 3-star from this node.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 2, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <3, (9, 1, 2)>, <3, (9, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (6, 3, 7)>, <5, (6, 3, 4)>, <6, (5, 7, 4)>, and <7, (6, 9, 4)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
