Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 2) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 14) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 13, 11, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 10, 13, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 10, 6, and node 12
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 11, 7, 14, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 13, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 11, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, 14, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, 11, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 13, 14, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 10 is connected to node 1, 12, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 13, 10, and node 2
Node 13 is connected to node 1, 8, 12, 4, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the center and leaves for each potential 3-star in the graph:
- For Node 1: (3, 6, 8)
- For Node 2: (9, 10, 6)
- For Node 3: (1, 11, 7)
- For Node 4: (3, 13, 0)
- For Node 5: (9, 11, 14)
- For Node 6: (1, 8, 14)
- For Node 7: (3, 8, 14)
- For Node 8: (1, 13, 14)
- For Node 9: (5, 2, -)
- For Node 10: (1, 12, -)
- For Node 11: (5, 3, 7)
- For Node 12: (13, 10, -)
- For Node 13: (1, 8, 12)
- For Node 14: (5, 3, 8)

Based on the connections, the 3-star combinations are as follows:
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (9, 10, 6)>
<3, (1, 11, 7)>
<4, (3, 13, 0)>
<5, (9, 11, 14)>
<6, (1, 8, 14)>
<7, (3, 8, 14)>
<8, (1, 13, 14)>
<11, (5, 3, 7)>
<13, (1, 8, 12)>
