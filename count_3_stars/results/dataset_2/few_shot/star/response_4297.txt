Response:
The first step is to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The second step will be to count how many 3-stars are present in the graph.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (14, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 13)>
<10, (11, 0, 6)>
<11, (1, 10, 2)>
<8, (2, 5, 12)>
<5, (13, 2, 3)>
<6, (10, 1, 7)>
<2, (11, 5, 0)>
<12, (10, 8, 13)>
<13, (7, 12, 5)>
<9, (13)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[10]
