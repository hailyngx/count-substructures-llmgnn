Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where one node is connected by edges to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the provided adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (5, 9, 8)>
- <5, (9, 6, 2)>
- <1, (4, 6, 2)>
- <3, (9, 8, 0)>
- <2, (4, 7, 1)>
- <7, (9, 0, 3)>
- <8, (9, 0, 6)>
- <9, (5, 8, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
