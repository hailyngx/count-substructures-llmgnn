Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique occurrence of a 3-star.

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (10, 14, 12)>
<1, (4, 2, 9)>
<2, (8, 5, 3)>
<3, (8, 9, 2)>
<4, (8, 1, 6)>
<5, (2, 14, 13)>
<6, (4, 10, 14)>
<7, (5, 13, 6)>
<8, (2, 12, 3)>
<9, (4, 12, 14)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
