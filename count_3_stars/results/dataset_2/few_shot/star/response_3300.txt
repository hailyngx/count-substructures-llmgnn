Response:
Based on the given graph, there are several 3-stars present. Let's identify each unique 3-star in the graph:

<0, (5, 17, 1)>
<1, (5, 6, 13)>
<2, (11, 17, 1)>
<3, (16, 5, 14)>
<4, (9, 12, 15)>
<5, (0, 10, 18)>
<6, (1, 12, 8)>
<7, (19, 17, 8)>
<8, (15, 6, 19)>
<9, (4, 12, 13)>
<10, (11, 5, 1)>
<11, (10, 2, 1)>
<12, (6, 4, 1)>
<13, (4, 18, 1)>
<14, (16, 3, 15)>
<15, (8, 4, 16)>
<16, (14, 3, 15)>
<17, (2, 19, 0)>
<18, (13, 5, 19)>
<19, (8, 18, 7)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
