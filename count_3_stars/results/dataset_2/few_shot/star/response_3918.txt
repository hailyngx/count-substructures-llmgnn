Response:
The 3-star graph can be found by examining each node and its connections to identify any 3-stars. 

Let's go through the list of nodes and their connections:

Let's start with node 0:
Node 0 is connected to nodes 11, 1.
- This creates one 3-star: <0, (11, 1, 21)>

Moving on to node 1:
Node 1 is connected to nodes 21, 0, 7.
- This creates two 3-stars: <1, (21, 0, 9)> and <1, (0, 21, 12)>

Continuing with subsequent nodes, we find the following 3-stars:
<2, (8, 28, 25)>
<3, (20, 27, 29)>
<4, (12, 18, 21)>
<5, (15, 28, 11)>
<6, (17, 26, 29)>
<7, (13, 8, 25)>
<8, (2, 28, 5)>
<9, (21, 16, 14)>
<10, (24, 15, 16)>
<11, (0, 28, 5)>
<12, (29, 18, 21)>
<13, (7, 8, 25)>
<14, (24, 9, 3)>
<15, (5, 10, 28)>
<16, (18, 10, 9)>
<17, (22, 29, 24)>
<18, (12, 16, 4)>
<19, (26, 13, 23)>
<20, (3, 27, 29)>
<21, (1, 12, 9)>
<22, (24, 17, 3)>
<23, (7, 19, 26)>
<24, (10, 22, 14)>
<25, (2, 8, 7)>
<26, (19, 17, 7)>
<27, (29, 3, 20)>
<28, (5, 2, 11)>
<29, (27, 17, 20)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].
