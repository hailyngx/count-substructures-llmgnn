Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we see that the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0: {6, 4, 7, 5, 2}
- Node 1: {6, 9, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {8, 0}
- Node 3: {9, 1, 7, 5, 4}
- Node 4: {9, 3, 7, 0}
- Node 5: {6, 3, 7, 0}
- Node 6: {5, 1, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 0, 5}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 2}
- Node 9: {8, 4, 3, 1}

Let's identify the 3-stars:
- From node 6: <6, (5, 1, 8)>
- From node 1: <1, (6, 9, 3)>
- From node 9: <9, (8, 4, 3)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (5, 1, 8)>
<1, (6, 9, 3)>
<9, (8, 4, 3)>
