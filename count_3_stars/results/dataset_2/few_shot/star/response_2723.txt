Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 3, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 0, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<2, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (9, 4, 2)>
<7, (8, 6, 2)>
