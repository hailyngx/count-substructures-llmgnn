Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. These are the nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors

Therefore, the potential centers of 3-stars are: 1, 7, 8, 10, 15, 17, 18, and 19. 

Now, let's check each potential center node and count the number of 3-stars they are the center of by identifying their connected nodes.

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 15, 4, and 10. 
  Therefore, <1, (15, 4, 10)> is a 3-star with node 1 in the center.

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 0, and 11. 
  Therefore, <7, (4, 0, 11)> is a 3-star with node 7 in the center.

For node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 16. 
  Therefore, <8, (2, 5, 16)> is a 3-star with node 8 in the center.

For node 10:
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9. 
  Therefore, <10, (0, 1, 9)> is a 3-star with node 10 in the center.

For node 15:
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 1, 9, and 5. 
  Therefore, <15, (1, 9, 5)> is a 3-star with node 15 in the center.

For node 17:
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 14, 19, and 4. 
  Therefore, <17, (14, 19, 4)> is a 3-star with node 17 in the center.

For node 18:
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 14, 13, and 2. 
  Therefore, <18, (14, 13, 2)> is a 3-star with node 18 in the center.

For node 19:
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 17, 6, and 0. 
  Therefore, <19, (17, 6, 0)> is a 3-star with node 19 in the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
