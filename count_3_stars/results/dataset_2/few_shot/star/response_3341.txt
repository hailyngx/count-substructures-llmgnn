Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

We will go through each node and identify 3-stars centered at that node. 

Starting with node 0: 
- Node 0 is connected to node 8. Thus, no 3-star centered at node 0.

Moving to node 1: 
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 12, and 8. This forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 12, 8)>.

Proceeding to node 2: 
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 16, 10, and 4. Thus, no 3-star centered at node 2.

Next, node 3: 
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 12. Thus, no 3-star centered at node 3.

Moving on to node 4: 
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 14, 2, 9, and 15. This forms a 3-star: <4, (14, 9, 15)>.

Continuing to node 5: 
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 11, and 10. This forms a 3-star: <5, (7, 11, 10)>.

Proceeding to node 6: 
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 13 and 12. Thus, no 3-star centered at node 6.

Next, node 7: 
- Node 7 is connected to node 5. Thus, no 3-star centered at node 7.

Moving to node 8: 
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 10, and 0. This forms a 3-star: <8, (1, 2, 10)>.

Proceeding to node 9: 
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 16, and 12. Thus, no 3-star centered at node 9.

Continuing to node 10: 
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 19, 5, and 16. This forms a 3-star: <10, (2, 8, 19)>.

Moving on to node 11: 
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 18 and 5. Thus, no 3-star centered at node 11.

Proceeding to node 12: 
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 9, 15, and 6. This forms a 3-star: <12, (1, 9, 15)>.

Next, node 13: 
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 14, 17, 19, and 6. Thus, no 3-star centered at node 13.

Continuing to node 14: 
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 15, and 13. This forms a 3-star: <14, (4, 15, 13)>.

Moving on to node 15: 
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 14, 12, and 4. This forms a 3-star: <15, (14, 12, 4)>.

Proceeding to node 16: 
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 2, 9, 18, and 10. Thus, no 3-star centered at node 16.

Next, node 17: 
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 13 and 18. Thus, no 3-star centered at node 17.

Continuing to node 18: 
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 17, 11, and 16. Thus, no 3-star centered at node 18.

Moving on to node 19: 
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 13 and 10. Thus, no 3-star centered at node 19.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (3, 12, 8)>
<4, (14, 9, 15)>
<5, (7, 11, 10)>
<8, (1, 2, 10)>
<12, (1, 9, 15)>
<14, (4, 15, 13)>
