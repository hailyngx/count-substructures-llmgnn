Response:
We will identify 3-stars in the graph based on the properties mentioned earlier. 

Let's list the 3-stars we find within angle brackets <>:

<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<5, (12, 0, 5)>
<5, (1, 12, 5)>
<5, (4, 1, 10)>
<5, (0, 12, 5)>
<9, (5, 1, 11)>
<9, (11, 7, 14)>
<9, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (14, 7, 8)>
<6, (12, 5, 6)>
<6, (8, 7, 14)>
<4, (5, 8, 13)>
<4, (8, 7, 14)>
<7, (11, 14, 8)>
<7, (14, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (3, 0, 1)>
<3, (1, 0, 3)>
<3, (13, 2, 3)>
<8, (6, 4, 14)>
<8, (4, 13, 10)>
<11, (9, 14, 7)>
<11, (7, 2, 11)>
<14, (6, 8, 7)>
<14, (8, 11, 14)>
<0, (5, 12, 0)>
<0, (3, 11, 0)>
<12, (5, 0, 12)>
<12, (13, 4, 12)>
<13, (4, 10, 13)>
<13, (10, 2, 13)>
<10, (4, 13, 10)>
<10, (13, 2, 10)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get a total of 32 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the final answer is [32].
