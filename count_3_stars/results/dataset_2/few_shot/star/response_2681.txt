Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-star graph has the following structure: the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

From the adjacency list, we can find all the 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (15, 25, 0)>
<4, (7, 12, 5)>
<6, (2, 13, 16)>
<7, (4, 12, 1)>
<8, (25, 17, 16)>
<9, (21, 11, 12)>
<10, (25, 12, 20)>
<11, (9, 17, 19)>
<13, (3, 6, 17)>
<14, (25, 16, 10)>
<15, (27, 3, 29)>
<16, (6, 28, 8)>
<17, (13, 8, 11)>
<20, (27, 22, 10)>
<21, (9, 22, 2)>
<22, (4, 29, 20)>
<23, (27, 5, 2)>
<24, (29, 18, 1)>
<25, (3, 8, 14)>
<27, (15, 20, 23)>
<28, (13, 16)>
<29, (15, 22, 24)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].
