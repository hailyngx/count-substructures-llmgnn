Response:
First, let's identify the possible 3-star configurations in the given graph based on the definition provided.

Given a 3-star with the center node labeled X and the leaf nodes labeled Y, Z, and W, we can observe the following possible configurations based on the adjacency list:
1. Node 0, 9, 12, and 11 can be the center with their respective connections to other nodes forming the leaves.
2. Node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, and 14 cannot serve as the center for a 3-star graph because they have more or fewer than three connections.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

For Node 0:
- Possible 3-stars: (0, 9, 12, 11)
For Node 9:
- Possible 3-stars: (9, 5, 6, 4), (9, 5, 13, 4)
For Node 12:
- Possible 3-stars: (12, 7, 1, 11), (12, 7, 6, 11)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2. 
So, the final answer is [2].
  
Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (9, 12, 11)>, <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 13, 4)>, <12, (7, 1, 11)>, <12, (7, 6, 11)>
