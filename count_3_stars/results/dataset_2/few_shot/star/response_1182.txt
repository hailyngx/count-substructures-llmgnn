Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (5, 6, 3)>
2. <1, (5, 6, 7)>
3. <1, (5, 3, 4)>
4. <1, (6, 3, 7)>
5. <1, (6, 3, 9)>
6. <1, (6, 1, 7)>
7. <1, (3, 4, 0)>
8. <5, (2, 8, 1)>
9. <5, (2, 8, 7)>
10. <5, (2, 1, 9)>
11. <5, (2, 1, 7)>
12. <5, (9, 3, 6)>
13. <5, (9, 3, 1)>
14. <5, (9, 2, 7)>
15. <5, (9, 2, 1)>

Since there are 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the count of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
