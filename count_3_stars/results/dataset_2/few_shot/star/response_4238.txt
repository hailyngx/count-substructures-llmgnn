Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure. These nodes have connections to exactly three other nodes.

The nodes that are part of a 3-star structure are: 
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 3, 16, and 9
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 3, 16, 14, and 19
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 3, 12, and 14
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 11, 13, and 17
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 18, 8, and 17
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 3, 0, and 17
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 12, 7, and 6
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 1, 4, and 12
- Node 16: Connected to nodes 1, 8, and 0
- Node 17: Connected to nodes 5, 15, and 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: (3, 16, 9)
- Node 1: (3, 16, 19)
- Node 3: (1, 11, 4), (1, 11, 18)
- Node 4: (3, 12, 14)
- Node 5: (11, 13, 17)
- Node 6: (8, 18, 17), (8, 17, 6)
- Node 9: (3, 0, 17)
- Node 10: (12, 7, 6)
- Node 12: (4, 10, 14)
- Node 14: (1, 4, 12)
- Node 16: (1, 8, 0), (8, 15, 17)

Thus, the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [11]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 16, 9)>
<1, (3, 16, 19)>
<3, (1, 11, 4)>
<3, (1, 11, 18)>
<4, (3, 12, 14)>
<5, (11, 13, 17)>
<6, (8, 18, 17)>
<6, (8, 17, 6)>
<9, (3, 0, 17)>
<10, (12, 7, 6)>
<12, (4, 10, 14)>
