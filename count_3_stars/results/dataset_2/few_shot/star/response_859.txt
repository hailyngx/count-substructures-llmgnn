Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 15, and 17: <1, (3, 15, 17)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 20, 0, and 6: <2, (20, 0, 6)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 7, and 23: <4, (11, 7, 23)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 24, and 18: <5, (8, 24, 18)>
5. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 18, and 19: <10, (0, 18, 19)>
6. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 29, and 26: <11, (16, 29, 26)>
7. Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 25, 10, and 18: <16, (25, 10, 18)>
8. Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 25, 10, and 19: <17, (25, 10, 19)>
9. Node 22 forms a 3-star with nodes 26, 9, and 21: <22, (26, 9, 21)>
10. Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes 29, 20, and 12: <28, (29, 20, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
