Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are part of 3-stars in the graph. We are looking for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. They will be the potential centers of the 3-stars.

From the given information, the nodes with exactly three edges are:
- Node 1 (connected to 6 and 2)
- Node 2 (connected to 9, 1, and 12)
- Node 4 (connected to 3, 11, and 12)
- Node 5 (connected to 3, 0, and 12)
- Node 7 (connected to 0, 8, and 13)
- Node 14 (connected to 9 and 10)

Next, we check these nodes to see if they are the centers of 3-stars by confirming that the nodes connected to them form stars.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (6, 2, 12)>
<2, (9, 1, 12)>
<4, (3, 11, 12)>
<5, (3, 0, 12)>
<7, (0, 8, 13)>
<14, (9, 10, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
