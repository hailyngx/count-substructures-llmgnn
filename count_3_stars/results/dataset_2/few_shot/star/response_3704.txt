Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes:
- From the adjacency list, we can see that the central nodes with three adjacent nodes are node 5, node 6, and node 12.

For node 5:
- (5, 6, 1, 19)
- (5, 1, 6, 2)
- (5, 19, 2, 17)

For node 6:
- (6, 11, 1, 5)

For node 12:
- (12, 7, 10, 15)
- (12, 4, 1, 18)
- (12, 18, 17, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars are:
