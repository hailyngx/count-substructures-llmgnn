Response:
The 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. From the adjacency list, we see that the nodes with 3 connections are: nodes 0, 1, 12, and 2 (which is not connected to any other node). Since node 2 is not connected to any other nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

2. For nodes 0, 1, and 12, we can check if they can form a 3-star with their neighbors. Let's check each of them:
   - Node 0: (0, 6, 7, 13) - This set of connections does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 1: (1, 10, 8, 7) - This set of connections does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 12: (12, 8, 3, 4) - This set of connections does not form a 3-star.

3. Next, we focus on the nodes with 4 connections; namely: nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 14.

   - For node 5: (5, 9, 6, 4) forms a 3-star: <5, (9, 6, 4)>
   - For node 6: (6, 5, 9, 3) forms a 3-star: <6, (5, 9, 3)>
   - For node 7: (7, 5, 0, 14) forms a 3-star: <7, (5, 0, 14)>
   - For node 8: (8, 10, 14, 12) forms a 3-star: <8, (10, 14, 12)>
   - For node 9: (9, 5, 6, 11) forms a 3-star: <9, (5, 6, 11)>
   - For node 10: (10, 11, 8, 4) does not form a 3-star.
   - For node 11: (11, 9, 10, 3) forms a 3-star: <11, (9, 10, 3)>
   - For node 14: (14, 5, 11, 8) forms a 3-star: <14, (5, 11, 8)>

So, the 3-stars found in the given graph are as follows:
<5, (9, 6, 4)>, <6, (5, 9, 3)>, <7, (5, 0, 14)>, <8, (10, 14, 12)>, <9, (5, 6, 11)>, <11, (9, 10, 3)>, and <14, (5, 11, 8)>.

Count of 3-stars: [7]
