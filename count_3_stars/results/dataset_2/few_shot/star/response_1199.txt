Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph.

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 14.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 0, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 14, and 1 which forms a 3-star.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 11, and 13.
- Node 8 is only connected to node 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 14, and 1 which forms a 3-star.

2. Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<4, (9, 14, 1)>
<10, (6, 14, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2.  
So, the final answer is [2].
