Response:
Let's analyze the graph and count the number of 3-stars:

From the list of edges, we can see there are three connections originating from each node, except for 29, which has only one connection. This confirms the graph has 30 nodes and each node connects to 3 other nodes.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

1. The central node of each 3-star can be any of the 30 nodes.
2. For each central node, we need to choose 3 leaves out of the 3 connections from that central node.
3. The combination of choosing 3 leaves out of 3 connections is fixed to form a unique 3-star.

Since each 3-star consists of 1 central node and 3 leaves (connected to the central node), there is only one possible configuration for each 3-star. This means that for each central node, there is only one unique 3-star associated with it.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is equal to the number of nodes in the graph, which is 30.

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].

Unique 3-stars: <0, (14, 5, 28)>, <1, (3, 16, 8)>, <2, (27, 17, 22)>, <3, (1, 21, 28)>, <4, (0, 25, 10)>, <5, (20, 14, 28)>, <6, (19, 11, 4)>, <7, (24)>, <8, (1, 13, 26)>, <9, (16, 12, 9)>, <10, (29)>, <11, (23, 15, 6)>, <12, (15, 9, 25)>, <13, (8, 24)>, <14, (0)>, <15, (21, 19, 12)>, <16, (1, 3, 9)>, <17, (22, 11, 27)>, <18, (22, 23)>, <19, (15, 11, 25)>, <20, (21)>, <21, (3, 20, 15)>, <22, (23, 18, 26)>, <23, (22, 11, 18)>, <24, (13, 7, 19)>, <25, (19, 12, 4)>, <26, (8)>, <27, (22, 2, 17)>, <28, (23, 0, 5)>, <29, (10)>.
