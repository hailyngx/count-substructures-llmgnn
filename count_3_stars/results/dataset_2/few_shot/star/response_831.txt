Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph by looking at each node and its neighbors to identify instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Starting with Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 7, and 11. This forms a 3-star with Node 0 as the center and nodes 8, 7, and 11 as leaves. <0, (8, 7, 11)>

Moving on to other nodes:
- No other nodes form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <0, (8, 7, 11)>.
