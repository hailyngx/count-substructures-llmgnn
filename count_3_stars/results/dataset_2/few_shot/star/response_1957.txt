Response:
The 3-star graph consists of the following unique configurations:

<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 19)>
<2, (5, 12, 15)>
<3, (1, 0, 12)>
<5, (2, 0, 6)>
<6, (16, 4, 5)>
<7, (18, 0, 11)>
<8, (9, 19, 17)>
<10, (13, 12, 14)>
<11, (4, 7, 14)>
<12, (3, 2, 16)>
<13, (16, 10, 14)>
<15, (2, 7, 17)>
<16, (6, 13, 15)>
<18, (4, 9, 7)>
<19, (1, 8, 17)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
