Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 6) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 8) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 0) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 14, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 10, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 11, 8, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 12, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 13, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 10, and node 14
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 12, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 10, 12, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 11, 3, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 13
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 13, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 13, 14, 3, 1, and node 8
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 10, 11, 12, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 12, 2, 0, 6, and node 13

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph. We will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given information, the 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 4, 14)>
<1, (10, 12, 8)>
<2, (11, 8, 14)>
<4, (13, 6, 3)>
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<6, (5, 4, 7)>
<7, (9, 12, 6)>
<8, (10, 12, 2)>
<9, (11, 3, 5)>
<10, (6, 8, 1)>
<11, (9, 2, 13)>
<12, (7, 13, 14)>
<13, (4, 12, 14)>
<14, (12, 2, 0)>

Now we count the number of unique 3-stars: [14].
