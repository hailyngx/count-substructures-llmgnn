Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors, as these nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star. Then, we check if each node's neighbors are connected to each other to form a 3-star. 

Let's list the nodes that could be the center of a 3-star based on having three neighbors:
- Node 0
- Node 3
- Node 6

Now, let's check each potential center's neighbors to see if they form 3-stars:

<0, (5, 1, 3)>

As the final step, we count the number of unique 3-stars found. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 

<List of unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 1, 3)>]
