Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph by identifying the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

1. Node 0: Not part of any 3-stars due to having 4 connections.

2. Node 1: Not part of any 3-stars due to having 2 connections.

3. Node 2: <2, (5, 6, 1)> (1 star)

4. Node 3: <3, (5, 6, 4)> (1 star)

5. Node 4: Not part of any 3-stars due to having 2 connections.

6. Node 5: <5, (9, 2, 0)> (1 star)

7. Node 6: <6, (9, 7, 3)> (1 star)

8. Node 7: Not part of any 3-stars due to having 3 connections.

9. Node 8: Not part of any 3-stars due to having 3 connections.

10. Node 9: <9, (5, 6, 1)> (1 star)

By counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we can see that there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
