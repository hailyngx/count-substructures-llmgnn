Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can see the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (7, 1, 12)> 
<1, (7, 3, 6)> 
<2, (9, 13, 12)> 
<3, (4, 1, 14)> 
<4, (9, 7, 6)> 
<5, (13, 10, 5)> 
<6, (4, 1, 14)> 
<7, (9, 4, 12)> 
<8, (13, 10, 8)> 
<9, (4, 2, 7)> 
<10, (13, 7, 8)> 
<11, (13, 8, 12)> 
<12, (7, 9, 3)> 
<13, (5, 8, 11)> 

All 3-stars have been listed. Count the total number of 3-stars and list them in brackets:
[14]
