Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify all the 3-stars by looking at each possible combination of a central node and its three connected nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (14, 15, 12)>
<1, (3, 2, 24)>
<2, (17, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 10, 9)>
<5, (8, 16, 18)>
<6, (11, 27, 22)>
<7, (13, 9, 29)>
<10, (17, 3, 12)>
<12, (14, 17, 18)>
<13, (26, 29, 7)>
<14, (0, 12, 19)>
<15, (26, 0, 25)>
<16, (14, 26, 24)>
<17, (10, 12, 2)>
<18, (25, 5, 12)>
<19, (14, 2, 22)>
<20, (11, 24, 20)>
