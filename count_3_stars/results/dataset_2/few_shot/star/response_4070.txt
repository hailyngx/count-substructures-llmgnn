Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. For each node in the graph, identify if it is the center of a 3-star. A node is the center of a 3-star if it has exactly three neighbors.

2. List the 3-stars found in the graph:

- <0, (1, 12, 2)>
- <1, (3, 11, 14)>
- <3, (1, 6, 2)>
- <4, (9, 11, 5)>
- <5, (9, 13, 10)>
- <6, (3, 0, 10)>
- <7, (11, 10, 8)>
- <8, (1, 7, 12)>
- <9, (5, 4, 14)>
- <10, (5, 9, 7)>
- <11, (1, 7, 2)>
- <12, (3, 2, 13)>
- <13, (5, 9, 14)>
- <14, (9, 1, 13)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [14]
