Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 7

Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. A 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see potential 3-stars involving each node:
- Node 0: (0, 6, 3, 7)
- Node 1: (1, 9, 3, 5), (1, 3, 8, 7)
- Node 2: (2, 6, 4, 7), (2, 9, 4, 7)
- Node 3: (3, 9, 1, 0)
- Node 4: (4, 1, 2)
- Node 5: (5, 6, 1, 8), (5, 7, 1, 0)
- Node 6: (6, 9, 5, 2), (6, 1, 3, 8), (6, 0, 3, 7)
- Node 7: (7, 9, 1, 5), (7, 1, 3, 8), (7, 0, 5, 2)
- Node 8: (8, 6, 1, 5)
- Node 9: (9, 6, 2, 3), (9, 1, 7, 5)

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars we found:

<0, (6, 3, 7)>
<1, (9, 3, 5)>
<1, (3, 8, 7)>
<2, (6, 4, 7)>
<2, (9, 4, 7)>
<5, (6, 1, 8)>
<5, (7, 1, 0)>
<6, (9, 5, 2)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (9, 1, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 2)>
<8, (6, 1, 5)>
<9, (6, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 7, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
