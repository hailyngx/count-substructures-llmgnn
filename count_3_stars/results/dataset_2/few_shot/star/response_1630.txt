Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated as follows:

1. For each node, identify if it is the center of a 3-star. To be a center of a 3-star, a node must be connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
2. For each center node found, count the number of unique 3-stars it is part of.

Let's go through these steps:

- Center nodes: Nodes 3, 11, 15, and 16 are the center nodes as they are each connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

- Unique 3-stars:
    - <3, (1, 4, 17)>
    - <11, (4, 12, 14)>
    - <15, (11, 12, 19)>
    - <16, (7, 10, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
