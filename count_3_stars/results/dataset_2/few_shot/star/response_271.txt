Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1)

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (5, 9, 0)>
<3, (5, 1, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
<5, (2, 4, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (9, 3, 0)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (4, 2, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
