Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, which indicates a central node of a possible 3-star.
    - Node 10 has 4 neighbors
    - Node 13 has 5 neighbors
    - Node 8 has 5 neighbors
    - Node 14 has 4 neighbors
    - Node 15 has 4 neighbors
    - Node 16 has 3 neighbors

Step 2: Determine the 3-stars formed by these central nodes:
    - For node 16: <16, (8, 18, 19)>
    - For other nodes, none of them meet the criteria of being the center of a 3-star.

Step 3: Output the final answer inside brackets []:
    - As there is only one 3-star in the given graph, the count of 3-stars is [1].
    - The unique 3-star is <16, (8, 18, 19)>.
