Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 7, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with degree 4 are: 0, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

Now, let's go through each of these nodes and check if they form any 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (6, 9, 8)> [1]
- Node 4: <4, (9, 1, 7)> [2]
- Node 6: <6, (9, 5, 1)> [3]
- Node 8: <8, (9, 1, 2)> [4]
- Node 9: <9, (6, 8, 4)> [5]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
