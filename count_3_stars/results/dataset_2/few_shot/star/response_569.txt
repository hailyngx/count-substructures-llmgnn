Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the graph provided. 

Based on the definition of a 3-star, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 13, 19)>
<1, (11, 10, 13)>
<3, (16, 2, 5)>
<4, (17, 10, 18)>
<5, (6, 8, 3)>
<6, (17, 5, 15)>
<8, (5, 15, 7)>
<9, (16, 18, 15)>

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
[8]
