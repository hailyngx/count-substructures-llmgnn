Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- Node 5: (5, 9, 19), (5, 4, 16)
- Node 9: (9, 5, 8), (9, 13, 12)
- Node 13: (13, 9, 14), (13, 17, 18)
- Node 17: (17, 14, 16), (17, 13, 7)
- Node 4: (4, 15, 2), (4, 5, 1)
- Node 7: (7, 17, 16), (7, 11, 19)
- Node 14: (14, 17, 6)

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars are <5, (9, 19, 4)>, <9, (5, 8, 13)>, <13, (9, 14, 17)>, <17, (14, 16, 13)>, <4, (15, 2, 4)>, <7, (17, 16, 13)>, <14, (17, 6, 14)>.
