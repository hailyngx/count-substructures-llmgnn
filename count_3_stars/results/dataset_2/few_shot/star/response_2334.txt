Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify the central nodes:
   - Node 0 has 4 neighbors (16, 15, 17, 9)
   - Node 5 has 5 neighbors (6, 18, 4, 17, 15)
   - Node 11 has 4 neighbors (16, 7, 13, 8)
   - Node 16 has 3 neighbors (11, 0, 12)
   - Node 18 has 4 neighbors (5, 9, 14, 3)
   - Node 13 has 4 neighbors (11, 19, 15, 4)
  
2. Check for 3-stars around each central node:
   - 3-stars around node 0: <0, (16, 15, 17)>, <0, (16, 15, 9)>, <0, (16, 17, 9)>, <0, (15, 17, 9)>
   - 3-stars around node 5: <5, (6, 18, 4)>, <5, (6, 18, 17)>, <5, (6, 4, 17)>, <5, (18, 4, 17)>, <5, (6, 4, 15)>, <5, (4, 17, 15)>, <5, (18, 17, 15)>
   - 3-stars around node 11: <11, (16, 7, 13)>, <11, (7, 13, 8)>, <11, (16, 13, 8)>
   - 3-stars around node 16: <16, (11, 0, 12)>, <16, (11, 0, 15)>
   - 3-stars around node 18: <18, (5, 9, 14)>, <18, (5, 9, 3)>, <18, (5, 14, 3)>, <18, (9, 14, 3)>
   - 3-stars around node 13: <13, (11, 19, 15)>, <13, (11, 15, 4)>, <13, (11, 19, 4)>, <13, (19, 15, 4)>
