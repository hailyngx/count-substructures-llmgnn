Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify each 3-star in the graph. 

Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Starting from each node, check if it forms a 3-star with its neighboring nodes. 
2. For each node, count the number of neighboring nodes and identify if it can form a 3-star.
3. Make a note of each unique 3-star identified.

After identifying all 3-stars, count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Let's go ahead and find the 3-stars in the given graph. 

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is represented inside brackets [].]

<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 0, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [4].]
