Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 8) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 5) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 2)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, the possible 3-star configurations are centered around the nodes: 6, 1, 5, 13, 8, and 14.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<6, (9, 10, 11)>
<1, (3, 5, 10)>
<3, (1, 11, 0)>
<11, (6, 7, 4)>
<0, (6, 3, 4)>
<7, (11, 5, 13)>
<5, (1, 7, 2)>
<8, (7, 14, 5)>
<14, (8, 4, 2)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
