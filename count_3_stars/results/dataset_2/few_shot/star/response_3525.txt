Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 14, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 12, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 11, 14, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 10, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 10, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 10, 7, 0, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 11, 7, 14, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 3, 6, 12, and node 4
Node 11 is connected to node 14, 8, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 10, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 6, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 11, 2, 8, 0, and node 13

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 6
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, and 1
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 12, and 8
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 11, and 14
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 7, and 8
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 10, and 2
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 10, and 7
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 14, and 1
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 10, and 1
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 2, and 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
