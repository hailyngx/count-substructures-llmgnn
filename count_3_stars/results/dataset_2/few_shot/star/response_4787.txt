Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node and three leaf nodes connected to the central node. Here, the central node must have degree 3 and the leaf nodes must have degree 1.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Central node: 5
   Leaf nodes: 2, 9, 13
   <5, (2, 9, 13)>

2. Central node: 9
   Leaf nodes: 4, 10, 11
   <9, (4, 10, 11)>

3. Central node: 4
   Leaf nodes: 8, 13, 14
   <4, (8, 13, 14)>

4. Central node: 8
   Leaf nodes: 3, 4, 9
   <8, (3, 4, 9)>

5. Central node: 0
   Leaf nodes: 3, 14, -
   <0, (3, 14, -)>

6. Central node: 2
   Leaf nodes: 1, 3, 5
   <2, (1, 3, 5)>

7. Central node: 12
   Leaf nodes: 1, 6, 13
   <12, (1, 6, 13)>

8. Central node: 1
   Leaf nodes: 11, 12, 14
   <1, (11, 12, 14)>

9. Central node: 3
   Leaf nodes: 0, 7, 8
   <3, (0, 7, 8)>

10. Central node: 10
    Leaf nodes: 6, 9, 5
    <10, (6, 9, 5)>

11. Central node: 6
    Leaf nodes: 3, 10, 11
    <6, (3, 10, 11)>

12. Central node: 11
    Leaf nodes: 1, 6, 9
    <11, (1, 6, 9)>

From the identified 3-stars, the total count is [12].
