Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Here are the steps to find the unique 3-stars and count them:

1. Identify the central nodes in the graph:
    - Node 6
    - Node 9
    - Node 5
    - Node 4
    - Node 0
    - Node 3
    - Node 10
    - Node 12
    - Node 13
    - Node 14

2. For each central node, list the connected nodes (leaves):
    <6, (9, 5, 10)>
    <6, (9, 5, 2)>
    <6, (9, 5, 11)>
    <6, (9, 5, 0)>
    <9, (6, 4, 3)>
    <6, (5, 13, 12)>
    <6, (5, 13, 0)>
    <6, (10, 8, 0)>
    <6, (10, 8, 14)>
    <6, (2, 0, 12)>
    <9, (4, 11, 7)>
    <5, (6, 13, 7)>
    <5, (6, 13, 0)>
    <5, (12, 0, 7)>
    <5, (12, 0, 6)>
    <4, (9, 11, 13)>
    <4, (9, 11, 1)>
    <4, (9, 11, 14)>
    <0, (6, 5, 2)>
    <3, (9, 8, 11)>
    <3, (9, 8, 14)>
    <3, (9, 14, 13)>
    <10, (6, 8, 14)>
    <12, (5, 0, 11)>
    <13, (5, 3, 14)>
    <13, (5, 3, 4)>
    <13, (3, 4, 14)>
    <14, (3, 13, 10)>
    <14, (3, 13, 4)>
    <14, (10, 13, 4)>

3. Counting unique 3-stars: 
    <6, (9, 5, 10)>
    <6, (9, 5, 2)>
    <6, (9, 5, 11)>
    <6, (9, 5, 0)>
    <9, (6, 4, 3)>
    <6, (5, 13, 12)>
    <6, (5, 13, 0)>
    <6, (10, 8, 0)>
    <6, (10, 8, 14)>
    <6, (2, 0, 12)>
    <9, (4, 11, 7)>
    <5, (6, 13, 7)>
    <5, (6, 13, 0)>
    <5, (12, 0, 7)>
    <5, (12, 0, 6)>
    <4, (9, 11, 13)>
    <4, (9, 11, 1)>
    <4, (9, 11, 14)>
    <0, (6, 5, 2)>
    <3, (9, 8, 11)>
    <3, (9, 8, 14)>
    <3, (9, 14, 13)>
    <10, (6, 8, 14)>
    <12, (5, 0, 11)>
    <13, (5, 3, 14)>
    <13, (5, 3, 4)>
    <13, (3, 4, 14)>
    <14, (3, 13, 10)>
    <14, (3, 13, 4)>
    <14, (10, 13, 4)>
