Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Based on the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<3, (13, 27, 1)>
<5, (8, 17, 28)>
<7, (1, 12, 29)>
<8, (13, 5, 25)>
<9, (10, 29, -)>
<10, (3, 9, 23)>
<11, (16, 18, -)>
<12, (7, 20, 28)>
<13, (22, 8, 3)>
<14, (13, 27, 19)>
<15, (23, 21, -)>
<16, (22, 11, 24)>
<17, (29, 0, 5)>
<18, (21, 11, 26)>
<19, (22, 14, 24)>
<20, (12, 18, -)>
<21, (15, 18, -)>
<22, (13, 19, 16)>
<23, (15, 10, -)>
<24, (16, 25, 19)>
<25, (8, 0, 24)>
<26, (18, 5, 0)>
<27, (14, 4, 3)>
<28, (12, 7, 6)>
<29, (17, 7, 9)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [24].
