Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking at each node and its neighbors to see if there are any 3-stars centered at that node.

1. For Node 0:
   - <0, (4, 11, 19)>
   
2. For Node 1:
   - <1, (7, 13, 19)>
   - <1, (7, 12, 13)>
   
3. For Node 2:
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 2.
   
4. For Node 3:
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 3.
   
5. For Node 4:
   - <4, (11, 12, 14)>
   
6. For Node 5:
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 5.
   
7. For Node 6:
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 6.
   
8. For Node 7:
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 7.
   
9. For Node 8:
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 8.
   
10. For Node 9:
    - <9, (8, 7, 5)>
   
11. For Node 10:
    - <10, (15, 12, 6)>
   
12. For Node 11:
    - No 3-stars centered at Node 11.
   
13. For Node 12:
    - <12, (11, 10, 4)>
   
14. For Node 13:
    - No 3-stars centered at Node 13.
   
15. For Node 14:
    - No 3-stars centered at Node 14.
   
16. For Node 15:
    - No 3-stars centered at Node 15.
   
17. For Node 16:
    - No 3-stars centered at Node 16.
   
18. For Node 17:
    - No 3-stars centered at Node 17.
   
19. For Node 18:
    - No 3-stars centered at Node 18.
   
20. For Node 19:
    - No 3-stars centered at Node 19.
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
