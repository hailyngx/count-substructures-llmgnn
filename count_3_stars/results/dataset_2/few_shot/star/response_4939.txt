Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 10, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 14, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 13, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 13, 0, 11, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, 2, and node 11
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 12, 10, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 13, 4, 2, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 0, 10, and node 11
Node 10 is connected to node 7, 12, 0, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 6, 14, and node 9
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 7, 10, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 4
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 7, 12, and node 11

Response:
Let's go through the list of edges and find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. From the adjacency list of each node, we can identify which nodes are connected to each node.

2. Identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars found.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (3, 6, 14)>
<3, (1, 13, 9)>
<4, (8, 13, 0)>
<5, (6, 0, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 12)>
<8, (1, 13, 2)>
<9, (3, 0, 10)>
<10, (7, 12, 0)>
<11, (4, 6, 14)>
<12, (8, 7, 10)>
<13, (3, 8, 4)>
<14, (1, 7, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
