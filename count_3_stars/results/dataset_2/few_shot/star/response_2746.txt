Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 2, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 4

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars that we find:

<0, (5, 2, 1)>
<0, (5, 2, 7)>
<0, (5, 1, 7)>
<1, (5, 2, 7)>
<2, (4, 1, 7)>
<3, (6, 8, 7)>
<4, (6, 9, 5)>
<4, (6, 2, 3)>
<5, (6, 4, 0)>
<5, (6, 1, 7)>
<6, (5, 3, 8)>
<7, (5, 2, 8)>
<8, (6, 9, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
