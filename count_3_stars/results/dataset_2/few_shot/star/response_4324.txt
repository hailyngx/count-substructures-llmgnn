Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided adjacency list and the given edges, we can find the following 3-stars:

<0, (4, 2, 7)>
<1, (5, 9, 6)>
<2, (6, 8, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<7, (9, 3, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 3-stars in the given graph.
