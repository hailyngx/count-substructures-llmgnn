Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (4, 12, 21)>
<2, (9, 10, 28)>
<4, (1, 21, 22)>
<5, (16, 17, 0)>
<6, (2, 11, 28)>
<9, (2, 15, 29)>
<10, (2, 12, 18)>
<11, (6, 8, 20)>
<12, (1, 10, 22)>
<13, (1, 26, 29)>
<14, (0, 18, 25)>
<15, (4, 9, 27)>
<16, (0, 10, 5)>
<17, (5, 19, 28)>
<18, (10, 14, 20)>
<19, (1, 17, 21)>
<20, (11, 18, 27)>
<21, (1, 4, 29)>
<22, (4, 12, 23)>
<23, (22, 25, 7)>
<25, (14, 23, 0)>
<26, (13, 29, 1)>
<27, (15, 20, 9)>
<28, (0, 17, 8)>
<29, (13, 21, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [26]
