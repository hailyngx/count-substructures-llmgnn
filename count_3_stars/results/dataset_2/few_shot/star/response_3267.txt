Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each occurrence of a 3-star pattern. 

Let's consider each node as the center of a potential 3-star and check if it satisfies the definition.

Starting with Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 6, 8, 1, and 2.
- Since Node 0 is only connected to a maximum of 5 nodes and needs to be connected to exactly 3 nodes in a 3-star pattern, Node 0 cannot form a 3-star.

Moving to Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 0.
- This forms a 3-star with Node 1 as the center and nodes 5, 8, and 0 as the leaves. 
- <1, (5, 8, 0)>

Continuing for the rest of the nodes:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (5, 9, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (5, 9, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (5, 8, 0)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (9, 2, 8)>
- Node 6 cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (9, 0, 3)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (5, 4, 0)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (5, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars are <1, (5, 8, 0)>, <2, (5, 9, 6)>, <3, (5, 9, 7)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>, <7, (9, 0, 3)>, and <8, (5, 4, 0)>.
