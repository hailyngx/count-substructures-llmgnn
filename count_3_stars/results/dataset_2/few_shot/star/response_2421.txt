Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 6, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 2, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 0, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

From the given adjacency list:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 2, and 4
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 1, and 6
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 1, and 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 1, and 3
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 1, and 4
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 2, 8, and 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 8, and 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 0, 7, and 6
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 7

We can see that nodes 0, 2, and 9 are not part of any 3-star as they are not connected to exactly three other nodes. The other nodes are part of different instances of 3-stars. Let's identify and count them:

- Node 1 is the center of the 3-star <1, (5, 3, 2)>
- Node 3 is the center of the 3-star <3, (5, 1, 6)>
- Node 4 is the center of the 3-star <4, (5, 9, 1)>
- Node 5 is the center of the 3-star <5, (9, 2, 1)> and <5, (2, 1, 4)>
- Node 6 is the center of the 3-star <6, (3, 2, 8)> and <6, (8, 7, 4)>
- Node 7 is the center of the 3-star <7, (9, 8, 6)>
- Node 8 is the center of the 3-star <8, (1, 0, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

So, the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 3, 2)>
<3, (5, 1, 6)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<5, (2, 1, 4)>
<6, (3, 2, 8)>
<6, (8, 7, 4)>
<7, (9, 8, 6)>
<8, (1, 0, 6)>
