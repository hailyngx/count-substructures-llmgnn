Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 15: (20, 13, 4), (13, 5, 25), (4, 6, 0), (11, 14, 4)
- Node 20: (15, 9, 24)
- Node 5: (6, 13, 2)
- Node 6: (5, 18, 4)
- Node 17: (29, 28, 24)
- Node 29: (17, 3, 7)
- Node 16: (22, 26, 8)
- Node 13: (5, 25, 14)
- Node 11: (14, 1, 18)

Count of 3-stars: [9]
Unique 3-stars: <15, (20, 13, 4)>, <15, (13, 5, 25)>, <15, (4, 6, 0)>, <15, (11, 14, 4)>, <20, (15, 9, 24)>, <5, (6, 13, 2)>, <6, (5, 18, 4)>, <17, (29, 28, 24)>, <29, (17, 3, 7)>
