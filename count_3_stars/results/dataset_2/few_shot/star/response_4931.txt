Response:
Given the graph described, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. <0, (13, 14, 5)>
2. <1, (6, 8, 10)>
3. <2, (8, 7, 11)>
4. <3, (8, 12, 14)>
5. <4, (9, 12, 14)>
6. <5, (8, 0, 2)>
7. <6, (1, 7, 12)>
8. <7, (6, 12, 11)>
9. <8, (13, 2, 5)>
10. <9, (4, 11, 13)>
11. <10, (2, 4, 1)>
12. <11, (9, 7, 14)>
13. <12, (6, 7, 4)>
14. <13, (9, 8, 0)>
15. <14, (0, 11, 3)>
