Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Counting the 3-stars connected to each node:
- Node 5: <5, (9, 11, 4)> 
- Node 9: No 3-stars (as it only connects to one other node)
- Node 7: No 3-stars (as it only connects to two other nodes)
- Node 12: <12, (14, 0, 11)>
- Node 6: <6, (5, 3, 8)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 10, 14)>
- Node 11: <11, (5, 7, 12)>
- Node 0: <0, (5, 12, 6)>
- Node 3: <3, (12, 6, 8)>
- Node 1: No 3-stars (as it only connects to four other nodes)
- Node 8: No 3-stars (as it only connects to three other nodes)
- Node 10: <10, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 4: No 3-stars (as it only connects to three other nodes)
- Node 13: No 3-stars (as it only connects to two other nodes)
- Node 14: <14, (5, 7, 12)>

2. List of unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 11, 4)>
<12, (14, 0, 11)>
<6, (5, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 10, 14)>
<11, (5, 7, 12)>
<0, (5, 12, 6)>
<3, (12, 6, 8)>
<10, (2, 3, 4)>
<14, (5, 7, 12)>

3. Count of unique 3-stars in the graph: [9]
