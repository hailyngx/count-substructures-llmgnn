Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Identify potential centers for 3-stars.  
Potential centers need at least 3 edges to form a 3-star.  
Nodes 4, 6, 7, and 9 are potential centers as they have at least 3 adjacent nodes.

Step 2: For each potential center, check if they can form a 3-star.  
Let's start with Node 4 as the potential center:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 1.

Thus, we have found the following 3-star centered at Node 4:  
<4, (7, 8, 1)>

Step 3: Repeat the same process for the other potential centers.  
Let's check Node 6 next:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 5.

This gives us another 3-star:  
<6, (4, 9, 5)>

Now, let's proceed with Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 5.

This results in another 3-star:  
<7, (4, 9, 5)>

Lastly, let's examine Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 6, and 2.

This gives us one more 3-star:  
<9, (7, 6, 2)>

Step 4: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found and output the final answer.  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<4, (7, 8, 1)>  
<6, (4, 9, 5)>  
<7, (4, 9, 5)>  
<9, (7, 6, 2)>  

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
