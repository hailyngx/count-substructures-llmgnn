Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 3
