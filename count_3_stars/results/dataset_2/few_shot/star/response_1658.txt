Node 1 is connected to node 9, 0, 7, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 11, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 13, 14, 7, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 11, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 14, 7, 8, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 14, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 13, 10, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 10, 1, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 11
Node 11 is connected to node 13, 10, 0, 4, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 8, 11, 3, and node 14

Response:
Starting from Node 0: (0, 11, 14), (0, 1, 2)
Moving to Node 1: (1, 9, 12), (1, 0, 7)
Moving to Node 2: (2, 11, 7)
Moving to Node 3: (3, 13, 12)
Moving to Node 4: No 3-star formed
Moving to Node 5: No 3-star formed
Moving to Node 6: (6, 9, 14), (6, 7, 13), (6, 8, 13)
Moving to Node 7: (7, 6, 14), (7, 14, 3), (7, 2, 1)
Moving to Node 8: No 3-star formed
Moving to Node 9: (9, 5, 10), (9, 6, 1), (9, 12, 8)
Moving to Node 10: (10, 9, 11)
Moving to Node 11: (11, 13, 0)
Moving to Node 12: No 3-star formed
Moving to Node 13: No 3-star formed
Moving to Node 14: No 3-star formed

Hence, there are a total of [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
<0, (11, 14, 1)>, <0, (1, 2, 11)>, <1, (9, 12, 1)>, <1, (7, 0, 1)>, <2, (11, 7, 2)>, <3, (13, 12, 3)>, <6, (9, 14, 6)>, <6, (7, 13, 6)>, <6, (8, 13, 6)>, <9, (5, 10, 9)>, <9, (6, 1, 9)>, <9, (12, 8, 9)>, <10, (9, 11, 10)>, <11, (13, 0, 11)>
