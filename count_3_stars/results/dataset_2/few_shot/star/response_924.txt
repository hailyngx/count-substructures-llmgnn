Response:
First, we identify the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will serve as potential centers for 3-stars. Based on the given adjacency list, the nodes with degree 3 are: 1, 2, 10, 11, 13, and 15.

Next, we find all the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star is formed by a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. We examine each potential center node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

For example, considering node 1 as a potential center node, we find that it forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 8. The 3-star would be <1, (6, 7, 8)>. 
Similarly, node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 17, and 19: <2, (7, 17, 19)>.
Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 13, and 16: <10, (12, 13, 16)>.
Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 12, and 14: <11, (0, 12, 14)>.
Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 10, and 19: <13, (5, 10, 19)>.
Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 18, and 14: <15, (17, 18, 14)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 17, 19)>, <10, (12, 13, 16)>, <11, (0, 12, 14)>, and <13, (5, 10, 19)>.
