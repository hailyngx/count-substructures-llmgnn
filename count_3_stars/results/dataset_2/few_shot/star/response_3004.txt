Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Based on the adjacency list and edges given, we can identify the 3-star patterns as follows:

1. <0, (8, 10, 2)>
2. <1, (9, 2, 7)>
3. <2, (5, 8, 1)>
4. <3, (9, 13, 8)>
5. <4, (5, 9, 11)>
6. <5, (9, 2, 11)>
7. <6, (7, 12, None)>
8. <7, (5, 6, 1)>
9. <8, (13, 2, 0)>
10. <9, (5, 4, 11)>
11. <10, (13, 2, 0)>
12. <11, (5, 9, 4)>
13. <12, (13, 6, 10)>
14. <13, (8, 12, 3)>
15. <14, (4, 2, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
