Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
The 3-star graphs in this given graph can be identified by looking at each node and its neighbors. A 3-star graph requires a node to be connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and check for 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-star
- Node 1: <1, (5, 9, 3)>
- Node 2: No 3-star
- Node 3: No 3-star
- Node 4: <4, (9, 6, 8)>
- Node 5: <5, (6, 8, 7)>
- Node 6: No 3-star
- Node 7: No 3-star
- Node 8: No 3-star
- Node 9: <9, (4, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3. 

So, the answer is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (5, 9, 3)>, <4, (9, 6, 8)>, and <9, (4, 1, 7)>.
