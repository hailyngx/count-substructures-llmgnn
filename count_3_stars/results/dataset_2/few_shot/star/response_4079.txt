Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the given information, we can list down the 3-stars as follows:
<0, (4, 5, 19)>
<1, (8, 11, 12)>
<2, (5, 6, 16)>
<3, (4, 9, 14)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 11, 17)>
<7, (5, 6, 13)>
<8, (1, 4, 16)>
<9, (3, 4, 10)>
<10, (9, 11, 14)>
<11, (1, 6, 18)>
<12, (1, 11, 13)>
<13, (7, 12, 14)>
<14, (3, 10, 13)>
<15, (4, 8, 18)>
<16, (2, 5, 8)>
<17, (6, 11, 17)>
<18, (11, 15, 1)>
<19, (0, 4, 19)>

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars: [20].
