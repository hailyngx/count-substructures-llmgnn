Response:
Looking at the given graph, we can see that each 3-star should involve one central node and three leaf nodes. To easily identify the 3-stars, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

1. Let's identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 1 has 1, 8
   - Node 3 has 10, 12
   - Node 5 has 7, 18
   - Node 7 has 5, 8
   - Node 10 has 3, 15
   - Node 11 has 9, 19
   - Node 17 has 12, 18
   - Node 19 has 2, 11

2. Among these, let's identify the 3-stars:
   - From Node 17: <17, (12, 18, 0)>
   - From Node 19: <19, (11, 18, 2)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
