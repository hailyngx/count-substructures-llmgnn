Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 7) (14, 9) (14, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 10, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 10, 8, 3, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, 7, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 13, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 13, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 10, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 13, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 10, 2, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 14, 10, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 6, 11, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 10, and node 13
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 13, and node 3

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 10)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 10)>
<10, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 12)>
<7, (0, 2, 13)>
<8, (2, 5, 12)>
<13, (4, 7, 11)>
<4, (2, 13, 14)>
<1, (6, 7, 10)>
<12, (3, 8, 13)>
<11, (10, 13)>
<14, (4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
