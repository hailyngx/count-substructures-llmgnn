Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 3, and 5. 
    - <0, (9, 1, 3)>
    - <0, (9, 1, 5)>
    [2]

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 2, and 0. 
    - <1, (9, 3, 2)>
    - <1, (9, 3, 0)>
    [2]

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8. 
    - <2, (1, 3, 8)>
    [1]

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 0, 2, 5, and 8. 
    - <3, (1, 0, 2)>
    - <3, (1, 0, 8)>
    - <3, (1, 2, 8)>
    - <3, (0, 2, 5)>
    - <3, (2, 5, 8)>
    [5]

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 9, and 6. 
    - <4, (7, 8, 9)>
    - <4, (7, 9, 6)>
    [2]

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 3, 8, and 0.
    - <5, (7, 3, 8)>
    - <5, (3, 8, 0)>
    [2]

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 8. 
    - <6, (4, 9, 8)>
    [1]

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
    - No 3-stars centered at node 7.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 9, 3, 2, and 5. 
    - <8, (4, 6, 9)>
    - <8, (4, 3, 2)>
    - <8, (4, 2, 5)>
    - <8, (6, 9, 3)>
    - <8, (6, 3, 5)>
    - <8, (9, 2, 5)>
    [6]

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, 1, and 0. 
    - <9, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <9, (4, 1, 0)>
    [2]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].
