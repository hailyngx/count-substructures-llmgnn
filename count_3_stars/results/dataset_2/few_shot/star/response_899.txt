Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes connected to each node form the leaves of the potential 3-stars. To form a 3-star, a node needs to be connected to exactly three other nodes.

    - For node 0, it is connected to 4, 7, 8, and 2. It forms <0, (4, 7, 8)> and <0, (4, 8, 2)>.
    - For node 1, it is connected to 3, 2, 5, and 9. It forms <1, (3, 2, 5)> and <1, (3, 5, 9)>.
    - For node 2, it is connected to 4, 1, 6, and 0. It forms <2, (4, 1, 6)>.
    - For node 3, it is connected to 7, 1, and 6. It doesn't form any 3-star as it has only two connections.
    - For node 4, it is connected to 7, 2, 9, 0, and 5. It forms <4, (7, 2, 5)> and <4, (7, 5, 9)>.
    - For node 5, it is connected to 4, 1, 8, and 6. It doesn't form any 3-star as it has four connections.
    - For node 6, it is connected to 3, 8, 5, and 2. It forms <6, (3, 8, 5)> and <6, (3, 5, 2)>.
    - For node 7, it is connected to 4, 0, 3, and 8. It forms <7, (4, 0, 3)>.
    - For node 8, it is connected to 7, 9, 5, 0, and 6. It doesn't form any 3-star as it has five connections.
    - For node 9, it is connected to 4, 1, and 8. It doesn't form any 3-star as it has three connections.

Hence, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 8, 2)>, <1, (3, 2, 5)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 1, 6)>, <4, (7, 2, 5)>, <4, (7, 5, 9)>, and <6, (3, 8, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
