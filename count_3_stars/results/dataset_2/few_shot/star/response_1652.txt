Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of 3-stars around each node and then summing them up. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each node:

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (10, 4, 14)>
   - Total = 1

2. Node 1:
   - No 3-star pattern since it only has one connection.

3. Node 2:
   - <2, (18, 19, 11)>
   - Total = 1

4. Node 3:
   - <3, (18, 11, 19)>
   - Total = 1

5. Node 4:
   - No 3-star pattern since it only has one connection.

6. Node 5:
   - <5, (18, 16, 7)>
   - Total = 1

7. Node 6:
   - No 3-star pattern since it only has one connection.

8. Node 7:
   - <7, (8, 15, 13)>
   - <7, (15, 14, 10)>
   - <7, (13, 16, 5)>
   - Several 3-stars for node 7.
   - Total = 3

9. Node 8:
   - No 3-star pattern since it only has one connection.

10. Node 9:
    - <9, (6, 14, 19)>
    - Total = 1

11. Node 10:
    - <10, (17, 15, 0)>
    - <10, (15, 14, 11)>
    - <10, (0, 14, 9)>
    - Total = 3

12. Node 11:
    - <11, (2, 3, 13)>
    - <11, (3, 19, 12)>
    - <11, (13, 16, 7)>
    - Total = 3

13. Node 12:
    - No 3-star pattern since it only has two connections.

14. Node 13:
    - No 3-star pattern since it only has three connections.

15. Node 14:
    - <14, (9, 10, 0)>
    - <14, (10, 15, 7)>
    - Total = 2

16. Node 15:
    - <15, (10, 14, 11)>
    - <15, (14, 15, 7)>
    - Total = 2

17. Node 16:
    - <16, (17, 12, 1)>
    - <16, (12, 19, 3)>
    - <16, (13, 11, 7)>
    - <16, (5, 18, 3)>
    - Total = 4

18. Node 17:
    - No 3-star pattern since it only has two connections.

19. Node 18:
    - <18, (2, 5, 16)>
    - Total = 1

20. Node 19:
    - <19, (9, 2, 3)>
    - <19, (3, 12, 11)>
    - Total = 2

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for all nodes: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 23

[23]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (10, 4, 14)>, <2, (18, 19, 11)>, <3, (18, 11, 19)>, <5, (18, 16, 7)>, <7, (8, 15, 13)>, <7, (15, 14, 10)>, <7, (13, 16, 5)>, <9, (6, 14, 19)>, <10, (17, 15, 0)>, <10, (15, 14, 11)>, <10, (0, 14, 9)>, <11, (2, 3, 13)>, <11, (3, 19, 12)>, <11, (13, 16, 7)>, <14, (9, 10, 0)>, <14, (10, 15, 7)>, <15, (10, 14, 11)>, <15, (14, 15, 7)>, <16, (17, 12, 1)>, <16, (12, 19, 3)>, <16, (13, 11, 7)>, <16, (5, 18, 3)>, <18, (2, 5, 16)>, <19, (9, 2, 3)>, <19, (3, 12, 11)>
