Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- Node 0: (6, 9, 1), (6, 5, 7), (9, 1, 2), (9, 0, 4)
- Node 1: (9, 2, 0), (9, 1, 7), (1, 2, 0)
- Node 2: (6, 9, 1), (6, 5, 7), (9, 2, 1), (9, 0, 2)
- Node 3: No 3-star as it is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
- Node 4: (6, 9, 4)
- Node 5: (6, 5, 7), (6, 3, 8), (6, 2, 5), (6, 0, 5)
- Node 6: (9, 5, 7), (6, 5, 7), (9, 2, 6), (9, 0, 6)
- Node 7: (6, 5, 7), (9, 1, 7), (6, 7, 3)
- Node 8: (6, 3, 8), (5, 3, 8)
- Node 9: (6, 9, 4), (9, 2, 1), (9, 0, 4)

Combining all the unique 3-star graphs, we have:
<[6,9,1], [6,5,7], [9,1,2], [9,0,4], [9,2,0], [9,1,7], [1,2,0], [9,2,1], [9,0,2], [6,9,4], [6,3,8], [6,2,5], [6,0,5], [6,7,3]> 

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
