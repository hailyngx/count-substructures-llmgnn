Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 9, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars.

The central nodes of the possible 3-stars can be any node with exactly 3 neighbors. From the adjacency list provided, the central nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.

Now, for each central node, we check its neighbors and see if they are connected to each other to form a 3-star configuration.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (7, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (7, 1, 5)>
<3, (4, 6, 0)>
<4, (7, 5, 1)>
<6, (7, 1, 3)>
<7, (4, 0, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
