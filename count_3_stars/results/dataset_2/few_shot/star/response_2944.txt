Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's list them:
1. Node 4: (7, 9, 5)
2. Node 7: (4, 3, 6)
3. Node 1: (4, 0, 5)
4. Node 3: (7, 6, 9)
5. Node 5: (4, 7, 8)
6. Node 6: (4, 7, 3)
7. Node 2: (3, 8, 5)
8. Node 0: (1, 8, 9)

Now let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [8]

Therefore, the answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (7, 9, 5)>
<7, (4, 3, 6)>
<1, (4, 0, 5)>
<3, (7, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 3)>
<2, (3, 8, 5)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
