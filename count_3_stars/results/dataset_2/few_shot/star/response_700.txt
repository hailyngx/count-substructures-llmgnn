Response:
We need to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (13, 29, 10)>
<1, (0, 19, 16)>
<2, (9, 17, 7)>
<3, (29, 18, 8)>
<4, (9)>
<5, (23, 18, 11)>
<6, (24, 10, 8)>
<7, (26, 27, 23)>
<8, (22, 29, 6)>
<9, (4, 18, 25)>
<10, (20, 26, 0)>
<11, (22, 5, 21)>
<13, (16, 0)>
<14, (5, 16)>
<15, (20, 17, 16)>
<17, (22, 15, 2)>
<19, (24, 1)>
<20, (15, 24, 10)>
<21, (27, 11)>
<22, (11, 17, 8)>
<23, (5, 7)>
<24, (20, 26, 6)>
<25, (28, 9)>
<26, (24, 10, 7)>
<27, (24, 21, 7)>
<28, (29, 25)>
<29, (28, 8, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [28]
