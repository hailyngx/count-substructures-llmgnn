Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

1. **Identify Nodes Connected to Exactly Three Other Nodes:**
   - Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, Node 9, Node 12, and Node 14 are connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. **Identify 3-Stars:**
   - For each of the identified nodes above, check if they form a 3-star with their neighbors. A 3-star will have one central node and three other nodes connected to it.

3. **Count the 3-Stars:**
   - Count all unique 3-stars we find.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
- <2, (5, 1, 4)>
- <5, (9, 0, 13)>
- <6, (9, 10, 14)>
- <9, (5, 6, 12)>
- <12, (9, 1, 10)>
- <14, (6, 3, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
