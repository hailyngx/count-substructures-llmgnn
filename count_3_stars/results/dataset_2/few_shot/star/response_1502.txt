Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's list them:

1. For Node 0, the 3-stars are:
    - <0, (27, 20, 25)>
    
2. For Node 1, the 3-stars are not present as it has only 2 connections.

3. For Node 2, the 3-stars are not present as it has only 2 connections.

4. For Node 3, the 3-stars are not present as it has only 1 connection.

5. For Node 4, the 3-stars are:
    - <4, (21, 19, 6)>
    - <4, (21, 5, 17)>
    - <4, (19, 6, 5)>
    
6. For Node 5, the 3-stars are not present as it has more than 3 connections.

7. For Node 6, the 3-stars are not present as it has only 2 connections.

8. For Node 7, the 3-stars are not present as it has only 2 connections.

9. For Node 8, the 3-stars are:
    - <8, (16, 10, 17)>
    
10. For Node 9, the 3-stars are not present as it has only 2 connections.

11. For Node 10, the 3-stars are not present as it has only 3 connections.

12. For Node 11, the 3-stars are:
    - <11, (27, 5, 12)>
    
13. For Node 12, the 3-stars are not present as it has more than 3 connections.

14. For Node 13, the 3-stars are:
    - <13, (27, 7, 24)>
    - <13, (27, 14, 23)>
    
15. For Node 14, the 3-stars are not present as it has more than 3 connections.

16. For Node 15, the 3-stars are not present as it has only 3 connections.

17. For Node 16, the 3-stars are not present as it has more than 3 connections.

18. For Node 17, the 3-stars are not present as it has only 2 connections.

19. For Node 18, the 3-stars are not present as it has only 2 connections.

20. For Node 19, the 3-stars are not present as it has more than 3 connections.

21. For Node 20, the 3-stars are not present as it has more than 3 connections.

22. For Node 21, the 3-stars are not present as it has only 2 connections.

23. For Node 22, the 3-stars are not present as it has only 1 connection.

24. For Node 23, the 3-stars are not present as it has only 2 connections.

25. For Node 24, the 3-stars are:
    - <24, (19, 9, 13)>
    
26. For Node 25, the 3-stars are:
    - <25, (0, 26, 15)>
    
27. For Node 26, the 3-stars are not present as it has more than 3 connections.

28. For Node 27, the 3-stars are not present as it has more than 3 connections.

29. For Node 28, the 3-stars are not present as it has more than 3 connections.

30. For Node 29, the 3-stars are not present as it has only 2 connections.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (27, 20, 25)>, <4, (21, 19, 6)>, <4, (21, 5, 17)>, <4, (19, 6, 5)>, <8, (16, 10, 17)>, <11, (27, 5, 12)>, <13, (27, 7, 24)>, <13, (27, 14, 23)>, <24, (19, 9, 13)>, <25, (0, 26, 15)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of [10].
