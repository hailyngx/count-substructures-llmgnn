Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (6, 3, 7)>
<0, (6, 2, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 8, 1)>
<2, (5, 1, 4)>
<2, (5, 7, 0)>
<2, (1, 8, 6)>
<6, (5, 9, 0)>
<6, (5, 9, 8)>
<6, (9, 8, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
<9, (6, 8, 7)>
<1, (9, 2, 8)>
<3, (9, 7, 0)>

So, there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
