Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node:
- Node 0 forms one 3-star: <0, (6, 2, 3)>
- Node 1 forms two 3-stars: <1, (5, 7, 6)> and <1, (5, 7, 12)>
- Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (7, 8, 11)>
- Node 3 forms zero 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms one 3-star: <4, (9, 7, 12)>
- Node 5 forms two 3-stars: <5, (9, 8, 1)> and <5, (9, 8, 10)>
- Node 6 forms zero 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms zero 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms zero 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms zero 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms zero 3-stars.
- Node 11 forms zero 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms three 3-stars: <12, (9, 4, 0)>, <12, (9, 1, 12)>, and <12, (9, 3, 1)>
- Node 13 forms zero 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms zero 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9] and they are:
<0, (6, 2, 3)>, <1, (5, 7, 6)>, <1, (5, 7, 12)>, <2, (7, 8, 11)>, <4, (9, 7, 12)>, <5, (9, 8, 1)>, <5, (9, 8, 10)>, <12, (9, 4, 0)>, and <12, (9, 3, 1)>
