Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each valid 3-star where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given that each 3-star involves a central node and three leaves connected to the central node, we can start by looking at each node in the graph to see if it is the central node of a 3-star.

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For Node 0:
   - <0, (4, 8, 14)>
   - <0, (4, 8, 5)>
   - <0, (4, 8, 13)>
   
2. For Node 1:
   - <1, (14, 4, 0)>
   - <1, (14, 0, 5)>

3. For Node 2:
   - <2, (3, 8, 13)>
  
4. For Node 3:
   - <3, (7, 6, 2)>
   - <3, (7, 10, 9)>

5. For Node 4:
   - <4, (1, 3, 0)>
   - <4, (1, 3, 6)>
   - <4, (1, 3, 2)>
   - <4, (8, 2, 6)>
   - <4, (8, 2, 11)>
   
6. For Node 5:
   - <5, (8, 0, 7)>
   - <5, (8, 0, 14)>
   - <5, (8, 0, 7)>

7. For Node 6:
   - <6, (3, 4, 2)>
   - <6, (3, 4, 11)>
   - <6, (3, 4, 12)>
   
8. For Node 7:
   - <7, (3, 10, 9)>
   
9. For Node 8:
   - <8, (4, 2, 6)>
   - <8, (4, 2, 11)>
   - <8, (4, 2, 13)>

10. For Node 9:
    - <9, (7, 10, 13)>
   
11. For Node 10:
    - <10, (14, 7, 9)>
   
12. For Node 11:
    - <11, (6, 13, 12)>
    
13. For Node 12:
    - <12, (6, 11, 13)>
    
14. For Node 13:
    - <13, (2, 11, 12)>

15. For Node 14:
    - <14, (1, 0, 5)>

By listing out all the unique 3-stars found, we can now determine the total count of 3-stars: [24].
