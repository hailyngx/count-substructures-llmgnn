Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we can see the connections for each node. Let's look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These will form the 3-stars in the graph.

1. For Node 1:
   Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 10, 14, and 9. As we can see, Node 1 has exactly three edges (4, 10, 14) but not all of them are unique, so it does not form a 3-star.
   
2. For Node 2:
   Node 2 is connected to nodes 10, 8, 5, 3, and 14. It has three unique edges (10, 8, 5), forming a 3-star.
   <2, (10, 8, 5)>
   
3. For Node 4:
   Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 9, 5, 14, 1, and 11. It has three unique edges (7, 9, 5), forming a 3-star.
   <4, (7, 9, 5)>
   
4. For Node 9:
   Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 11, 13, 1, and 14. It has three unique edges (4, 11, 13), forming a 3-star.
   <9, (4, 11, 13)>
   
5. For Node 10:
   Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 8, 1, and 2. As we can see, Node 10 has exactly three edges (11, 8, 1) but not all of them are unique, so it does not form a 3-star.
   
6. For Node 13:
   Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 9, 14, and 6. It has three unique edges (8, 9, 14), forming a 3-star.
   <13, (8, 9, 14)>
  
7. For Node 14:
   Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 13, 2, 1, and 9. It has three unique edges (4, 13, 2), forming a 3-star.
   <14, (4, 13, 2)>
   
Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
