Response:
Let's analyze the graph step by step to count the number of 3-stars:

1. Look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes can serve as the center of a 3-star.

Nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them: 
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 5, 11, and 1
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 12
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 4, 9, and 14
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 10, 11, and 0

2. For each of these nodes, check the nodes they are connected to and see if they form a 3-star pattern.

    For Node 1:
    - 3-star: <1, (5, 11, 1)> 

    For Node 3:
    - No 3-star pattern possible.

    For Node 9:
    - No 3-star pattern possible.

    For Node 8:
    - 3-star: <8, (10, 11, 0)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

    Unique 3-stars:
    <1, (5, 11, 1)>
    <8, (10, 11, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
