Response:
The central nodes of the 3-stars in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25, and 27.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars: 

- Node 0: There is one 3-star <0, (16, 28, 23)>.
- Node 1: There is one 3-star <1, (19, 24, 27)>.
- Node 2: There is one 3-star <2, (29, 18, 12)>.
- Node 4: There is one 3-star <4, (29, 7, 16)>.
- Node 5: There is one 3-star <5, (25, 21, 9)>.
- Node 6: There is one 3-star <6, (14, 3, 26)>.
- Node 7: There is one 3-star <7, (4, 14, 22)>.
- Node 9: There is one 3-star <9, (21, 12, 11)>.
- Node 11: There is one 3-star <11, (15, 9, 27)>.
- Node 13: There is one 3-star <13, (15, 14, 12)>.
- Node 14: There is one 3-star <14, (7, 6, 23)>.
- Node 16: There is one 3-star <16, (4, 0, 25)>.
- Node 18: There is one 3-star <18, (2, 20, 24)>.
- Node 21: There is one 3-star <21, (29, 5, 23)>.
- Node 22: There is one 3-star <22, (7, 26, 8)>.
- Node 24: There is one 3-star <24, (4, 18, 8)>.
- Node 25: There is one 3-star <25, (5, 10, 16)>.
- Node 27: There is one 3-star <27, (29, 19, 16)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [<0, (16, 28, 23)>, <1, (19, 24, 27)>, <2, (29, 18, 12)>, <4, (29, 7, 16)>, <5, (25, 21, 9)>, <6, (14, 3, 26)>, <7, (4, 14, 22)>, <9, (21, 12, 11)>, <11, (15, 9, 27)>, <13, (15, 14, 12)>, <14, (7, 6, 23)>, <16, (4, 0, 25)>, <18, (2, 20, 24)>, <21, (29, 5, 23)>, <22, (7, 26, 8)>, <24, (4, 18, 8)>, <25, (5, 10, 16)>, <27, (29, 19, 16)>].
