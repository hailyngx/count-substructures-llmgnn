Response:
Let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in this graph:

<15, (10, 26, 14)>
<27, (28, 9, 13)>
<6, (28, 14, 0)>
<9, (27, 6, 23)>
<3, (10, 12, 17)>
<17, (29, 1, 8)>
<29, (7, 13, 5)>
<0, (6, 14, 2)>
<14, (15, 0, 2)>
<26, (24, 12, 15)>
<28, (18, 6, 2)>
<1, (22, 16, 7)>
<24, (19, 2, 26)>
<11, (29, 23, 5)>
