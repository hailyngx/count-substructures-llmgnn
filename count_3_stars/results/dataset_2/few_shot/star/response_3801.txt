Response:
There are three steps to solve this problem:
1. Find all nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.
2. For each of these nodes, identify if the connected nodes form a 3-star.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

Let's start with the first step and identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 12 is connected to only 3 edges.

Now, let's check if Node 12 is part of any 3-stars:
- Node 12 has edges connected to nodes 2, 7, and 16. These nodes do not form a 3-star around Node 12.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0].

Final answer: [0]
