Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 3) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 12) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 7) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 4) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 3) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 2) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 5) (16, 17) (16, 7) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 18) (18, 19) (18, 12) (18, 14) (11, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (14, 6) (14, 15) (14, 18) (4, 17) (4, 0) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 4) (5, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 15, 12, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 15, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 19, and node 12
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 17, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 17, 14, and node 10
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 13, 16, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 17, 12, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 15, and node 12
Node 11 is connected to node 13
Node 12 is connected to node 10, 8, 2, 0, and node 18
Node 13 is connected to node 17, 11, 19, and node 7
Node 14 is connected to node 6, 15, and node 18
Node 15 is connected to node 1, 10, 0, and node 14
Node 16 is connected to node 17, and node 7
Node 17 is connected to node 6, 13, 16, 8, and node 4
Node 18 is connected to node 19, 12, and node 14
Node 19 is connected to node 13, 18, and node 2

Response:
There are only 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 17, 14)>
<12, (10, 8, 18)>

Therefore, the answer is [2].
