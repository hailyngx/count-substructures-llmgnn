Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, 7, and node 0
