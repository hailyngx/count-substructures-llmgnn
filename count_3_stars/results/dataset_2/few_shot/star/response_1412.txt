Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 13) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 2) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 13, 9, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 10, 14, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, 11, and node 13
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 10, and node 11
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 12, 14, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, and node 14
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 11, 8, 0, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 11, 6, and node 12
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 9, 5, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 10, and node 13
Node 13 is connected to node 12, 0, 5, and node 9
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node has exactly three neighbors, forming a 3-star with that node as the center.

Here are the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (13, 9, 2)>
<1, (7, 3, 6)>
<2, (7, 0, 14)>
<3, (1, 9, 5)>
<4, (7, 8, 10)>
<5, (7, 3, 11)>
<6, (4, 1, 10)>
<7, (4, 12, 14)>
<8, (4, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 11, 13)>
<10, (4, 11, 6)>
<11, (10, 9, 5)>
<12, (7, 10, 13)>
<13, (12, 0, 5)>
<14, (4, 7, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
