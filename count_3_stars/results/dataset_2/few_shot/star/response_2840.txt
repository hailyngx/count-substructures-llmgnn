Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 8) (3, 15) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 12) (10, 17) (10, 4) (17, 10) (17, 2) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 18) (18, 3) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 7) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 0) (0, 16) (0, 1) (7, 18) (7, 13) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (6, 14) (6, 19) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 13) (19, 6) (19, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 12) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 5) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9)

Node 17 is connected to node 10, and node 2
Node 18 is connected to node 3, 8, 5, and node 7
Node 19 is connected to node 6, and node 2

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<8, (15, 4, 14)>
<1, (16, 5, 13)>
<9, (11, 2, 14)>
<5, (12, 4, 18)>
<2, (17, 19, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
