Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure based on the given adjacency list. 
Nodes with exactly three neighbors are potential centers of 3-stars.

1. Node 1: Connected to nodes 13, 10, and 9
2. Node 10: Connected to nodes 20, 1, 5, and 24
3. Node 13: Connected to nodes 26, 21, and 3
4. Node 16: Connected to nodes 7, 12, 2
5. Node 19: Connected to nodes 11, 16, and 4
6. Node 21: Connected to nodes 13, 26, 8, and 2

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From Node 1: <1, (13, 10, 9)>
2. From Node 10: <10, (20, 1, 5)>
3. From Node 13: <13, (26, 21, 3)>
4. From Node 16: <16, (7, 12, 2)>
5. From Node 19: <19, (11, 16, 4)>
6. From Node 21: <21, (13, 26, 8)>

Count: [6]
