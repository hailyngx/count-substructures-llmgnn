The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 10) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 11, and node 12
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 10, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 10, 11, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 12, 10, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 13, and node 12
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 2, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 14, 13, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 1, 4, 2, 12, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, and node 14
Node 12 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, 5, 0, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 5
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 7, 11, and node 10

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 6 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 9. 
2. Node 9 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 7.
3. Node 1 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 3, 10, and 12.
4. Node 10 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 1, 14, and 4.
5. Node 7 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 9.
6. Node 12 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 5.
7. Node 13 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 9.
8. Node 11 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 14.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 10, 12)>
<10, (1, 14, 4)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<12, (1, 4, 5)>
<13, (3, 5, 9)>
<11, (0, 2, 14)>
