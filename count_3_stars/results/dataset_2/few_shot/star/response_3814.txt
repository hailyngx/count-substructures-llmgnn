Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 12) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 3) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 11) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 13, 10, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 11
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 12
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 13, 0, 14, and node 10
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 11, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 12, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 14, and node 11
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 10, and node 11
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 1, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 14, 2, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph. Here are the unique 3-stars <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)> found in the graph:

1. <5, (9, 6, 2)>
2. <9, (5, 3, 1)>
3. <4, (0, 1, 11)>
4. <7, (9, 3, 1)>
5. <6, (5, 1, 14)>
6. <8, (10, 11, 4)>
7. <13, (3, 0, _)>
8. <0, (9, 4, 13)>
9. <14, (5, 6, 12)>
10. <1, (9, 4, 7)>
11. <10, (8, 0, 3)>
12. <2, (5, 4, 12)>
13. <12, (5, 14, 11)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
Count: [13]
