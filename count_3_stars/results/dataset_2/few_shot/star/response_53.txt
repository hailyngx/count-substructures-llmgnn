Response:
The central node in a 3-star graph is always connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. So, to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
1. For each node in the graph, determine if it forms the center of a 3-star.
2. Count the total number of 3-stars found in the graph.
   
Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (11, 14, 19)>
<0, (2, 14, 19)>
<0, (2, 19, 14)>
<1, (3, 9, 14)>
<1, (3, 14, 9)>
<2, (0, 14, 19)>
<2, (0, 19, 14)>
<2, (7, 14, 19)>
<2, (7, 19, 14)>
<4, (3, 11, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 11)>
<5, (18, 19, 0)>
<5, (18, 0, 19)>
<6, (4, 8, 15)>
<6, (4, 15, 8)>
<7, (2, 14, 17)>
<7, (2, 17, 14)>
<8, (6, 9, 19)>
<8, (6, 19, 9)>
<14, (0, 3, 17)>
<14, (0, 17, 3)>
<15, (6, 12, 18)>
<15, (6, 18, 12)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph [20].
