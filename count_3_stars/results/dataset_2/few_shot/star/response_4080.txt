Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 4) (13, 1) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 11, and node 12
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 6, 13, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 10, 8, 12, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, 6, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 12, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 12, 4, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 10, 11, 6, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 14, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 7, 2, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 7, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 2, 6, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 10, 7, and node 4

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph based on the given information.

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, and 6 <1, (2, 8, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 10, and 12 <2, (1, 10, 12)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 3, and 6 <4, (5, 3, 6)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 1, and 7 <9, (14, 1, 7)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 7, and 14 <10, (11, 7, 14)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 2, and 6 <12, (5, 2, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 6.
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
