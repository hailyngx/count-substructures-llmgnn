Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 4: connected to nodes 29, 21, and center node
- Node 11: connected to nodes 16, 27, and center node
- Node 12: connected to nodes 14, center node
- Node 21: connected to nodes 28, 22, and center node

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<4, (29, 21, center)>
<11, (16, 27, center)>
<21, (28, 22, center)>
<12, (14, center)>

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [4].
