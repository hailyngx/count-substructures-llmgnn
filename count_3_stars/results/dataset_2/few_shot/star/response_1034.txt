Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the adjacency list and edge information, we can identify the 3-stars:

1. From the adjacency list, we note that nodes 9, 10, 11, and 14 are connected to 4 other nodes, making them potential central nodes for 3-stars. 

2. We can now list the 3-star configurations:
    - <9, (6, 1, 4)>
    - <10, (11, 8, 14)>
    - <11, (9, 10, 1)>
    - <14, (10, 8, 4)>

To find the total number of 3-stars, we need to count the occurrences of each unique configuration. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
