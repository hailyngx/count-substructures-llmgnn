Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars. Each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-stars. Let's list them one by one:

1. <0, (20, 3, 28)>
2. <1, (25, 10, 14)>
3. <2, (18, 26, 7)>
4. <3, (0, 10, 23)>
5. <4, (27, 19, 24)>
6. <5, (18, 17, 21)>
7. <6, (27, 18, 7)>
8. <7, (9, 2, 13)>
9. <8, (26, 12, *)>
10. <10, (21, 3, 1)>
11. <11, (22, *, *)>
12. <12, (8, 3, *)>
13. <13, (27, 29, 26)>
14. <14, (5, 1, *)>
15. <16, (27, 22, 19)>
16. <17, (5, *, *)>
17. <18, (5, 2, 26)>
18. <19, (20, 2, 4)>
19. <20, (0, 21, *)>
20. <21, (5, 20, 17)>
21. <22, (11, *, *)>
22. <23, (3, 12, *)>
23. <24, (28, *, *)>
24. <25, (1, 28, *)>
25. <26, (2, 18, 13)>
26. <27, (4, 13, 16)>
27. <28, (25, 0, 29)>
28. <29, (28, *, *)>

We have listed all the unique 3-stars present in the given graph. Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of [28].
