Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1

Response:
Let's list out the 3-stars present in the given graph:

<0, (7, 3, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<1, (5, 9, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 3)>
<1, (5, 8, 3)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 4, 7)>
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
