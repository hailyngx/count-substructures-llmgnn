Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that are at the center of a 3-star. 

The nodes and their connections we can identify as centers of 3-stars are: 7, 8, 10, 14, 18, and 19.

Now, let's find the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<7, (10, 16, 11)>
<8, (9, 4, 11)>
<10, (18, 7, 14)>
<14, (12, 6, 10)>
<18, (15, 1, 19)>
<19, (6, 17, 18)>

Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
