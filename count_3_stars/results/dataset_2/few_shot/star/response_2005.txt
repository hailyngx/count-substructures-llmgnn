Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, 7, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1

Response:
The given graph can be represented by the following 3-stars:
<1, (9, 0, 7)>
<2, (6, 4, 0)>
<3, (7, 5, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 2)>
<5, (6, 3, 8)>
<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<7, (6, 1, 3)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<9, (1, 8, 9)>
<10, (0, 2, 5)>

[10 3-stars]
