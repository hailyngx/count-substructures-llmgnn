Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Let's list out the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (5, 6, 13)>
<2, (6, 11, 12)>
<5, (1, 6, 15)>
<6, (1, 2, 10)>
<7, (12, 14, 19)>
<10, (6, 7, 14)>
<11, (1, 2, 18)>
<12, (2, 7, 13)>
<13, (1, 6, 4)>
<14, (7, 10, 17)>
<15, (5, 9, 15)>
<16, (3, 9, 17)>
<17, (0, 14, 16)>
<18, (8, 11, 18)>
<19, (7, 10, 19)>

Counting the number of 3-stars found, we have a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
