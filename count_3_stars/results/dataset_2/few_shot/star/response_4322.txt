Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the provided adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>
<8, (5, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>
<8, (5, 9, 1)>
