Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking for nodes with exactly three edges:
- Node 0 has 4 edges
- Node 1 has 3 edges
- Node 2 has 5 edges
- Node 3 has 5 edges
- Node 4 has 4 edges
- Node 5 has 4 edges
- Node 6 has 3 edges
- Node 7 has 4 edges
- Node 8 has 3 edges
- Node 9 has 5 edges

Since we are interested in 3-star graphs, we need to focus on nodes with exactly 3 edges. These are nodes 1, 6, and 8.

Next, let's look at possible 3-star combinations for these nodes:
- For Node 1: It is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 0. So, <1, (9, 2, 0)> is a 3-star.
- For Node 6: It is connected to nodes 5, 3, and 0. So, <6, (5, 3, 0)> is a 3-star.
- For Node 8: It is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 2. So, <8, (9, 4, 2)> is a 3-star.

Combining all the unique 3-stars, we have:
<1, (9, 2, 0)>, <6, (5, 3, 0)>, <8, (9, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
