Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 
Each node can be the central node of a 3-star. So, we will count the 3-stars centered at each node.

Number of 3-stars centered at each node:
- Node 0: Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 1: Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 2: Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 3: Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 4: <4, (1, 0, 7)>
- Node 5: <5, (9, 14, 12)>
- Node 6: <6, (9, 5, 2)>
- Node 7: <7, (9, 4, 12)>
- Node 8: Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 9: <9, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 10: Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 11: Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 12: Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 13: Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 14: <14, (5, 6, 12)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (1, 0, 7)>
<5, (9, 14, 12)>
<6, (9, 5, 2)>
<7, (9, 4, 12)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<14, (5, 6, 12)>
