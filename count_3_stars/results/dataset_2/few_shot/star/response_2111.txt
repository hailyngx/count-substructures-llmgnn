Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (which makes up a 3-star).

Looking at the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (9, 11, 1)>
<2, (8, 5, 12)>
<4, (14, 18, 11)>
<7, (9, 11, 3)>
<8, (13, 2, 9)>
<10, (18, 12, 19)>
<15, (17, 4, 2)>
<16, (14, 19, 16)>
<17, (19, 15, 18)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
