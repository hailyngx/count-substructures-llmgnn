The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 1) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 0) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 11, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 11, 13, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 12, 13, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 11, 0, and node 14
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 14, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 13, 4, 3, and node 10
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 14, 10, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 11, 10, 7, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 1, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 12, 3, 1, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 2, 14, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 2, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node's connections and identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the format described in the initial prompt:

<5, (9, 13, 4)>
<9, (5, 10, 7)>
<4, (5, 3, 14)>
<7, (9, 13, 2)>
<8, (14, 10, 1)>
<0, (3, 11, 2)>
<2, (7, 13, 12)>
<1, (8, 11, 13)>
<3, (5, 4, 14)>
<11, (9, 12, 1)>
<13, (5, 9, 7)>
<14, (4, 10, 12)>
<10, (5, 9, 8)>
<12, (2, 14, 11)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
