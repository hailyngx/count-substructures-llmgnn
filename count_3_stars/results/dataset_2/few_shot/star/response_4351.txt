Response:
There are several steps to solve this. Let's start by finding the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For each node in the graph, we will check if it is the center of a 3-star by examining its neighbors. 

2. A 3-star graph consists of a central node and exactly three other nodes connected to the central node.

3. We will iterate through each node and check its neighbors to see if any 3-star configurations exist.

After examining all the nodes, we will count the number of unique 3-stars and output the answer. Let's start the process.
