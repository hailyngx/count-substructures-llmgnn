Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars. This can be done by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. Once we identify these nodes, we can then check if they form a 3-star by confirming that they are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 1 (neighbors: 0, 6, 2)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 7, 1, 11)
- Node 12 (neighbors: 5, 8, 13)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 12, 1)

Now, let's check if any of these nodes are part of a 3-star:

- Node 1 is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 2 is part of a 3-star: <2, (7, 11, 1)>
- Node 12 is part of a 3-star: <12, (5, 8, 13)>
- Node 14 is not part of a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

<2, (7, 11, 1)>
<12, (5, 8, 13)>
