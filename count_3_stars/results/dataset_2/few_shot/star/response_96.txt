Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 3

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Find all nodes with 3 neighbors each:
   - Node 5 has neighbors {1, 4, 0, 7}
   - Node 6 has neighbors {9, 1, 7, 2, 4}
   - Node 8 has neighbors {9, 1, 4, 2, 7}

2. Count the 3-stars:
   - Node 5 can form 1 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 0)>
   - Node 6 can form 1 3-star: <6, (9, 1, 7)>
   - Node 8 can form 1 3-star: <8, (9, 1, 4)>


Therefore, there are [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
