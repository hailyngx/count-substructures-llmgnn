Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 7) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13)

Node 8 is connected to node 5, 11, 2, and node 14
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 14, 3, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 6, 11, 3, and node 13
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 7, 8, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 11, 0, 3, and node 13
Node 13 is connected to node 10, 3, 7, 12, and node 1
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs found in the given graph are: 

<0, (6, 4, 12)>
<1, (9, 4, 14)>
<2, (6, 4, 8)>
<3, (9, 10, 13)>
<5, (9, 8, 10)>
<9, (5, 14, 3)>
<10, (5, 6, 11)>
<11, (10, 8, 12)>
<12, (11, 0, 3)>
<13, (10, 7, 12)>
<14, (9, 8, 1)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
