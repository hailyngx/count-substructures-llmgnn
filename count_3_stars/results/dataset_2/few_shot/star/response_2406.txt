Response:
First, let's identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each potential 3-star in the given graph:

1. For node 5:
   - Potential 3-star: <5, (9, 6, 2)>
   - Potential 3-star: <5, (9, 1, 4)>
   - Potential 3-star: <5, (6, 9, 0)>
   - Potential 3-star: <5, (2, 1, 7)>
   - Potential 3-star: <5, (1, 9, 6)>
   - Potential 3-star: <5, (4, 7, 0)>

2. For node 9:
   - Potential 3-star: <9, (5, 6, 1)>
   - Potential 3-star: <9, (5, 7, 4)>
   - Potential 3-star: <9, (6, 5, 7)>
   - Potential 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 7)>
   - Potential 3-star: <9, (7, 4, 0)>

3. For node 4:
   - Potential 3-star: <4, (5, 7, 0)>

4. For node 7:
   - Potential 3-star: <7, (9, 4, 0)>
   - Potential 3-star: <7, (4, 0, 3)>
   - Potential 3-star: <7, (6, 5, 0)>
   - Potential 3-star: <7, (8, 2, 3)>

5. For node 6:
   - Potential 3-star: <6, (5, 9, 7)>
   - Potential 3-star: <6, (5, 2, 0)>
   - Potential 3-star: <6, (9, 7, 0)>

6. For node 2:
   - Potential 3-star: <2, (5, 8, 1)>
   - Potential 3-star: <2, (5, 1, 8)>
   - Potential 3-star: <2, (8, 7, 3)>

7. For node 1:
   - Potential 3-star: <1, (5, 9, 2)>
   - Potential 3-star: <1, (5, 2, 8)>

8. For node 0:
   - Potential 3-star: <0, (5, 4, 7)>
   - Potential 3-star: <0, (4, 7, 3)>

9. For node 3:
   - Potential 3-star: <3, (7, 8, 0)>

10. For node 8:
   - Potential 3-star: <8, (7, 2, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [16].  
Unique 3-stars: <5, (9, 6, 2)>, <5, (9, 1, 4)>, <5, (6, 9, 0)>, <5, (2, 1, 7)>, <5, (1, 9, 6)>, <5, (4, 7, 0)>, <9, (5, 6, 1)>, <9, (5, 7, 4)>, <9, (6, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (7, 4, 0)>, <4, (5, 7, 0)>, <7, (9, 4, 0)>, <7, (4, 0, 3)>, <7, (6, 5, 0)>, <7, (8, 2, 3)>.
