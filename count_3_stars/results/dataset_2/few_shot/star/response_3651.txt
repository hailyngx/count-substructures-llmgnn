Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by multiplying the total number of nodes by the total number of possible 3-star configurations around each node. Since each 3-star consists of a central node and 3 leaf nodes, we need to consider each individual node as the central node and count the number of 3-stars around it. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each node:
- Node 0: (8, 10, 16)
- Node 1: No 3-star exists
- Node 2: (11, 5, 19)
- Node 3: (11, 19, 12) and (11, 18, 14)
- Node 4: (10, 16, 14)
- Node 5: (13, 2, 15)
- Node 6: (9, 14, 11)
- Node 7: No 3-star exists
- Node 8: (13, 10, 16)
- Node 9: (6, 10, 16)
- Node 10: (9, 8, 0)
- Node 11: (6, 3, 17)
- Node 12: (13, 16, 1)
- Node 13: (8, 5, 12)
- Node 14: (18, 6, 4)
- Node 15: No 3-star exists
- Node 16: (12, 4, 9)
- Node 17: No 3-star exists
- Node 18: (13, 3, 14)
- Node 19: No 3-star exists

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have:
<0, (8, 10, 16)>, <2, (11, 5, 19)>, <3, (11, 18, 14)>, <4, (10, 16, 14)>, <5, (13, 2, 15)>, <6, (9, 14, 11)>, <8, (13, 10, 16)>, <9, (6, 10, 16)>, <10, (9, 8, 0)>, <11, (6, 3, 17)>, <12, (13, 16, 1)>, <13, (8, 5, 12)>, <14, (18, 6, 4)>, <16, (12, 4, 9)>, <18, (13, 3, 14)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
