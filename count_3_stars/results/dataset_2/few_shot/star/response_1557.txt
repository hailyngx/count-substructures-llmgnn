Response:
The given graph has a total of 20 nodes and 60 edges. To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we find the following 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (6, 18, 19)>
<6, (0, 5, 19)>
<7, (0, 1, 18)>
<10, (8, 14, 17)>
<12, (15, 16, 16)>
<14, (10, 16, 19)>
<15, (10, 11, 12)>
<16, (0, 14, 19)>
<17, (2, 8, 10)>
<19, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
