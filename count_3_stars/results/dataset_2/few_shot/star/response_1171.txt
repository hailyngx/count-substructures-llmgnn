Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we see that the central nodes and their connected nodes are as follows:
- <0, (5, 9, 7)>
- <1, (5, 3, 6)>
- <2, (9, 3, 8)>
- <3, (9, 1, 2)>
- <4, (5, 9, 7)>
- <5, (8, 1, 4)>
- <6, (4, 1, 2)>
- <7, (5, 4, 0)>
- <8, (5, 1, 2)>
- <9, (4, 2, 3)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
