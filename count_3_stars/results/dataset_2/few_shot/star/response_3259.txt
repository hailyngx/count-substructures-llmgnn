Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each central node and its three adjacent nodes. 

Let's go through each node and its connections to identify the 3-stars:

1. Central Node: 0, Adjacent Nodes: 28, 8, 11
   <0, (28, 8, 11)>
   
2. Central Node: 1, Adjacent Nodes: 28, 24, 10
   <1, (28, 24, 10)>

3. Central Node: 2, Adjacent Nodes: 5, 3, 24
   <2, (5, 3, 24)>

4. Central Node: 3, Adjacent Nodes: 25
   (Not a 3-star)

5. Central Node: 4, Adjacent Nodes: 27, 26
   (Not a 3-star)

6. Central Node: 5, Adjacent Nodes: 9, 2, 8
   <5, (9, 2, 8)>
   
7. Central Node: 6, Adjacent Nodes: 24
   (Not a 3-star)

8. Central Node: 7, Adjacent Nodes: 9, 11, 2
   <7, (9, 11, 2)>
   
9. Central Node: 8, Adjacent Nodes: 5, 28, 0
   <8, (5, 28, 0)>

10. Central Node: 9, Adjacent Nodes: 5, 20, 7
    <9, (5, 20, 7)>
    
11. Central Node: 10, Adjacent Nodes: 26, 1, 23
    (Not a 3-star)

12. Central Node: 11, Adjacent Nodes: 13, 7, 0
    <11, (13, 7, 0)>

13. Central Node: 12, Adjacent Nodes: 27, 16
    (Not a 3-star)
    
14. Central Node: 13, Adjacent Nodes: 26, 11
    (Not a 3-star)

15. Central Node: 14, Adjacent Nodes: 27
    (Not a 3-star)

16. Central Node: 15, Adjacent Nodes: 18
    (Not a 3-star)
    
17. Central Node: 16, Adjacent Nodes: 25, 12, 28
    <16, (25, 12, 28)>
    
18. Central Node: 17, Adjacent Nodes: 26, 24, 23
    <17, (26, 24, 23)>
   
19. Central Node: 18, Adjacent Nodes: 15
    (Not a 3-star)

20. Central Node: 19, Adjacent Nodes: 13
    (Not a 3-star)

21. Central Node: 20, Adjacent Nodes: 9, 18
    (Not a 3-star)

22. Central Node: 21, Adjacent Nodes: 12, 11
    (Not a 3-star)

23. Central Node: 22, Adjacent Nodes: 6, 8, 20
    (Not a 3-star)

24. Central Node: 23, Adjacent Nodes: 19, 10, 21
    (Not a 3-star)

25. Central Node: 24, Adjacent Nodes: 14, 6, 17
    (Not a 3-star)

26. Central Node: 25, Adjacent Nodes: 3
    (Not a 3-star)

27. Central Node: 26, Adjacent Nodes: 17, 24, 4
    <26, (17, 24, 4)>

28. Central Node: 27, Adjacent Nodes: 12, 4, 14
    <27, (12, 4, 14)>
    
29. Central Node: 28, Adjacent Nodes: 16, 8, 0
    <28, (16, 8, 0)>

30. Central Node: 29, Adjacent Nodes: 5
    (Not a 3-star)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
