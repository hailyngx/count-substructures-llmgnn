Response:
The first step is to identify the center nodes. Center nodes are nodes with exactly three neighbors.

Center nodes: 
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 21, 20, and 0
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 14, 17, and 15

Next, we identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Counting the number of unique 3-stars:
- For center node 6, the 3-stars are: 
  - <6, (21, 20, 0)>
  - [1 unique 3-star]

- For center node 10, the 3-stars are: 
  - <10, (14, 17, 15)>
  - [1 unique 3-star]

Finally, we output the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph inside brackets:
[2]
