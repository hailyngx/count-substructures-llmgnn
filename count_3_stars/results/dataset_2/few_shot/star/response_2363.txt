Response:
Let's solve this step by step. 

Step 1: Find all 3-stars in the given graph. 

- From the adjacency list, we can see that the possible central nodes are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16.
- For each central node, we will find the connected nodes (leaves) and check if they form a 3-star.

<1, (5, 8, 18)>
<3, (11, 12, 17)>
<4, (2, 9, 16)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 14, 15)>
<12, (3, 6, 15)>
<14, (0, 7, 9)>
<15, (7, 9, 18)>
<16, (4, 5, 13)>

Step 2: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
