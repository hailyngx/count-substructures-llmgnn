Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
<0, (5, 6, 5)>
<1, (4, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (9, 1, 8)>
<4, (7, 6, 1)>
<5, (9, 2, 0)>
<6, (4, 7, 0)>
<7, (9, 6, 1)>
<8, (1, 3, 2)>
<9, (5, 2, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
