Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 6, and 14. <1, (15, 6, 14)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 19, 12, and 14. <2, (19, 12, 14)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 11, and 10. <4, (6, 11, 10)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 18. <6, (1, 8, 18)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 19, 10, and 17. <8, (19, 10, 17)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 19, and 18. <9, (15, 19, 18)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 19, 4, and 17. <11, (19, 4, 17)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [6]
