Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 12) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 10) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 11) (14, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, 12, 10, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 11, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 0, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 13, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 10, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 12, 0, 11, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 13, 10, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 10
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 13, 0, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 7, 12, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 3, 8, 7, 0, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 10
Node 14 is connected to node 10

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are:
- <0, (6, 3, 12)>
- <0, (6, 7, 12)>
- <0, (6, 10, 14)>
- <0, (3, 12, 7)>
- <0, (3, 12, 11)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 7, 11)>
- <4, (9, 13, 2)>
- <5, (9, 6, 8)>
- <5, (9, 6, 3)>
- <5, (9, 6, 0)>
- <5, (9, 6, 10)>
- <5, (9, 4, 13)>
- <5, (9, 4, 2)> 

Therefore, there are [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
