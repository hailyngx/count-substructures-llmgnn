Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify and list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<25, (3, 1, 15)>
<26, (29, 4, 8)>
<4, (26, 16, 28)>
<6, (3, 9, 17)>
<7, (25, 20, 17)>
<9, (6, 15, 1)>
<10, (1, 24, 27)>
<18, (28, 11, 0)>
<24, (23, 12, 21)>
<15, (25, 9, 16)>
<16, (4, 5, 15)>
<17, (6, 26, 7)>
<0, (18, 8, 24)>
<21, (17, 24, 23)>
<5, (16, 14, 2)>
<14, (2, 5, 20)>
<20, (7, 14, 27)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 16.]
