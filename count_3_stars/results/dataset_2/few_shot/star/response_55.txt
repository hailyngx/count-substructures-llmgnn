Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 14) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 12) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 13, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 10, 11, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 11, 0, 13, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 10, and node 12
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 13, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 14, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 10, 11, 8, and node 12
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 13, 14, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 14, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 7, 4, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 3, 14, 7, 13, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 13, 7, 4, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 1, 3, 11, 8, 5, and node 12
Node 14 is connected to node 6, 9, 11, 8, and node 12

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (9, 3, 5)>
<1, (3, 13, 5)>
<2, (3, 10, 11)>
<3, (1, 11, 13)>
<4, (6, 10, 12)>
<5, (1, 13, 2)>
<6, (9, 14, 4)>
<7, (10, 11, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
