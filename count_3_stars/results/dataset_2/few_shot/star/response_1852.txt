Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From the adjacency list, we can determine the degree of each node:
    - Node 0 has degree 3
    - Node 1 has degree 3
    - Node 2 has degree 1
    - Node 3 has degree 1
    - Node 4 has degree 2
    - Node 5 has degree 3
    - Node 6 has degree 2
    - Node 7 has degree 1
    - Node 8 has degree 5
    - Node 9 has degree 4
    - Node 10 has degree 3
    - Node 11 has degree 5
    - Node 12 has degree 3
    - Node 13 has degree 5
    - Node 14 has degree 2
    - Node 15 has degree 3
    - Node 16 has degree 2
    - Node 17 has degree 4
    - Node 18 has degree 3
    - Node 19 has degree 3
    - Node 20 has degree 4
    - Node 21 has degree 2
    - Node 22 has degree 3
    - Node 23 has degree 5
    - Node 24 has degree 3
    - Node 25 has degree 5
    - Node 26 has degree 1
    - Node 27 has degree 2
    - Node 28 has degree 2
    - Node 29 has degree 5

- Based on the degrees, we can see that nodes with degree 3 or higher can potentially be the center of a 3-star. Nodes 8, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, and 29 satisfy this condition.

- Let's list the 3-stars:
    - <8, (1, 16, 25)>
    - <9, (1, 17, 29)>
    - <11, (1, 16, 18)>
    - <13, (4, 14, 20)>
    - <17, (0, 5, 19)>
    - <19, (4, 17, 20)>
    - <20, (11, 13, 25)>
    - <22, (8, 25, 29)>
    - <23, (3, 13, 14)>
    - <25, (8, 12, 22)>
    - <29, (9, 10, 18)>

- Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
