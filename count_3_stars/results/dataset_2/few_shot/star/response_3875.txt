Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's go through the adjacency list for each node:

1. Nodes with 3 connections:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 25, 21, and 22.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 10 and 2.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 17 and 14.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 25, 1, and 28.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 7 and 15.

2. Based on the adjacency list, we can identify the three-stars in the graph:
<8, (25, 21, 22)>
<9, (10, 26, 2)>
<11, (17, 12, 14)>
<20, (25, 1, 28)>
<27, (7, 15, 25)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
