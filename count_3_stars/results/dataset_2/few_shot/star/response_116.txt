Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, 5, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 7, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<0, (6, 3, 2)>
<1, (6, 3, 2)>
<2, (9, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 0, 5)>
<4, (9, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 2)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<7, (6, 9, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
