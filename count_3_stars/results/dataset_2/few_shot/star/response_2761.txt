Response:
We will determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's list down the 3-stars in this graph:

<11, (16, 7, 5)>
<16, (11, 7, 12)>
<4, (8, 18, 1)>
<8, (4, 17, 7)>
<5, (11, 0, 15)>
<6, (1, 19, 13)>
<7, (11, 16, 8)>
<9, (2, 14, 13)>
<10, (1, 5, 19)>
<17, (11, 8, 18)>
<18, (4, 2, 17)>
<19, (3, 1, 6)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
