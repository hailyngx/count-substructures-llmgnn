Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, 8, and node 2

Response:
First, we can identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 9, 3
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 4, 6, 5
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 4, 2, 5
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 9, 2
- Node 8 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 9, 5

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is 5.
