Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5)

Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can check each node and its neighbors to see if they form a 3-star. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: No 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes only.
- Node 1: 3-star with center node 1 and leaves 9, 2, 4. <1, (9, 2, 4)>
- Node 2: No 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 3: No 3-star as it is connected to 2 nodes only.
- Node 4: No 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 5: No 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 6: No 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes only.
- Node 7: 3-star with center node 7 and leaves 6, 9, 8. <7, (6, 9, 8)>
- Node 8: No 3-star as it is connected to 6 nodes.
- Node 9: No 3-star as it is connected to 5 nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [2]
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (9, 2, 4)>, <7, (6, 9, 8)>
