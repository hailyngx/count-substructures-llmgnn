Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each instance where a central node is connected exactly to three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<5, (11, 16, 8)>
<14, (8, 19, 10)>
<19, (14, 17, 10)>

Counting these unique 3-star patterns, we get a total of [3] 3-stars in the graph.
