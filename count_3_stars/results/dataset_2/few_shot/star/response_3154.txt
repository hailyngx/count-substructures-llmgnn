Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 7, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Based on the given graph, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 6 <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 8 <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 0, and 9 <2, (4, 0, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 9 <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6 <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 1, and 4 <5, (6, 1, 4)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, and 0 <6, (5, 4, 0)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 0, and 1 <7, (4, 0, 1)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 9 <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 2, and 4 <9, (8, 2, 4)>

Count of 3-stars = 9

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
