Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the unique 3-stars where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph by observing nodes with exactly three connections. Let's list the unique 3-stars below:
<11, (16, 6, 7)>
<5, (19, 17, 0)>
<2, (11, 13, 7)>
<3, (1, 0, 6)>
<4, (0, 15, 14)>
<6, (11, 18, 1)>
<9, (8, 15, 13)>
<10, (19, 18, 5)>
<12, (16, 17, 1)>
<7, (11, 2, 7)>
<8, (9, 19, 13)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars by counting the unique instances listed above.
