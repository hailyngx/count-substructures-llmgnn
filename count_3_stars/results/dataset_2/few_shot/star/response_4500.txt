Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

Central nodes:
- Node 8 has neighbors 13, 4, and 11.
- Node 13 has neighbors 8, 16, and 1.
- Node 10 has neighbors 13, 11, and 17.
- Node 14 has neighbors 4, 0, and 3.

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- <8, (13, 4, 11)>
- <13, (8, 16, 1)>
- <10, (13, 11, 17)>
- <14, (4, 0, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
