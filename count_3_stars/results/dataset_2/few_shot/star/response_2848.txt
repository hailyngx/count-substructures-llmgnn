Response:
The central node of the 3-star can be any of the 20 nodes in the graph.

Let's iterate through each node and count the number of 3-stars it is a part of:

1. For node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to 3 neighbors: 14, 10, and 17.
   - There is 1 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (14, 10, 17)>.

2. For node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to 3 neighbors: 15, 14, and 17.
   - There are 2 3-stars with node 1 as the center: <1, (15, 14, 17)> and <1, (15, 10, 3)>.

3. For node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to 3 neighbors: 8, 12, and 6.
   - There is 1 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (8, 12, 6)>.

4. For node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to 5 neighbors: 15, 10, 6, 9, and 8.
   - There is 1 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (15, 10, 6)>.

5. For node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to 3 neighbors: 11, 5, and 6.
   - There is 1 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (11, 5, 6)>.

6. For node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to 3 neighbors: 9, 18, and 4.
   - There is 1 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (9, 18, 4)>.

7. For node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to 5 neighbors: 11, 3, 2, 17, and 4.
   - There is 1 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (11, 3, 17)>.

8. For node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to 1 neighbor: 8.
   - There are no 3-stars with node 7 as the center.

9. For node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to 3 neighbors: 3, 2, and 7.
   - There is 1 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (3, 2, 7)>.

10. For node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to 4 neighbors: 16, 3, 5, and 10.
   - There are 2 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (16, 3, 10)> and <9, (3, 5, 10)>.

11. For node 10:
   - Node 10 is connected to 4 neighbors: 3, 15, 9, and 0.
   - There is 1 3-star with node 10 as the center: <10, (3, 15, 0)>.

12. For node 11:
   - Node 11 is connected to 5 neighbors: 16, 18, 13, 6, and 4.
   - There is 1 3-star with node 11 as the center: <11, (16, 18, 13)>.

13. For node 12:
   - Node 12 is connected to 1 neighbor: 2.
   - There are no 3-stars with node 12 as the center.

14. For node 13:
   - Node 13 is connected to 2 neighbors: 11 and 14.
   - There are no 3-stars with node 13 as the center.

15. For node 14:
   - Node 14 is connected to 3 neighbors: 0, 1, and 13.
   - There is 1 3-star with node 14 as the center: <14, (0, 1, 13)>.

16. For node 15:
   - Node 15 is connected to 3 neighbors: 3, 1, and 10.
   - There is 1 3-star with node 15 as the center: <15, (3, 1, 10)>.

17. For node 16:
   - Node 16 is connected to 3 neighbors: 11, 17, and 9.
   - There is 1 3-star with node 16 as the center: <16, (11, 17, 9)>.

18. For node 17:
   - Node 17 is connected to 4 neighbors: 16, 0, 1, and 6.
   - There is 1 3-star with node 17 as the center: <17, (16, 0, 1)>.

19. For node 18:
   - Node 18 is connected to 2 neighbors: 11 and 5.
   - There are no 3-stars with node 18 as the center.

20. Node 19 is not connected to any other nodes, so it cannot be part of any 3-stars.

Hence, the 3-stars in the graph are:
- <0, (14, 10, 17)>
- <1, (15, 14, 17)>
- <1, (15, 10, 3)>
- <2, (8, 12, 6)>
- <3, (15, 10, 6)>
- <4, (11, 5, 6)>
- <5, (9, 18, 4)>
- <6, (11, 3, 17)>
- <8, (3, 2, 7)>
- <9, (16, 3, 10)>
- <9, (3, 5, 10)>
- <10, (3, 15, 0)>
- <11, (16, 18, 13)>
- <14, (0, 1, 13)>
- <15, (3, 1, 10)>
- <16, (11, 17, 9)>
- <17, (16, 0, 1)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].
