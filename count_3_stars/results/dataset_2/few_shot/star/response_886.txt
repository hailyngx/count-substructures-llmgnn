Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the graph and find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 8, 3, 19)
2. Node 1: (1, 17, 15, 9), (1, 17, 18, 3)
3. Node 2: (2, 10, 14, 17)
4. Node 3: (3, 4, 8, 18)
5. Node 4: (4, 8, 14, 16)
6. Node 6: (6, 11, 12, 17), (6, 11, 13, 7)
7. Node 7: (7, 13, 15, 16)
8. Node 8: (8, 0, 4, 12), (8, 0, 19, 3)
9. Node 9: (9, 1, 2, 19)
10. Node 10: (10, 2, 14, 17)
11. Node 11: (11, 6, 12, 17)
12. Node 13: (13, 5, 6, 7), (13, 7, 15, 18)
13. Node 14: (14, 4, 10, 16)
14. Node 15: (15, 1, 13, 19)
15. Node 16: (16, 4, 7, 14), (16, 7, 3, 18)
16. Node 17: (17, 1, 2, 11)
17. Node 18: (18, 13, 1, 3)
18. Node 19: (19, 8, 0, 15), (19, 9, 15, 0)

There are a total of <18> unique 3-star configurations found, and the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
