Response:
Let's look for 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

From the adjacency list of each node, we can see the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 14, 1)>
<1, (9, 0, 19)>
<2, (9, 3, 11)>
<3, (6, 13, 0)>
<4, (17, 8, 0)>
<5, (12, 17, 0)>
<6, (3, 10, 0)>
<7, (12, 19, 13)>
<8, (4, 18, 14)>
<9, (2, 1, 19)>
<10, (17, 6, 0)>
<11, (17, 14, 2)>
<12, (5, 7, 16)>
<13, (3, 7, 0)>
<14, (15, 8, 11)>
<15, (14, 16, 0)>
<16, (15, 12, 0)>
<17, (5, 10, 11)>
<18, (8)>
<19, (7, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 20. 
So, the final answer is [20].
