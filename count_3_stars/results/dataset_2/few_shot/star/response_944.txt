Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the steps to find and count the 3-stars:

1. Look at each node in the graph and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. If a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, then it forms a 3-star with the node itself as the center and the three connected nodes as the leaves.
3. Count the distinct 3-stars formed in the graph.

Here are the distinct 3-stars found in the given graph:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (9, 0, 6)>
<7, (9, 0, 3)>
<1, (6, 2, 8)>
<3, (7, 0, 8)>
<2, (5, 9, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
