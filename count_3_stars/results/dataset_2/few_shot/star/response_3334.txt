Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars:
<3, (1, 7, 18)>
<15, (2, 17, 3)>
<1, (3, 7, 5)>
<10, (13, 16, 18)>
<0, (14, 12, 2)>
<14, (0, 12, 11)>
<2, (15, 8, 0)>
<8, (2, 19, 5)>
<19, (8, 9, 18)>
<4, (13)>
<6, (2, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 12)>
<13, (10, 18, 4)>
<16, (10, 5, 18)>
<17, (15, 12, 7)>
<7, (3, 1, 17)>
<11, (14)>
<9, (19, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
