Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 2) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 10) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 10) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 8) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 2)

Node 3 is connected to node 7, 11, 13, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 11, 13, and node 10
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 13, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 11
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 11, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 14, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 12, 4, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 10, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, and node 4

Response:
Let's start finding the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For Node 0: (0, 5, 14, 8), (0, 5, 13, 1)
2. For Node 1: (1, 9, 7, 8), (1, 7, 11, 8)
3. For Node 2: (2, 0, 6, 11), (2, 6, 11, 3)
4. For Node 3: (3, 7, 11, 13), (3, 11, 7, 2)
5. For Node 4: (4, 11, 13, 10)
6. For Node 5: (5, 9, 6, 0), (5, 6, 7, 0)
7. For Node 6: (6, 5, 7, 11)
8. For Node 7: (7, 3, 11, 1)
9. For Node 8: (8, 9, 0, 1)
10. For Node 9: (9, 5, 8, 1)
11. For Node 10: (10, 12, 4, 2)
12. For Node 11: (11, 7, 6, 1)
13. For Node 12: (12, 10, 14)
14. For Node 13: (13, 5, 0, 3), (13, 3, 11, 4)
15. For Node 14: (14, 9, 12, 0)

Count of 3-stars = 15

Therefore, the answer is [15]. 
Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 14, 8)>, <0, (5, 13, 1)>, <1, (9, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 11, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 11)>, <2, (6, 11, 3)>, <3, (7, 11, 13)>, <3, (11, 7, 2)>, <4, (11, 13, 10)>, <5, (9, 6, 0)>, <5, (6, 7, 0)>, <6, (5, 7, 11)>, <7, (3, 11, 1)>, <8, (9, 0, 1)>, <9, (5, 8, 1)>, <10, (12, 4, 2)>, <11, (7, 6, 1)>, <12, (10, 14)>, <13, (5, 0, 3)>, <13, (3, 11, 4)>, <14, (9, 12, 0)>.
