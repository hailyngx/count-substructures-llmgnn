Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars based on the definition provided:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>
<9, (6, 4, 3)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
