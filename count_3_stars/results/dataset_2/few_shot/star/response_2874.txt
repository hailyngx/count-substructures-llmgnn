Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

### Node-based Approach:
1. For each node in the graph, check if it forms a 3-star with exactly 3 neighbors.
2. If a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes with no common neighbors between those 3 nodes, then it forms a 3-star.
3. Count the total number of such 3-stars formed in the graph.

### List of 3-stars: 
<9, (2, 7, 27)>  
<26, (25, 8, 12)>  
<15, (18, 29, 27)>  
<7, (10, 23, 18)>  
<1, (2, 3, 13)>  
<3, (11, 14, 24)>  
<10, (19, 28, 7)>  
<17, (23, 22, 6)>  
<20, (22, 29, 24)>  
<4, (23, 7, 16)>  
<21, (25, 29, 0)>  
<16, (14, 22, 4)>
