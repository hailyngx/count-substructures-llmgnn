Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

There are 3-star graphs with the following central nodes:
1. Central node 0: (4, 7, 11)
2. Central node 1: (7, 2, 14), (1, 5, 9)
3. Central node 2: (4, 1, 6), (9, 2, 5), (12, 2, 10)
4. Central node 3: (14, 3, 13)
5. Central node 4: (7, 12, 0), (4, 6, 2)
6. Central node 5: (1, 8, 13), (2, 5, 9)
7. Central node 6: (8, 6, 11)
8. Central node 7: (4, 0, 11), (7, 1, 5)
9. Central node 8: (9, 5, 13), (6, 8, 11)
10. Central node 9: (9, 1, 2), (5, 8, 13)
11. Central node 10: (12, 14, 10)
12. Central node 11: (7, 6, 8), (0, 11, 12)
13. Central node 12: (4, 11, 0), (12, 2, 10)
14. Central node 13: (3, 14, 5)
15. Central node 14: (4, 1, 3), (10, 12, 14)

Counting these unique 3-star graphs, we find a total of [15] 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
