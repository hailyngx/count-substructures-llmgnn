Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 7, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, 7, 9, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 9, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 0, 3, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's list the possible 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (8, 7, 3)>
2. <1, (5, 2, 7)>
3. <2, (5, 1, 7)>
4. <3, (5, 6, 0)>
5. <4, (0, 9, 3)>
6. <5, (6, 2, 8)>
7. <6, (5, 3, 8)>
8. <7, (2, 0, 3)>
9. <8, (5, 6, 0)>
10. <9, (7, 4, 3)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer is [10].
