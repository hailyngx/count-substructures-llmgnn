Response:
Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

There are no 3-stars centered at Node 10 since it is not connected to any other nodes.
For each node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will check if they form a 3-star.

Now, let's consider the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
1. Node 11 is connected to 4, 5, and 17.
2. Node 2 is connected to 3, 4, and 11.
3. Node 6 is connected to 1, 3, and 17.
4. Node 12 is connected to 3 and 17.
5. Node 19 is connected to 3, 13, and 16.
6. Node 13 is connected to 6, 9, and 19.

Identifying the unique 3-star patterns:
<11, (4, 5, 17)>
<2, (3, 4, 11)>
<6, (1, 3, 17)>
<12, (3, 17)>
<19, (3, 13, 16)>
<13, (6, 9, 19)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6] and the unique 3-stars are <11, (4, 5, 17)>, <2, (3, 4, 11)>, <6, (1, 3, 17)>, <12, (3, 17)>, <19, (3, 13, 16)>, <13, (6, 9, 19)>.
