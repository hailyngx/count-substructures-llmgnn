Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 10) (2, 0) (2, 10) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 17) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 17) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 7) (19, 4) (19, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 17) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 14) (6, 18) (16, 17) (4, 1) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 19) (9, 10) (9, 4) (7, 13) (7, 18) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 9, 8)>
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 19, 11)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (13, 12, 17)>
4. Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (5, 7, 15)>
5. Node 17 forms a 3-star: <17, (1, 16, 15)>
6. Node 18 forms a 3-star: <18, (11, 6, 7)>
7. Node 19 forms a 3-star: <19, (4, 9, -)>

Since there are 7 unique 3-stars in the graph, the total count is [7].
