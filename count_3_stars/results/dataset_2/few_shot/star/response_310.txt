Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

From the adjacency list:
1. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, and 13.
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 16.
3. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 0, and 12.
4. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 11, and 1.
5. Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 17, and 12.
6. Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 6, and 19.

Now, let's count the 3-stars: [6]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<8, (9, 7, 13)>
<9, (5, 8, 16)>
<11, (10, 0, 12)>
<12, (10, 11, 1)>
<15, (8, 17, 12)>
<17, (11, 6, 19)> [6]
