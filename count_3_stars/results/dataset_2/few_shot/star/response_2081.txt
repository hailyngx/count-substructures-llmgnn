Response:
Let's determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For each node, check its connections with other nodes to find potential 3-stars. 
2. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.
3. Count the number of unique 3-stars found in the graph.

After analyzing the connections, we can list the unique 3-stars:

<2, (1, 7, 14)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 9, 11)>
<5, (3, 11, 12)>
<7, (0, 5, 14)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (4, 8, 13)>
<10, (0, 14, 7)>
<11, (4, 5, 6)>
<12, (2, 5, 8)>
<13, (4, 9, 14)>
<14, (7, 10, 13)>

Total number of 3-stars: 12.  
Therefore, the final answer is [12].
