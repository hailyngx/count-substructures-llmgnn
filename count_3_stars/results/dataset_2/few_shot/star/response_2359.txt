Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph. 

Firstly, we can identify all the nodes that have 3 edges connected to them:
- Node 6: (16, 9, 10)
- Node 8: (16, 9, 2)
- Node 9: (6, 8, 15)
- Node 10: (6, 18, 1)
- Node 13: (5, 15, 14)
- Node 14: (9, 18, 13)
- Node 15: (6, 9, 13)
- Node 16: (17, 8, 6)
- Node 17: (11, 16, 5)
- Node 18: (14, 10, 1)

Now, we can construct each unique 3-star with the central node and its leaves:
- <6, (16, 9, 10)>
- <8, (16, 9, 2)>
- <9, (6, 8, 15)>
- <10, (6, 18, 1)>
- <13, (5, 15, 14)>
- <14, (9, 18, 13)>
- <15, (6, 9, 13)>
- <16, (17, 8, 6)>
- <17, (11, 16, 5)>
- <18, (14, 10, 1)>

Now counting the total number of 3-stars, we find that there are 10 unique 3-stars in total. So, the answer is [10].
