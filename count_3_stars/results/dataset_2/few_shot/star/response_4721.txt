Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 10 forms a 3-star with leaves 17, 21, and 26.
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with leaves 8, 28, and 5.
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with leaves 10, 18, and 4.
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with leaves 11, 12, and 16.
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with leaves 10, 18, and 5.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 29, and not found in this graph.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 17, and not found in this graph.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 26, and not found in this graph.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 13, 17, and 14.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 9, 29, and 15.
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with leaves 21, 24, and 7.
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with leaves 9, 24, and 7.
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 18, 27.
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with leaves 17, 28, and 14.
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with leaves 20, 29, and not found in this graph.

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
