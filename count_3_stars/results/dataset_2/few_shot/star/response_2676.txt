Response:
Starting with each node, we will look for 3-stars in the graph.

1. For node 0: No 3-stars with node 0 as the center.

2. For node 1: 
    - <1, (6, 4, 15)>
    - <1, (15, 3, 14)>
    - <1, (14, 10, 8)>

3. For node 2: 
    - <2, (11, 0, 7)>
    - <2, (7, 16, 8)>
    - <2, (17, 12, 18)>

4. For node 3: No 3-stars with node 3 as the center.

5. For node 4: No 3-stars with node 4 as the center.

6. For node 5: No 3-stars with node 5 as the center.

7. For node 6: No 3-stars with node 6 as the center.

8. For node 7: No 3-stars with node 7 as the center.

9. For node 8: No 3-stars with node 8 as the center.

10. For node 9: No 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

11. For node 10: 
    - <10, (15, 13, 14)>
    - <10, (13, 15, 19)>
    - <10, (14, 10, 8)>

12. For node 11: No 3-stars with node 11 as the center.

13. For node 12: No 3-stars with node 12 as the center.
