Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all the potential 3-stars based on the definition provided. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

The nodes and their connections can be summarized as follows:
- Node 0: (4, 7, 6)
- Node 1: (15, 22, 12)
- Node 2: (12, 19, 5, 26)
- Node 3: (14, 24, 23, 29)
- Node 4: (13, 0, 28)
- Node 5: (17, 2)
- Node 6: (28, 26, 0)
- Node 7: (0, 22)
- Node 8: (11, 9, 19, 21, 18)
- Node 9: (8, 17, 10)
- Node 10: (9, 15, 24, 23)
- Node 11: (8, 17)
- Node 12: (16, 1, 27, 2)
- Node 13: (4, 14, 25)
- Node 14: (3, 15, 20, 13)
- Node 15: (1, 29, 10, 23, 14)
- Node 16: (12, 25)
- Node 17: (11, 9, 29, 5)
- Node 18: (8)
- Node 19: (8, 2)
- Node 20: (14, 21)
- Node 21: (8, 20)
- Node 22: (7, 1, 29)
- Node 23: (3, 27, 15, 10)
- Node 24: (3, 10)
- Node 25: (16, 28, 13)
- Node 26: (6, 2)
- Node 27: (12, 23)
- Node 28: (4, 6, 25)
- Node 29: (3, 17, 15, 22)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars based on this information:

<0, (4, 7, 6)>
<1, (15, 22, 12)>
<3, (14, 24, 23)>
<4, (13, 0, 28)>
<9, (8, 17, 10)>
<15, (1, 29, 23)>
<17, (11, 9, 29)>
<21, (8, 20, 1)>
<25, (16, 28, 13)>
<26, (6, 2, 12)>
<27, (12, 23, 3)>
<29, (3, 17, 15)>

There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
