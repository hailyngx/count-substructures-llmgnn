Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9, and 11 <0, (7, 9, 11)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 6, and 8 <1, (7, 6, 8)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 1, and 8 <2, (10, 1, 8)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 13, and 8 <3, (10, 13, 8)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 6 <4, (7, 8, 6)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 10, and 8 <5, (7, 10, 8)>
7. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 9, and 1 <6, (4, 9, 1)>
8. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 0, and 14 <7, (4, 0, 14)>
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 9, and 1 <8, (4, 9, 1)>
10. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 0 <9, (6, 8, 0)>
11. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 13, and 8 <10, (3, 13, 8)>
12. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 0, and 13 <11, (14, 0, 13)>
13. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 6 and 11 <12, (6, 11)>
14. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 11, and 1 <13, (10, 11, 1)>
15. Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 6, and 5 <14, (7, 6, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
