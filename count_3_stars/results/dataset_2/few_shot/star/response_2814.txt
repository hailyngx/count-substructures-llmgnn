Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the given adjacency list, we can see that the center node can be any of the nodes from 0 to 9. We will inspect each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

1. For Node 0:
   - Node 0 has neighbors: 6, 8, 7, 1.
   - Possible 3-stars with node 0 as the center:
     - <0, (6, 8, 7)>
     - <0, (6, 1, 8)>
   [Total: 2]

2. For Node 1:
   - Node 1 has neighbors: 5, 6, 4, 8, 0.
   - Possible 3-stars with node 1 as the center:
     - <1, (5, 6, 4)>
     - <1, (5, 0, 8)>
   [Total: 2]

3. For Node 2:
   - Node 2 has neighbors: 5, 6, 4, 8, 7.
   - Possible 3-stars with node 2 as the center:
     - <2, (5, 6, 4)>
     - <2, (5, 7, 8)>
   [Total: 2]

4. For Node 3:
   - Node 3 has neighbors: 5, 4.
   - There are no 3-stars with node 3 as the center.

5. For Node 4:
   - Node 4 has neighbors: 6, 8, 1, 3, 2.
   - Possible 3-stars with node 4 as the center:
     - <4, (6, 8, 2)>
     - <4, (1, 3, 2)>
   [Total: 2]

6. For Node 5:
   - Node 5 has neighbors: 9, 2, 1, 3.
   - Possible 3-stars with node 5 as the center:
     - <5, (9, 2, 1)>
   [Total: 1]

7. For Node 6:
   - Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 0.
   - Possible 3-stars with node 6 as the center:
     - <6, (1, 2, 4)>
   [Total: 1]

8. For Node 7:
   - Node 7 has neighbors: 9, 2, 0.
   - Possible 3-stars with node 7 as the center:
     - <7, (9, 2, 0)>
   [Total: 1]

9. For Node 8:
   - Node 8 has neighbors: 9, 4, 2, 0, 1.
   - Possible 3-stars with node 8 as the center:
     - <8, (9, 4, 2)>
   [Total: 1]

10. For Node 9:
    - Node 9 has neighbors: 5, 8, 7.
    - There are no 3-stars with node 9 as the center.
