Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (13, 5, 11)>
2. Node 1: <1, (8, 9, -)>
3. Node 2: <2, (14, 11, 4)>
4. Node 3: <3, (4, 14, -)>
5. Node 4: <4, (8, 2, 3)>
6. Node 5: <5, (17, 15, 0)>
7. Node 6: <6, (10, 12, -)>
8. Node 7: <7, (18, 16, 12)>
9. Node 8: <8, (4, 17, 1)>
10. Node 9: <9, (12, 1, 15)>
11. Node 10: <10, (6, 16, 14)>
12. Node 11: <11, (13, 2, 0)>
13. Node 12: <12, (6, 7, 16)>
14. Node 13: <13, (11, 19, 0)>
15. Node 14: <14, (2, 7, 15), (3, 10, -)>
16. Node 15: <15, (5, 9, 14)>
17. Node 16: <16, (7, 12, 10)>
18. Node 17: <17, (8, 5, 19)>
19. Node 18: <18, (19, 7, -)>
20. Node 19: <19, (13, 18, 17)>

Counting the 3-stars in the graph, we get a total of [20] unique 3-stars.
