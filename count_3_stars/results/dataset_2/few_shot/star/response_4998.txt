Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 2) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 2) (6, 14) (12, 5) (12, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 9, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 11, 7, 5, 14, 0, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 10, 13, 4, 6, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 11, 7, and node 14
Node 4 is connected to node 10, 8, 9, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 10, 8, 12, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 14
Node 7 is connected to node 13, 3, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 4, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 11, 8, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 3, 1, and node 9
Node 12 is connected to node 5, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 2, 14, and node 7
Node 14 is connected to node 13, 3, 2, 1, and node 6

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. Based on the given adjacency list, nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 can act as centers since they each have exactly three adjacent nodes.

Now, we will list the unique 3-stars in the graph <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>:
<1, (5, 7, 12)>
<2, (4, 6, 14)>
<3, (7, 11, 14)>
<4, (2, 8, 10)>
<5, (1, 8, 10)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 11)>
<10, (2, 4, 5)>
<11, (1, 3, 9)>
<13, (7, 8, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
