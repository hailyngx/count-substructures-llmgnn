Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 10, 18)>
<3, (1, 0, 6)>
<10, (11, 15, 0)>
<11, (10, 8, 0)>
<2, (18, 5, 19)>
<5, (1, 2, 17)>
<18, (2, 0, 19)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 11, 9)>
<9, (8, 17, 16)>
<6, (3, 8, 7)>
<7, (19, 9, 13)>
<12, (10, 16, 19)>
<13, (3, 7, 19)>
<15, (10, 14, 19)>
<14, (15, 19)>
<16, (12, 9, 4)>
<17, (9, 5, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
