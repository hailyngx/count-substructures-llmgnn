Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to 4 other nodes (5, 3, 8, 2)
   - Node 1 is connected to 6 other nodes (9, 4, 7, 3, 6, 8)
   - Node 2 is connected to 4 other nodes (5, 3, 6, 0)
   - Node 6 is connected to 5 other nodes (9, 4, 1, 2, 8)
   - Node 8 is connected to 5 other nodes (9, 7, 1, 6, 0)

2. Count the 3-stars:
   - For Node 0: There are no 3-stars centered at Node 0 since it is connected to 4 nodes.
   - For Node 1: There is 1 unique 3-star centered at Node 1: <1, (9, 7, 6)>
   - For Node 2: There is no 3-star centered at Node 2 since it is connected to 4 nodes.
   - For Node 6: There is 1 unique 3-star centered at Node 6: <6, (9, 4, 8)>
   - For Node 8: There is 1 unique 3-star centered at Node 8: <8, (9, 7, 6)>

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars: [3]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
