Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 6) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 12)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing all unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<4, (5, 10, 12)>
<7, (1, 9, 13)>
<3, (6, 9, 14)>
<1, (7, 10, 11)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 14)>

Now, we will count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. After listing all possibilities and eliminating duplicates, we find that there are a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
