Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all possible triangles in the graph. Since a 3-star is a specific type of triangle with one central node, we can count the number of 3-stars by finding all triangles with one node having degree 3 and the other two nodes being connected to that node.

Let's start by identifying all nodes with a degree of 3:
- Node 3 has a degree of 5
- Node 4 has a degree of 4
- Node 6 has a degree of 4
- Node 7 has a degree of 4
- Node 9 has a degree of 4
- Node 10 has a degree of 4
- Node 15 has a degree of 3

Now, we will find the triangles formed by each of these nodes:
1. For Node 3:
   - (3, 11, 0) is a triangle with Node 3 as the central node
   - (3, 15, 6) is a triangle with Node 3 as the central node
   - (3, 7, 14) is a triangle with Node 3 as the central node
   - (3, 0, 13) is a triangle with Node 3 as the central node

2. For Node 4:
   - (4, 16, 1) is a triangle with Node 4 as the central node
   - (4, 5, 17) is a triangle with Node 4 as the central node
   - (4, 10, 13) is a triangle with Node 4 as the central node

3. For Node 6:
   - (6, 15, 2) is a triangle with Node 6 as the central node
   - (6, 8, 19) is a triangle with Node 6 as the central node
   - (6, 7, 14) is a triangle with Node 6 as the central node

4. For Node 7:
   - (7, 3, 14) is a triangle with Node 7 as the central node
   - (7, 2, 15) is a triangle with Node 7 as the central node
   - (7, 6, 14) is a triangle with Node 7 as the central node

5. For Node 9:
   - (9, 3, 18) is a triangle with Node 9 as the central node
   - (9, 2, 18) is a triangle with Node 9 as the central node
   - (9, 10, 12) is a triangle with Node 9 as the central node

6. For Node 10:
   - (10, 4, 16) is a triangle with Node 10 as the central node
   - (10, 9, 12) is a triangle with Node 10 as the central node
   - (10, 4, 13) is a triangle with Node 10 as the central node

7. For Node 15:
   - (15, 3, 6) is a triangle with Node 15 as the central node
