Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star present in the graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (9, 4, 8)>
<1, (9, 3, 5)>
<2, (9, 3, 4)>
<3, (6, 1, 8)>
<4, (8, 0, 5)>
<5, (6, 1, 4)>
<6, (5, 7, 3)>
<7, (6, 9, 8)>
<8, (3, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 7, 1)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: [10].
