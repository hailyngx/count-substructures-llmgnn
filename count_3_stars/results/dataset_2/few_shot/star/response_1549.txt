Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 14, 11, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 1, and node 11
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 10, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 13, 14, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 11, 14, 3, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 7, 13, 0, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 13, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 8, 12, 2, and node 10

Response:
There are three steps in this problem:  
Step 1: Identify the 3-stars by examining each node and its connections.  
Step 2: Count the number of unique 3-stars found in Step 1.  
Step 3: Output the final count.

Step 1: Identify the 3-stars:
<0, (8, 10, 12)>
<1, (5, 6, 11)>
<2, (4, 13, 14)>
<3, (5, 9, 10)>
<4, (7, 8, 14)>
<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (9, 4, 13)>
<8, (4, 13, 14)>
<9, (5, 11, 14)>
<10, (7, 13, 0)>
<11, (9, 4, 6)>
<12, (13, 0, 2)>
<13, (7, 8, 12)>
<14, (5, 9, 4)>

Step 2: Count the number of unique 3-stars found in Step 1:  
[15]

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
