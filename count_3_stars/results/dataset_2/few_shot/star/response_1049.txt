Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them step by step.

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0: (7, 29, 6)
   - Node 1: Does not have 3 connections.
   - Node 2: (14, 15, 25)
   - Node 3: (17, 11, 21)
   - Node 4: (8, 13, 29)
   - Node 5: (28, 3, 25)
   - Node 6: (11, 0, 10)
   - Node 7: (26, 0, 19)
   - Node 8: (14, 4, 20)
   - Node 9: (28, 7, 12)
   - Node 10: (6, 22)
   - Node 11: (28, 3, 13)
   - Node 12: (18, 9)
   - Node 13: (14, 4, 11)
   - Node 14: (17, 8, 2)
   - Node 15: (4, 18, 2)
   - Node 16: Does not have 3 connections.
   - Node 17: (14, 3, 26)
   - Node 18: (8, 15, 12)
   - Node 19: (7, 29, 23)
   - Node 20: Does not have 3 connections.
   - Node 21: Does not have 3 connections.
   - Node 22: (10, 5)
   - Node 23: (19, 2)
   - Node 24: Does not have 3 connections.
   - Node 25: (27, 5, 2)
   - Node 26: (17, 24, 7)
   - Node 27: (8, 25)
   - Node 28: (11, 16, 9)
   - Node 29: (4, 0, 19)

2. From the nodes identified above, we can form the following 3-stars:
   - <0, (7, 29, 6)>
   - <2, (14, 15, 25)>
   - <3, (17, 11, 21)>
   - <4, (8, 13, 29)>
   - <5, (28, 3, 25)>
   - <6, (11, 0, 10)>
   - <7, (26, 0, 19)>
   - <8, (14, 4, 20)>
   - <9, (28, 7, 12)>
   - <10, (6, 22)>
   - <11, (28, 3, 13)>
   - <12, (18, 9)>
   - <13, (14, 4, 11)>
   - <14, (17, 8, 2)>
   - <15, (4, 18, 2)>
   - <17, (14, 3, 26)>
   - <18, (8, 15, 12)>
   - <19, (7, 29, 23)>
   - <22, (10, 5)>
   - <23, (19, 2)>
   - <25, (27, 5, 2)>
   - <26, (17, 24, 7)>
   - <27, (8, 25)>
   - <28, (11, 16, 9)>
   - <29, (4, 0, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].
