Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the definition provided.

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the adjacency list, for each node, we will check if it forms a 3-star with its connected nodes.

After examining all nodes, we will list the unique 3-stars found. Let's begin the process:

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 11)>
<3, (0, 10, 28)>
<4, (0, 6, 16)>
<10, (16, 19, 25)>
<11, (0, 2, 6)>
<12, (1, 5, 19)>
<13, (14, 20, 21)>
<14, (7, 13, 17)>
<16, (6, 10, 25)>
<17, (5, 14, 21)>
<19, (3, 10, 12)>
<20, (13, 26, 27)>
<21, (0, 2, 5)>
<24, (8, 26, 27)>
<28, (3, 10, 23)>
<29, (0, 18, 23)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [15]
