Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 11, and one more node (not determined yet).
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 2, and one more node.
3. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 14, and one more node.
4. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 12, and one more node.
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 14, and one more node.
6. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 19, 17, and one more node.
7. Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 13, and one more node.
8. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 19, 16, and one more node.
9. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 6, and one more node.
10. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 19, 15, and one more node.
11. Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 11, and one more node.
12. Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 18, and one more node.
13. Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 15, and one more node.
14. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 18, 0, and one more node.

Let's count the unique 3-stars found:
[14]

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 11, 7)>
<9, (5, 2, 13)>
<13, (9, 14, 17)>
<2, (9, 12, 0)>
<6, (10, 14, 3)>
<4, (19, 17, 3)>
<14, (9, 13, 6)>
<1, (19, 16, 14)>
<3, (10, 6, 4)>
<8, (19, 15, 12)>
<18, (15, 11, 7)>
<16, (9, 18, 1)>
<17, (13, 15, 4)>
<7, (18, 0, 8)>
