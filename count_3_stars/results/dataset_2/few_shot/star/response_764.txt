Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:  

<3, (15, 12, 8)>  
<15, (3, 1, 2)>  
<4, (7, 19, 13)>  
<7, (4, 0, 19)>  
<10, (17, 5, 16)>  
<2, (15, 18, 5)>  
<18, (2, 16, 16)>  
<5, (10, 2, 12)>  
<6, (14, 0, 0)>  
<1, (15, 17, 14)>  
<0, (7, 6, 9)>  
<9, (0, 0, 0)>  
<11, (5, 0, 12)>  
<14, (6, 1, 19)>  
<16, (15, 4, 17)>  
<17, (10, 1, 16)>  
<19, (4, 7, 14)>  
<12, (3, 5, 11)>  
<13, (4, 16, 16)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
