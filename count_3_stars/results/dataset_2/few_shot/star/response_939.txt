Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify the vertices connected to each node:
    - Node 0: 7, 16, 3, 2
    - Node 1: 2, 19
    - Node 2: 1, 0, 4
    - Node 3: 9, 0, 18
    - Node 4: 9, 2, 11
    - Node 5: 9, 15, 14
    - Node 6: 9, 15, 11, 19, 13
    - Node 7: 17, 0
    - Node 8: 17, 19
    - Node 9: 5, 6, 4, 3
    - Node 10: 12
    - Node 11: 6, 14, 13, 4
    - Node 12: 13, 10, 18
    - Node 13: 6, 12, 11
    - Node 14: 5, 11, 18
    - Node 15: 5, 6
    - Node 16: 0, 19
    - Node 17: 19, 8, 7
    - Node 18: 12, 14, 3
    - Node 19: 6, 1, 17, 8, 16

2. Count the number of 3-stars using the adjacency list for each node:
    - From the given list:
        <5, (9, 15, 14)>
        <6, (9, 15, 11)>
        <9, (5, 6, 4)>
        <14, (5, 11, 18)>
        <16, (0, 19, 18)>
    - Combining the unique stars: 
        <5, (9, 15, 14)>
        <6, (9, 15, 11)>
        <9, (5, 6, 4)>
        <16, (0, 19, 18)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
