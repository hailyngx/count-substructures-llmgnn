Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars in the graph.

From the adjacency list, we can find the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with (8, 3, 8) and (3, 8, 0)
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with (6, 2, 1) and (8, 2, 1)
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with (9, 1, 2) and (8, 1, 2)
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with (9, 2, 3) and (8, 1, 3)
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with (5, 9, 4) and (8, 3, 4)
- Node 5 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 6 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 7 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 8 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 9 does not form any 3-stars

Hence, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (8, 3, 8)>
<0, (3, 8, 0)>
<1, (6, 2, 1)>
<1, (8, 2, 1)>
<2, (9, 1, 2)>
<2, (8, 1, 2)>
<3, (9, 2, 3)>
<3, (8, 1, 3)>
<4, (5, 9, 4)>
<4, (8, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
