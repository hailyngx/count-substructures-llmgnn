Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2)

Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 1 has three neighbors (7, 6, 9).
   - Therefore, there is one 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (7, 6, 9)>

2. Node 2 has three neighbors (6, 9, 3).
   - Therefore, there is one 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (6, 9, 3)>

3. Node 3 has three neighbors (7, 1, 0).
   - Therefore, there is one 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (7, 1, 0)>

4. Node 5 has three neighbors (4, 6, 1).
   - Therefore, there is one 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (4, 6, 1)>

5. Node 6 has three neighbors (7, 5, 1).
   - Therefore, there is one 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (7, 5, 1)>

6. Node 7 has three neighbors (4, 3, 6).
   - Therefore, there is one 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (4, 3, 6)>

7. Node 0 has three neighbors (9, 3, 8).
   - Therefore, there is one 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (9, 3, 8)>

8. Node 4 has two neighbors (7, 5) which is less than three, so it cannot form a 3-star.

9. Node 8 has two neighbors (6, 1), which is less than three, so it cannot form a 3-star.

10. Node 9 has two neighbors (2, 1), which is less than three, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
