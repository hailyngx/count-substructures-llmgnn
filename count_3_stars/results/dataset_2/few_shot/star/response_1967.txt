Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star in the given graph. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Upon analyzing the adjacency list, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 17, 8, and 7)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 16 and 12)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 14 and 15)

Now, let's find the 3-stars involving these nodes:
- For Node 1:
    - <1, (17, 8, 7)>
- For Node 2:
    - <2, (16, 12, 3)> -> This is not a 3-star since Node 2 has 2 neighbors, not 3.
- For Node 6:
    - <6, (14, 15, 4)> -> This is not a 3-star since Node 4 is not connected to Node 6.

Therefore, there is only 1 unique 3-star in the given graph: <1, (17, 8, 7)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
