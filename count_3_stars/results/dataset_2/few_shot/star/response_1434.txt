Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node acts as a center of a 3-star by being connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes and their connections to find all the 3-stars:

- For Node 0, Node 8 and Node 5 are connected. However, Node 0 is not a center of a 3-star.
- For Node 1, Node 8, Node 13, and Node 2 are connected, creating <1, (8, 13, 2)>.
- For Node 2, Node 3, Node 12, and Node 1 are connected, creating <2, (3, 12, 1)>.
- For Node 3, Node 6, Node 11, and Node 7 are connected, creating <3, (6, 11, 7)>.
- For Node 4, Node 6 and Node 5 are connected. However, Node 0 is not a center of a 3-star.
- For Node 5, Node 6 and Node 4 are connected. However, Node 5 is not a center of a 3-star.
- For Node 6, Node 5, Node 3, and Node 8 are connected, creating <6, (5, 3, 8)>.
- For Node 7, Node 8, Node 3, and Node 2 are connected, creating <7, (8, 3, 2)>.
- For Node 8, Node 6, Node 13, and Node 11 are connected, creating <8, (6, 13, 11)>.
- Node 9 is not a center of a 3-star as it is connected only to Node 14.
- For Node 10, Node 13, Node 2, and Node 12 are connected, creating <10, (13, 2, 12)>.
- For Node 11, Node 8, Node 13, and Node 3 are connected, creating <11, (8, 13, 3)>.
- For Node 12, Node 11, Node 2, and Node 10 are connected, creating <12, (11, 2, 10)>.
- For Node 13, Node 8, Node 11, and Node 1 are connected, creating <13, (8, 11, 1)>.
- For Node 14, Node 9, Node 3, and Node 2 are connected, creating <14, (9, 3, 2)>.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<1, (8, 13, 2)>, <2, (3, 12, 1)>, <3, (6, 11, 7)>, <6, (5, 3, 8)>, <7, (8, 3, 2)>, <8, (6, 13, 11)>, <10, (13, 2, 12)>, <11, (8, 13, 3)>, <12, (11, 2, 10)>, <13, (8, 11, 1)>, <14, (9, 3, 2)>.

Count of 3-stars: [11].
