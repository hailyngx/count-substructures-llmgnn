Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Based on the given information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (6, 9, 3)>
<0, (6, 9, 4)>
<0, (6, 4, 5)>
<0, (9, 4, 3)>
<0, (9, 3, 7)>
<0, (3, 1, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 7)>
<5, (6, 0, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
