Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 4) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 4) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 1) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 10, 5, 6, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 7, 14, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 14, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 13, 5, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 13, 2, 14, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 10, 0, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 11, 7, 14, 3, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 0, 12, and node 7
Node 11 is connected to node 13, 10, 9, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 13, 10, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 12, 4, 11, and node 3
Node 14 is connected to node 2, 1, 9, and node 4

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. One way to do this is by checking which nodes have exactly three neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors

So, the central nodes are:
- Node 8
- Node 12

Next, let's find the 3-stars centered at Node 8 and Node 12:

For Node 8:
- (8, 13, 12, 11)
- (8, 13, 4, 1)
- (8, 1, 7, 10)

For Node 12:
- (12, 13, 11, 10)

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<8, (13, 12, 11)>
<8, (13, 4, 1)>
<8, (1, 7, 10)>
<12, (13, 11, 10)>
