Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <3, (21, 26, 5)>
2. <15, (20, 19, 4)>
3. <6, (9, 1, 29)>
4. <9, (6, 27, 29)>
5. <18, (23, 10, 17)>
6. <22, (16, 5, 1)>
7. <8, (14, 29, 25)>
8. <13, (2, 7, 14)>
9. <10, (18, 17, 28)>
10. <17, (10, 0, 23)>
11. <20, (15, 0, 11)>
12. <21, (3, 2, 26)>
