Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all possible 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph along with the nodes involved:
<6, (9, 8, 0)>
<9, (6, 4, 0)>
<1, (5, 8, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<10, (9, 11, 12)>
<11, (10, 14, 0)>
<4, (9, 11, 7)>
<7, (9, 1, 10)>
<2, (3, 11, 13)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<12, (10, 2, 5)>

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [11].
