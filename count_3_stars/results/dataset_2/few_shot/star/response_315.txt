Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 6 has degree 6 (connected to 9, 14, 7, 2, 11, 8)
- Node 9 has degree 4 (connected to 6, 14, 10, 12)
- Node 10 has degree 3 (connected to 9, 3, 13)
- Node 12 has degree 4 (connected to 9, 1, 3, 0)
- Node 13 has degree 4 (connected to 8, 2, 10, 14)

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
- By checking the above nodes, we can find the following 3-stars:
    - <6, 9, 14>
    - <6, 9, 7>
    - <6, 9, 11>
    - <6, 9, 8>
    - <6, 14, 7>
    - <6, 14, 11>
    - <6, 14, 8>
    - <9, 14, 10>
    - <9, 14, 12>
    - <9, 10, 13>
    - <10, 13, 8>
    - <13, 8, 11>

3. Count of 3-stars in the graph: [12]
  
Therefore, the final answer is [12].
Unique 3-stars: <6, 9, 14>, <6, 9, 7>, <6, 9, 11>, <6, 9, 8>, <6, 14, 7>, <6, 14, 11>, <6, 14, 8>, <9, 14, 10>, <9, 14, 12>, <9, 10, 13>, <10, 13, 8>, <13, 8, 11>
