Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes will be the potential centers of 3-star graphs.

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 5, 2, and 19)
- Node 17 (connected to nodes 19, 11, and 1)

2. For each potential center node, check if the neighbors form a 3-star structure.

For Node 1:
<1, (5, 2, 19)>
<1, (5, 3, 19)>
(Note: Only one unique 3-star is found for Node 1)

For Node 17:
<17, (19, 11, 1)>
(Note: Only one unique 3-star is found for Node 17)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
