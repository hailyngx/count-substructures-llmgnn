Response:
Let's identify the 3-star motifs in the given graph and count the total number of unique 3-stars. 

From the given information:
- Node 0 forms 2 3-stars: <0, (1, 6, 12)> and <0, (3, 5, 14)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 14)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (7, 9, 14)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (3, 7, 14)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 8 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 10 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 11 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star: <12, (0, 11, 14)>
- Node 13 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star: <14, (3, 5, 12)>

Count of unique 3-stars: 11
