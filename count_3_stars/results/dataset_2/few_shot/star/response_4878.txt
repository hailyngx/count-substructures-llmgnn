Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, let's look for all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, which forms a 3-star pattern. Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (8, 12, 18)>
<0, (10, 5, 18)>
<0, (10, 12, 0)>
<1, (15, 13, 19)>
<4, (12, 11, 4)>
<5, (7, 19, 10)>
<6, (9, 19, 10)>
<7, (17, 11, 2)>
<9, (6, 19, 12)>
<13, (12, 15, 13)>
<14, (17, 11, 16)>
<17, (14, 11, 7)>
<18, (14, 0, 16)>
<19, (1, 5, 11)>

Counting these unique 3-stars gives us a total of [14].
