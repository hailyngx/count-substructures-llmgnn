Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present.
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We can start by looking at each node and checking its connections to see if it forms a 3-star.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<4, (7, 12, 13)>
<7, (4, 0, 6)>
<6, (7, 9, 14)>
<9, (6, 2, 13)>
<2, (6, 8, 14)>
<8, (2, 0, 12)>
<5, (13, 1, 3)>
<13, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 10)>
<12, (4, 8, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
