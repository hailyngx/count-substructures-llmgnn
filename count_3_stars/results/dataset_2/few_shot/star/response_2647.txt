Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the possible 3-star combinations are:
- Node 6 is central with {9, 5, 3} as leaves.
- Node 9 is central with {6, 4, 2} as leaves.
- Node 1 is central with {3, 4, 8} as leaves.
- Node 3 is central with {6, 9, 1} as leaves.
- Node 4 is central with {9, 1, 3} as leaves.
- Node 8 is central with {6, 1, 7} as leaves.

Let's count the total number of such unique 3-stars.   
There are 6 unique 3-stars. 

[6]  
<6, (9, 5, 3)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (6, 9, 1)>
<4, (9, 1, 3)>
<8, (6, 1, 7)>
