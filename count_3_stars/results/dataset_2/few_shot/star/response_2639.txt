Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 11, 1, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 11, 10, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, 12, 2, and node 11
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 10, 14, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 14, and node 10
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 14, 10, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 8, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 12, 5, 13, 3, and node 2

Response:
Let's start by identifying the neighbors of each node.

Node 0: 4, 7
Node 1: 6, 7, 12, 2
Node 2: 5, 3, 11, 1, 10
Node 3: 4, 7, 11, 10, 2
Node 4: 9, 8, 0, 5, 3
Node 5: 4, 8, 12, 2, 11
Node 6: 1
Node 7: 0, 3, 10, 14, 1
Node 8: 4, 5, 14, 10
Node 9: 4, 14, 10, 12
Node 10: 9, 8, 7, 3, 2
Node 11: 12, 5, 13, 3, 2
Node 12: 9, 5, 11, 1
Node 13: 11, 14
Node 14: 9, 8, 7, 13

Now let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

There is only one unique 3-star in the given graph: <4, (9, 8, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
