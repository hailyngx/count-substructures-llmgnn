Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star configuration.

Below are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<5, (2, 8, 3)>
<9, (6, 8, 7)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 4)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [5]
