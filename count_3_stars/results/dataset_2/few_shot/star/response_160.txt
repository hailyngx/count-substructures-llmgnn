Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 9, 5, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 6, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node's connections and identify the 3-stars they are a part of. 

Analyzing the graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (7, 6, 5)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (7, 9, 3)>
<5, (7, 1, 8)>
<6, (3, 9, 5)>
<7, (4, 0, 9)>
<8, (7, 1, 3)>
<9, (4, 7, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
