Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Given graph:
- Total nodes: 10
- Total edges: 40

List of edges:
(6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4)

6: 9, 1, 4, 8
7: 9, 4, 5
8: 6, 9, 3
9: 6, 8, 2, 3, 1, 7

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph. 
Here, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
