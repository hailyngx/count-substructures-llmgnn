Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 5 forms a 3-star <5, (2, 0, 4)>.
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star <9, (20, 18, 19)>.
3. Node 10 forms a 3-star <10, (6, 12, 13)>.
4. Node 12 forms a 3-star <12, (17, 10, 14)>.
5. Node 16 forms a 3-star <16, (28, 9, 6)>.
6. Node 19 forms a 3-star <19, (2, 18, 26)>.
7. Node 23 forms a 3-star <23, (29, 26, 3)>.
8. Node 25 forms a 3-star <25, (22, 8, 7)>.
9. Node 27 forms a 3-star <27, (15, 3, 7)>.

Total number of 3-stars: 9
