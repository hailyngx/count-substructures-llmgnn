Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Since each 3-star has exactly one central node, we will look for nodes with 3 neighbors.

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 6
- Node 8
- Node 9
- Node 10
- Node 11
- Node 12
- Node 15
- Node 16
- Node 17
- Node 19

Next, we will check each central node's neighbors to see if they form 3-stars.

For example, for Node 0:
- (0, 16, 3, 18) forms a 3-star with Node 0 as the center.

Following this process for all central nodes, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (16, 3, 18)>
<1, (2, 8, 19)>
<6, (8, 4, 8)>
<8, (15, 6, 2)>
<9, (3, 18, 4)>
<10, (17, 12, 7)>
<11, (3, 12, 15)>
<12, (11, 15, 5)>
<15, (11, 8, 12)>
<16, (0, 14, 17)>
<17, (14, 10, 10)>
<19, (7, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
