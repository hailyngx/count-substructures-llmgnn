Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (the definition of a 3-star graph).

To make it easier to understand, let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph step by step:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 4, 1, 3
   <0, (4, 1, 3)>

2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 6, 4, 2
   <1, (6, 4, 2)>

3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 6, 9, 4
   <2, (6, 9, 4)>

4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 9, 4, 5
   <3, (9, 4, 5)>

5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 2, 0, 1
   <4, (2, 0, 1)>

6. Node 5: No 3-stars found.

7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 9, 5, 1
   <6, (9, 5, 1)>

8. Node 7: No 3-stars found.

9. Node 8: No 3-stars found.

10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 6, 2, 3
    <9, (6, 2, 3)>

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 1, 3)>
<1, (6, 4, 2)>
<2, (6, 9, 4)>
<3, (9, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 0, 1)>
<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<9, (6, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
