Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the given adjacency list, we see that the 3-stars can be formed around the nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

2. Let's start by counting the number of 3-stars around each node:
- Node 0: <0, (5, 4, 1)> 
- Node 1: <1, (4, 7, 6)>
- Node 2: <2, (9, 3, 8)> 
- Node 3: <3, (5, 6, 2)> 
- Node 4: <4, (5, 0, 1)> 
- Node 5: <5, (6, 4, 0)> 
- Node 6: <6, (5, 7, 1)> 
- Node 7: <7, (5, 6, 1)> 
- Node 8: <8, (9, 7, 2)> 
- Node 9: <9, (8, 2, 0)> 

3. Counting the total number of 3-stars:
- Total number of 3-stars = 10

Therefore, the answer is [10].
