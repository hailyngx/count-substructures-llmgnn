Response:
The central node in a 3-star graph can be any of the 15 nodes in the graph.

Let's count the number of 3-stars with each node as the central node:

1. Node 0: (0, 3, 5), (0, 3, 7), (0, 5, 7), (0, 5, 14), (0, 7, 14) - Total: 5
2. Node 1: (1, 3, 6), (1, 3, 7), (1, 3, 9), (1, 4, 9) - Total: 4
3. Node 2: (2, 9, 10), (2, 10, 12), (2, 10, 13), (2, 10, 14) - Total: 4
4. Node 3: (3, 1, 6), (3, 1, 7), (3, 1, 9), (3, 6, 10) - Total: 4
5. Node 4: (4, 1, 9), (4, 1, 14), (4, 9, 12), (4, 9, 14) - Total: 4
6. Node 5: (5, 0, 7), (5, 0, 14), (5, 7, 14), (5, 12, 14) - Total: 4
7. Node 6: (6, 1, 3), (6, 1, 10), (6, 3, 14), (6, 10, 12) - Total: 4
8. Node 7: (7, 0, 3), (7, 0, 5), (7, 0, 14), (7, 1, 3) - Total: 4
9. Node 8: (8, 3, 9), (8, 3, 12), (8, 12, 4), (8, 12, 5) - Total: 4
10. Node 9: (9, 1, 4), (9, 1, 8), (9, 2, 10), (9, 4, 12) - Total: 4
11. Node 10: (10, 0, 2), (10, 2, 12), (10, 2, 13), (10, 2, 14) - Total: 4
12. Node 11: (11, 12, 13) - Total: 1
13. Node 12: (12, 4, 8), (12, 5, 10), (12, 6, 10), (12, 10, 11) - Total: 4
14. Node 13: (13, 1, 11), (13, 2, 11), (13, 2, 10), (13, 11, 12) - Total: 4
15. Node 14: (14, 4, 7), (14, 5, 7), (14, 6, 7), (14, 6, 10) - Total: 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [55].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (9, 10, 13)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 9, 14)>
<5, (0, 7, 14)>
<6, (1, 3, 14)>
<7, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (3, 9, 12)>
<9, (1, 4, 9)>
<10, (0, 12, 14)>
