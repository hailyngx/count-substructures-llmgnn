Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that has degree 3 and check if its neighbors can form a 3-star around it. 

Let's go through each node with degree 3:

Node 0: Not a center of any 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors.
Node 2: Not a center of any 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors.
Node 7: Not a center of any 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors.

Now, let's examine the remaining nodes:

Node 1: (5, 3, 6)
Node 3: (5, 4, 8)
Node 4: (9, 7, 6)
Node 5: (9, 8, 6)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (5, 3, 6)>
<3, (5, 4, 8)>
<4, (9, 7, 6)>
<5, (9, 8, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
