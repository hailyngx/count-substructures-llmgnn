Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 10, 11, 14, 13, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 3, 14, and node 13
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 3, 12, 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 11
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 10, 11, 12, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 10, 11, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 14, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 0, 8, 7, and node 13
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, 8, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 13
Node 13 is connected to node 1, 10, 12, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three leaf nodes for each 3-star in the graph. Let's start by identifying the 3-stars:

1. <5, (8, 11, 1)>
2. <9, (4, 14, 1)>
3. <6, (1, 3, 2)>
4. <1, (5, 9, 6)>
5. <3, (6, 1, 2)>
6. <10, (0, 8, 7)>
7. <11, (5, 7, 0)>
8. <7, (10, 12, 14)>
9. <12, (7, 2, 13)>
10. <0, (6, 10, 14)>
11. <14, (9, 1, 7)>
12. <2, (6, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
