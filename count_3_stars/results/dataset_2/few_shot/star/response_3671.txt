Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

From the provided adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (18, 3, 15)>
2. <0, (18, 3, 19)>
3. <0, (3, 18, 8)>
4. <1, (12, 17, 6)>
5. <2, (18, 7, 0)>
6. <3, (18, 11, 5)>
7. <6, (1, 10, 8)>
8. <7, (2, 12, 19)>
9. <8, (18, 17, 6)>
10. <14, (12, 19, 10)>
11. <14, (3, 19, 5)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars: [11].
