Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. This indicates the presence of a 3-star with that node as the center.

After analyzing the provided graph and adjacency list, we can see that there are a total of [26] 3-stars in the given graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (9, 3, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (9, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 1, 0)>
<4, (5, 9, 3)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (6, 1, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
