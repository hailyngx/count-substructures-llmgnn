Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-star subgraphs where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the provided adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 4, 8)>
<1, (7, 3, 8)>
<2, (7, 3, 13)>
<3, (5, 1, 6)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<5, (9, 6, 4)>
<6, (5, 7, 3)>
<7, (9, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 8, 13)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<10, (5, 10, 13)>
<11, (13, 6, 12)>
<12, (0, 14, 12)>
<13, (8, 13, 2)>
<14, (0, 8, 14)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars identified, which is [14].
