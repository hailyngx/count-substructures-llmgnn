Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (18, 4, 15)>
<1, (2, 9, 7)>
<2, (18, 8, 1)>
<3, (10, 2, 8)>
<4, (8, 13, 0)>
<7, (11, 14, 1)>
<9, (18, 1, 19)>
<10, (17, 15, 3)>
<13, (4, 12, 16)>
<17, (10, 11, 17)>
<18, (2, 9, 0)>
<19, (9, 0, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
