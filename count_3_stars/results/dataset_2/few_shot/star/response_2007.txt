Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

We will look at each node and consider it as the center of a potential 3-star. For each node, we will examine its neighbors to see if any three of them are connected to the center node, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's go through the nodes one by one:

1. Node 0: 
   No 3-star with Node 0 as the center.

2. Node 1: 
   <1, (5, 9, 8)>
   
3. Node 2: 
   No 3-star with Node 2 as the center.

4. Node 3: 
   No 3-star with Node 3 as the center.

5. Node 4: 
   No 3-star with Node 4 as the center.

6. Node 5: 
   <5, (9, 6, 8)>
   
7. Node 6: 
   No 3-star with Node 6 as the center.

8. Node 7: 
   <7, (6, 3, 4)>
   
9. Node 8: 
   No 3-star with Node 8 as the center.

10. Node 9: 
    No 3-star with Node 9 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (5, 9, 8)> and <7, (6, 3, 4)>.
