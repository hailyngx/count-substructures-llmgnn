Response:
First, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.

For each node in the graph, we will check if it forms a 3-star structure as the central node. A 3-star structure consists of the central node and its three adjacent nodes.

Here are the nodes that form 3-star structures:
- Node 5: (5, 9, 12), (5, 9, 13)
- Node 9: (9, 5, 6), (9, 4, 6)
- Node 13: (13, 2, 0), (13, 5, 6)
- Node 17: (17, 1, 3), (17, 10, 1)
- Node 18: (18, 2, 4), (18, 4, 16)

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-star structures:
- <5, (9, 12, 13)>
- <9, (5, 4, 6)>
- <13, (2, 0, 5)>
- <17, (1, 3, 10)>
- <18, (2, 4, 16)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
