Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 8) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 12, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 11, 12, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 10, 11, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 4, 7, 6, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 12, 9, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 10, 11, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 13, 11, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 13, 12, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 4, 14, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 10, 4, and node 14
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 2, 9, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 1, 5, 6, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 8, and node 9

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs can be found by looking at each node and counting the number of 3-star configurations it is involved in.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<8, (13, 4, 14)>
<13, (8, 7, 6)>
<10, (11, 2, 9)>
<11, (10, 1, 5)>
<4, (8, 12, 9)>
<5, (10, 11, 0)>
<6, (13, 11, 0)>
<7, (13, 12, 3)>
<12, (4, 7, 0)>
<0, (12, 5, 6)>
<9, (10, 4, 14)>
<1, (8, 11, 12)>

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
