Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
There are 3-star configurations in the graph. Let's identify each unique 3-star:
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
