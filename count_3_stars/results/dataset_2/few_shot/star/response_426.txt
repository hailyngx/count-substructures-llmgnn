Response:
Before determining the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the 3-stars first:

<0, (9, 2, 14)>
<0, (9, 11, 3)>
<0, (9, 1, 5)>
<0, (11, 2, 14)>
<0, (11, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 14, 4)>
<1, (6, 9, 0)>
<1, (6, 5, 13)>
<2, (9, 8, 14)>
<3, (10, 0, 5)>
<4, (7, 10, 14)>
<5, (8, 3, 12)>
<6, (9, 1, 8)>
<6, (9, 1, 5)>
<11, (10, 0, 13)>
<12, (4, 8, 13)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
