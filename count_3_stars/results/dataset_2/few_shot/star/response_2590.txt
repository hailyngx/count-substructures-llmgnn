Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are the centers of the 3-stars in the graph. To be a center of a 3-star, a node must have exactly 3 neighbors.

Based on the adjacency list, the nodes that qualify as centers are:
- Node 1 (connected to 3, 19, 18)
- Node 2 (connected to 13, 12, 5)
- Node 3 (connected to 7, 16, 4)
- Node 4 (connected to 3, 9, 18)
- Node 5 (connected to 2, 11, 4)
- Node 6 (connected to 1, 9, 0)
- Node 14 (connected to 17, 7, 19)
- Node 15 (connected to 9, 16)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph using the identified center nodes:

1. For Node 1:
The 3-stars with node 1 as the center are as follows:
- <1, (3, 19, 18)>
The total number of 3-stars with Node 1 as the center: 1

2. For Node 2:
The 3-stars with node 2 as the center are as follows:
- <2, (13, 12, 5)>
The total number of 3-stars with Node 2 as the center: 1

3. For Node 3:
The 3-stars with node 3 as the center are as follows:
- <3, (7, 16, 4)>
The total number of 3-stars with Node 3 as the center: 1

4. For Node 4:
The 3-stars with node 4 as the center are as follows:
- <4, (3, 9, 18)>
- <4, (5, 11, 2)>
The total number of 3-stars with Node 4 as the center: 2

5. For Node 5:
The 3-stars with node 5 as the center are as follows:
- <5, (2, 11, 4)>
The total number of 3-stars with Node 5 as the center: 1

6. For Node 6:
The 3-stars with node 6 as the center are as follows:
- <6, (1, 9, 0)>
The total number of 3-stars with Node 6 as the center: 1

7. For Node 14:
The 3-stars with node 14 as the center are as follows:
- <14, (17, 7, 19)>
The total number of 3-stars with Node 14 as the center: 1

8. For Node 15:
The 3-stars with node 15 as the center are as follows:
- <15, (9, 16, 3)>
The total number of 3-stars with Node 15 as the center: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
