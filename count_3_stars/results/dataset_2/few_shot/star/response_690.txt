Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to count the number of 3-stars.

First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 2: Connected to node 20
- Node 3: Connected to node 29 and node 28
- Node 4: Connected to node 11, 24, and node 20
- Node 5: Connected to node 9, 28, and node 20 
- Node 6: Connected to node 17 and node 0
- Node 8: Connected to node 1, 29, and node 18
- Node 9: Connected to node 26, 5, 11, and node 27
- Node 12: Connected to node 10 and node 0
- Node 13: Connected to node 7, 28, and node 16
- Node 15: Connected to node 14, 10, 0, and node 18

Next, we will list the 3-stars in the graph:
<2, (20, 4, 5)>
<3, (29, 28, 7)>
<6, (17, 0, 7)>
<8, (1, 29, 18)>
<9, (26, 11, 5)>
<12, (10, 0, 15)>
<13, (7, 28, 16)>
<15, (14, 10, 0)>
<20, (5, 2, 4)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of 9. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
