Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, 8, and node 2

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
<[0, (1, 5, 8)]>, <[1, (0, 3, 8)]>, <[2, (4, 7, 9)]>, <[3, (1, 4, 9)]>, <[4, (7, 6, 2)]>, <[5, (4, 6, 2)]>, <[6, (4, 9, 8)]>, <[7, (4, 9, 2)]>, <[8, (1, 6, 9)]>, <[9, (7, 6, 8)]>
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
