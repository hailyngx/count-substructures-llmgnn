Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 13) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 12, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 10, 12, 4, 2, and node 14
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 11, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (9, 10, 12)>
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (9, 10, 5)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (7, 8, 14)>
4. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (10, 11, 14)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (6, 4, 1)>
6. Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (11, 8, 1)>
7. Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (10, 3, 12)>
8. Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (11, 13, 1)>
9. Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (6, 7, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
