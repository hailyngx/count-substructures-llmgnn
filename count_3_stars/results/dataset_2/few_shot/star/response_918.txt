Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 0) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 10, 2, 8, 14, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 14, 5, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 6, 13, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 11
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 5, 14, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 0, 14, 13, 12, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 11, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 11, 0, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 0, and node 12
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 10, 3, 13, 8, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 10, 11, 8, 5, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 11, 2, and node 5
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 0, 1, and node 5

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with 3 edges (leaves) attached to them, as these nodes could potentially be the center of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 4: connected to nodes 7, 5, and 14
- Node 5: connected to nodes 4, 0, and 14
- Node 11: connected to nodes 7, 13, and 12
- Node 12: connected to nodes 10, 5, and 11

Next, let's check each of these nodes to see if they form any 3-stars with the nodes connected to them. 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[6]
<4, (7, 5, 14)>
<5, (4, 0, 14)>
<11, (7, 13, 12)>
<12, (10, 5, 11)>
<12, (11, 8, 10)>
<12, (5, 1, 11)>
