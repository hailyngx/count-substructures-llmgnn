Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of ways we can choose the central node and its three connected nodes. 

Let's iterate through each node and count the number of 3-stars it is part of:
1. Node 0 is part of 2 3-stars: <0, (6, 11, 12)> and <0, (6, 7, 14)>
2. Node 1 is part of 2 3-stars: <1, (6, 11, 12)> and <1, (6, 2, 12)>
3. Node 2 is part of 1 3-star: <2, (1, 7, 12)>
4. Node 3 is part of 0 3-stars
5. Node 4 is part of 0 3-stars
6. Node 5 is part of 1 3-star: <5, (11, 13, 14)>
7. Node 6 is part of 3 3-stars: <6, (9, 10, 11)>, <6, (1, 11, 12)>, and <6, (8, 10, 13)>
8. Node 7 is part of 3 3-stars: <7, (9, 8, 13)>, <7, (12, 0, 14)>, and <7, (2, 1, 12)>
9. Node 8 is part of 3 3-stars: <8, (6, 10, 13)>, <8, (3, 9, 10)>, and <8, (7, 13, 14)>
10. Node 9 is part of 3 3-stars: <9, (6, 10, 11)>, <9, (4, 10, 9)>, and <9, (7, 8, 13)>
11. Node 10 is part of 2 3-stars: <10, (11, 9, 6)> and <10, (8, 6, 13)>
12. Node 11 is part of 3 3-stars: <11, (6, 10, 9)>, <11, (1, 6, 12)>, and <11, (0, 5, 14)>
13. Node 12 is part of 3 3-stars: <12, (1, 11, 6)>, <12, (7, 0, 14)>, and <12, (2, 1, 7)>
14. Node 13 is part of 2 3-stars: <13, (8, 7, 14)> and <13, (5, 11, 14)>
15. Node 14 is part of 1 3-star: <14, (12, 0, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].  
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (6, 11, 12)>, <0, (6, 7, 14)>, <1, (6, 11, 12)>, <1, (6, 2, 12)>, <2, (1, 7, 12)>, <5, (11, 13, 14)>, <6, (9, 10, 11)>, <6, (1, 11, 12)>, <6, (8, 10, 13)>, <7, (9, 8, 13)>, <7, (12, 0, 14)>, <7, (2, 1, 12)>, <8, (6, 10, 13)>, <8, (3, 9, 10)>, <8, (7, 13, 14)>, <9, (6, 10, 11)>, <9, (4, 10, 9)>, <9, (7, 8, 13)>, <10, (11, 9, 6)>, <10, (8, 6, 13)>, <11, (6, 10, 9)>, <11, (1, 6, 12)>, <11, (0, 5, 14)>
