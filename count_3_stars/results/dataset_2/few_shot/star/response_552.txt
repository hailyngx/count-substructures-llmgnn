Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the provided information, we can see that the nodes with degree 3 are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. These nodes have exactly three neighbors and can potentially be the central node of a 3-star.

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (9, 3, 4)>
<2, (9, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 2)>
<4, (9, 1, 3)>
<5, (7, 9, 8)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph, which is [5].
