Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
The nodes with 4 connections are nodes 4, 9, and 2. 
Checking their connections, we can find all the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2: <2, (5, 4, 0)>, <2, (6, 3, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 3)>
- Node 4: <4, (5, 2, 0)>, <4, (9, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (8, 6, 0)>, <4, (6, 2, 5)>
- Node 9: <9, (6, 3, 1)>, <9, (4, 5, 0)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 8, 7)>, <9, (6, 3, 4)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [8].
