Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be found by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

<2, (22, 23, 7)>
<5, (14, 8, 15)>
<6, (21, 29, 10)>
<7, (0, 24, 2)>
<9, (17, 15, 29)>
<13, (22, 28, 0)>
<14, (1, 18, 23)>
<15, (25, 9, 5)>
<16, (27, 0, 0)>
<17, (29, 20, 9)>
<18, (22, 18, 14)>
<19, (26, 10, 22)>
<20, (17, 11, 20)>
<21, (6, 0, 11)>
<22, (13, 18, 2)>
<23, (14, 17, 8)>
<24, (4, 7, 0)>
<25, (3, 15, 0)>
<26, (19, 10, 4)>
<27, (5, 28, 16)>
<28, (13, 27, 0)>
<29, (17, 3, 6)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph is [22].
