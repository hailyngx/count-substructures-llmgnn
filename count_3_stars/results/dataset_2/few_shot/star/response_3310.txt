Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (7, 11, 14)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (12, 13, 14)>
<3, (4, 10, 6)>
<4, (1, 12, 13)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 11)>
<8, (1, 5, 12)>
<9, (5, 6, 10)>
<10, (3, 9, 14)>
<11, (0, 7, 14)>
<12, (2, 4, 8)>
<13, (2, 4, 14)>
<14, (1, 10, 11)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [14]
