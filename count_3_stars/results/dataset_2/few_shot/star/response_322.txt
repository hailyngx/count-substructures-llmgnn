Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Then we need to check if these connections form a 3-star pattern.

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can first identify all the potential 3-star patterns. Here are the identified 3-stars:

<0, (9, 2, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (8, 0, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<5, (9, 1, 3)>
<6, (1, 7, 3)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (6, 2, 0)>
<9, (5, 3, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars. The final answer is: [9].
