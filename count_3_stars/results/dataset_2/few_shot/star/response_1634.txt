Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Start by listing the neighbors of each node so we can easily identify the 3-stars.
- The possible 3-stars will consist of the center node and its three adjacent nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (1, 0, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 19)>
<1, (5, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 0)>
<2, (6, 18, 15)>
<0, (5, 3, 16)>
<18, (15, 16, 5)>
<13, (6, 14, 15)>
<15, (18, 17, 13)>
<16, (18, 15, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
