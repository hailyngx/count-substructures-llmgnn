Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step by step by examining each node and its connections.

Node 0: Not a part of any 3-star since it has more than three connections.
Node 1: Forms a 3-star: <1, (5, 9, 2)>
Node 2: Not a part of any 3-star since it has more than three connections.
Node 3: Not a part of any 3-star since it has more than three connections.
Node 4: Forms a 3-star: <4, (9, 6, 3)>
Node 5: Forms a 3-star: <5, (9, 6, 8)>
Node 6: Not a part of any 3-star since it has more than three connections.
Node 7: Not a part of any 3-star since it has less than three connections.
Node 8: Not a part of any 3-star since it has more than three connections.
Node 9: Forms a 3-star: <9, (5, 6, 4)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (5, 9, 2)>, <4, (9, 6, 3)>, <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 4)>

Combining them, we get a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
