Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list out the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<3, (1, 16, 12)>
<4, (1, 0, 14)>
<5, (9, 13, 7)>
<7, (2, 12, 19)>
<9, (5, 16, 1)>
<11, (3, 13, 15)>
<13, (5, 17, 11)>
<16, (9, 3, 14)>
<17, (2, 13, 6)>
<18, (0, 17, 8)>
<19, (7, 11, 16)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [11].
