Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the unique 3-stars present. 

The unique 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (5, 9, 8)>
<0, (5, 2, 1)>
<0, (5, 2, 3)>
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<0, (9, 2, 3)>
<0, (9, 2, 4)>
<1, (5, 6, 0)>
<4, (5, 9, 3)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<4, (7, 9, 3)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 6, 0)>
<9, (4, 7, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
