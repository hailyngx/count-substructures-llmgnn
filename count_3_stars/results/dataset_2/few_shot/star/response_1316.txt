Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. A 3-star pattern consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars identified in the given graph:
<0, (5, 9, 6)>
<1, (9, 3, 0)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 0)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<6, (5, 7, 2)>
<7, (1, 9, 3)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [8]
