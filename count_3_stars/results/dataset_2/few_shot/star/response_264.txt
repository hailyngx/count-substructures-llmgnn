Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can iterate through each node and check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors. 

From the adjacency list, we see that the possible 3-stars would involve a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We can iterate through each node and its neighbors to find the 3-stars.

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (0, 1, 19)>
<3, (11, 5, 9)>
<4, (8, 13, 9)>
<6, (7, 10, 15)>
<8, (4, 13, 14)>
<9, (1, 3, 15)>
<10, (6, 14, 15)>
<11, (16, 3, 2)>
<12, (8, 17, 13)>
<13, (7, 18, 8)>
<14, (16, 15, 8)>
<15, (18, 6, 9)>
<16, (14, 18, 11)>
<17, (19, 12, 18)>
<18, (19, 13, 16)>
<19, (17, 2, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
