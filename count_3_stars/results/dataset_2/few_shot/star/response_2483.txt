Node 2 is connected to node 4, 12, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 11, 10, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 10, 13, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 14, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 13, 12, 0, and node 14
Node 10 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 11, and node 0
Node 11 is connected to node 3, 10, 14, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 1, 3, 13, 11, 2, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 12, 9, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 8, 11, and node 9

Response:
First, we identify all 3-stars in the given graph. 
To form a 3-star, we look for a node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

From the adjacency list provided, we can see that the nodes with the following connections satisfy this condition:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 10
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 10, and 0

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (7, 8, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 10)>
<1, (7, 10, 0)>

Since all 3-stars are unique, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
