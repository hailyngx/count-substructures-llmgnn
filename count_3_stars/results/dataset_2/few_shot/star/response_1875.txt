Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 3

Response:
We need to find all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's examine each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. A 3-star will have the center connected to exactly three other nodes.

For Node 0: Not a center of a 3-star.

For Node 1: <1, (5, 2, 4)>

For Node 2: <2, (9, 6, 0)>

For Node 3: <3, (9, 1, 7)>

For Node 4: <4, (6, 1, 8)>

For Node 5: Not a center of a 3-star.

For Node 6: Not a center of a 3-star.

For Node 7: <7, (5, 1, 0)>

For Node 8: Not a center of a 3-star.

For Node 9: Not a center of a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (5, 2, 4)>, <2, (9, 6, 0)>, <3, (9, 1, 7)>, and <7, (5, 1, 0)>.
