Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated based on the number of nodes and edges in the graph. Since a 3-star has one central node and three leaf nodes, we need to identify all possible 3-stars in the given graph.

In this graph, we are given that there are 20 nodes and 60 edges. For a 3-star, we need to find a central node (with degree exactly 3) and three leaf nodes connected to it.

Let's identify the central nodes first:
- Node 7 has degree 4 (connected to 4 nodes: 12, 3, 6, 19)
- Node 1 has degree 4 (connected to 4 nodes: 3, 2, 16, 10)
- Node 2 has degree 5 (connected to 5 nodes: 1, 10, 9, 19, 6)
- Node 3 has degree 3 (connected to 3 nodes: 7, 1, 16)
- Node 4 has degree 2 (connected to 2 nodes: 5, 16)
- Node 5 has degree 4 (connected to 4 nodes: 4, 13, 17, 0)
- Node 6 has degree 3 (connected to 3 nodes: 7, 18, 2)
- Node 9 has degree 4 (connected to 4 nodes: 8, 2, 17, 14)
- Node 10 has degree 4 (connected to 4 nodes: 1, 11, 15, 2)
- Node 11 has degree 3 (connected to 3 nodes: 10, 19, 13)
- Node 12 has degree 2 (connected to 2 nodes: 7, 16)
- Node 13 has degree 4 (connected to 4 nodes: 11, 8, 5, 15)
- Node 16 has degree 4 (connected to 4 nodes: 4, 1, 3, 12)
- Node 17 has degree 2 (connected to 2 nodes: 5, 9)
- Node 18 has degree 2 (connected to 2 nodes: 19, 6)
- Node 19 has degree 4 (connected to 4 nodes: 7, 11, 18, 2)

Based on the degrees of the nodes, we see that only Node 3 and Node 6 have a degree of 3, making them potential central nodes for 3-stars.

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph using the central nodes:
1. With Node 3 as the center:  
<3, (7, 1, 16)>  
<3, (7, 16, 12)>  
2. With Node 6 as the center:  
<6, (7, 18, 2)>  
<6, (2, 1, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
