Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star in the graph. For a node to be the center of a 3-star, it must have exactly three adjacent nodes.

Based on the adjacency list provided, the candidate central nodes are:
- Node 12: connected to 7, 6, and 22
- Node 3: connected to 1, 25, and 23
- Node 9: connected to 17, 1, and 20
- Node 20: connected to 25, 9, and 4
- Node 5: connected to 11, 13, and 26

Now, let's construct the 3-stars using these central nodes and their adjacent nodes:
1. Central node: 12
   Adjacent nodes: 7, 6, 22
   <12, (7, 6, 22)>

2. Central node: 3
   Adjacent nodes: 1, 25, 23
   <3, (1, 25, 23)>

3. Central node: 9
   Adjacent nodes: 17, 1, 20
   <9, (17, 1, 20)>

4. Central node: 20
   Adjacent nodes: 25, 9, 4
   <20, (25, 9, 4)>

5. Central node: 5
   Adjacent nodes: 11, 13, 26
   <5, (11, 13, 26)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
