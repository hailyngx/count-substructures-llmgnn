Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 0: No 3-star as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
2. Node 1: No 3-star as it is connected to only 3 other nodes.
3. Node 2: No 3-star as it is connected to only 3 other nodes.
4. Node 3: No 3-star as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
5. Node 4: No 3-star as it is connected to only 3 other nodes.
6. Node 5: One 3-star: <5, (9, 3, 7)>
7. Node 6: No 3-star as it is connected to only 3 other nodes.
8. Node 7: No 3-star as it is connected to only 3 other nodes.
9. Node 8: No 3-star as it is connected to more than 3 other nodes.
10. Node 9: One 3-star: <9, (5, 16, 13)>
11. Node 10: No 3-star as it is connected to more than 3 other nodes.
12. Node 11: No 3-star as it is connected to more than 3 other nodes.
13. Node 12: No 3-star as it is connected to only 3 other nodes.
14. Node 13: No 3-star as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
15. Node 14: No 3-star as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
16. Node 15: No 3-star as it is connected to only 3 other nodes.
17. Node 16: No 3-star as it is connected to only 3 other nodes.
18. Node 17: No 3-star as it is connected to more than 3 other nodes.
19. Node 18: No 3-star as it is connected to only 1 other node.
20. Node 19: No 3-star as it is connected to more than 3 other nodes.
