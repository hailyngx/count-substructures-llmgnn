Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Now let's go through each node and find the 3-stars in the graph:

- From Node 0: <0, (2, 11, 5)>
- From Node 1: <1, (2, 14, 15)>
- From Node 2: <2, (1, 7, 14)>
- From Node 4: no 3-star as it has only two adjacent nodes.
- From Node 6: no 3-star as it has only two adjacent nodes.
- From Node 8: <8, (4, 10, 16)>
- From Node 11: <11, (0, 9, 17)>
- From Node 12: <12, (5, 9, 17)> and <12, (10, 13, 17)>
- From Node 13: <13, (10, 16, 18)>
- From Node 14: <14, (1, 2, 15)> and <14, (7, 19, 15)>
- From Node 15: no 3-star as it has only two adjacent nodes.
- From Node 16: no 3-star as it has only one adjacent node.
- From Node 17: <17, (11, 12, 18)>
- From Node 18: no 3-star as it has only two adjacent nodes.
- From Node 19: no 3-star as it has only one adjacent node.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (2, 11, 5)>
- <1, (2, 14, 15)>
- <2, (1, 7, 14)>
- <8, (4, 10, 16)>
- <11, (0, 9, 17)>
- <12, (5, 9, 17)>
- <12, (10, 13, 17)>
- <13, (10, 16, 18)>
- <14, (1, 2, 15)>
- <14, (7, 19, 15)>
