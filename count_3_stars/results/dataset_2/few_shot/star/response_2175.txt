Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 14
Node 2 is connected to node 10, 5, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 11, 0, 14, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 13, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 11, 13, 2, 8, and node 12
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 11, 3, and node 14
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 10, 5, 9, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 8, 12, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 3, 13, 5, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 10, 5, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 7, 11, 5, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 3, 6, 1, and node 12

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

From the adjacency list, we find the nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0 has three neighbors: 13, 3, 9
- Node 1 has two neighbors
- Node 3 has six neighbors
- Node 4 has three neighbors: 9, 13, 6
- Node 7 has three neighbors: 3, 6, 13
- Node 8 has four neighbors
- Node 10 has four neighbors
- Node 12 has three neighbors: 10, 5, 14

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with (13, 3, 9): <0, (13, 3, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with (9, 13, 6): <4, (9, 13, 6)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with (3, 6, 13): <7, (3, 6, 13)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with (10, 5, 14): <12, (10, 5, 14)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars: [4].
