Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 13) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 13, 7, and node 10
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 5, 4, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 12

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (9, 3, 13)>
<0, (9, 3, 7)>
<0, (3, 13, 7)>
<0, (13, 7, 10)>
<1, (6, 3, 5)>
<1, (6, 5, 4)>
<1, (3, 5, 12)>
<2, (3, 7, 12)>
<4, (9, 1, 13)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 10)>
<5, (1, 7, 14)>
<6, (9, 1, 11)>
<7, (3, 0, 5)>
<8, (6, 9, 13)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
<10, (0, 12, 5)>
<11, (6, 8, 13)>

Count of 3-stars: [17]
