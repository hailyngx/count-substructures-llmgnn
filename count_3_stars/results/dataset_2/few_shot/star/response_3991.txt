Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent the 3-stars in the graph.

From the given adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (14, 8, 9)>
2. <1, (11, 4, 5)>
3. <2, (8, 9, 4)>
4. <3, (7, 8, 10)>
5. <5, (12, 0, 10)>
6. < 8, (12, 0, 2)>
7. < 9, (0, 14, 2)>
8. <10, (3, 4, 5)>
9. <11, (8, 1, 13)>
10. <12, (7, 4, 5)>
11. <13, (7, 14, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
