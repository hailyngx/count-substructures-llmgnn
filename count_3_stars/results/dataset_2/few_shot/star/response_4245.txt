Response:
First, we will identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided. We consider each node as the center in turn and find the corresponding leaves.

For Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 1, and 8. But it does not form a 3-star.

For Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 5, and 0. This forms a 3-star: <1, (9, 4, 5)>

For Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 4, 7, and 3. This forms two 3-stars: <2, (6, 9, 4)> and <2, (6, 7, 3)>

For Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 4, and 2. But it does not form a 3-star.

For Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 1, 3, and 2. This forms a 3-star: <4, (6, 7, 1)>

For Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 8. But it does not form a 3-star.

For Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 5, 3, 2, 4, and 8. This forms four 3-stars: <6, (9, 5, 3)>, <6, (9, 2, 4)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>

For Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 0, and 2. This forms a 3-star: <7, (9, 4, 0)>

For Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 5, and 0. But it does not form a 3-star.

For Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 1, and 7. This forms a 3-star: <9, (6, 2, 1)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [9]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (9, 4, 5)>, <2, (6, 9, 4)>, <2, (6, 7, 3)>, <4, (6, 7, 1)>, <6, (9, 5, 3)>, <6, (9, 2, 4)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (9, 4, 0)>
