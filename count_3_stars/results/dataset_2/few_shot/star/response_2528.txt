Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the possible 3-stars.

From the adjacency list, nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8 have exactly three edges connected to them.

Step 2: For each potential center node, check if the three adjacent nodes connected to it form a 3-star.

For Node 0:
We have (0, 9, 3) which forms a 3-star. <0, (9, 3)>

For Node 2:
We have (2, 5, 8) which forms a 3-star. <2, (5, 8)>

For Node 5:
We have (5, 2, 8) which forms a 3-star. <5, (2, 8)>

For Node 8:
We have (8, 5, 4) which forms a 3-star. <8, (5, 4)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (9, 3)>, <2, (5, 8)>, <5, (2, 8)>, <8, (5, 4)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
