Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph and list the unique 3-stars, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

Nodes with three connections:
- Node 1 is connected to 3, 13, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to 14, 11, 4, 5, and 13
- Node 6 is connected to 3, 14, and 8
- Node 9 is connected to 0, 14, 11, and 10
- Node 12 is connected to 5

2. For each of these nodes, consider the connections they have and form 3-stars if the connected nodes are unique.
   
3. Count the number of unique 3-stars and list them. Make sure to list the unique 3-stars only once.

Based on the provided information, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
- <1, (3, 13, 8)>
- <2, (14, 11, 4)>
- <6, (3, 14, 8)>
- <9, (0, 14, 11)>
- <12, (5)>

Now, calculating the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we have found 5 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
