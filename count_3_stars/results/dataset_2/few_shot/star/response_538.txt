Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify all the 3-stars:

- From node 0: None
- From node 1: <1, (7, 13, 11)>
- From node 2: None
- From node 3: None
- From node 4: None
- From node 5: None
- From node 6: <6, (7, 8, 14)> <6, (3, 0, 12)>
- From node 7: None
- From node 8: None
- From node 9: None
- From node 10: None
- From node 11: None
- From node 12: None
- From node 13: None
- From node 14: None

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars found are:

- <6, (7, 8, 14)>
- <6, (3, 0, 12)>
