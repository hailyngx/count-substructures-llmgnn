Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (13, 6) (13, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 5)

Response:
We are looking for all the 3-star patterns in the given graph. Remember that a 3-star pattern consists of 3 leaves connected to a central node.

Let's find the 3-star patterns step by step:

1. Consider each node as a potential central node and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
   
2. Identify the leaves connected to the potential central node to form a 3-star pattern.

Here are the 3-star patterns in the given graph:
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 10, 14)>
<8, (4, 11, 5)>
<10, (1, 7, 12)>
<11, (3, 5, 8)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars found: [5]
