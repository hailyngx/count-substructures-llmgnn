Response:
We can start by checking each node to see if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors.  

Let's go through each node:

- Node 0: Forms a 3-star <0, (5, 8, 15)>.
  
- Node 1: Does not form a 3-star.

- Node 2: Forms a 3-star <2, (8, 14, 19)>.

- Node 3: Does not form a 3-star.

- Node 4: Does not form a 3-star.

- Node 5: Forms a 3-star <5, (9, 0, 3)>.

- Node 6: Does not form a 3-star.

- Node 7: Does not form a 3-star.

- Node 8: Forms a 3-star <8, (9, 2, 18)>.

- Node 9: Forms a 3-star <9, (5, 8, 17)>.

- Node 10: Does not form a 3-star.

- Node 11: Does not form a 3-star.

- Node 12: Does not form a 3-star.

- Node 13: Does not form a 3-star.

- Node 14: Does not form a 3-star.

- Node 15: Does not form a 3-star.

- Node 16: Does not form a 3-star.

- Node 17: Does not form a 3-star.

- Node 18: Forms a 3-star <18, (8, 6, 7)>.

- Node 19: Does not form a 3-star.

Count of 3-stars: [4]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 8, 15)>
<2, (8, 14, 19)>
<5, (9, 0, 3)>
<8, (9, 2, 18)>
