Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each possible combination of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (14, 24, 29)>
<0, (14, 8, 10)>
<0, (24, 7, 29)>
<1, (4, 15, 21)>
<3, (6, 11, 21)>
<3, (6, 3, 16)>
<5, (6, 27, 29)>
<9, (6, 20, 29)>
<9, (6, 8, 29)>
<9, (20, 28, 29)>
<11, (7, 12, 24)>
<11, (7, 11, 23)>
<11, (11, 12, 25)>
<18, (19, 25, 26)>
<23, (15, 16, 23)>
<23, (16, 23, 27)>
<23, (16, 23, 27)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we find [16].
