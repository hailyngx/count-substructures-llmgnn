Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern). 

To do this, we will look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors and check if they form a 3-star pattern around the central node. 

In this graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<5, (9, 1, 7)>
<5, (9, 4, 1)>
<5, (9, 7, 1)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<9, (5, 2, 7)>
<4, (5, 2, 9)>
<4, (5, 2, 2)>
<7, (5, 1, 9)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (9, 4, 8)>
<2, (9, 8, 7)>
<3, (8, 6, 0)>
<6, (8, 5, 1)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars: 
[15]

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
