Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's find the 3-stars step by step:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 13, and 16. 
  <1, (4, 13, 16)>
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 17, and 9.
  <2, (8, 17, 9)>
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 5, and 14.
  <3, (8, 5, 14)>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 10, and 15.
  <4, (7, 10, 15)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 15, 19, and 0.
  <6, (15, 19, 0)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 16, and 19.
  <7, (4, 16, 19)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 2, and 11.
  <8, (13, 2, 11)>
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 1, and 18.
  <13, (8, 1, 18)>
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 13, 19, and 9.
  <18, (13, 19, 9)>
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 7, 6, and 18.
  <19, (7, 6, 18)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
