Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. The central nodes will be those nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors.

Based on the adjacency list:
- Node 4 has only 1 connection.
- Node 0, 1, 2, and 8 have 5 connections each.
- Node 5 and 9 have 4 connections each.
- Node 6 and 7 have 5 connections each.
- Node 3 has 6 connections.

Therefore, the central nodes are nodes 5 and 9.

Next, let's identify the leaves (outer nodes) connected to each central node to form the 3-stars.

For central node 5:
- Leaves connected to node 5: 6, 3, and 7
- So, the 3-star with node 5 as the center is <5, (6, 3, 7)>

For central node 9:
- Leaves connected to node 9: 6, 2, and 7
- So, the 3-star with node 9 as the center is <9, (6, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [2] 
The unique 3-stars are: <<5, (6, 3, 7)>, <9, (6, 2, 7)>>
