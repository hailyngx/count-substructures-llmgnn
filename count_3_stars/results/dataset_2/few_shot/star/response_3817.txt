Response:
To find the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 11, 13)>
<9, (5, 12, 14)>
<4, (3, 7, 10)>
<7, (4, 6, 12)>
<1, (6, 18, -)>
<3, (4, -, -)>
<10, (4, 13, -)>
<11, (5, 14, 19)>
<2, (14, 17, 18)>
<12, (7, 9, 13)>
<13, (0, 5, 12)>
<6, (1, 7, 17)>
<16, (6, 7, -)>
<15, (4, 17, 18)>
<17, (2, 6, 19)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are [14] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
