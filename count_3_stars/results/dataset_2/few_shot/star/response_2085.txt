Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 3, 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 0, 1, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star shape. Let's go through the adjacency list for each node and identify the 3-stars:

<0, (8, 3, 1)>
<1, (4, 6, 0)>
<2, (4, 1, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 0)>
<4, (9, 5, 1)>
<5, (4, 8, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 1)>
<7, (8, 5, 2)>
<8, (5, 0, 7)>
<9, (4, 0, 1)>

So, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
