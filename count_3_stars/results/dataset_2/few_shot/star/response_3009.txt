Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking at each node and its connections:

- From node 0: <0, (6, 9, 20)>
- From node 6: <6, (9, 3, 0)>
- From node 9: <9, (6, 4, 0)>
- From node 20: <20, (6, 0, 18)>
- From node 4: <4, (9, 21, 10)>
- From node 26: <26, (1, 13, 28)>
- From node 17: <17, (10, 25, 8)>
- From node 16: <16, (20, 12, 28)>
- From node 18: <18, (20, 15, 19)>
- From node 25: <25, (7, 10, 17)>
- From node 12: <12, (27, 16, 28)>
- From node 13: <13, (26, 2, -)>
- From node 5: <5, (26, 15, -)>
- From node 8: <8, (17, 27, 24)>
- From node 11: <11, (1, 18, -)>
- From node 19: <19, (16, 18, 24)>
- From node 21: <21, (-, -, -)>
- From node 22: <22, (10, 3, -)>
- From node 23: <23, (14, 28, -)>
- From node 7: <7, (9, 25, 2)>
- From node 1: <1, (14, 26, 11)>
- From node 3: <3, (6, 27, 22)>
- From node 15: <15, (5, 18, -)>
- From node 24: <24, (19, 8, 29)>
- From node 29: <29, (0, 3, 24)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].
