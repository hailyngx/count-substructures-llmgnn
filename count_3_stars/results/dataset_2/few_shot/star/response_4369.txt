Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<2, (9, 1, 6)>
<3, (1, 0, 8)>
<4, (5, 3, 6)>
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<6, (7, 2, 4)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (9, 3, 7)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
