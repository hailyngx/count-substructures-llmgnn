Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of 3-stars centered at each node individually. 

Counting the number of 3-stars centered at each node:
- Node 0: (0, 8, 5), (0, 5, 7), (0, 5, 12)
- Node 1: (1, 10, 13)
- Node 2: (2, 11, 12), (2, 12, 3)
- Node 3: No 3-stars centered at Node 3
- Node 4: (4, 11, 1), (4, 11, 2)
- Node 5: (5, 10, 13), (5, 10, 0), (5, 0, 7), (5, 7, 14)
- Node 6: No 3-stars centered at Node 6
- Node 7: (7, 9, 11), (7, 11, 14)
- Node 8: (8, 10, 11), (8, 11, 12), (8, 11, 0)
- Node 9: No 3-stars centered at Node 9
- Node 10: (10, 8, 11), (10, 8, 12), (10, 8, 0)
- Node 11: (11, 7, 8), (11, 8, 12), (11, 8, 0), (11, 8, 4), (11, 8, 2)
- Node 12: (12, 8, 11), (12, 8, 0), (12, 8, 1), (12, 8, 2)
- Node 13: (13, 10, 5), (13, 5, 7)
- Node 14: No 3-stars centered at Node 14

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (8, 5, 7)>, <0, (5, 7, 12)>, <1, (10, 13, 4)>, <2, (11, 12, 4)>, <2, (12, 3, 2)>, <4, (11, 1, 4)>, <5, (10, 13, 0)>, <5, (0, 7, 14)>, <7, (9, 11, 4)>, <7, (11, 14, 7)>, <8, (10, 11, 8)>, <8, (11, 12, 8)>, <8, (11, 0, 8)>, <10, (8, 11, 10)>, <10, (8, 12, 10)>, <10, (8, 0, 10)>, <11, (7, 8, 11)>, <11, (8, 12, 11)>, <11, (8, 4, 11)>, <11, (8, 2, 11)>, <12, (8, 11, 12)>, <12, (8, 0, 12)>, <12, (8, 1, 12)>, <12, (8, 2, 12)>, <13, (10, 5, 13)>, <13, (5, 7, 13)>

Therefore, the final answer is [25].
