Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 11) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 14) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 12) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8)

Node 12 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 5, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, 0, and node 13

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 3, 14)>
<1, (7, 11, 2)>
<3, (0, 10, 13)>
<6, (9, 14, 12)>
<8, (9, 10, 11)>
<9, (7, 6, 14)>
<11, (1, 5, 12)>
<12, (4, 6, 2)>
<13, (4, 1, 14)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph and output it inside brackets:

[9]
