Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can consider each node as the potential center of a 3-star and check if it satisfies the definition of a 3-star. 

Here are the steps to identify the 3-stars:

1. Identify the potential centers (nodes with degree equal to 3) which can act as the central node of a 3-star.
2. For each potential center, check its neighbors to find possible 3-stars.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Potential centers:
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 have degree 3.

2. For each potential center, check its neighbors to form 3-stars:

From node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 1.
  - No 3-star with 0 as the central node.

From node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 0, and 8.
- <1, (4, 6, 0)> [One 3-star]

From node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 3, and 8.
- <2, (7, 3, 8)> [One 3-star]

From node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 2, and 8.
  - No 3-star with 3 as the central node.

From node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 3, and 8.
  - No 3-star with 6 as the central node.

From node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 0.
  - No 3-star with 9 as the central node.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 6, 0)>
<2, (7, 3, 8)>
