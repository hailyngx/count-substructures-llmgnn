Response:
Let's go step-by-step to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Step 1: Identify all possible 3-stars in the graph.
- From the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find central nodes (the center) that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
- We can find these 3-stars by looking at each node's adjacency list and check if it satisfies the 3-star condition.

Step 2: Count the number of unique 3-stars found.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 connections:
- Node 0 is connected to 4, 10, 3.
- Node 2 is connected to 13, 12, 19.
- Node 19 is connected to 0, 2, 4.
- Node 25 is connected to 13, 5, 6.
- Node 27 is connected to 11, 8, 16.
- Node 28 is connected to 6.
- Node 29 is connected to 22, 7.

Based on the adjacency lists, we can find the unique 3-stars:

<0, (14, 10, 3)>
<2, (13, 12, 19)>
<19, (0, 2, 4)>
<25, (13, 5, 6)>
<27, (11, 8, 16)>
<28, (6)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: [6]
