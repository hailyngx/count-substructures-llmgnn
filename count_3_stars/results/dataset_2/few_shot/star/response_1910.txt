Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique instance of a 3-star pattern.

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, with a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can go through each node of the graph and check if it forms a 3-star.

Starting from Node 0:
- Node 0 has connections to nodes 6, 9, 4, and 7. 
  - Two potential 3-stars can be formed using Node 0 as the center:
    <0, (6, 9, 4)>
    <0, (6, 7, 4)>

Moving to Node 1:
- Node 1 has connections to nodes 9 and 5.
  - No 3-star can be formed with Node 1 as the center.

Proceeding to Node 2:
- Node 2 has connections to only node 9.
  - No 3-star can be formed with Node 2 as the center.

Next is Node 3:
- Node 3 has connections to nodes 4, 8, 5, 2, 0, and 7.
  - One potential 3-star can be formed using Node 3 as the center:
    <3, (4, 5, 8)>

Moving to Node 4:
- Node 4 has connections to nodes 0 and 5.
  - No 3-star can be formed with Node 4 as the center.

Proceeding to Node 5:
- Node 5 has connections to nodes 6, 4, 8, and 1.
  - No 3-star can be formed with Node 5 as the center.

Next is Node 6:
- Node 6 has connections to nodes 5, 7, and 0.
  - Two potential 3-stars can be formed using Node 6 as the center:
    <6, (5, 7, 0)>
    <6, (5, 0, 7)>

Moving to Node 7:
- Node 7 has connections to nodes 6, 9, 8, 0, and 1.
  - One potential 3-star can be formed using Node 7 as the center:
    <7, (6, 9, 0)>

Proceeding to Node 8:
- Node 8 has connections to nodes 5 and 7.
  - No 3-star can be formed with Node 8 as the center.

Finally, Node 9:
- Node 9 has connections to nodes 2, 1, and 7.
  - No 3-star can be formed with Node 9 as the center.

Combining all the unique 3-stars found as shown above, we have:
[<0, (6, 9, 4)>, <0, (6, 7, 4)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 0)>, <6, (5, 0, 7)>, <7, (6, 9, 0)>]
