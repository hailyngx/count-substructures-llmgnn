Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is at the center of a star with exactly 3 leaves connected to it. Let's go through each node to find these 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-stars since it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1: No 3-stars as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 2: No 3-stars since it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3: No 3-stars as it has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4: No 3-stars since it has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: <5, (15, 9, 10)>
- Node 6: No 3-stars as it has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7: No 3-stars since it has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: <8, (15, 19, 14)>
- Node 9: No 3-stars since it has 2 neighbors.
- Node 10: No 3-stars as it has 2 neighbors.
- Node 11: No 3-stars since it has 3 neighbors.
- Node 12: No 3-stars since it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 13: No 3-stars since it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 14: No 3-stars since it has 5 neighbors.
- Node 15: <15, (18, 8, 5)>
- Node 16: No 3-stars since it has 1 neighbor.
- Node 17: No 3-stars since it has 5 neighbors.
- Node 18: No 3-stars since it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 19: No 3-stars as it has 2 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars are <5, (15, 9, 10)> and <8, (15, 19, 14)>.
