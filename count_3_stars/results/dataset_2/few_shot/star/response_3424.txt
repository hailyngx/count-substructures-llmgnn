Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node
    - Node 0: degree 2
    - Node 1: degree 3
    - Node 2: degree 3
    - Node 3: degree 5
    - Node 4: degree 4
    - Node 5: degree 3
    - Node 6: degree 1
    - Node 7: degree 5
    - Node 8: degree 3
    - Node 9: degree 4
    - Node 10: degree 3
    - Node 11: degree 2
    - Node 12: degree 3
    - Node 13: degree 4
    - Node 14: degree 2
    - Node 15: degree 5
    - Node 16: degree 1
    - Node 17: degree 4
    - Node 18: degree 2
    - Node 19: degree 1

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars in the graph
    - Only nodes with degree 3 or higher can be part of a 3-star graph.
    - Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 17, and 18 have degree 3 or higher.

Step 3: Count the number of 3-star configurations
    - For each node with degree 3 or higher, check if it forms a 3-star.
    - Count the number of 3-stars by counting the number of unique configurations.
