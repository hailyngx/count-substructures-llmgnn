Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6)

Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step to build all possible 3-stars in this graph:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 5 is connected to 9, 8, 1, 4, 7. 
   - Node 7 is connected to 5, 9, 1, 2, 0.

2. Next, let's create all possible 3-stars using the two nodes found in step 1:
   - Using Node 5:
     - <5, (9, 8, 1)>
     - <5, (9, 1, 4)>
     - <5, (8, 1, 7)>
     - <5, (8, 4, 7)>
     - <5, (1, 4, 7)>

   - Using Node 7:
     - <7, (5, 9, 1)>
     - <7, (5, 1, 2)>
     - <7, (5, 2, 0)>
     - <7, (9, 1, 2)>
     - <7, (9, 2, 0)>

3. Combine all unique 3-stars found:
   - <5, (9, 8, 1)>, <5, (9, 1, 4)>, <5, (8, 1, 7)>, <5, (8, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>
   - <7, (5, 9, 1)>, <7, (5, 1, 2)>, <7, (5, 2, 0)>, <7, (9, 1, 2)>, <7, (9, 2, 0)>

4. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [10].
