Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we need to identify all instances where there is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:
- For simplicity, we will represent each 3-star as <Central Node, (Leaf 1, Leaf 2, Leaf 3)>

1. From the adjacency list:
    - Node 0: <0, (16, 13, 8)>
    - Node 1: <1, (16, 14, 10)>
    - Node 2: <2, (11, 13, 15)>
    - Node 3: <3, (17, 7, 10)>
    - Node 6: <6, (14, 15, 6)>
    - Node 7: <7, (9, 14, 19)>
    - Node 8: <8, (9, 15, 0)>
    - Node 10: <10, (5, 3, 1)>
    - Node 11: <11, (16, 18, 2)>
    - Node 13: <13, (2, 10, 0)>
    - Node 14: <14, (17, 6, 7)>
    - Node 15: <15, (16, 8, 6)>
    - Node 16: <16, (11, 0, 1)>
    - Node 17: <17, (14, 3, 18)>
    - Node 18: <18, (11, 17, 3)>
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (16, 13, 8)>, <1, (16, 14, 10)>, <2, (11, 13, 15)>, <3, (17, 7, 10)>, <6, (14, 15, 6)>, <7, (9, 14, 19)>, <8, (9, 15, 0)>, <10, (5, 3, 1)>, <11, (16, 18, 2)>, <13, (2, 10, 0)>, <14, (17, 6, 7)>, <15, (16, 8, 6)>, <16, (11, 0, 1)>, <17, (14, 3, 18)>, <18, (11, 17, 3)>
