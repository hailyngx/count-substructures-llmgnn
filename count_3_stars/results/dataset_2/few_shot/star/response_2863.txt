Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step.

1. Identify the central nodes:
   - There are 20 nodes in total: {0, 1, 2, ..., 19}.
   - Count the number of edges between each pair of nodes:
     - Node 0 has degree 4
     - Node 1 has degree 3
     - Node 2 has degree 2
     - Node 3 has degree 4
     - Node 4 has degree 3
     - Node 5 has degree 2
     - Node 6 has degree 1
     - Node 7 has degree 3
     - Node 8 has degree 5
     - Node 9 has degree 3
     - Node 10 has degree 5
     - Node 11 has degree 3
     - Node 12 has degree 3
     - Node 13 has degree 2
     - Node 14 has degree 2
     - Node 15 has degree 2
     - Node 16 has degree 3
     - Node 17 has degree 3
     - Node 18 has degree 4
     - Node 19 has degree 3
   
   The central nodes are: {0, 3, 8, 10, 18}

2. Find the leaves connected to each central node:
   - For node 0: {14, 3, 18, 8}
   - For node 3: {1, 0, 8, 18}
   - For node 8: {3, 0, 19, 16, 7}
   - For node 10: {9, 15, 7, 19, 16}
   - For node 18: {5, 9, 3, 0}

3. For each central node, determine the 3-stars:
   - For central node 0: <0, (14, 3, 8)> [1 unique 3-star]
   - For central node 3: <3, (1, 0, 18)> [1 unique 3-star]
   - For central node 8: <8, (3, 0, 16)>, <8, (3, 0, 7)> [2 unique 3-stars]
   - For central node 10: <10, (9, 15, 7)> [1 unique 3-star]
   - For central node 18: <18, (5, 9, 3)> [1 unique 3-star]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
