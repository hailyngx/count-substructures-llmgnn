Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by iterating through each node and checking for any 3-stars centered at that node. 

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (11, 16, 19)>
<1, (17, 19, 7)>
<2, (6, 9, 15)>
<3, (5, 18, 17)>
<4, (9, 8, 13)>
<5, (8, 3, 11)>
<6, (14, 2, 18)>
<7, (1, 17, 11)>
<8, (13, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 2, 16)>
<10, (16, 18, 0)>
<11, (13, 7, 5)>
<12, (6, 14, 5)>
<13, (8, 4, 11)>
<14, (6, 12, 5)>
<15, (4, 2, 15)>
<16, (9, 0, 10)>
<17, (1, 19, 18)>
<18, (6, 17, 3)>
<19, (1, 17, 0)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
