Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Let's analyze the graph and find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: <0, (6, 3, 7)>
- Node 1: <1, (6, 9, 2)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 4: <4, (6, 9, 3)>
- Node 5: <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 6: <6, (1, 7, 4)>
- Node 7: <7, (6, 9, 1)>
- Node 8: <8, (9, 5)>
- Node 9: <9, (8, 4, 1)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars we found: [10].
