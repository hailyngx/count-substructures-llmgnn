Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From node 0: <0, (9, 4, 8)>  
2. From node 1: <1, (5, 7, 9)>  
3. From node 2: No 3-star  
4. From node 3: No 3-star  
5. From node 4: No 3-star  
6. From node 5: <5, (9, 1, 6)>  
7. From node 6: No 3-star  
8. From node 7: No 3-star  
9. From node 8: No 3-star  
10. From node 9: <9, (5, 1, 8)>, <9, (5, 3, 2)>, <9, (5, 6, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (9, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (9, 1, 6)>, <9, (5, 1, 8)>, <9, (5, 3, 2)>.
