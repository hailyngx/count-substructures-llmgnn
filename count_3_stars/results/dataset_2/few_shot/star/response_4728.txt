The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 11, 7, 10, 4, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 11, and node 14
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 11, 14, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 12, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 11, 4, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 5, and node 10
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 8, 0, 13, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, 13, and node 5
Node 12 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 11, 0, and node 10
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 7, 10, and node 5

Response:
The task is to count the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 

First, let's identify all the 3-stars:
<0, (11, 7, 10)>
<1, (6, 3, 11)>
<2, (9, 5, 14)>
<3, (6, 1, 11)>
<4, (0, 12, 5)>
<5, (2, 8, 14)>
<6, (9, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 14, 0)>
<8, (6, 5, 10)>
<9, (2, 6, 12)>
<10, (8, 0, 13)>
<11, (1, 3, 0)>
<12, (9, 4, 12)>
<13, (6, 11, 0)>
<14, (2, 7, 10)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. Based on the above list, we can see there are 14 unique 3-stars. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [14].
