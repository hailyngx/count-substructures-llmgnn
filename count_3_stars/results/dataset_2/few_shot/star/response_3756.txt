Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 0) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 10) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (3, 8) (3, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 12, 14, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 8, 14, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 12, 8, 13, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 14
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 13
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 10, 2, and node 11
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 12, and node 10
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 11, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 14, 1, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 7, 6, 12, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 2, 10, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 9, 2, 0, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, 1, 13, and node 10

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<4, (7, 9, 13)>
<7, (4, 12, 10)>
<6, (9, 5, 10)>
<9, (4, 6, 14)>
<12, (7, 2, 10)>
<2, (6, 12, 8)>
<8, (5, 11, 3)>
<14, (9, 0, 13)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
