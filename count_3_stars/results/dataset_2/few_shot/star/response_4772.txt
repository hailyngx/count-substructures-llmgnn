Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

In this graph, the potential center nodes are nodes 0 to 29, excluding node 22 because it is not connected to any other nodes.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For each potential center node, we will check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

After analyzing the graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<4, (27, 7, 9)>
<5, (28, 18, 24)>
<8, (15, 26, 25)>
<11, (21, 3, 24)>
<17, (0, 12, 25)>
<18, (7, 3, 26)>
<25, (12, 14, 17)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
