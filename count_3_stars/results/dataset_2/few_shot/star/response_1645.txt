Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify every instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes one by one to find the 3-stars.

1. **Node 0**: (0, 8, 2, 10) is not a 3-star.
   
2. **Node 1**: (1, 6, 3, 12) is a 3-star. <1, (6, 3, 12)>
   
3. **Node 2**: (2, 8, 12, 11) is a 3-star. <2, (8, 12, 11)>
   
4. **Node 3**: (3, 6, 1, 10) is not a 3-star.
   
5. **Node 4**: (4, 7, 8, 10) is not a 3-star.
   
6. **Node 5**: (5, 9, 14, 8) is not a 3-star.
   
7. **Node 6**: (6, 1, 10, 12) is a 3-star. <6, (1, 10, 12)>
   
8. **Node 7**: (7, 9, 1, 4) is not a 3-star.
   
9. **Node 8**: (8, 5, 4, 7) is not a 3-star.
   
10. **Node 9**: (9, 5, 14, 7) is not a 3-star.
   
11. **Node 10**: (10, 6, 3, 4) is not a 3-star.
   
12. **Node 11**: (11, 1, 4, 7) is not a 3-star.
   
13. **Node 12**: (12, 6, 1, 11) is a 3-star. <12, (6, 1, 11)>
   
14. **Node 13**: (13, 9, 14) is not a 3-star.
   
15. **Node 14**: (14, 9, 1, 13) is not a 3-star.

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (6, 3, 12)>, <2, (8, 12, 11)>, <6, (1, 10, 12)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
