Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Check each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. 
2. For each node, check its neighbors to form potential 3-stars with the current node as the center.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Let's start counting:

For Node 0:
- Possible 3-stars: <0, (8, 13, 14)>, <0, (8, 13, 4)>
- Total: 2

For Node 1:
- Possible 3-stars: <1, (5, 13, 7)>, <1, (8, 13, 7)>, <1, (8, 13, 2)>, <1, (8, 14, 7)>, <1, (13, 3, 0)>, <1, (13, 3, 10)>, <1, (13, 0, 14)>, <1, (13, 0, 4)>, <1, (13, 12, 11)>, <1, (14, 6, 7)>
- Total: 10

For Node 2:
- Possible 3-stars: <2, (11, 6, 1)>, <2, (11, 6, 12)>, <2, (11, 6, 4)>
- Total: 3

For Node 3:
- Possible 3-stars: <3, (9, 13, 10)>
- Total: 1

For Node 4:
- Possible 3-stars: <4, (9, 0, 14)>, <4, (2, 11, 6)>
- Total: 2

For Node 5:
- Possible 3-stars: <5, (13, 1, 7)>
- Total: 1

For Node 6:
- Possible 3-stars: <6, (10, 11, 14)>
- Total: 1

For Node 7:
- Possible 3-stars: <7, (5, 13, 8)>
- Total: 1

For Node 8:
- Possible 3-stars: <8, (0, 13, 12)>
- Total: 1

For Node 9:
- Possible 3-stars: <9, (4, 14, 0)>
- Total: 1

For Node 10:
- Possible 3-stars: <10, (3, 13, 11)>
- Total: 1

For Node 11:
- Possible 3-stars: <11, (2, 6, 12)>
- Total: 1

For Node 12:
- Possible 3-stars: <12, (8, 13, 11)>
- Total: 1

For Node 13:
- Possible 3-stars: <13, (5, 12, 0)>
- Total: 1

For Node 14:
- Possible 3-stars: <14, (9, 0, 6)>
- Total: 1

Finally, let's sum up the total number of unique 3-stars we found:
