Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. 

1. Node 5 forms a 3-star with the leaves 9, 6, and 0: <5, (9, 6, 0)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with the leaves 5, 7, and 1: <9, (5, 7, 1)>
3. Node 7 forms a 3-star with the leaves 5, 11, and 6: <7, (5, 11, 6)>
4. Node 1 forms a 3-star with the leaves 9, 3, and 14: <1, (9, 3, 14)>
5. Node 3 forms a 3-star with the leaves 4, 13, and 12: <3, (4, 13, 12)>
6. Node 6 forms a 3-star with the leaves 5, 8, and 10: <6, (5, 8, 10)>
7. Node 10 forms a 3-star with the leaves 5, 13, and 11: <10, (5, 13, 11)>
8. Node 11 forms a 3-star with the leaves 7, 14, and 2: <11, (7, 14, 2)>
9. Node 0 forms a 3-star with the leaves 5, 13, and 2: <0, (5, 13, 2)>
10. Node 12 forms a 3-star with the leaves 3, 0, and 14: <12, (3, 0, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
