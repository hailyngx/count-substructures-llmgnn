Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1)

Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that have three connections to other nodes.

Let's list the nodes with their connections:

Node 0: (5, 6, 2, 1)
Node 1: (5, 6, 7, 8, 2, 0)
Node 2: (9, 4, 1, 3, 0)
Node 3: (9, 7, 8, 2)
Node 4: (7, 8, 2)
Node 5: (9, 6, 1, 0)
Node 6: (5, 1, 0)
Node 7: (4, 3, 1)
Node 8: (9, 4, 3, 1)
Node 9: (5, 8, 2, 3)

From these connections, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<9, (8, 2, 3)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (9, 4, 1)>
<3, (9, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
