Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 9, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, and node 3

Response:
The 3-star structures in the given graph can be found by identifying the central node and its three edges. We can then count how many such structures exist in the given graph. 

Here are the steps to find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify the central node (denoted by the node number). 

2. Find the three nodes connected to the central node. 

3. List the unique 3-stars found.

Let's go through the graph and identify the 3-star structures:

- 3-stars centered at node 0: <0, (4, 6, 9)> and <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- 3-stars centered at node 1: <1, (4, 5, 8)> and <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- 3-stars centered at node 2: <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- 3-stars centered at node 3: <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- 3-stars centered at node 4: <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- 3-stars centered at node 5: <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- 3-stars centered at node 6: None
- 3-stars centered at node 7: None
- 3-stars centered at node 8: None
- 3-stars centered at node 9: None

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [7]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>
