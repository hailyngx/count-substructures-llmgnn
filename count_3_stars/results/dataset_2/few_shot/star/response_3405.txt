Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. We will go through each node and its neighbors to find any 3-stars.

Starting from node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 6, 14, 5, 13.
  - No 3-star with center at node 0.
  
Moving to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 13, 8.
  - No 3-star with center at node 1.
  
Checking node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 10.
  - No 3-star with center at node 2.
  
Examining node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 10, 12.
  - No 3-star with center at node 3.
  
Investigating node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 12, 11.
  - <4, (7, 8, 12)> [1 unique 3-star]
  
Looking at node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to node 0.
  - No 3-star with center at node 5.
  
Moving to node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 14, 0, 13.
  - <6, (9, 14, 13)> [1 unique 3-star]
  
Checking node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 12, 0, 10, 8.
  - <7, (4, 12, 10)> [1 unique 3-star]
  
Examining node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 9, 1, 10.
  - <8, (4, 7, 9)> [1 unique 3-star]
  
Looking at node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 11, 14, 10, 1.
  - <9, (6, 8, 10)> [1 unique 3-star]
  
Moving to node 10:
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 9, 3, 8, 12, 2.
  - <10, (7, 9, 12)> [1 unique 3-star]
  
Checking node 11:
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 9, 12.
  - No 3-star with center at node 11.
  
Investigating node 12:
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 3, 10, 11.
  - <12, (4, 7, 10)> [1 unique 3-star]
  
Looking at node 13:
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 0, 14.
  - No 3-star with center at node 13.
  
Examining node 14:
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 0, 13.
  - No 3-star with center at node 14.
  
We have identified all the unique 3-stars in the given graph. There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
