Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three leaves, we will look for nodes with three neighbors.

Here are the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 18, 5, 11)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 8, 1, 6)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 2, 10, 18)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 14, 13, 1)
- Node 11 (neighbors: 3, 1, 5)
- Node 15 (neighbors: 16, 19, 6)
- Node 17 (neighbors: 14)

Now we will count the number of 3-stars in the graph. We will list the unique 3-stars using the format <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>:

<0, (18, 5, 11)>
<2, (8, 1, 6)>
<4, (2, 10, 18)>
<7, (14, 13, 1)>
<11, (3, 1, 5)>
<15, (16, 19, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
