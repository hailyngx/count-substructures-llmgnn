Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 14) (16, 10) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 12) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 18) (7, 8) (7, 15) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 12) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 1) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 8) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 17) (3, 10) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (10, 16) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 1) (18, 6) (18, 17) (18, 15) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 10)

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 are all connected to at least three other nodes.

Now, let's list down the unique 3-stars:
<0, (8, 1, 14)>
<1, (12, 0, 10)>
<2, (11, 5, 4)>
<3, (9, 6, 4)>
<4, (8, 3, 2)>
<5, (9, 13, 2)>
<6, (3, 18, 12)>
<7, (8, 15, 11)>
<8, (4, 14, 0)>
<9, (5, 13, 3)>
<10, (16, 14, 3)>
<11, (14, 2, 15)>
<12, (6, 17, 2)>
<13, (9, 5, 7)>
<14, (11, 16, 8)>
<15, (11, 7, 18)>
<16, (14, 10, 1)>
<17, (3, 12, 18)>
<18, (6, 17, 15)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
