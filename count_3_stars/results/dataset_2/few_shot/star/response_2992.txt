Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. For each node, identify the 3-stars that have that node as the center:
   - Node 0: None
   - Node 1: <1, (16, 8, 5)> (1, 10, 4) (1, 5, 12)
   - Node 2: None
   - Node 3: None
   - Node 4: <4, (11, 2, 1)>
   - Node 5: <5, (17, 13, 12)> (5, 1, 12)
   - Node 6: <6, (11, 0, 15)> (6, 19, 12) (6, 15, 0)
   - Node 7: None
   - Node 8: None
   - Node 9: None
   - Node 10: <10, (15, 7, 1)>
   - Node 11: <11, (9, 6, 8)> (11, 4, 1)
   - Node 12: <12, (2, 5, 13)> (12, 19, 3) (12, 19, 6) (12, 3, 2)
   - Node 13: None
   - Node 14: None
   - Node 15: None
   - Node 16: None
   - Node 17: None
   - Node 18: None
   - Node 19: <19, (18, 13, 3)> (19, 13, 18) (19, 13, 5) (19, 6, 12) (19, 12, 3)

2. Count the unique 3-stars found:
   - <1, (16, 8, 5)>
   - <1, (10, 4, 5)>
   - <1, (5, 12, 1)>
   - <4, (11, 2, 1)>
   - <5, (17, 13, 12)>
   - <5, (1, 12, 5)>
   - <6, (11, 0, 15)>
   - <6, (19, 12, 6)>
   - <6, (15, 0, 6)>
   - <10, (15, 7, 1)>
   - <11, (9, 6, 8)>
   - <11, (4, 1, 11)>
   - <12, (2, 5, 13)>
   - <12, (19, 3, 12)>
   - <12, (19, 6, 12)>
   - <12, (3, 2, 12)>
   - <19, (18, 13, 3)>
   - <19, (13, 18, 19)>
   - <19, (13, 5, 19)>
   - <19, (6, 12, 19)>
   - <19, (12, 3, 19)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [21]

Therefore, the final answer is [21].
