Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: <0, (9, 13, 14)>
2. Node 1: <1, (8, 11, 14)>
3. Node 2: <2, (8, 6, 13)>
4. Node 3: No 3-star (since it is only connected to 3 nodes)
5. Node 4: <4, (8, 14, 0)>
6. Node 5: <5, (9, 6, 11)>
7. Node 6: <6, (5, 10, 2)>
8. Node 7: No 3-star (since it is only connected to 2 nodes)
9. Node 8: <8, (13, 4, 2)>
10. Node 9: <9, (5, 10, 0)>
11. Node 10: No 3-star (since it is only connected to 2 nodes)
12. Node 11: <11, (5, 14, 1)>
13. Node 12: <12, (9, 13, 2)>
14. Node 13: <13, (8, 12, 2)>
15. Node 14: No 3-star (since it is only connected to 3 nodes)

Count of 3-stars: [7]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 13, 14)>
<1, (8, 11, 14)>
<2, (8, 6, 13)>
<4, (8, 14, 0)>
<5, (9, 6, 11)>
<6, (5, 10, 2)>
<12, (9, 13, 2)>
