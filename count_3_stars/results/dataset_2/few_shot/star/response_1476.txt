Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. From the given adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with degree 3 are: 0, 2, 6, 8, and 9. These nodes can potentially be the central node of a 3-star.

2. For each of these nodes, we will check if they are connected to exactly 3 other nodes to form a 3-star.

   - For Node 0: (0, 9, 7, 8) - does not form a 3-star as it has 4 edges.
   - For Node 2: (2, 5, 9, 8) - forms a 3-star <2, (5, 9, 8)>.
   - For Node 6: (6, 9, 4, 1) - does not form a 3-star as it has 4 edges.
   - For Node 8: (8, 5, 4, 0) - forms a 3-star <8, (5, 4, 0)>.
   - For Node 9: (9, 6, 2, 7) - does not form a 3-star as it has 4 edges.

3. Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
   - <2, (5, 9, 8)>
   - <8, (5, 4, 0)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
