Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0

The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 4, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 8)>
