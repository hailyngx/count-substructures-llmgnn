Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 14, 5, 8, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 11, 7, 14, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, 13, 11, and node 10
Node 5 is connected to node 12, 13, 2, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 11, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 11, 10, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 12, 6, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 10 is connected to node 7, 0, 5, and node 4
Node 11 is connected to node 3, 7, 6, 13, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 13, 5, and node 8
Node 13 is connected to node 12, 0, 5, 4, and node 11
Node 14 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list and the given graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars: 
<0, (14, 10, 13)>
<1, (3, 6, 2)>
<1, (2, 14, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 11, 7)>
<4, (6, 2, 13)>
<5, (12, 2, 13)>
<6, (1, 11, 8)>
<7, (3, 11, 10)>
<8, (7, 12, 6)>
<9, (3, 8, 11)>
<10, (7, 0, 5)>
<11, (3, 7, 4)>
<12, (13, 5, 8)>
<13, (12, 0, 5)>
<14, (3, 0, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
