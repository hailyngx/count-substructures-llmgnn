Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the adjacency list, we can identify all possible 3-stars as follows:
- Node 0: (2, 14, 10)
- Node 1: (29, 14, 12)
- Node 3: (25, 18, 15)
- Node 4: (13, 23, 20)
- Node 5: (16, 15, 29)
- Node 7: (24, 19, 27)
- Node 8: (22, 9, 12)
- Node 9: (22, 28, 17)
- Node 10: (23, 13, 20)
- Node 12: (8, 26, 1)
- Node 13: (28, 23, 20)
- Node 14: (0, 1, 29)
- Node 15: (27, 5, 29)
- Node 16: (11, 26, 5)
- Node 17: (9, 21, 24)
- Node 18: (25, 22, 0)
- Node 19: (27, 7, 15)
- Node 20: (28, 10, 13)
- Node 21: (6, 26, 17)
- Node 22: (18, 24, 8)
- Node 23: (10, 13, 12)
- Node 24: (17, 7, 22)
- Node 25: (3, 18, 15)
- Node 26: (16, 21, 7)
- Node 27: (15, 7, 19)
- Node 28: (20, 13, 9)
- Node 29: (15, 1, 5)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 

Final answer: [28]
