Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, the 3-stars can be counted using the definition provided. 

The key observation to make is that for a 3-star to exist, the center node should be connected to exactly 3 other nodes. We can then list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<6, (5, 1, 2)>
<7, (4, 3, -)>
<8, (4, 5, 1)>
<9, (4, 2, 3)>
<0, (9, 2, 1)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are a total of [5] 3-stars.
