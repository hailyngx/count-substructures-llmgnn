Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 2, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Let's list down the possible 3-stars by examining each node and its connections:
1. Node 0: (1, 2, 6), (1, 6, 0), (2, 0, 6)
2. Node 1: (0, 2, 6), (2, 8, 5), (8, 5, 7), (5, 1, 6)
3. Node 2: (0, 6, 1), (0, 1, 5), (1, 5, 8), (5, 8, 7)
4. Node 3: (6, 4, 9), (4, 9, 7), (9, 7, 3)
5. Node 4: (6, 9, 7), (6, 7, 3), (9, 3, 4)
6. Node 5: (1, 6, 0), (1, 0, 2), (0, 2, 7), (2, 7, 8)
7. Node 6: (0, 1, 5), (0, 5, 8), (1, 8, 7), (8, 7, 5)
8. Node 7: (3, 9, 4), (3, 4, 6), (4, 6, 7)
9. Node 8: (5, 7, 9)
10. Node 9: (7, 5, 1)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (6, 4, 9)>
<4, (6, 9, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 0)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (3, 9, 4)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (7, 5, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
