Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given information, the potential central nodes (centers) would be: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now, let's examine each potential central node to check if it has exactly three neighboring nodes connected to it.

1. Central node 0 has (17, 20, 4) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <0, (17, 20, 4)> is a 3-star.

2. Central node 1 has (8, 9, 19) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <1, (8, 9, 19)> is a 3-star.

3. Central node 3 has (23, 11, 27) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <3, (23, 11, 27)> is a 3-star.

4. Central node 4 has (17, 20, 0) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <4, (17, 20, 0)> is a 3-star.

5. Central node 5 has (28, 26, 18) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <5, (28, 26, 18)> is a 3-star.

6. Central node 6 has (14, 12, 29) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <6, (14, 12, 29)> is a 3-star.

7. Central node 7 has (2, 9, 26) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <7, (2, 9, 26)> is a 3-star.

8. Central node 8 has (13, 1, 10) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <8, (13, 1, 10)> is a 3-star.

9. Central node 9 has (22, 28, 7) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <9, (22, 28, 7)> is a 3-star.

10. Central node 11 has (22, 15, 3) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <11, (22, 15, 3)> is a 3-star.

11. Central node 12 has (14, 0, 19) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <12, (14, 0, 19)> is a 3-star.

12. Central node 16 has (23, 15, 28) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <16, (23, 15, 28)> is a 3-star.

13. Central node 17 has (25, 0, 4) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <17, (25, 0, 4)> is a 3-star.

14. Central node 18 has (0, 5, 26) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <18, (0, 5, 26)> is a 3-star.

15. Central node 19 has (1, 27, 12) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <19, (1, 27, 12)> is a 3-star.

16. Central node 20 has (25, 15, 4) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <20, (25, 15, 4)> is a 3-star.

17. Central node 21 has (14, 29, 24) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <21, (14, 29, 24)> is a 3-star.

18. Central node 22 has (9, 11, 15) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <22, (9, 11, 15)> is a 3-star.

19. Central node 23 has (27, 3, 16) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <23, (27, 3, 16)> is a 3-star.

20. Central node 24 has (20, 21, 10) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <24, (20, 21, 10)> is a 3-star.

21. Central node 25 has (17, 20, 28) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <25, (17, 20, 28)> is a 3-star.

22. Central node 26 has (5, 7, 18) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <26, (5, 7, 18)> is a 3-star.

23. Central node 27 has (23, 19, 16) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <27, (23, 19, 16)> is a 3-star.

24. Central node 28 has (25, 16, 9) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <28, (25, 16, 9)> is a 3-star.

25. Central node 29 has (21, 16, 12) as its neighboring nodes. Thus, <29, (21, 16, 12)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 26. 
So, the final answer is [26].
