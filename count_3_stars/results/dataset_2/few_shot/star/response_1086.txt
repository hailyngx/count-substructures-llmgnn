Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 12) (15, 10) (15, 9) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 4) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 12) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 19) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 4) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 13) (16, 3) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 0) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 9) (12, 3) (12, 18) (7, 3) (7, 18) (7, 8) (5, 2) (5, 18) (6, 8) (6, 13) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 0) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) (1, 0)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars, which consist of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Below are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<2, (17, 18, 5)>
<3, (7, 16, 12)>
<4, (17, 10, 0)>
<5, (2, 18, '')>
<6, (8, 13, '')>
<7, (3, 18, 8)>
<8, (9, 10, 6)>
<9, (15, 8, 19)>
<10, (15, 8, 4)>
<11, (14, 13, '')>
<12, (3, 18, '')>
<13, (11, 0, 6)>
<14, (17, 11, 16)>
<15, (10, 9, '')>
<16, (14, 2, 0)>
<17, (14, 19, 4)>
<18, (19, 5, 7)>
<19, (17, 18, 9)>

As we have identified all the 3-stars, we can now count them by simply counting the number of unique combinations. There are 18 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [18].
