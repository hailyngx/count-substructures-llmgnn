Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Start by determining the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 9, and 18, forming a 3-star <3, (15, 9, 18)>
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 15, 9, and 11, forming a 3-star <5, (15, 9, 11)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 17, 16, and 10, forming a 3-star <7, (17, 16, 10)>
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 11, forming a 3-star <9, (3, 5, 11)>
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 14, 7, and 16, forming a 3-star <10, (14, 7, 16)>
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 12, forming a 3-star <14, (6, 1, 12)>
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 0, and 12, forming a 3-star <15, (3, 0, 12)>
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 19, 4, and 7, forming a 3-star <17, (19, 4, 7)>
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 3, 0, and 13, forming a 3-star <18, (3, 0, 13)>

2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
We have identified 9 unique 3-stars.
