Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 8, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star configuration. 

Let's start by examining each node and its connections to find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0:
<0, (7, 8, 6)>
<0, (7, 2, 9)>
<0, (8, 6, 9)>

2. Node 1:
<1, (3, 5, 8)>

3. Node 2:
No 3-stars as a central node.

4. Node 3:
<3, (7, 1, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>

5. Node 4:
<4, (8, 9, 5)>

6. Node 5:
<5, (4, 7, 6)>
<5, (7, 1, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>

7. Node 6:
No 3-stars as a central node.

8. Node 7:
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (2, 0, 9)>

9. Node 8:
No 3-stars as a central node.

10. Node 9:
<9, (4, 7, 3)>
<9, (4, 8, 0)>
<9, (7, 3, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 8, 6)>
<0, (7, 2, 9)>
<0, (8, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (7, 1, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (8, 9, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 6)>
<5, (7, 1, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (2, 0, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 3)>
<9, (4, 8, 0)>
