Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify them step by step:

1. Node 0: Not a center of any 3-star.
2. Node 1: Forms a 3-star <1, (0, 4, 5)>.
3. Node 2: Not a center of any 3-star.
4. Node 3: Not a center of any 3-star.
5. Node 4: Forms a 3-star <4, (1, 5, 12)>.
6. Node 5: Forms a 3-star <5, (1, 4, 11)>.
7. Node 6: Forms a 3-star <6, (1, 7, 9)>.
8. Node 7: Not a center of any 3-star.
9. Node 8: Not a center of any 3-star.
10. Node 9: Forms a 3-star <9, (6, 11, 2)>.
11. Node 10: Not a center of any 3-star.
12. Node 11: Forms a 3-star <11, (9, 13, 14)>.
13. Node 12: Not a center of any 3-star.
14. Node 13: Forms a 3-star <13, (6, 4, 11)>.
15. Node 14: Not a center of any 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<1, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 12)>, <5, (1, 4, 11)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 11, 2)>, <11, (9, 13, 14)>, and <13, (6, 4, 11)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
