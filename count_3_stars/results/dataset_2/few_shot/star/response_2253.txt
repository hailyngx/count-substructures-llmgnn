Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (16, 10, 18)>
<1, (12, 8, _)>
<2, (3, 15, _)>
<3, (2, 19, 5)>
<4, (10, 17, _)>
<5, (3, 7, 16)>
<6, (17, 18, 19)>
<7, (19, 5, _)>
<8, (1, _, _)>
<9, (10, _, _)>
<10, (9, 0, 4)>
<11, (18, 17, _)>
<12, (15, 1, _)>
<13, (10, 6, 19)>
<14, (16, 10, 19)>
<15, (12, 2, _)>
<16, (0, 17, 14)>
<17, (16, 11, 6)>
<18, (0, 11, 6)>
<19, (3, 7, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [19].
