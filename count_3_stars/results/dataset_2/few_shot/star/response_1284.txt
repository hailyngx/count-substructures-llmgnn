Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node:
- Node 3 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes: 0, 4, and 14.
- Node 4 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes: 12, 0, and 10.
- Node 6 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes: 5, 10, and 12.
- Node 12 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes: 6, 4, and it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 13 and Node 7 do not have exactly 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<3, (0, 4, 14)>
<4, (12, 0, 10)>
<6, (5, 10, 12)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3.
