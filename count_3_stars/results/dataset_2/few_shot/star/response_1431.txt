Response:
Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

<0, (25, 2, 23)>
<1, (16, 14, -)>
<2, (13, 12, 0)>
<3, (21, 28, 29)>
<4, (14, 6, 17)>
<5, (25, 8, -)>
<6, (20, 4, 23)>
<7, (20, 24, -)>
<8, (20, 25, 5)>
<9, (13, 18, 27)>
<10, (18, 3, 12)>
<11, (21, 29, -)>
<12, (2, 24, 10)>
<13, (22, 2, 9)>
<14, (4, 1, -)>
<15, (23, 17, 28)>
<16, (1, 23, 29)>
<17, (15, 4, 28)>
<18, (22, 9, 10)>
<19, (17, 6, -)>
<20, (7, 25, 8)>
<21, (3, 11, -)>
<22, (13, 18, 27)>
<23, (15, 16, 0)>
<24, (7, 28, 12)>
<25, (20, 5, 8)>
<26, (27, 17, -)>
<27, (22, 9, 26)>
<28, (15, 3, 17)>
<29, (3, 11, 16)>

After identifying all the 3-stars, we count them to find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
