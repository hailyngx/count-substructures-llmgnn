Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (9, 5, 3)>
<1, (4, 8, 2)>
<2, (6, 9, 1)>
<3, (9, 7, 5)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 0, 3)>
<6, (9, 5, 2)>
<7, (4, 3, 8)>
<8, (9, 4, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
