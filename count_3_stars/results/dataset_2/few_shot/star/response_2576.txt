Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 5, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 6, 1, 4), (0, 1, 4, 7)
2. Node 1: (1, 3, 2, 5), (1, 3, 4, 5)
3. Node 3: (3, 1, 4, 5), (3, 1, 2, 5)
4. Node 4: (4, 3, 0, 5), (4, 3, 5, 9)
5. Node 5: (5, 1, 3, 2), (5, 3, 4, 7)
6. Node 6: (6, 0, 1, 4), (6, 1, 8, 9)
7. Node 8: (8, 6, 1, 2), (8, 6, 2, 7)

This gives us a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [7].

<0, (6, 1, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 2, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (3, 0, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 2)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (6, 1, 2)>, <8, (6, 2, 7)>
