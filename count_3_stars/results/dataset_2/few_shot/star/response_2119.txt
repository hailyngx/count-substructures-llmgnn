Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph based on the definition provided. We will then count the total number of such 3-stars.

The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<0, (13, 6, 12)>
<1, (13, 9, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 6)>
<3, (10, 2, 5)>
<4, (5, 2, 11)>
<5, (3, 13, 6)>
<6, (5, 7, 2)>
<7, (8, 6, 11)>
<8, (1, 13, 2)>
<9, (1, 8, 7)>
<10, (3, 5, 9)>
<11, (8, 7, 4)>
<12, (0, 9, 10)>
<13, (1, 8, 5)>
<14, (2, 10, 14)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. We have a total of 14 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
