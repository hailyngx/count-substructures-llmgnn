Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars.

From the adjacency list provided:
- Node 1, 15, 18 form a 3-star with center at Node 1. <1, (15, 18)>
- Node 1, 2, 3 form a 3-star with center at Node 1. <1, (2, 3)>
- Node 11, 12, 19 form a 3-star with center at Node 11. <11, (12, 19)>
- Node 15, 17, 18 form a 3-star with center at Node 15. <15, (17, 18)>
- Node 1, 5, 17 form a 3-star with center at Node 1. <1, (5, 17)>
- Node 1, 13, 15 form a 3-star with center at Node 1. <1, (13, 15)>
- Node 3, 5, 17 form a 3-star with center at Node 3. <3, (5, 17)>
- Node 6, 11, 14 form a 3-star with center at Node 6. <6, (11, 14)>
- Node 8, 11, 16 form a 3-star with center at Node 8. <8, (11, 16)>
- Node 1, 15, 17 form a 3-star with center at Node 1. <1, (15, 17)>
- Node 2, 3, 17 form a 3-star with center at Node 2. <2, (3, 17)>
- Node 10, 14, 19 form a 3-star with center at Node 10. <10, (14, 19)>
- Node 3, 9, 13 form a 3-star with center at Node 3. <3, (9, 13)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (15, 18)>, <1, (2, 3)>, <11, (12, 19)>, <15, (17, 18)>, <1, (5, 17)>, <1, (13, 15)>, <3, (5, 17)>, <6, (11, 14)>, <8, (11, 16)>, <1, (15, 17)>, <2, (3, 17)>, <10, (14, 19)>
