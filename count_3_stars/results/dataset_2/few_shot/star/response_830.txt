Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:
1. Look at each node in the graph.
2. For each node, check all the connected nodes and see if there is a 3-star centered at the current node.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<4, (19, 23, 11)>
<7, (28, 18, 9)>
<14, (17, 6, 24)>
<17, (14, 12, 6)>
<5, (6, 18, 27)>
<6, (14, 5, 3)>
<18, (7, 26, 23)>
<19, (4, 26, 22)>
<9, (7, 22, 2)>
<22, (19, 9, 16)>
<21, (9, 10, 11)>
<20, (29, 13, 3)>
<27, (5, 13, 8)>
<12, (17, 8, 26)>
<24, (14, 21, 25)>
<16, (22, 1, 0)>
<3, (6, 20, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
