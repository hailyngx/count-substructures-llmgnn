Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by identifying all such 3-stars:

<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (9, 6, 0)>
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<7, (9, 1, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars by adding up the unique 3-stars found above.
