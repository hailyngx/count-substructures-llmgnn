Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graph patterns in the given graph.

The central node (center) of each 3-star can be determined by finding a node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By examining the adjacency list, we can find the central nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 2, 5, and 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 10, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 14, and 13.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 12, 0, and 14.

Next, we can list out the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
1. <1, (3, 2, 5)>
2. <1, (3, 2, 0)>
3. <1, (3, 5, 0)>
4. <1, (2, 5, 0)>
5. <3, (1, 10, 9)>
6. <9, (1, 3, 7)>
7. <10, (3, 14, 13)>
8. <11, (12, 0, 14)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
