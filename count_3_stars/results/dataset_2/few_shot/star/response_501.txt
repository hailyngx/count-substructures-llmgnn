Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes would be the centers of potential 3-stars in the graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, the potential central nodes are: 2, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18.

Now let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 2: (2, 6, 11), (2, 6, 18)
- Node 9: (9, 11, 18)
- Node 11: (11, 0, 2), (11, 0, 9)
- Node 14: (14, 0, 3), (14, 0, 16)
- Node 16: (16, 1, 5)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (6, 11, 18)>
<9, (11, 18)>
<11, (0, 2, 9)>
<14, (0, 3, 16)>
<16, (1, 5)>
