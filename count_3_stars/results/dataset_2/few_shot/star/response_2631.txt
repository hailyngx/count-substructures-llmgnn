Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 13, and 10, forming <0, (9, 13, 10)>.
- Node 1 is not part of any 3-star as it is not the central node.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 11 and 12, forming <2, (11, 12, 4)>.
- Node 3 is not part of any 3-star as it is not the central node.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 9, forming <4, (5, 9, 13)>.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9 and 6, forming <5, (9, 6, 4)>.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 13, forming <6, (5, 13, 7)>.
- Node 7 is not part of any 3-star as it is not the central node.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9 and 13, forming <8, (9, 13, 3)>.
- Node 9 is not part of any 3-star as it is not the central node.
- Node 10 is not part of any 3-star as it is not the central node.
- Node 11 is not part of any 3-star as it is not the central node.
- Node 12 is not part of any 3-star as it is not the central node.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 9 and 8, forming <13, (9, 8, 4)>.
- Node 14 is not part of any 3-star as it is not the central node.

Therefore, we have identified 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the final answer is [6].
