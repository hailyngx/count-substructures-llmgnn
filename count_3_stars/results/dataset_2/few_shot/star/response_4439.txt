Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 6) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 12) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 6) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 8) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 10, 13, 14, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 11, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 11, 13, 14, 7, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 12, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 11, 4, 0, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 10, 13, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 11, 13, 4, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 14, and node 3
Node 10 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 13
Node 11 is connected to node 3, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 14, 3, and node 6
Node 13 is connected to node 10, 8, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, 12, and node 2

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern:
- Nodes 5, 1, and 2 each have 3 edges, forming 3-star patterns.
- Let's represent these 3-star patterns: <5, (9, 2, 1)>, <2, (5, 9, 14)>, <1, (5, 11, 8)>.

Now, let's count the number of 3-star patterns in the given graph:
- For each 3-star pattern above, there is only one corresponding 3-star in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 
So, the unique 3-stars found are <5, (9, 2, 1)>, <2, (5, 9, 14)>, and <1, (5, 11, 8)>.
