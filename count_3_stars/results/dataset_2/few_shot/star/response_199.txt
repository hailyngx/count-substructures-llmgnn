Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 7

Response:
Let's first find all the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Central node 0: (0, 5, 2, 7), (0, 5, 4, 3)
2. Central node 1: (1, 5, 6, 2)
3. Central node 2: (2, 4, 1, 3)
4. Central node 3: (3, 5, 6, 4), (3, 5, 8, 0), (3, 4, 2, 0)
5. Central node 4: (4, 9, 8, 2)
6. Central node 5: (5, 9, 1, 3)
7. Central node 6: (6, 9, 1, 3)
8. Central node 7: (7, 9, 8, 0)

Total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [8]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 2, 7)>, <0, (5, 4, 3)>, <1, (5, 6, 2)>, <2, (4, 1, 3)>, <3, (5, 6, 4)>, <3, (5, 8, 0)>, <3, (4, 2, 0)>, <4, (9, 8, 2)>
