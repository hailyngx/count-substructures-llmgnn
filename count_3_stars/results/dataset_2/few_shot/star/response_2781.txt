Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we know that the possible center nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, and 19.

2. For each node, we will check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors. 
   - For example, for node 3, it forms 3-star with nodes 7, 10, and 14.
   - Similarly, for node 15, it forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 8, and 5.

3. After examining all nodes, we can list down the unique 3-stars we found:

<3, (7, 10, 14)>
<15, (9, 8, 5)>
<6, (9, 11, 8)>
<17, (10, 1, 2)>
<1, (17, 14, 12)>
<5, (15, 19, 18)>
<8, (15, 6, 4)>
<9, (15, 6, 2)>
<14, (3, 1, 5)>
<0, (6, 4, 0)>
<10, (3, 17, 2)>
<7, (3, 11, 7)>
<2, (9, 10, 17)>
<12, (1, 19, 2)>
<18, (8, 5, 14)>

4. Finally, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [14]
