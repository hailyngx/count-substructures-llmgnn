Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's look at all possible 3-star configurations in the graph:

1. <0, (3, 4, 7)>
2. <1, (4, 8, 9)>
3. <2, (6, 8, 9)>
4. <3, (0, 5, 7)>
5. <4, (0, 1, 5)>
6. <5, (3, 4, 7)>
7. <6, (2, 4, 8)>
8. <7, (0, 2, 5)>
9. <8, (1, 5, 6)>
10. <9, (1, 2, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars from the list above:
