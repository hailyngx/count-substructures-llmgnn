Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Identify the central node and its adjacent nodes:
- Central Node 0: Connected to nodes 10, 12, and 18

2. Find all possible 3-stars with Node 0 as the center:
- <0, (10, 12, 18)>
- [1]

3. Repeat the same process for all nodes in the graph:
- <1, (14, 10, 11)>
- <2, (11, 7, 8)>
- <3, (17, 16, 5)>
- <4, (19)>
- <5, (17, 3, 12)>
- <6, (15, 12, 19)>
- <7, (2, 8, 3)>
- <8, (10, 7, 2)>
- <9, (16, 19, 14)>
- <10, (11, 0, 8)>
- <11, (10, 1, 2)>
- <12, (5, 0, 15)>
- <13, (2)>
- <14, (17, 11, 19)>
- <15, (6, 12, 2)>
- <16, (9, 3, 18)>
- <17, (14, 3, 5)>
- <18, (0, 5, 16)>
- <19, (6, 9, 14)>
- [20]

4. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
- [20]

Therefore, there are 20 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
