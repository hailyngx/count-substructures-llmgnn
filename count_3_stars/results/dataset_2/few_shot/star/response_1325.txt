Response:
Based on the given information, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph by locating the central nodes that have exactly three neighbors. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 13, 2)
   - Node 9 has 1 neighbor
   - Node 7 has 3 neighbors (9, 13, 12)

2. Identify the 3-stars:
   - <0, (1, 13, 2)>
   - <7, (9, 13, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
