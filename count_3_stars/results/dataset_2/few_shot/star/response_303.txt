Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- Identify the unique 3-star structures involving a central node and three leaves.
- Check how many times each unique 3-star structure appears in the graph.

Based on the adjacency list provided, let's identify the unique 3-stars and then count their occurrences:

1. <0, (3, 6, 9)> (Center node: 0, Leaves: 3, 6, 9)
2. <1, (7, 5, 8)> (Center node: 1, Leaves: 7, 5, 8)
3. <2, (4, 6, 8)> (Center node: 2, Leaves: 4, 6, 8)
4. <3, (4, 9, 8)> (Center node: 3, Leaves: 4, 9, 8)
5. <4, (7, 9, 3)> (Center node: 4, Leaves: 7, 9, 3)
6. <5, (7, 1, 8)> (Center node: 5, Leaves: 7, 1, 8)
7. <6, (9, 2, 0)> (Center node: 6, Leaves: 9, 2, 0)
8. <7, (4, 2, 5)> (Center node: 7, Leaves: 4, 2, 5)
9. <8, (1, 3, 5)> (Center node: 8, Leaves: 1, 3, 5)
10. <9, (4, 3, 6)> (Center node: 9, Leaves: 4, 3, 6)

Now, let's count how many times each unique 3-star structure appears in the graph:
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>: 1
- <1, (7, 5, 8)>: 1
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>: 1
- <3, (4, 9, 8)>: 1
- <4, (7, 9, 3)>: 1
- <5, (7, 1, 8)>: 1
- <6, (9, 2, 0)>: 1
- <7, (4, 2, 5)>: 1
- <8, (1, 3, 5)>: 1
- <9, (4, 3, 6)>: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
