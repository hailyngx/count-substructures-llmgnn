Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star graph.
The nodes that have exactly three neighbors are: 
Node 5 (neighbors: 9, 6, 4)
Node 4 (neighbors: 5, 7, 0)
Node 7 (neighbors: 5, 4, 14)
Node 1 (neighbors: 9, 3, 10)
Node 3 (neighbors: 4, 1, 0)
Node 6 (neighbors: 5, 4, 12)
Node 9 (neighbors: 5, 2, 10)
Node 0 (neighbors: 4, 3, 14)
Node 2 (neighbors: 9, 7, 0)
Node 12 (neighbors: 3, 6, 11)
Node 13 (neighbors: 9, 7, 6)
Node 14 (neighbors: 7, 0, 2)

Step 2: For each potential center node, check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors.
So, the 3-stars are:
<4, (5, 7, 0)>
<7, (5, 4, 14)>
<3, (4, 1, 0)>
<6, (5, 4, 12)>
<9, (5, 2, 10)>
<5, (9, 6, 4)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Therefore, the solution is:
[6]
