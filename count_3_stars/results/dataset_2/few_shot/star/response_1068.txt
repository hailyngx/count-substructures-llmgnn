Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 2

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three neighboring nodes.

Based on the adjacency list and the edges provided, here are the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
