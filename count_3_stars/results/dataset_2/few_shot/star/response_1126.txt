Response:
Step 1: Identify all the nodes that can be in the center of a 3-star. We are looking for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.

Nodes that can be in the center of a 3-star:
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 13
- Node 18

Step 2: For each potential center node, identify its neighbors and check if they form a 3-star pattern.

For Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to Node 15.
- Node 15 has more than 3 neighbors, so Node 4 cannot be the center of a 3-star.

For Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to Node 10 and Node 7.
- Node 10 is connected to Node 14, Node 3, and Node 5.
- This forms a 3-star: <5, (10, 14, 3)>.

For Node 13:
- Node 13 is connected to Node 3.
- Node 3 is connected to Node 9, Node 10, Node 12, and Node 13.
- This forms a 3-star: <13, (3, 9, 10)>.

For Node 18:
- Node 18 is connected to Node 17, Node 7, and Node 15.
- Node 17 is connected to Node 14, Node 6, Node 16, Node 18, and Node 7.
- This forms a 3-star: <18, (17, 14, 6)>.

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
- We identified 3 unique 3-stars: <5, (10, 14, 3)>, <13, (3, 9, 10)>, and <18, (17, 14, 6)>.
