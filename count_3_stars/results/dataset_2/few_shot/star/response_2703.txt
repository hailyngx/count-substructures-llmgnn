Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each possible 3-star.

Let's begin by listing the possible 3-stars using the provided adjacency list:

<0, (17, 14, 5)>
<1, (4, 8, 12)>
<2, (19, 5, 13)>
<3, (4, 18, 5)>
<4, (12, 1, 3)>
<5, (10, 0, 2)>
<6, (9, 8, 13)>
<7, (12, 15)>
<8, (6, 14, 1)>
<9, (6, 18)>
<10, (16, 17, 5)>
<11, (16, 14)>
<12, (4, 7, 13, 1)>
<13, (6, 12, 2)>
<14, (11, 8, 0, 15)>
<15, (17, 7, 14)>
<16, (11, 18, 10)>
<17, (10, 0, 18, 15)>
<18, (16, 9, 17, 3)>
<19, (2)>

Now let's count the number of unique 3-stars listed above: 

[20]
