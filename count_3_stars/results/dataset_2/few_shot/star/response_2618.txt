Response:
First, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through each node and check if it is a part of any 3-star. If a node has exactly three neighbors, then it is the center of a 3-star and its neighbors are the leaves.

Here are the identified 3-stars:
<3, (1, 15, 25)>
<8, (3, 12, 23)>
<9, (6, 13, 22)>
<15, (0, 3, 25)>
<18, (14, 24, 26)>
<21, (6, 11, 22)>
<22, (9, 14, 25)>
<25, (1, 3, 22)>
<26, (17, 18, 27)>
<28, (4, 13, 23)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have found 10 3-stars in total, which can be represented as [<10>].
