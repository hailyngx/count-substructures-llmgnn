Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 12) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 0) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 1) (2, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 12)

Response:
First, we need to determine the nodes that form 3-stars. 
Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. Let's list those nodes:
- Node 2 (Neighbors: 1, 9)
- Node 6 (Neighbors: 1, 12, 8)
- Node 11 (Neighbors: 14, 5, 12)

Now, we identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the nodes we found. 
- Node 2 is the center and has neighbors 1 and 9. <2, (1, 9)>
- Node 6 is the center and has neighbors 1, 12, and 8. <6, (1, 12, 8)>
- Node 11 is the center and has neighbors 14, 5, and 12. <11, (14, 5, 12)>

Therefore, there are 3 3-stars in the given graph.
