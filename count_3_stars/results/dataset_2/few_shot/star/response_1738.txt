Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars based on the given information.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (3, 7, 2)>
<1, (5, 8, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 2)>
<3, (4, 5, 1)>
<3, (7, 5, 1)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (4, 3, 1)>
<5, (6, 7, 1)>
<5, (8, 0, 1)>
<6, (5, 7, 1)>
<6, (9, 7, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 7, 6)>
<9, (8, 2, 5)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [16].
