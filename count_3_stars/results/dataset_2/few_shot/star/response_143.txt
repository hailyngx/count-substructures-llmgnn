Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (a 3-star pattern).

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-star patterns:
- Node 0: (10, 13, 2)
- Node 1: (4, 10, 2), (4, 10, 12), (10, 12, 8)
- Node 2: (5, 8, 1), (5, 8, 3)
- Node 3: (5, 9, 13)
- Node 4: (7, 6, 1), (7, 6, 13)
- Node 5: (6, 7, 3)
- Node 6: (7, 8, 5), (7, 8, 13), (8, 13, 3)
- Node 7: (4, 6, 10), (4, 6, 13), (6, 13, 8)
- Node 8: (13, 14, 0), (13, 14, 1), (14, 0, 12)
- Node 10: (4, 7, 1), (4, 7, 13), (7, 13, 8)
- Node 12: (5, 10, 1), (5, 10, 8), (10, 8, 1)
- Node 13: (7, 8, 6), (7, 8, 0)
- Node 14: (9, 8, 1)

There are a total of [21] unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (10, 13, 2)>, <1, (4, 10, 2)>, <1, (4, 10, 12)>, <1, (10, 12, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 1)>, <2, (5, 8, 3)>, <3, (5, 9, 13)>, <4, (7, 6, 1)>, <4, (7, 6, 13)>, <5, (6, 7, 3)>, <6, (7, 8, 5)>, <6, (7, 8, 13)>, <6, (8, 13, 3)>, <7, (4, 6, 10)>, <7, (4, 6, 13)>, <8, (13, 14, 0)>, <8, (13, 14, 1)>, <8, (14, 0, 12)>, <10, (4, 7, 1)>, <10, (4, 7, 13)>, <12, (5, 10, 1)>, <12, (5, 10, 8)>, <12, (10, 8, 1)>
