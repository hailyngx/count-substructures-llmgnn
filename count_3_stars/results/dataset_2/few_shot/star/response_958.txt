Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern around it.

Based on the given information, we can see that Node 8 fits the definition of a central node in a 3-star, as it is connected to exactly three other nodes (4, 7, and 9). Let's list the 3-stars involving Node 8:
<8, (4, 7, 9)>

Similarly, Node 9 also fits the definition of a central node in a 3-star, connected to nodes 6, 8, and 2. Let's list the 3-star involving Node 9:
<9, (6, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 2.
