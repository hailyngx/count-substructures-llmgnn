Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern. These are nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We can list these nodes: 
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 7, 12, and 5)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 10, 2, and 9)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 15, 6, and 18)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 10, 17, and 18)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 15, 13, and 11)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 3, 18, and 0)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 12, 0, and 18)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 11, 1, and 19)
- Node 10 (connected to nodes 1, 4, and 13)
- Node 11 (connected to nodes 8, 5, and 9)
- Node 13 (connected to nodes 10, 5, and 16)
- Node 17 (connected to nodes 19, 4, and 18)
- Node 18 (connected to nodes 3, 7, and 4)
- Node 19 (connected to nodes 17, 4, and 9)

Next, let's determine the 3-stars in the given graph. We will ensure that the central node of the 3-star has exactly three leaf nodes. 

[7]  
<7, (12, 0, 18)>  

[3]  
<3, (15, 6, 18)>  

[4]  
<4, (10, 17, 18)>  
<4, (17, 19, 18)>  

[5]  
<5, (15, 13, 11)>  

[9]  
<9, (11, 1, 19)>  

[10]  
<10, (1, 13, 4)>  

[11]  
<11, (8, 5, 9)>  

[13]  
<13, (10, 5, 16)>  

[18]  
<18, (3, 7, 4)>  

[19]  
<19, (17, 4, 9)>
