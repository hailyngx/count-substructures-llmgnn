Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 8) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 4) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 1) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 1 is connected to node 9, 0, 11, 2, 12, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 10, 1, 14, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 5, 0, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 13, 10, 11, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 11, 3, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 14, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 13, 0, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes form 3-stars with the selected node as the center.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 9, 8)>
<2, (4, 9, 10)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 11)>
<5, (3, 11, 14)>
<6, (7, 14, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 12)>
<10, (2, 4, 14)>
<11, (4, 5, 1)>
<12, (1, 9, 13)>
<13, (12, 14, 4)>
<14, (2, 9, 6)>

Since there are 15 unique 3-stars in total, the final count of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
