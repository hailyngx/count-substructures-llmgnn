Response:
Let's find all the 3-star configurations in the given graph.

From the adjacency list provided, we can see that the 3-stars can be formed with the center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step to find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Start with node 0: 
    - (0, 14, 15) forms a 3-star with center node 0.
<0, (14, 15, 3)>

2. Node 1 has only 2 connections, so it cannot form a 3-star.

3. Start with node 2: 
    - (2, 7, 12) forms a 3-star with center node 2.
<2, (7, 12, 19)>

4. Start with node 3: 
    - (3, 0, 11) forms a 3-star with center node 3. 
<3, (0, 11, 6)>
    - (3, 5, 6) forms another 3-star with center node 3. 
<3, (5, 6, 0)>

5. Start with node 4: 
    - (4, 9, 17) forms a 3-star with center node 4.
<4, (9, 17, 13)>
    - (4, 10, 5) forms another 3-star with center node 4.
<4, (10, 5, 13)>

6. Start with node 5: 
    - (5, 3, 18) forms a 3-star with center node 5.
<5, (3, 18, 10)>
    - (5, 10, 4) forms another 3-star with center node 5.
<5, (10, 4, 18)>

7. Start with node 6: 
    - (6, 3, 1) forms a 3-star with center node 6.
<6, (3, 1, 19)>
    - (6, 18, 15) forms another 3-star with center node 6.
<6, (18, 15, 19)>

8. Start with node 7: 
    - (7, 12, 2) forms a 3-star with center node 7.
<7, (12, 2, 17)>
    - (7, 10, 4) forms another 3-star with center node 7.
<7, (10, 4, 13)>

9. Start with node 8: 
    - (8, 12, 17) forms a 3-star with center node 8.
<8, (12, 17, 18)>
    - (8, 1, 17) forms another 3-star with center node 8.
<8, (1, 17, 18)>

10. Start with node 9: 
    - (9, 4, 17) forms a 3-star with center node 9.
<9, (4, 17, 13)>

11. Node 10 forms 3-stars with center nodes 10 and 14, which are already accounted for in earlier steps.

12. Start with node 11:
    - (11, 3, 13) forms a 3-star with center node 11.
<11, (3, 13, 7)>

13. Node 16 is not connected to any other nodes.

14. Start with node 17:
    - (17, 7, 8) forms a 3-star with center node 17.
<17, (7, 8, 9)>

15. Start with node 18:
    - (18, 6, 15) forms a 3-star with center node 18.
<18, (6, 15, 5)>
    - (18, 15, 8) forms another 3-star with center node 18.
<18, (15, 8, 6)>

16. Start with node 19:
    - (19, 6, 2) forms a 3-star with center node 19.
<19, (6, 2, 15)>

Let's count the total number of 3-stars: [14].
