Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern.

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, 2. (<1, (5, 9, 2)>)
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, 7. (<2, (5, 9, 7)>)
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, 8. (<3, (6, 4, 8)>)
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, 0. (<7, (6, 4, 0)>)
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, 2. (<9, (5, 6, 2)>)

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
