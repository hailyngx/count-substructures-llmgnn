Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first identify all the 3-stars present in the graph based on the given edges and adjacency list:

1. <11, (16, 0, 6)>
2. <16, (11, 1, 14)>
3. <5, (18, 0, -)>
4. <9, (28, 10, 12)>
5. <15, (27, 19, 26)>
6. <27, (15, 20, 13)>
7. <7, (21, 3, 22)>
8. <21, (15, 7, 3)>
9. <22, (7, 19, 4)>
10. <23, (2, 28, -)>
11. <28, (9, 23, 29)>
12. <29, (28, 20, 26)>
13. <2, (23, 8, 1)>
14. <8, (11, 2, 26)>
15. <17, (2, 13, 25)>
16. <20, (27, 29, -)>
17. <4, (22, 26, -)>
18. <13, (27, 17, 6)>
19. <3, (21, 0, 18)>
20. <25, (17, 6, 10)>
21. <18, (5, 3, 1)>
22. <12, (9, -)>
23. <24, (22, -)>
