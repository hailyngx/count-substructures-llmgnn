Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph can be identified by finding nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes in the graph. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

1. <28, (3, 8, 24)>
2. <26, (13, 4, 6)>
3. <12, (29, 4, 16)>
4. <25, (3, 1, 6)>
5. <21, (2, 7, 28)>
6. <22, (8, 1, 0)>
7. <9, (3, 7, 14)>

There are 7 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
