Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2)

Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node and check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. From the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars:
   - Node 9: <9, (6, 8, 2)>
   - Node 5: <5, (6, 7, 1)>
   - Node 2: <2, (9, 1, 8)>
   - Node 0: <0, (9, 4, 2)>
   - Node 1: <1, (7, 5, 8)>
   - Node 3: <3, (9, 7, 2)>
   - Node 6: <6, (9, 5, 7)>
   - Node 4: <4, (7, 0)>

2. Counting the number of unique 3-stars found:
   - <9, (6, 8, 2)>
   - <5, (6, 7, 1)>
   - <2, (9, 1, 8)>
   - <0, (9, 4, 2)>
   - <1, (7, 5, 8)>
   - <3, (9, 7, 2)>
   - <6, (9, 5, 7)>
   - <4, (7, 0)>
  
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
