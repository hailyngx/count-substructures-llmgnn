Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0)

Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the given information. A 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph as follows:

1. Node 0: <0, (7, 9, 2)>
2. Node 1: <1, (3, 6, 8)>
3. Node 2: <2, (3, 6, 8)>
4. Node 3: <3, (1, 6, 2)>
5. Node 4: <4, (7, 8, 5)>
6. Node 5: <5, (4, 7, 3)> 
7. Node 6: <6, (7, 1, 3)>
8. Node 7: <7, (4, 0, 6)>
9. Node 8: <8, (4, 1, 3)>
10. Node 9: <9, (7, 0, 0)>

Now we have identified all the unique 3-stars in the graph. Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get 10 unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
