Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure.

Based on the given edges and adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-star structures:
- <0, (5, 4, 7)>
- <0, (5, 2, 1)>
- <0, (5, 2, 3)>
- <0, (4, 3, 1)>
- <0, (7, 2, 1)>
- <0, (7, 2, 3)>
- <0, (2, 3, 1)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (6, 9, 8)>
- <3, (4, 2, 8)>
- <3, (2, 8, 1)>

Counting the unique 3-stars identified above, we have a total of [11] 3-stars in the given graph.
