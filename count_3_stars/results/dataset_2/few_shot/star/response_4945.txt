Response:
Let's determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (degree = 3) as potential central nodes for 3-stars.
   These nodes are: 11, 18, 5, 9, 7, 15, 16

2. Check each potential central node to see if it forms a valid 3-star:
   
   - For the node 11:
     <11, (14, 17, 15)>
     <11, (14, 1, 17)>
     <11, (1, 17, 15)>
     These are the only 3-stars centered at node 11.
     
   - For the node 18:
     <18, (4, 5, 7)>
     These are the only 3-stars centered at node 18.

   - For the node 5:
     <5, (16, 18, 13)>
     <5, (16, 15, 9)>
     <5, (18, 13, 19)>
     <5, (13, 19, 17)>
     These are the only 3-stars centered at node 5.

   - For the node 9:
     <9, (16, 6, 15)>
     <9, (6, 15, 13)>
     <9, (15, 5, 16)>
     <9, (15, 5, 13)>
     These are the only 3-stars centered at node 9.

   - For the node 7:
     <7, (18, 4, 12)>
     These are the only 3-stars centered at node 7.

   - For the node 15:
     <15, (11, 6, 9)>
     <15, (11, 5, 16)>
     <15, (11, 5, 13)>
     <15, (6, 9, 13)>
     These are the only 3-stars centered at node 15.

   - For the node 16:
     <16, (9, 6, 5)>
     These are the only 3-stars centered at node 16.

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
   [19] 

Therefore, the final answer is [19].
