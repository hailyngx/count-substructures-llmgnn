Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 9, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all unique 3-stars in the graph.

Given 10 nodes and the connectivity information provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph as follows:
- Node 0: (1, 5, 2), (1, 8, 0), (5, 7, 0), (2, 9, 0)
- Node 1: (3, 6, 1), (9, 7, 1), (8, 7, 1), (0, 8, 1)
- Node 2: (5, 6, 2), (9, 7, 2), (8, 6, 2), (0, 2, 8)
- Node 3: (1, 6, 3), (5, 3, 1)
- Node 4: No 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 5: (7, 3, 5), (2, 6, 5), (0, 5, 7)
- Node 6: (1, 3, 6), (2, 5, 6), (8, 6, 1)
- Node 7: No 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: (7, 1, 8), (6, 2, 8), (0, 8, 1)
- Node 9: (4, 7, 9), (1, 9, 2)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are: 
<1, (5, 7, 0)>, <1, (3, 6, 1)>, <1, (9, 7, 1)>, <1, (8, 7, 1)>, <0, (2, 9, 0)>,<5, (7, 3, 5)>, <5, (2, 6, 5)>, <8, (7, 1, 8)>, <8, (6, 2, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 3)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
