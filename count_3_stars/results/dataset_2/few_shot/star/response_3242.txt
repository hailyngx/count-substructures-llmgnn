Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided.

1. Start by identifying each 3-star in the graph:
   - Node 4 acts as a center node with leaves 7, 19, and 17. <4, (7, 19, 17)>
   - Node 7 acts as a center node with leaves 4, 0, and 17. <7, (4, 0, 17)>
   - Node 10 acts as a center node with leaves 11, 17, and 19. <10, (11, 17, 19)>
   - Node 11 acts as a center node with leaves 10, 9, and 18. <11, (10, 9, 18)>
   - Node 17 acts as a center node with leaves 4, 7, and 10. <17, (4, 7, 10)>
   - Node 19 acts as a center node with leaves 4, 10, and 2. <19, (4, 10, 2)>
   - Node 21 acts as a center node with leaves 28, 0, and 27. <21, (28, 0, 27)>
   - Node 22 acts as a center node with leaves 28, 9, and 27. <22, (28, 9, 27)>
   - Node 27 acts as a center node with leaves 21, 28, and 22. <27, (21, 28, 22)>
   - Node 28 acts as a center node with leaves 21, 22, and 27. <28, (21, 22, 27)>
   - Node 29 acts as a center node with leaves 0, 1, and 15. <29, (0, 1, 15)>

2. Count the total number of 3-stars found: [10]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
