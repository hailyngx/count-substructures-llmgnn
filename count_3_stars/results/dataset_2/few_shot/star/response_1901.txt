Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 2, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:

<0, (5, 2, 8)>
<1, (4, 8, 0)>
<2, (5, 8, 3)>
<3, (9, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 0)>
<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<7, (9, 6, 4)>
<8, (7, 2, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
