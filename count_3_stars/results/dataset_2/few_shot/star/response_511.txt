Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- For Node 0: <0, (9, 1, 3)>
- For Node 1: <1, (9, 0, 3)> and <1, (9, 2, 8)>
- For Node 2: <2, (5, 6, 12)> and <2, (1, 6, 13)>
- For Node 3: <3, (9, 0, 4)> and <3, (9, 1, 8)>
- For Node 4: <4, (7, 3, 14)> and <4, (6, 3, 14)>
- For Node 5: <5, (9, 6, 8)> and <5, (9, 2, 8)>
- For Node 6: <6, (5, 4, 13)>
- For Node 7: <7, (9, 4, 12)>
- For Node 8: <8, (5, 1, 3)> and <8, (5, 1, 10)>
- For Node 9: <9, (5, 0, 7)> and <9, (5, 1, 8)>
- For Node 10: <10, (12, 14, 8)>
- For Node 12: <12, (7, 2, 10)>
- For Node 13: <13, (6, 2, 11)>
- For Node 14: <14, (9, 0, 4)> and <14, (9, 0, 10)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
