Response:
The 3-star graph in the given graph is formed when a center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. To find all the 3-star graphs in this graph, we need to look for each node's connections and identify if it forms a 3-star pattern.

After analyzing the given graph, we find the following 3-stars:

<9, (26, 25, 28)>
<26, (9, 15, 21)>
<3, (15, 7, 16)>
<15, (26, 3, 16)>
<8, (23, 20, 0)>
<23, (8, 11, 24)>
<0, (8, 20, 2)>
<20, (8, 0, 4)>
<12, (27, 16, 19)>
<27, (12, 4, 21)>
<2, (0, 22, 13)>
<11, (23, 2, 28)>
<5, (10, 14, 3)>
<6, (13, 21, 1)>
<21, (26, 27, 29)>
<4, (20, 27, 19)>
<29, (21, 1, 25)>
<1, (6, 29, 19)>
<14, (11, 5, 22)>
<10, (5)>
<7, (3, 14, 17)>
<16, (15, 12, 4)>
<17, (22, 7)>
<18, (6, 1)>
<19, (12, 4, 1)>
<24, (23, 21)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25]. 
<9, (26, 25, 28)>, 
<26, (9, 15, 21)>, 
<3, (15, 7, 16)>, 
<15, (26, 3, 16)>, 
<8, (23, 20, 0)>, 
<23, (8, 11, 24)>, 
<0, (8, 20, 2)>, 
<20, (8, 0, 4)>, 
<12, (27, 16, 19)>, 
<27, (12, 4, 21)>, 
<2, (0, 22, 13)>, 
<11, (23, 2, 28)>, 
<5, (10, 14, 3)>, 
<6, (13, 21, 1)>, 
<21, (26, 27, 29)>,
