Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 1) (11, 18) (11, 4) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 6) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 15) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 9) (5, 13) (5, 14) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (12, 2) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 19) (19, 18) (19, 12) (19, 1) (0, 12) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 15) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 16) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 14) (9, 18) (9, 3) (9, 7) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 13) (6, 17) (6, 7) (15, 8) (15, 2) (15, 0) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 14)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (12, 16, 3)>
<1, (10, 19, 14)>
<2, (8, 12, 15)>
<3, (17, 0, 9)>
<4, (11, 12, 18)>
<5, (13, 17, 14)>
<6, (13, 17, 7)>
<7, (9, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 15, 18)>
<9, (18, 3, 7)>
<10, (1, 19, 14)>
<11, (18, 4, 12)>
<12, (2, 4, 0)>
<13, (5, 17, 16)>
<14, (5, 1, 16)>
<15, (8, 2, 0)>
<16, (13, 0, 14)>
<17, (13, 6, 3)>
<18, (11, 8, 19)>
<19, (18, 12, 1)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 
The answer is [20].
