Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 4: <4, (7, 8, 1)>, <4, (7, 3, 6)>, <4, (7, 2, 5)>, <4, (8, 1, 3)>, <4, (8, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>
2. Node 7: <7, (4, 8, 3)>, <7, (4, 3, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 5)>, <7, (8, 3, 6)>, <7, (8, 2, 5)>, <7, (3, 6, 1)>
3. Node 6: <6, (7, 9, 3)>, <6, (7, 9, 1)>, <6, (9, 1, 3)>, <6, (7, 1, 2)>, <6, (9, 8, 2)>, <6, (1, 3, 2)>
4. Node 1: <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 3)>, <1, (4, 9, 3)>, <1, (6, 9, 3)>, <1, (4, 3, 0)>
5. Node 8: <8, (4, 9, 2)>, <8, (4, 2, 5)>, <8, (9, 2, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [20].
