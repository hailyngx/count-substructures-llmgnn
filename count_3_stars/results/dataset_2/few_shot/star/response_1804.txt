Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (2, 8, 10)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<2, (6, 8, 3)>
<3, (2, 0, 13)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
<5, (8, 4, 10)>
<6, (9, 7, 2)>
<7, (6, 10, 14)>
<8, (5, 6, 2)>
<9, (6, 4, 1)>
<10, (5, 0, 7)>
<11, (1)>
<12, (9, 8, 10)>
<13, (3, 10, 14)>
<14, (2, 7, 12)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
