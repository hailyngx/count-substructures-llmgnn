Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step by step:

1. Look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to 2 other nodes.
   - Node 1 is connected to 3 other nodes.
   - Node 2 is connected to 1 other node.
   - Node 3 is connected to 4 other nodes.
   - Node 4 is connected to 2 other nodes.
   - Node 5 is connected to 4 other nodes.
   - Node 6 is connected to 2 other nodes.
   - Node 7 is connected to 1 other node.
   - Node 9 is connected to 1 other node.
   - Node 16 is connected to 1 other node.

2. Identify the 3-stars:
   - Node 1, (7, 10, 12)
   - Node 3, (2, 14, 10)
   - Node 5, (6, 19, 15)
   - Node 8, (13, 17, 12)
   - Node 12, (0, 10, 1)
   - Node 14, (0, 18, 19)
   - Node 15, (4, 17, 13)

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars. Hence, the final answer is [7].  

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (7, 10, 12)>
<3, (2, 14, 10)>
<5, (6, 19, 15)>
<8, (13, 17, 12)>
<12, (0, 10, 1)>
<14, (0, 18, 19)>
<15, (4, 17, 13)>
