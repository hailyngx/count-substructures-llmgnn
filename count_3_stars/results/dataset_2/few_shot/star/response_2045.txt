Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 3) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 3) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 9) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 13, 6, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 11, 14, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 10, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 2, 0, 14, and node 10
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 13, 6, 2, and node 12
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 5, 14, 10, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 13, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 11, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 1, 11, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, 14, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 13, 6, 1, and node 3

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 3, 6)>
<8, (4, 1, 13)>
<13, (8, 5, 14)>
<5, (13, 6, 2)>
<6, (7, 5, 14)>
<14, (13, 1, 3)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
