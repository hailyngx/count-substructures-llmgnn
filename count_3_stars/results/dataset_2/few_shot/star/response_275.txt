Response:
First, let's identify nodes that can form 3-stars based on the given graph:
- Node 4 has edges with nodes 8, 18, and 1
- Node 8 has edges with nodes 4, 2, and 0
- Node 13 has edges with nodes 9, 2, and 15
- Node 5 has edges with nodes 6, 19, and 10
- Node 7 has edges with nodes 11, 15, and 19
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 9, 4, and 14
- Node 3 has edges with nodes 19, 14, and 10

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- There are 3-stars centered at node 4: 
  - <4, (8, 18, 1)>
- There are 3-stars centered at node 8: 
  - <8, (4, 2, 0)>
- There are 3-stars centered at node 13: 
  - <13, (9, 2, 15)>
- There are 3-stars centered at node 5: 
  - <5, (6, 19, 10)>
- There are 3-stars centered at node 7: 
  - <7, (11, 15, 19)>
- There are 3-stars centered at node 1: 
  - <1, (9, 4, 14)>
- There are 3-stars centered at node 3: 
  - <3, (19, 14, 10)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: **7**]
