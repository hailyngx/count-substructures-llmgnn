Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For a 3-star, we need a central node and three leaf nodes connected to the central node.

2. We will go through each node in the graph to check if it forms a 3-star.

Starting from the given adjacency list:
- Node 0 does not form a 3-star because it has only 2 connections.
- Node 1 does form a 3-star: <1, (11, 7, 12)>
- Node 2 does not form a 3-star because it has only 2 connections.
- Node 3 does form a 3-star: <3, (5, 9, 6)>
- Node 4 does form a 3-star: <4, (10, 11, 13)>
- Node 5 does form a 3-star: <5, (9, 6, 3)>
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star because it has only 3 connections.
- Node 7 does form a 3-star: <7, (10, 8, 12)>
- Node 8 does not form a 3-star because it has only 2 connections.
- Node 9 does form a 3-star: <9, (5, 8, 11)>
- Node 10 does not form a 3-star because it has only 2 connections.
- Node 11 does form a 3-star: <11, (9, 14, 1)>
- Node 12 does form a 3-star: <12, (10, 7, 4)>
- Node 13 does form a 3-star: <13, (4, 2, 14)>
- Node 14 does form a 3-star: <14, (11, 13, 1)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [7]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
