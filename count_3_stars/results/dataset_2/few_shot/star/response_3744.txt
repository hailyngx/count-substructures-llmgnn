Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star configuration. 

Let's go through each node and its neighbors to find all the 3-stars:

1. For Node 0: 
    - <0, (14, 3, 19)>
2. For Node 1:
    - <1, (2, 14, 19)>
3. For Node 2:
    - <2, (8, 1, 7)>
4. For Node 3:
    - No 3-stars as it has only two neighbors.
5. For Node 4:
    - No 3-stars as it has only two neighbors.
6. For Node 5:
    - No 3-stars as it has only two neighbors.
7. For Node 6:
    - No 3-stars as it has four neighbors.
8. For Node 7:
    - <7, (2, 5, 15)>
9. For Node 8:
    - No 3-stars as it has only two neighbors.
10. For Node 9:
    - Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.
11. For Node 10:
    - No 3-stars as it has three neighbors but they are not connected in a star configuration.
12. For Node 11:
    - <11, (8, 5, 19)>
    - <11, (5, 17, 19)>
13. For Node 12:
    - No 3-stars as it has two neighbors.
14. For Node 13:
    - <13, (14, 16, 3)>
15. For Node 14:
    - <14, (0, 1, 19)>
    - <14, (0, 13, 19)>
16. For Node 15:
    - No 3-stars as it has two neighbors.
17. For Node 16:
    - No 3-stars as it has two neighbors.
18. For Node 17:
    - No 3-stars as it has three neighbors but they are not connected in a star configuration.
19. For Node 18:
    - No 3-stars as it has three neighbors but they are not connected in a star configuration.
20. For Node 19:
    - <19, (0, 14, 11)>
    - <19, (0, 1, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (14, 3, 19)>
<1, (2, 14, 19)>
<7, (2, 5, 15)>
<11, (8, 5, 19)>
<11, (5, 17, 19)>
<13, (14, 16, 3)>
<14, (0, 1, 19)>
<14, (0, 13, 19)>
<19, (0, 14, 11)>
<19, (0, 1, 11)>
