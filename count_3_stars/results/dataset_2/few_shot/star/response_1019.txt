Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes which are not part of any 3-star are: 6, 8, 10, 12. 

Next, we will go through each remaining node and its connections to identify 3-stars. 
1. From node 3:
    - (3, 15, 9)
    - (3, 1, 0)
    - (3, 16, 7)

2. From node 4:
    - (4, 7, 18)
    - (4, 9, 19)
    - (4, 5, 14)

3. From node 5:
    - (5, 4, 14)

4. From node 7:
    - (7, 4, 18)

5. From node 9:
    - (9, 15, 19)

6. From node 13:
    - (13, 3, 17)

7. From node 14:
    - (14, 18, 5)

8. From node 15:
    - (15, 3, 9)

9. From node 16:
    - (16, 3, 7)

10. From node 17:
    - (17, 13, 9)

11. From node 18:
    - (18, 7, 2)

Counting all the unique 3-stars we found: 
<3, (15, 9, 3)>, <3, (1, 0, 3)>, <3, (16, 7, 3)>, <4, (7, 18, 4)>, <4, (9, 19, 4)>, <4, (5, 14, 4)>, <5, (4, 14, 5)>, <7, (4, 18, 7)>, <9, (15, 19, 9)>, <13, (3, 17, 13)>, <14, (5, 18, 14)>, <15, (3, 9, 15)>, <16, (3, 7, 16)>, <17, (9, 13, 17)>, <18, (2, 7, 18)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [15].
