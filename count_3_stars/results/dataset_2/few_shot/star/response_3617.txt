Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for cases where a node has exactly three edges (i.e., is part of a 3-star) and check the neighboring nodes to see if they form 3-stars. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them:
    - Nodes: 4, 6, 7, 10

2. Examine each identified node and check if they form 3-stars with their neighbors:
    - Node 4: Forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 14, and 16
    - Node 6: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 5
    - Node 7: Does not form any 3-star
    - Node 10: Forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 15, and 17

3. List the unique 3-stars found:
    - <4, (5, 14, 16)>
    - <6, (0, 1, 5)>
    - <10, (12, 15, 17)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
