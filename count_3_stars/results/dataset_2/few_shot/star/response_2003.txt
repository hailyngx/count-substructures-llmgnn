Response:
The central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 9, 26, 6, 4, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 28, 20, 27, 24.

Calculating the number of 3-stars: 
For each central node, we need to find all unique combinations of 3 leaves connected to it.

For central node 9: 
<9, (0, 10, 22)>
Number of 3-stars for central node 9 = 1

For central node 26:
<26, (2, 8, 9)>
Number of 3-stars for central node 26 = 1

For central node 6: 
<6, (4, 17, 24)>
Number of 3-stars for central node 6 = 1

For central node 4:
<4, (6, 11, 14)>
Number of 3-stars for central node 4 = 1

For central node 7:
<7, (8, 28, 29)>
Number of 3-stars for central node 7 = 1

For central node 10:
<10, (0, 20, 21)>
Number of 3-stars for central node 10 = 1

For central node 11:
<11, (13, 4, 21)>
Number of 3-stars for central node 11 = 1

For central node 13:
<13, (2, 5, 11)>
Number of 3-stars for central node 13 = 1

For central node 14:
<14, (4, 21, 24)>
Number of 3-stars for central node 14 = 1

For central node 28:
<28, (7, 12, 19)>
Number of 3-stars for central node 28 = 1

For central node 20:
<20, (1, 10, 12)>
Number of 3-stars for central node 20 = 1

For central node 27:
<27, (12, 23, 24)>
Number of 3-stars for central node 27 = 1

For central node 24:
<24, (2, 23, 27)>
Number of 3-stars for central node 24 = 1

Total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [13]
