Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that form 3-star structures by having 3 edges connected to the node. In this case, any node with 3 connections is a potential center of a 3-star. Then we verify if the neighbors of the potential center form a 3-star structure by being connected only to the center node.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:

[8]

Unique 3-stars: 
<8, (9, 4, 7)>
<8, (9, 4, 3)> 
(There are only these two unique 3-stars)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
