Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 24, 18)>
<1, (28, 7, 24)>
<2, (4, 15, -)>
<3, (0, 28, 7)>
<4, (8, 5, 17)>
<5, (4, 17, 15)>
<6, (22, 27, -)>
<7, (26, 3, 14)>
<8, (4, 10, 16)>
<9, (10, -, -)>
<10, (22, 8, 26)>
<11, (28, -, -)>
<12, (13, 21, -)>
<13, (22, 12, 19)>
<14, (19, 16, 24)>
<15, (2, 25, 18)>
<16, (8, 21, 14)>
<17, (4, 25, 5)>
<18, (0, 15, 20)>
<19, (13, 26, 14)>
<20, (19, 18, 24)>
<21, (16, 25, 12)>
<22, (13, 6, 10)>
<23, (27, 26, -)>
<24, (0, 29, 1)>
<25, (17, 15, 21)>
<26, (19, 23, 10)>
<27, (23, 6, -)>
<28, (11, 3, 1)>
<29, (24, -, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars. 

There are 29 unique 3-stars listed above.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].
