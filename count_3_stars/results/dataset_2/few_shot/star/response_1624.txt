Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 2, 6)>
<1, (5, 8, 4)>
<2, (8, 6, 3)>
<3, (5, 4, 2)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
<5, (8, 1, 4)>
<6, (4, 2, 8)>
<7, (9, 8, 1)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [8].
