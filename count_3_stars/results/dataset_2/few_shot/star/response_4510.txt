Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. Remember that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
1. <4, (2, 12, 10)>
2. <4, (2, 12, 14)>
3. <4, (10, 14, 5)>
4. <7, (3, 13, 6)>
5. <7, (3, 13, 12)>
6. <7, (9, 13, 6)>
7. <1, (5, 8, 12)>
8. <1, (5, 8, 6)>
9. <1, (5, 8, 14)>
10. <2, (3, 8, 0)>
11. <2, (3, 8, 12)>
12. <2, (0, 10, 4)>
13. <5, (8, 14, 10)>
14. <6, (1, 13, 7)>
15. <6, (10, 13, 7)>
16. <8, (5, 14, 1)>
17. <0, (10, 11, 2)>
18. <0, (11, 3, 2)>
19. <11, (9, 12, 3)>
20. <14, (8, 10, 4)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we find that there are [20] 3-stars.
