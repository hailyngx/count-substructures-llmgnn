Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows: 
<0, (2, 9, 11)>
<1, (4, 10, 8)>
<2, (0, 9, 5)>
<3, (10, 15, 16)>
<4, (1, 11, 19)>
<5, (2, 4, 18)>
<6, (9, 7, 16)>
<7, (6, 12, 13)>
<8, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 17)>
<10, (3, 1, 17)>
<11, (0, 4, 19)>
<12, (7, 11, 19)>
<13, (7, 16, 19)>
<14, (0, 16, 0)>
<15, (10, 10, 16)>
<16, (3, 6, 13)>
<17, (9, 10, 17)>
<18, (5, 5, 5)>
<19, (4, 11, 13)>
