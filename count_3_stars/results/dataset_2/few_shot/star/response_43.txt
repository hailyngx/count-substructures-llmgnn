Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:
- <3, (1, 9, 6)>
- <15, (8, 5, 2)>
- <1, (3, 6, 16)>
- <7, (12, 11, 17)>
- <12, (4, 17, 19)>
- <5, (1, 13, 17)>
- <2, (15, 9, 6)>
- <8, (15, 14, 10)>
- <14, (1, 18, 11)>
- <17, (7, 5, 0)>
- <16, (1, 0, 10)>
- <6, (1, 2, 10)>
- <11, (7, 14, 19)>
  
Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [13] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
