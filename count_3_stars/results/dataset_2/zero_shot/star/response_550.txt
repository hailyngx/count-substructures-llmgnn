Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 18) (1, 0) (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 2) (13, 4) (13, 7) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 8) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 5) (2, 17) (2, 16) (2, 5) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 5) (8, 18) (8, 7) (6, 19) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 18) (9, 1) (9, 16) (9, 11) (9, 7) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 18) (10, 12) (10, 3) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 3) (18, 11) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (7, 9) (19, 6) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (1, 8, 15)>
<12, (1, 8, 16)>
<16, (2, 5, 8)>
<18, (3, 11, 15)>
