Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is enclosed in brackets [].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<6, (9, 7, 5)>
<4, (7, 8, 6)>
<7, (4, 0, 6)>
<8, (4, 2, 0)>
<5, (6, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
