Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (4, 9) (4, 5) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 0) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (14, 2) (14, 9) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 9) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<8, (10, 12, 3)>
<13, (12, 1, 9)>
<10, (8, 11, 9)>
<9, (13, 10, 4)>
