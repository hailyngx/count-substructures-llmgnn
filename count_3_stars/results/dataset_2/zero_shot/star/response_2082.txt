Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<6, (5, 1, 4)>
<4, (6, 0, 1)>
<7, (5, 3, 2)>
<8, (9, 3, -)>
<0, (9, 4, 1)>
