Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 0) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 14) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 4) (6, 8) (6, 11) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures found in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (13, 0, 7)>
<9, (4, 14, 1)>
<1, (9, 3, 0)>
<3, (13, 12, 10)>
<8, (13, 14, 6)>
<2, (12, 4, 0)>
<12, (3, 2, 11)>
<10, (3, 12, 7)>
<4, (9, 13, 0)>
<14, (9, 8, 10)>
<6, (8, 11, 0)>
<7, (5, 9, 10)>
<11, (5, 12, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
