Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 14) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 12) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 3) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 10) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<13, (5, 10, 14)>
<3, (11, 12, 14)>
<1, (7, 6, 9)> 

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [4].
