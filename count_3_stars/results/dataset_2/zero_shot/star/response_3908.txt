Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 4) (10, 1) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 4) (17, 7) (7, 17) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 16) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 9) (9, 19) (9, 4) (4, 15) (4, 17) (4, 9) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 18) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 0) (11, 5) (11, 19) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 13) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 13) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 18) (18, 16) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 13) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<3, (5, 8, 15)>
<15, (0, 4, 17)>
<17, (4, 7, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 11, 16)>
<19, (9, 11, 5)>
<9, (4, 19, 9)>
<16, (1, 11, 18)>
<1, (6, 10, 16)>
<6, (0, 1, 17)>
<11, (5, 16, 19)>
<14, (13, 3, 18)>
