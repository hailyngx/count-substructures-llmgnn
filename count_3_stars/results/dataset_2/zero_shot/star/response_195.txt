Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 17) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 19) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 12) (12, 11) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 0) (10, 14) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (17, 4) (17, 3) (17, 15) (2, 19) (2, 13) (19, 3) (19, 2) (19, 6) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 15) (1, 18) (1, 14) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 1) (13, 0) (13, 2) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 16) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 15) 

Response:
[count=count_stars=0]

The 3-stars in the graph can be found by identifying the central node and the three leaves connected to it. 

Let's go through each node in the graph to find the 3-stars:

1. For node 0:
   - <0, (5, 9, 16)>
   
2. For node 1:
   - <1, (18, 14, 15)>
   
3. For node 2:
   - No 3-star.
   
4. For node 3:
   - <3, (16, 7, 17)>
   
5. For node 4:
   - No 3-star.
   
6. For node 5:
   - <5, (0, 9, 16)>
   
7. For node 6:
   - No 3-star.
   
8. For node 7:
   - <7, (3, 9, 11)>
   
9. For node 8:
   - <8, (16, 9, 12)>
   
10. For node 9:
    - <9, (5, 8, 7)>
    
11. For node 10:
    - No 3-star.
    
12. For node 11:
    - <11, (3, 7, 12)>
    
13. For node 12:
    - <12, (8, 11, 7)>
    
14. For node 13:
    - No 3-star.
    
15. For node 14:
    - <14, (1, 7, 10)>
    
16. For node 15:
    - <15, (18, 16, 17)>
    
17. For node 16:
    - <16, (15, 3, 8)>
    
18. For node 17:
    - No 3-star.
    
19. For node 18:
    - <18, (15, 1, 16)>
    
20. For node 19:
    - No 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 9, 16)>, <1, (18, 14, 15)>, <3, (16, 7, 17)>, <5, (0, 9, 16)>, <7, (3, 9, 11)>, <8, (16, 9, 12)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>, <11, (3, 7, 12)>, <12, (8, 11, 7)>, <18, (15, 1, 16)>.
