Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The central nodes in a 3-star will be nodes with degree 3. We can identify the central nodes as nodes 6, 4, and 1.

For node 6:
- Leaves: 9, 5, 7

For node 4:
- Leaves: 9, 7, 3

For node 1:
- Leaves: 9, 7, 3

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<6, (9, 5, 7)>, <4, (9, 7, 3)>, <1, (9, 7, 3)>
