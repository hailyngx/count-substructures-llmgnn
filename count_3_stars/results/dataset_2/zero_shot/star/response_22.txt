Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (6, 4, 3)>
<9, (6, 8, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
