Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 3) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 4) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<7, (11, 12, 6)>
<2, (0, 8, 1)>
