Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

<10, (11, 7, 13)>
<2, (8, 3, 14)>
<8, (2, 5, 3)>
<0, (14, 6, 9)>
<14, (2, 12, 0)>
<5, (8, 13, 7)>
<13, (10, 2, 5)>
<12, (10, 14, 6)>
