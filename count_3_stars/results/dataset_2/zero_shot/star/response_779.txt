Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 9) (16, 19) (5, 15) (9, 16) (9, 14) (9, 10) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (0, 7) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 8) (15, 5) (15, 10) (15, 14) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 19) (6, 11) (6, 19) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 18) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 3) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 3) (18, 10) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 8) (13, 7) (13, 18) (19, 16) (19, 12) (19, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 18) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<3, (4, 2, 18)>
<6, (11, 19, 16)>
<9, (10, 14, 16)>
<10, (9, 15, 18)>
<11, (6, 2, 16)>
<15, (14, 5, 10)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
