Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 2) (4, 5) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 6) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 3) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 9) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 18) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 6) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (14, 3) (14, 5) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 18) (9, 10) (9, 2) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 9) (6, 3) (6, 19) (6, 8) (6, 18) (18, 12) (18, 0) (18, 6)
