Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<9, (5, 3, 1)>
<4, (5, 8, 0)>
<7, (3, 2, âˆ…)>
<6, (5, 3, 2)>
<8, (5, 4, 0)>
<3, (9, 7, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<0, (9, 4, 8)>
<1, (9, 3, 2)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [10].
