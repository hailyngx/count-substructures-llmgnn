Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 12) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 7) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 2) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 9) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 9) (13, 0) (13, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 7) (1, 9) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (8, 4, 10)>
<2, (6, 12, 14)>
<3, (10, 9, 14)>
<5, (1, 7, 10)>
<7, (5, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<12, (1, 3, 9)>
