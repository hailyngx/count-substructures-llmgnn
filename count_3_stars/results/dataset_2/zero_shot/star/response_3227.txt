Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 8) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 9) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 12) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 5) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 4) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 0) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 18) (0, 15) (0, 18) (10, 4) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 5) (5, 17) (5, 1) (2, 7) (7, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<11, (16, 19, 4)>
<16, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (13, 9, 16)>
<4, (11, 9, 13)>
