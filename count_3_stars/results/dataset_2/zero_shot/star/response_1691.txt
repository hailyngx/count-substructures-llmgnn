Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
