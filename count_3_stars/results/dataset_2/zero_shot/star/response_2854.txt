Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 25) (9, 15) (9, 28) (9, 16) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 8) (3, 17) (15, 9) (15, 7) (15, 17) (1, 26) (1, 13) (10, 11) (10, 22) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 27) (12, 27) (12, 20) (12, 29) (27, 11) (27, 12) (27, 25) (27, 6) (20, 12) (20, 24) (20, 5) (20, 16) (0, 14) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 29) (21, 4) (21, 18) (18, 26) (18, 21) (18, 23) (18, 6) (25, 9) (25, 27) (25, 6) (5, 26) (5, 10) (5, 20) (19, 11) (19, 29) (19, 24) (2, 23) (2, 17) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 4) (22, 10) (22, 14) (22, 16) (23, 18) (23, 2) (23, 7) (8, 26) (8, 29) (24, 20) (24, 19) (24, 7) (7, 15) (7, 23) (7, 24) (29, 12) (29, 14) (29, 19) (29, 8) (13, 1) (13, 28) (16, 9) (16, 20) (16, 22) (28, 9) (28, 13) (6, 27) (6, 0) (6, 18) (6, 25) (4, 14) (4, 21) (4, 17) 

Response:
The 3-star patterns found in the given graph are:
<9, (15, 25, 28)>
<26, (1, 5, 8)>
<10, (11, 22, 27)>
<12, (20, 27, 29)>
<14, (0, 22, 29)>
<18, (6, 21, 23)>
<16, (9, 20, 22)>
<1, (13, 26, 28)>[8]
