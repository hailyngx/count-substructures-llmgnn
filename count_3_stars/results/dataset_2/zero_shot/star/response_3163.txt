Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 16) (17, 8) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 15) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 1) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 15) (12, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 15) (3, 10) (3, 9) (16, 17) (16, 15) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 4) (15, 11) (15, 16) (19, 14) (19, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 10)>
<2, (5, 11, 18)>
<3, (9, 10, 14)>
<4, (5, 15, 19)>
<6, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (10, 11, 17)>
<13, (0, 7, 13)>
<15, (4, 11, 16)>
<16, (15, 17, 16)>
