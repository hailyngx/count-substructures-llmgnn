Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be found by identifying the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

Based on the given edges, the 3-stars in the graph are:
<5, (9, 4, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 0)>
<6, (9, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 4, 0)>
<4, (5, 6, 1)>
<8, (6, 4, 2)>
<2, (5, 3, 4)>
<7, (9, 6, 1)>
<0, (5, 9, 1)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we find a total of 9 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
