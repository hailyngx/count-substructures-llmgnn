Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (0, 27) (0, 26) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 5) (27, 8) (2, 0) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 11) (17, 29) (17, 15) (17, 21) (29, 17) (29, 6) (21, 17) (21, 24) (21, 16) (21, 13) (24, 21) (24, 9) (24, 22) (22, 24) (22, 26) (22, 12) (22, 3) (26, 0) (26, 22) (26, 13) (26, 14) (26, 12) (13, 21) (13, 26) (13, 20) (3, 22) (3, 16) (10, 15) (10, 5) (15, 2) (15, 17) (15, 10) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 19) (23, 5) (14, 26) (14, 1) (14, 5) (16, 21) (16, 3) (16, 8) (25, 19) (25, 8) (8, 27) (8, 16) (8, 25) (8, 28) (8, 20) (28, 8) (28, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (5, 27) (5, 10) (5, 23) (5, 14) (19, 11) (19, 25) (6, 7) (6, 29) (6, 20) (9, 7) (9, 24) (9, 28) (9, 20) (9, 12) (20, 13) (20, 8) (20, 6) (20, 9) (12, 22) (12, 26) (12, 9) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:

<0, (27, 2, 26)>
<2, (0, 18, 1)>
<15, (2, 17, 10)>
<26, (0, 22, 13)>
<8, (27, 16, 25)>
<21, (17, 24, 16)>
<14, (1, 5, 26)>
<11, (4, 18, 19)>
<20, (13, 8, 6)>
<12, (22, 26, 9)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
