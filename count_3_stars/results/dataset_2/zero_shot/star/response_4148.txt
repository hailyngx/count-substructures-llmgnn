Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. Let's count the number of 3-stars present in the graph:

- Node 0: (0, 6, 1), (0, 2, 8), (0, 3, 9)
- Node 1: (1, 6, 0), (1, 8, 2)
- Node 2: (2, 8, 0), (2, 7, 5), (2, 4, 3)
- Node 3: (3, 0, 9), (3, 8, 2), (3, 4, 5)
- Node 4: (4, 6, 0), (4, 2, 8), (4, 3, 5)
- Node 5: (5, 4, 3), (5, 7, 2), (5, 3, 9)
- Node 6: (6, 1, 0), (6, 4, 2), (6, 9, 3)
- Node 7: (7, 5, 2), (7, 9, 3)
- Node 8: (8, 2, 4), (8, 3, 1), (8, 0, 6)
- Node 9: (9, 3, 0), (9, 7, 5), (9, 6, 4)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 1, 8)>
<0, (2, 8, 3)>
<0, (3, 9, 0)>
<1, (6, 0, 8)>
<2, (8, 0, 3)>
<2, (7, 5, 3)>
<2, (4, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 9, 3)>
<3, (8, 2, 1)>
<3, (4, 5, 3)>
<4, (6, 0, 2)>
<4, (2, 8, 4)>
<4, (3, 5, 3)>
<5, (4, 3, 5)>
<5, (7, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 9, 5)>
<6, (1, 0, 8)>
<6, (4, 2, 6)>
<6, (9, 3, 4)>
<7, (5, 2, 7)>
<7, (9, 3, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (3, 0, 9)>
<9, (7, 5, 9)>
<9, (6, 4, 9)>
