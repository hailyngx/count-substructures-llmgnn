Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 2) (4, 1) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 14) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<8, (11, 6, 2)>
<13, (5, 6, 1)>
<2, (0, 14, 4)>
<10, (0, 14, 9)>
