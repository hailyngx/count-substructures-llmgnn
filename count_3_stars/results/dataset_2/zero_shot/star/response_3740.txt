Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (15, 10) (15, 14) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 14) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 1) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 0) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 1) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 1) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 11) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 17) (1, 12) (1, 19) (1, 13) (1, 7) (14, 15) (14, 16) (14, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 6, 18)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<6, (5, 10, 15)>
<15, (10, 14, 16)>
<16, (3, 18, 14)>
<10, (6, 15, 12)>
<8, (9, 3, 4)>
<4, (12, 0, 14)>
<12, (10, 4, 11)>
<18, (5, 16, 13)>
<19, (1, 0, 13)>
<17, (13, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
