Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 14) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 11) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 12) (11, 9) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 12) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 7, 10)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 9, 13)>
<12, (2, 5, 10)>
<13, (8, 10, 14)>
<14, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
