Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 15) (22, 13) (22, 19) (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 3) (26, 8) (0, 10) (27, 25) (27, 10) (27, 17) (27, 5) (7, 21) (7, 6) (7, 23) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 12) (21, 17) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 26) (8, 23) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 18) (23, 7) (23, 8) (23, 14) (2, 14) (18, 6) (18, 25) (18, 29) (28, 29) (29, 18) (29, 28) (29, 17) (29, 24) (17, 27) (17, 21) (17, 6) (17, 29) (24, 26) (24, 29) (24, 4) (24, 1) (24, 5) (20, 19) (20, 16) (25, 27) (25, 18) (5, 26) (5, 27) (5, 24) (4, 24) (4, 12) (4, 15) (4, 3) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 4) (19, 22) (19, 20) (10, 0) (10, 27) (10, 16) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 24) (1, 14) (14, 23) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 15) (3, 26) (3, 4) (16, 20) (16, 10) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 14) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the total number of 3-stars is [6].

<13, (1, 8, 15)>
<26, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (6, 8, 12)>
<27, (5, 17, 25)>
<7, (1, 6, 23)>
<24, (1, 4, 5)>
