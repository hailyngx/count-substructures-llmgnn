Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 19) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 16) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 1) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 17) (11, 3) (11, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (5, 18) (5, 17) (1, 18) (1, 10) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 19) (14, 16) (14, 10) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 10) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 17) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 15) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 15) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 15) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 16) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
