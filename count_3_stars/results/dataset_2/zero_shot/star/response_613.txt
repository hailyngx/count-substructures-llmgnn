Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 3) (0, 6) (0, 11) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

[6]

The unique 3-stars are: 
<5, (9, 11, 8)>
<6, (9, 1, 14)>
<8, (9, 13, 11)>
<13, (8, 4, 10)>
<4, (13, 10, 14)>
<7, (9, 6, 14)>
