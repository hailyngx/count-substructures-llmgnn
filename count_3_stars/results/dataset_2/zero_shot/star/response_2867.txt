Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

<4, (2, 10, 14)>
<7, (1, 12, 14)>
<1, (7, 2, 10)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (0, 8, 11)>
<9, (2, 3, 11)>
<12, (7, 13, 14)>
<13, (0, 5, 12)>
