Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
The given graph represents the following connections between nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6.

Now, let's count the 3-stars in this graph. 

There are a total of [4] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
