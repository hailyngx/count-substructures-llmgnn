Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 2) (6, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 8, 4)>
<4, (5, 1, 0)>
<7, (8, 1, 4)>
<1, (4, 3, 7)>
<3, (5, 1, 0)>
<2, (5, 9, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<8, (5, 9, 7)>
