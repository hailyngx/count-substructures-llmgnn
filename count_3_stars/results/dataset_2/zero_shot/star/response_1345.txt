Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:

<6, (5, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 5, 1)>
<9, (8, 2, 1)>
<0, (9, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 0, 3)> 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
