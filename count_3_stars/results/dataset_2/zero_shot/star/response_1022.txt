Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (18, 19) (18, 7) (5, 17) (5, 15) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 12) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 18) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 14) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 14) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 10) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 17) (3, 4) (3, 14) (17, 8) (17, 5) (17, 19) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 3) (14, 10) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 15) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are [20] nodes and [60] edges in the graph. 

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star.

Here is the list of unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 11, 13)>
<1, (8, 9, 15)>
<2, (4, 11, 14)>
<3, (4, 14, 15)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 15, 17)>
<6, (10, 12, 16)>
<7, (12, 14, 18)>
<8, (1, 4, 17)>
<9, (1, 9, 12)>
<10, (6, 14, 16)>
<11, (0, 2, 13)>
<12, (6, 7, 9)>
<13, (0, 11, 19)>
<14, (2, 7, 15)>
<15, (5, 9, 14)>
<16, (7, 10, 12)>
<17, (5, 8, 19)>
<18, (7, 18, 19)>
<19, (13, 17, 18)>

Therefore, there are [20] 3-stars in the graph.
