Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 18) (1, 16) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (18, 14) (18, 17) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 11) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 8) (19, 11) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 9) (0, 19) (0, 13) (11, 15) (11, 19) (5, 17) (5, 3) (5, 2) (16, 4) (16, 1) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 19) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 0) (6, 19)
