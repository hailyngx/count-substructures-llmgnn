Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (11, 12) (11, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 4) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 0) 

Response:
The central nodes in the 3-star graphs can be calculated by examining the degrees of the nodes in the given graph. Since the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a 3-star graph, the nodes with degree three in the graph are central nodes. From the given edges, the degrees of the nodes are:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 6
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 5

Since the central nodes must have a degree of 3, the possible central nodes are: 0, 3, 8, 10, 11, 12.

Now, we can identify the 3-stars by finding the leaves connected to each central node:

<0, (9, 5, 4)>
<3, (14, 2, 4)>
<8, (10, 1, 7)>
<10, (13, 14, 8)>
<11, (12, 4, 3)>
<12, (7, 14, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
