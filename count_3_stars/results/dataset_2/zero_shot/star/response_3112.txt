Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 1) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 8) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 10, 13)>
<10, (9, 5, 13)>
<4, (7, 12, 13)>
<13, (5, 9, 10)>
