Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph, listed below:

<1, (4, 6, 2)>
<5, (7, 1, 0)>
<6, (4, 1, 3)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (4, 8, 2)>
<4, (7, 1, 9)>
<0, (5, 9, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
