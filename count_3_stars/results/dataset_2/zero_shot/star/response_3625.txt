Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (8, 3) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 1) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 2) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 13) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<4, (9, 10, 11)>
<6, (4, 7, 10)>
<10, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
