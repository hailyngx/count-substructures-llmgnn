Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 14) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 6) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 18) (18, 16) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 15) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 0) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 17) (17, 19) (17, 12) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 1) (2, 0) (14, 16) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 10) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 15) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 15) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 6) (15, 9) (10, 14) (10, 6) (12, 8) (12, 17) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-star graphs in the given graph.

<11, (16, 3, 2)>
<4, (8, 9, 13)>
<13, (8, 7, 18)>
<18, (16, 13, 19)>
