Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 7) (15, 27) (15, 26) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 14) (27, 5) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 26) (8, 6) (23, 8) (23, 17) (23, 16) (23, 19) (20, 17) (20, 29) (20, 7) (20, 12) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 25) (14, 27) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 24) (14, 10) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 26) (18, 4) (18, 24) (18, 29) (9, 7) (11, 7) (11, 6) (28, 6) (28, 3) (17, 23) (17, 20) (6, 13) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 28) (29, 20) (29, 0) (29, 18) (10, 14) (10, 21) (10, 24) (10, 16) (21, 27) (21, 10) (12, 20) (12, 4) (3, 4) (3, 28) (26, 15) (26, 8) (26, 4) (7, 22) (7, 20) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 1) (5, 27) (5, 2) (5, 25) (16, 23) (16, 10) (16, 24) (24, 14) (24, 18) (24, 10) (24, 16) (1, 14) (1, 7) (19, 23) (25, 13) (25, 0) (25, 5) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<13, (22, 8, 6)>, <27, (15, 21, 14)>, <8, (13, 23, 2)>, <20, (17, 29, 7)>, <14, (27, 1, 0)>, <4, (18, 12, 26)>, <10, (14, 21, 24)>, <7, (22, 9, 11)>, <29, (20, 18, 0)>, <16, (23, 24, 10)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
