Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 7, 0)>
<4, (9, 8, 1)>
<8, (9, 4, 5)>
<5, (6, 8, 1)>
<2, (4, 8, 3)>
<0, (6, 5, 1)>
