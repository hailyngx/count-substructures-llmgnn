Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 1) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 1, 11)>
<6, (14, 2, 13)>
<10, (9, 11, 4)>
<11, (5, 10, 7)>
<2, (6, 8, 0)>
<8, (10, 2, 12)>
<0, (2, 8, 13)>
<1, (5, 14, 4)>
<3, (7, 14, 4)>
<7, (5, 11, 3)>
<14, (6, 1, 3)>
<12, (5, 9, 8)>
