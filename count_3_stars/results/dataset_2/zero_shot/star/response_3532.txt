Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 25) (1, 2) (25, 1) (25, 28) (25, 22) (25, 2) (10, 19) (10, 16) (11, 24) (11, 22) (11, 26) (0, 24) (0, 23) (20, 4) (20, 6) (20, 16) (3, 27) (3, 29) (14, 26) (14, 7) (14, 24) (26, 11) (26, 14) (26, 5) (5, 26) (5, 22) (5, 27) (5, 7) (2, 1) (2, 25) (2, 17) (12, 19) (16, 10) (16, 20) (16, 21) (21, 16) (21, 27) (8, 24) (8, 18) (28, 25) (28, 17) (28, 22) (28, 18) (24, 11) (24, 0) (24, 14) (24, 8) (24, 23) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 27) (15, 9) (15, 23) (15, 6) (15, 4) (23, 0) (23, 24) (23, 15) (23, 4) (6, 20) (6, 15) (6, 29) (29, 3) (29, 6) (29, 13) (29, 22) (19, 10) (19, 12) (27, 3) (27, 5) (27, 21) (27, 9) (27, 17) (13, 9) (13, 29) (7, 14) (7, 5) (22, 25) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 28) (22, 29) (17, 2) (17, 28) (17, 27) (4, 20) (4, 15) (4, 23) (18, 8) (18, 28) 

Response:
There are 8 total 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (24, 23, 15)>
<1, (25, 2, 17)>
<3, (27, 21, 16)>
<5, (26, 22, 28)>
<6, (15, 29, 4)>
<9, (27, 13, 15)>
<10, (16, 20, 21)>
<11, (24, 22, 26)>

Therefore, the final count is [8].
