Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 15) (14, 17) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (4, 12) (4, 5) (8, 11) (8, 10) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 10) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 16) (15, 10) (15, 2) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 19) (18, 5) (2, 15) (2, 9) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star has degree 3, so we need to look for nodes in the graph with exactly 3 incident edges. 

The nodes with degree 3 are: 11, 16, 5, 6, 0, 7, 10, 12, and 13.

By examining each node and its incident edges, we find the following 3-stars:
<11, (16, 8, 12)>
<16, (11, 17, 19)>
<5, (14, 4, 18)>
<6, (17, 5, 0)>
<7, (1, 0, 10)>
<10, (8, 5, 15)>
<12, (11, 3, 4)>
<13, (11, 3, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
