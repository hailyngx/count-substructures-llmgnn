Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 6) (17, 5) (10, 9) (2, 15) (2, 4) (8, 0) (1, 0) (1, 18) (1, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 5) (5, 17) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 6) (15, 2) (15, 12) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 16) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 11) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 11) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 11) (3, 16) (3, 6) (11, 12) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 9) 

Response:
There are [14] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 7, 16)>
<1, (0, 7, 18)>
<2, (4, 12, 15)>
<3, (6, 11, 16)>
<4, (2, 5, 12)>
<5, (4, 7, 13)>
<6, (3, 11, 17)>
<7, (0, 5, 14)>
<9, (10, 14, 18)>
<11, (6, 9, 12)>
<12, (4, 11, 15)>
<13, (5, 6, 19)>
<14, (7, 9, 17)>
<18, (1, 11, 19)>
