Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 21) (26, 28) (26, 7) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 20) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 11) (2, 14) (2, 29) (2, 18) (29, 2) (29, 20) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 5) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 15) (22, 9) (22, 23) (22, 27) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 4) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 24) (3, 1) (3, 18) (0, 17) (0, 20) (0, 7) (20, 14) (20, 29) (20, 1) (20, 0) (18, 2) (18, 3) (18, 4) (4, 23) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 8) (7, 26) (7, 0) (7, 16) (21, 9) (21, 4) (28, 26) (28, 8) (28, 15) (5, 10) (5, 24) (13, 11) (13, 27) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 28) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 25) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 24) (12, 8) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 12) (8, 27) (6, 14) (6, 11) (25, 22) (25, 16) (25, 19) (27, 22) (27, 13) (27, 8) (24, 1) (24, 5) (24, 12) (19, 25)
