Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 13) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 16) (6, 19) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 13) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 14) (17, 9) (17, 2) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 5) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 11) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 5) (14, 10) (14, 15) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 15) (1, 2) (1, 11) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 19) (19, 4) (19, 6) (19, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 16) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 8) (15, 14) (15, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (6, 13, 19)>
<2, (0, 1, 17)>
