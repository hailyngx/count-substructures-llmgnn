Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 13) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 10) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 3) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of 12 3-stars in the given graph. 

[12]

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 9, 1)>
<6, (9, 11, 12)>
<9, (4, 7, 6)>
<0, (4, 7, 14)>
<1, (4, 1, 3)>
<3, (9, 1, 13)>
<2, (8, 12, 5)>
<8, (6, 1, 2)>
<10, (6, 11, 5)>
<11, (4, 6, 13)>
<5, (10, 1, 2)>
<13, (6, 11, 3)>
