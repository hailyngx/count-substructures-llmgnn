Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The center node of each 3-star can be identified by finding the nodes with exactly 3 incident edges. Counting the number of 3-stars:

[<0, (5, 2, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 3)>, <2, (5, 8, 6)>, <3, (9, 4, 1)>, <4, (9, 1, 6)>, <5, (2, 0, 6)>, <6, (4, 3, 2)>, <7, (1, 4, 0)>, <8, (9, 4, 2)>, <9, (8, 3, 4)>]

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
