Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 12) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 13) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 2) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (9, 5, 6)>
<1, (9, 3, 7)>
<2, (11, 6, 10)>
<3, (9, 1, 7)>
<4, (8, 12, 13)>
<5, (8, 10, 14)>
<6, (0, 2, 12)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (5, 8, 3)>
<9, (5, 1, 7)>
<10, (2, 6, 5)>
<11, (1, 3, 4)>
<12, (6, 7, 4)>
<13, (2, 14, 4)>
<14, (5, 12, 13)>
