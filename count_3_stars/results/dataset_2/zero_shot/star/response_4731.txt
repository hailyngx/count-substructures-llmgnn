Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 2, 1)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<7, (6, 9, 4)>
<1, (9, 4, 3)>
<0, (6, 9, 3)>
