Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 13) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 13) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 9) 

Response:
There are [11] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 8, 13)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 10)>
<5, (0, 6, 11)>
<6, (5, 8, 14)>
<7, (0, 1, 11)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, 7, 13)>
<10, (4, 10, 13)>
