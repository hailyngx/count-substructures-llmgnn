Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 19) (16, 0) (16, 2) (5, 4) (5, 17) (9, 8) (9, 17) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 14) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 18) (4, 5) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 13) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 18) (15, 14) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 13) (2, 16) (2, 0) (2, 19) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 2) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 15) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 16, 19)>
<1, (6, 13, 8)>
<3, (0, 11, 13)>
<7, (0, 12, 14)>
<10, (0, 14, 17)>
<14, (7, 10, 15)>
