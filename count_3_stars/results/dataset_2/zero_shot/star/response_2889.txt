Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 13) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 15) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 15) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 16) (12, 18) (12, 8) (16, 18) (16, 15) (16, 2) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 0) (7, 11) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 7) (2, 14) (2, 16) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph can be obtained by counting the number of nodes that are connected to three other nodes.
There are 4 such nodes in the graph:
1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 19, and 1.
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 18, and 13.
3. Node 15 is connected to nodes 9, 19, and 13.
4. Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 2.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (6, 19, 1)>
<4, (9, 18, 13)>
<15, (9, 19, 13)>
<14, (6, 1, 2)>
