Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 13) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 4) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) 

Response:
