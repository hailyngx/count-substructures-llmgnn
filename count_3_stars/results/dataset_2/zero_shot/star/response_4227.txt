Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 14) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 10) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 4) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 1) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 3) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 5) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) 

Response:
