Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 3, 0)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 0)>
<6, (7, 1, 9)>
