Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 15) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 10) (17, 11) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 15) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 19) (7, 9) (7, 15) (7, 16) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 7) (18, 12) (18, 0) (19, 6) (19, 12) (14, 4) (14, 11) (0, 6) (0, 18) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (3, 1, 12)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 17, 19)>
<8, (13, 16, 17)>
<13, (2, 8, 15)>
<10, (12, 17, 10)>
<17, (6, 8, 11)>
<4, (13, 9, 14)>
<3, (11, 5, 16)>
<1, (11, 5, 15)>
<12, (10, 5, 18)>
<7, (16, 9, 15)>
<16, (3, 7, 8)>
<18, (0, 12, 18)>
