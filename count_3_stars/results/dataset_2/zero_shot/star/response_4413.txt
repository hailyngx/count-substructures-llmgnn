Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are listed below:

<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<9, (8, 7, 0)>
<6, (5, 1, 3)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<0, (9, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
