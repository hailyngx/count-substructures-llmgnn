Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 14) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 12) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 12) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 10) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are 7 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
<6, (10, 11, 8)>
<9, (2, 13, 12)>
<4, (7, 0, 11)>
<7, (4, 0, 10)>
<1, (3, 14, 5)>
<3, (4, 1, 10)>
<5, (1, 14, 11)>
Therefore, the final answer is [7].
