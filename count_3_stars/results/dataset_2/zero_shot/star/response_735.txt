Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (9, 0) (26, 12) (1, 21) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 6) (21, 25) (21, 14) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 28) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 16) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 19) (22, 23) (22, 27) (22, 0) (23, 22) (8, 15) (8, 28) (8, 20) (8, 25) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 13) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 20) (6, 21) (6, 15) (6, 28) (6, 13) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 6) (7, 18) (7, 25) (7, 5) (7, 17) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 7) (25, 12) (29, 9) (29, 24) (27, 22) (27, 18) (27, 2) (24, 11) (24, 29) (24, 12) (24, 5) (24, 2) (20, 8) (20, 19) (20, 14) (14, 21) (14, 20) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 22) (0, 4) (0, 13) (5, 7) (5, 24) (12, 26) (12, 25) (12, 24) (12, 13) (13, 18) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 12) (17, 4) (17, 19) (17, 7) (2, 27) (2, 24) (16, 15) 

Response:
There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<3, (15, 8, 16)>
<4, (18, 0, 17)>
<6, (21, 15, 28)>
<7, (25, 17, 5)>
<8, (15, 28, 20)>
<11, (3, 10, 24)>
<12, (25, 24, 13)>
<13, (18, 0, 12)>
<15, (6, 21, 28)>
<18, (4, 27, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
