Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 6) (1, 29) (1, 27) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 11) (21, 25) (22, 10) (22, 15) (22, 29) (23, 3) (23, 28) (10, 22) (10, 17) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 13) (20, 0) (20, 7) (20, 3) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 27) (2, 14) (18, 9) (18, 14) (13, 0) (13, 26) (13, 28) (26, 13) (26, 5) (26, 11) (26, 8) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 11) (5, 26) (5, 8) (19, 8) (19, 9) (9, 18) (9, 19) (9, 29) (29, 1) (29, 22) (29, 9) (29, 11) (8, 26) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 25) (16, 21) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 27) (6, 1) (6, 24) (24, 6) (24, 12) (24, 28) (12, 16) (12, 24) (12, 28) (12, 3) (11, 21) (11, 26) (11, 7) (11, 29) (15, 22) (3, 23) (3, 20) (3, 12) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 16) (25, 21) (25, 8) (4, 17) (27, 1) (27, 2) (27, 16) (28, 23) (28, 13) (28, 24) (28, 12) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 24, 29)>
<10, (2, 17, 22)>
<12, (3, 24, 28)>
<16, (14, 16, 27)>
<21, (11, 25, 29)>
<26, (11, 29, 8)>
