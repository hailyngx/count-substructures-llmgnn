Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 12) (16, 13) (5, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 19) (6, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 16) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 17) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 8) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 15) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 1) (15, 14) (15, 4) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 13) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 4) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 18) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 13) (4, 15) (4, 19) (13, 16) (13, 6) (13, 18) (13, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<11, (8, 17, 18)>
<1, (7, 9, 14)>
<12, (2, 7, 17)>
<18, (13, 16, 19)>
