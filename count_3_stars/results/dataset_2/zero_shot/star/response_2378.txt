Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 9) (16, 6) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 13) (7, 12) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 15) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 9) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 13) (19, 18) (19, 13) (15, 12) (15, 14) (14, 2) (14, 15) (6, 16) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 4) (0, 1) (0, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (9, 16) (9, 13) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (12, 14, 15)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (5, 1, 0)>
<5, (11, 5, 8)>
<6, (6, 3, 12)>
<7, (12, 15, 14)>
<8, (13, 17, 19)>
<9, (16, 6, 9)>
<10, (2, 10, 14)>
<11, (18, 11, 2)>
<12, (13, 19, 18)>
