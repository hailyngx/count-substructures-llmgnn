Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 5) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 3) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 14) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (14, 8) (14, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 12) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 10)>
<3, (7, 11, 13)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (6, 13, 14)>
<9, (0, 11, 12)>
<2, (1, 5, 14)>
