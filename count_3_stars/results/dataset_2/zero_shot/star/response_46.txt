Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by finding all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's determine the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<1, (3, 6, 4)>
<2, (5, 13, 14)>
<3, (1, 4, 10)>
<4, (1, 3, 10)>
<5, (2, 8, 10)>
<6, (1, 8, 6)>
<7, (9, 13, 11)>
<8, (5, 6, 11)>
<9, (5, 1, 7)>
<10, (5, 3, 4)>
<11, (9, 11, 14)>
<12, (1, 11, 2)>
<13, (5, 2, 7)>
<14, (0, 11, 4)>

Counting the above unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [(14)].
