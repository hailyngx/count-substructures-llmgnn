Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 0) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 18) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 17) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 1) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 13) (17, 11) (17, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) (8, 19) (8, 12) (15, 19) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 3) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 17) (3, 5) (3, 19) (3, 6) (3, 16) (6, 14) (6, 3) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 3) 

Response:
There are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 13, 2)>
<5, (9, 18, 3)>
<7, (11, 14, 18)>
<11, (7, 10, 12)>
<18, (5, 7, 1)>
<9, (5, 16, 0)>
<14, (7, 0, 13)>
<1, (11, 18, 13)>
<8, (19, 12, 8)>
<3, (5, 19, 6)>
