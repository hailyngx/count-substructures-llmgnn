Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
