Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 16) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 5) (1, 4) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 7) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 4) (2, 16) (18, 7) (18, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (16, 3) (16, 10) (16, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (14, 19) (14, 13) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 9) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 14) (5, 15) (5, 11) (5, 12) (9, 10) (9, 7) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 5) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 11) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 14)
