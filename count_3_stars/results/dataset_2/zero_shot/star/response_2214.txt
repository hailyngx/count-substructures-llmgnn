Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 

<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<4, (6, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars is [2].
