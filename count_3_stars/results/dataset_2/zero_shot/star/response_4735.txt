Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 15) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 17) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 16) (15, 5) (15, 19) (13, 19) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 0) (0, 17) (0, 11) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 1) (16, 3) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 12) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 6) (3, 16) (3, 19) (7, 10) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) (12, 14) (12, 10) (6, 19) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

<5, (9, 2, 17)>
<8, (9, 4, 1)>
<1, (2, 8, 16)>
<16, (18, 5, 1)>
<14, (4, 8, 11)>
