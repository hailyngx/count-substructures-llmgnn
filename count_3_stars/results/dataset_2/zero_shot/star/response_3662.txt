Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 5) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 1) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 14) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 9) (2, 1) (2, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 3) (9, 14) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

<5, (8, 6, 1)>
<12, (9, 4, 14)>
<1, (7, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 14, 8)>
<8, (5, 14, 6)>
<14, (13, 9, 12)>
