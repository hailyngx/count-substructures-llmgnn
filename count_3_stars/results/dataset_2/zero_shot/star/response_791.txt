Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 19) (7, 17) (14, 9) (14, 8) (17, 7) (17, 15) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 0) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 2) (0, 18) (0, 15) (1, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 8) (16, 6) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 6) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 15) (2, 3) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 2) (15, 6) (15, 12) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 13) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 3) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 15) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 13) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (4, 5, 13)>
<4, (3, 18, 19)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (5, 17, 19)>
<8, (6, 11, 16)>
<9, (12, 14, 15)>
<11, (6, 8, 12)>
<12, (11, 13, 15)>
<14, (8, 9, 17)>
<18, (0, 4, 6)>
