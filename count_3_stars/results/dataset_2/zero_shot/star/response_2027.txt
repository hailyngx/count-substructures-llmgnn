Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 3) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<9, (5, 12, 2)>
<4, (7, 12, 13)>
<7, (4, 10, 2)>
<8, (13, 1, 11)>
<10, (7, 12, 14)>
<11, (4, 13, 6)>
<6, (5, 11, 14)>
<12, (9, 4, 10)>
<1, (7, 8, 0)>
<0, (5, 1, 3)>
<3, (5, 13, 12)>
<13, (8, 11, 14)>
<14, (13, 10, 6)>
<2, (9, 7, 11)>
