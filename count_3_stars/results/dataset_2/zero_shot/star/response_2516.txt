Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 0, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
