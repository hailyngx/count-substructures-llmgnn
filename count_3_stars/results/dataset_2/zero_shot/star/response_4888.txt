Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 1) (11, 18) (11, 4) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 6) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 15) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 9) (5, 13) (5, 14) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (12, 2) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 19) (19, 18) (19, 12) (19, 1) (0, 12) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 15) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 16) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 14) (9, 18) (9, 3) (9, 7) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 13) (6, 17) (6, 7) (15, 8) (15, 2) (15, 0) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 14) 

Response:
There are [11] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<8, (18, 2, 15)>
<13, (5, 17, 6)>
<(12, 4, 11), 2>
<5, (13, 14, 17)>
<(0, 16, 3), 12>
<19, (18, 12, 1)>
<(14, 16, 1), 5>
<(3, 7, 9), 17>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (12, 8, 15)>
<1, (10, 14, 19)>
