Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 15) (1, 12) (1, 16) (17, 5) (17, 18) (13, 5) (13, 19) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (15, 14) (15, 4) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 8) (19, 13) (19, 18) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 6) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 18) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 4) (4, 15) (4, 6) (4, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 11) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 4)
