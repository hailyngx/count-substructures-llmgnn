Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 16) (4, 7) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 16) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (10, 3) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 18) (16, 9) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 15) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 19) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 19) (17, 9) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 11) (1, 5) (1, 11) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 17) (11, 1) (11, 18) (2, 4) (2, 17) (19, 0) (19, 6) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 18) (14, 13) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 3) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 9, 12)>, <9, (5, 15, 17)>, <16, (7, 8, 13)>, <12, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (6, 10, 18)>
