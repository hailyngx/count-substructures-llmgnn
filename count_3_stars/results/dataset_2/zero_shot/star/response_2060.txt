Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
There is a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 8, 6)>
<0, (1, 8, 2)>
