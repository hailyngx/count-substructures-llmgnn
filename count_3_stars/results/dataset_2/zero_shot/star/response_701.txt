Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
