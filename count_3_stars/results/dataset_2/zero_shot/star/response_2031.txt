Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 2)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
