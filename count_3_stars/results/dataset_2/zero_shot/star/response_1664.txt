Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 7) (11, 4) (11, 0) (14, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 11) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 10) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<6, (5, 1, 3)>
<12, (13, 4, 0)>
<4, (12, 0, 14)>
