Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 0) 

Response:
[4]
Unique 3-stars: <6, (9, 3, 2)>, <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <1, (3, 5, 4)>, <3, (6, 1, 0)>
