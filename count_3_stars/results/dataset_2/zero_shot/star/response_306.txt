Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 3) (9, 12) (26, 5) (26, 21) (14, 17) (14, 3) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 22) (17, 27) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 13) (20, 17) (20, 6) (6, 20) (6, 21) (6, 23) (6, 13) (21, 26) (21, 6) (21, 11) (21, 15) (15, 21) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 24) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 24) (8, 10) (8, 19) (8, 29) (8, 22) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 1) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (12, 9) (12, 16) (12, 4) (5, 26) (5, 29) (5, 27) (22, 17) (22, 8) (22, 24) (24, 15) (24, 16) (24, 22) (24, 1) (7, 28) (29, 8) (29, 5) (29, 13) (11, 21) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 25) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 4) (27, 17) (27, 5) (1, 19) (1, 4) (1, 24) (1, 25) (1, 0) (25, 11) (25, 1) (25, 23) (25, 18) (0, 15) (0, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 29) (18, 10) (18, 25) (2, 11) (2, 23) (2, 28) (23, 6) (23, 25) (23, 2) (28, 7) (28, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 15, 24)>
<1, (4, 19, 24)>
<2, (11, 23, 28)>
<5, (26, 27, 29)>
<6, (13, 21, 23)>
<8, (10, 19, 29)>
<11, (19, 21, 25)>
<15, (0, 16, 24)>
<17, (14, 20, 27)>
<22, (8, 24, 27)>
