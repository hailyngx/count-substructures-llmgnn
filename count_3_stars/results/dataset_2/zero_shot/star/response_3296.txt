Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 12) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [2].

The unique 3-stars are <6, (9, 5, 14)> and <10, (9, 1, 11)>.
