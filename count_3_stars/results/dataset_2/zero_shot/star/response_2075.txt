Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 9) (14, 13) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 9) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 1) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<1, (13, 0, 8)>, <1, (10, 0, 8)>, <1, (13, 8, 1)>, <1, (13, 8, 5)>]

There are a total of 4 3-stars in the graph. So, the answer is [4].
