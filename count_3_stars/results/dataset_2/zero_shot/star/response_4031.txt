Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 11) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 12) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 0) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 12) (2, 11) (2, 10) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars: 
[<5, (9, 13, 0)>, <13, (12, 10, 5)>, <1, (8, 11, 14)>, <6, (4, 14, 3)>, <0, (8, 5, 11)>]
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
