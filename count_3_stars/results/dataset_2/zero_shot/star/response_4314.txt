Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 26) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 17) (3, 23) (15, 27) (15, 8) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 7) (18, 22) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 25) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 2) (10, 24) (8, 15) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 19) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 0) (5, 20) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 19) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 0) (14, 23) (26, 11) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 25) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 20) (17, 19) (20, 11) (20, 27) (20, 5) (20, 17) (9, 11) (9, 29) (9, 12) (29, 9) (29, 7) (29, 12) (2, 22) (2, 13) (2, 28) (2, 21) (23, 3) (23, 5) (23, 14) (23, 26) (1, 25) (1, 28) (1, 7) (7, 27) (7, 18) (7, 29) (7, 1) (21, 13) (21, 2) (25, 18) (25, 26) (25, 1) (24, 10) (12, 9) (12, 29) (28, 15) (28, 2) (28, 1) (28, 19) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 28) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be deduced from the number of times a node appears as the central node in a 3-star. Since each 3-star contains one central node, the number of 3-stars is equal to the number of times a node is the center of a 3-star.

First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, indicating they can potentially be the center of a 3-star:

Nodes connected to 3 other nodes:
- Node 18
- Node 13
- Node 7
- Node 22
- Node 2
- Node 29

Next, we will list the 3-stars in the graph:

<18, (22, 6, 7)>
<13, (17, 19, 2)>
<7, (27, 1, 29)>
<22, (26, 2, 18)>
<2, (13, 21, 28)>
<29, (9, 12, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
