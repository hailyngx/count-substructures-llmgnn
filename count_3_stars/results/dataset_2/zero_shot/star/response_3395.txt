Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 18) (7, 18) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 19) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 18) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 17) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 16) (16, 0) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 17) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 2) (19, 3) (19, 15) (6, 17) (6, 2) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 8) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 13) (14, 3) (14, 10) (8, 15) (8, 17) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by looking at the nodes connected to each node and then counting the number of 3-stars.

In this case, the 3-stars are as follows:
<1, (3, 5, 12)>
<2, (5, 6, 13)>
<3, (1, 9, 14)>
<4, (18, 7, 5)>
<5, (9, 17, 1)>
<6, (2, 17, 15)>
<7, (13, 18, 6)>
<8, (15, 17, 5)>
<9, (11, 3, 5)>
<10, (14, 18, 0)>
<11, (18, 9, 0)>
<12, (17, 5, 1)>
<13, (7, 1, 2)>
<14, (10, 3, 14)>
<15, (8, 2, 15)>
<16, (0, 16, 0)>
<17, (18, 6, 12)>
<18, (4, 11, 7)>
<19, (3, 15, 15)>

Therefore, there are [19] 3-stars in the given graph.
