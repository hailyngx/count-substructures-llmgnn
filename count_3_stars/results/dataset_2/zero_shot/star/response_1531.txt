Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<5, (1, 4, 3)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (9, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 1)>
<8, (9, 7, 3)>
<0, (9, 7, 1)>

There are total 8 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [8].
