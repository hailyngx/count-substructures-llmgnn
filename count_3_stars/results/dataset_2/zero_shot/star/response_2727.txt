Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 10) (10, 7) (10, 12) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be determined by finding the number of nodes that can serve as the center of a 3-star and then counting the number of 3-stars around those centers. 

Let's first determine the nodes that can serve as the center of a 3-star. A node can be the center of a 3-star if it has exactly 3 edges connected to it. From the given graph, the following nodes have exactly 3 edges:
- Node 5
- Node 9
- Node 1
- Node 4
- Node 8
- Node 7
- Node 10

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars around these potential centers:
1. Node 5: <5, (9, 2, 3)>  [1]
2. Node 9: <9, (5, 11, 0)>  [2]
3. Node 1: <1, (3, 2, 4)>  [3]
4. Node 4: <4, (1, 3, 8)>  [4]
5. Node 8: <8, (4, 6, 6)>  (Note: Node 6 is repeated, so we only count it once) [5]
6. Node 7: <7, (14, 0, 10)>  [6]
7. Node 10: <10, (12, 7, 12)>  [7]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
