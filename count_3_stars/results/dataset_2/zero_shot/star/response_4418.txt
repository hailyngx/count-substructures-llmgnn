Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 19) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 17) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 15) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 16) (0, 10) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 11) (16, 0) (16, 15) (19, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 4) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 2) (11, 15) (11, 18) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 18) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 5) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 14) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 3) (17, 7) (17, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 total 3-stars in the given graph.
