Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding all possible combinations of the given nodes with one of them as the center. 

The 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 13)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 14)>
<3, (1, 6, 12)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 9, 11)>
<6, (1, 3, 10)>
<7, (10, 11, 14)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 5, 10)>
<10, (6, 7, 13)>
<11, (5, 7, 13)>
<12, (3, 6, 11)>
<13, (4, 10, 11)>
<14, (2, 7, 12)>

Counting each unique 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
