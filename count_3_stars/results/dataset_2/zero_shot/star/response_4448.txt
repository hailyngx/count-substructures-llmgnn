Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are: 

<5, (9, 1, 4)>  
<9, (5, 8, 7)>  
<4, (5, 9, 7)>  
<7, (9, 4, 6)>  
<1, (5, 9, 7)>  
<3, (1, 0, 2)>  
<8, (9, 4, 6)>  
<2, (4, 3, 6)>  
<0, (5, 1, 3)>  
<6, (7, 8, 2)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
