Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 17) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 16) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 3) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (19, 2) (19, 1) (13, 11) (13, 17) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (16, 4) (3, 18) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 8) (7, 9) (7, 18) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 14) (1, 19) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (15, 12) (12, 17) (12, 3) (12, 15) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (1, 5, 19)>
<2, (1, 10, 14)>
<3, (12, 17, 18)>
<4, (11, 14, 16)>
<7, (9, 18, 3)>
<8, (5, 14, 8)>
<11, (4, 10, 13)>
<17, (11, 13, 17)>
