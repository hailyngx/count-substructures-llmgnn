Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 24) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 29) (7, 23) (1, 3) (1, 10) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 28) (21, 0) (21, 2) (21, 17) (12, 3) (12, 27) (12, 8) (27, 25) (27, 12) (27, 26) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 26) (8, 22) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (17, 21) (29, 7) (29, 13) (29, 5) (6, 15) (6, 28) (6, 18) (6, 13) (28, 25) (28, 6) (28, 0) (22, 8) (22, 26) (22, 16) (26, 27) (26, 8) (26, 22) (23, 7) (23, 20) (0, 21) (0, 28) (20, 23) (20, 13) (20, 18) (2, 4) (2, 21) (2, 10) (2, 14) (19, 24) (19, 13) (24, 15) (24, 19) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 16) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 18) (14, 16) (18, 6) (18, 20) (18, 14) (5, 29) (16, 25) (16, 22) (16, 9) (16, 14) (11, 4) (11, 9) (13, 29) (13, 6) (13, 20) (13, 19) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 unique 3-stars. The count is calculated by considering that a 3-star can have its central node and leaf nodes in any order.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 10, 25)>
<2, (4, 10, 21)>
<3, (1, 12, 25)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (15, 13, 28)>
<7, (4, 7, 29)>
<8, (4, 8, 22)>
<9, (10, 14, 16)>
<13, (6, 13, 20)>
<15, (3, 15, 24)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
