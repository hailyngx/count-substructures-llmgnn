Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
