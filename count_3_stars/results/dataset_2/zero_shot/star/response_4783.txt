Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in this graph. The final answer is [2].

Unique 3-stars found:
