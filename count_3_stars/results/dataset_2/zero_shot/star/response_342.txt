Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<9, (1, 7, 0)>
<4, (7, 0, 1)>
<7, (9, 4, 0)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<6, (5, 4, 3)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<8, (5, 9, 2)>
<0, (9, 4, 3)>
<3, (0, 6, 3)>
