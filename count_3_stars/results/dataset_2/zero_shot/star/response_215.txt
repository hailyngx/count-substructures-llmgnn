Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 2) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 4) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 16) (4, 17) (4, 15) (18, 7) (18, 3) (3, 11) (3, 18) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 13) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 15) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 14) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 16) (0, 9) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 2) (2, 11) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 14) (13, 9) (13, 19) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars: 
<6, (9, 15, 19)>
<9, (6, 10, 13)>
<16, (1, 12, 14)>
<19, (8, 13, 14)>
