Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 11) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 4) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) (4, 11) (4, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 1) 

Response:
The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges are 9, 6, 8, 13, 10, 11, 0, 14, 2, and 3. 
Therefore, there are 10 different 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 6, 10)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
<6, (9, 14, 7)>
<8, (6, 10, 13)>
<13, (6, 8, 11)>
<10, (9, 8, 11)>
<11, (13, 10, 0)>
<0, (11, 14, 1)>
<14, (6, 13, 0)>
<2, (11, 0, 7)>

Thus, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
