Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 13)>
<6, (9, 1, 4)>
<3, (5, 4, 12)>
<10, (11, 8, 1)>
<11, (5, 10, 13)>
<2, (11, 8, 4)>
<8, (9, 10, 2)>
<0, (14, 1, 12)>
<14, (0, 12, 1)>
<4, (6, 10, 2)>
<1, (6, 10, 8)>
