Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 3) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 8) (17, 9) (17, 18) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 18) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 16) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 1) (16, 14) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (1, 19) (1, 2) (1, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 4) (15, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 18) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 4) (9, 10) (9, 17) (9, 16) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 6) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3)
