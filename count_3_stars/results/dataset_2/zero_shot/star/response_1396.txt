Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 20) (22, 13) (22, 25) (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 21) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 2) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 23) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 8) (15, 20) (15, 23) (20, 13) (20, 15) (20, 12) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 24) (14, 0) (14, 29) (14, 25) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) (28, 16) (28, 19) (7, 2) (16, 28) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 26) (16, 19) (3, 21) (3, 18) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 20) (12, 16) (12, 4) (23, 10) (23, 15) (26, 16) (26, 6) (19, 10) (19, 28) (19, 16) (24, 0) (24, 18) (24, 29) (8, 17) (8, 11) (8, 29) (27, 5) (27, 29) (29, 14) (29, 24) (29, 8) (29, 27) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 21) (2, 7) (18, 3) (18, 24) (6, 26) (6, 25) (25, 22) (25, 14) (25, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The count is [6].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<13, (22, 20, 2)>
<5, (9, 0, 27)>
<9, (5, 4, 11)>
<1, (21, 17, 2)>
<10, (17, 19, 23)>
<4, (9, 16, 12)>
