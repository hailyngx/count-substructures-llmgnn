Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 11) (20, 15) (20, 9) (20, 24) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 0) (17, 29) (17, 28) (17, 24) (29, 17) (29, 3) (22, 27) (22, 16) (26, 28) (26, 16) (13, 15) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 14) (13, 7) (21, 10) (21, 2) (3, 29) (3, 7) (3, 10) (28, 17) (28, 26) (28, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (9, 20) (9, 8) (9, 10) (10, 21) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 25) (0, 6) (0, 16) (0, 4) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 8) (16, 0) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 4) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 18) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 21) (2, 28) (2, 19) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 23) (1, 19) (19, 2) (19, 1) (27, 22) (27, 24) (25, 13) (25, 10) (25, 12) (24, 20) (24, 17) (24, 27) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 11) (12, 25) (4, 15) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (23, 1)
