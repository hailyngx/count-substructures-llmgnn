Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 18) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 15) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 6) (5, 6) (5, 16) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 14) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 14) (7, 18) (19, 11) (19, 4) (9, 4) (9, 11) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 12) (4, 19) (4, 9) (4, 11) (12, 3) (12, 15) (18, 1) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 14) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 4) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 18) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 10) (16, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 18)>
<7, (11, 14, 18)>
