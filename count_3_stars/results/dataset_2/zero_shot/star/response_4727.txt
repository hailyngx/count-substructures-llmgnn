Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 16) (17, 6) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 3) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (3, 18) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 13) (9, 8) (9, 3) (19, 15) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 13) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 13) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 16) (16, 10) (16, 5) (16, 4) (13, 11) (13, 15) (13, 6) (13, 1) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 16) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<10, (4, 5, 16)>
<2, (18, 8, 7)>
