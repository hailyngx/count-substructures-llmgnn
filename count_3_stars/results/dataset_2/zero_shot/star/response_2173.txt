Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. The number of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (6, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 3)>
<4, (7, 8, 3)>
