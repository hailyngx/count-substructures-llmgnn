Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of 3-node paths passing through each node. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can count the number of paths of length 2 that originate at each node.

Here are the counts for the 3-stars in the graph:

[12]

<1, (2, 3, 12)>
<2, (1, 3, 10)>
<3, (2, 4, 13)>
<4, (3, 11, 14)>
<5, (3, 7, 14)>
<6, (2, 9, 13)>
<7, (5, 8, 14)>
<8, (7, 11, 13)>
<9, (6, 11, 13)>
<10, (2, 0, 14)>
<11, (4, 8, 9)>
<12, (1, 6, 7)>
