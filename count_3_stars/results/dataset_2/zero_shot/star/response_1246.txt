Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 25) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 15) (3, 29) (25, 11) (25, 6) (25, 8) (8, 16) (8, 25) (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 20) (13, 28) (12, 1) (12, 26) (27, 10) (27, 28) (2, 13) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 17) (1, 12) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 28) (26, 12) (26, 1) (26, 20) (26, 29) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 20) (20, 13) (20, 26) (20, 17) (4, 14) (4, 21) (29, 3) (29, 26) (29, 22) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 24) (23, 19) (5, 18) (5, 10) (19, 23) (19, 0) (6, 25) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 16) (9, 15) (21, 13) (21, 2) (21, 4) (21, 22) (14, 4) (14, 23) (14, 22) (14, 7) (22, 29) (22, 21) (22, 14) (22, 15) (24, 23) (24, 0) (0, 19) (0, 6) (0, 24) (0, 15) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 22) (15, 0) (7, 14) (10, 27) (10, 2) (10, 5) (28, 13) (28, 27) (28, 1) 

Response:
There are 12 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (12, 26, 28)>
<2, (13, 17, 21)>
<4, (14, 22, 23)>
<6, (1, 25, 6)>
<9, (15, 16, 22)>
<10, (2, 5, 27)>
<13, (2, 20, 28)>
<16, (8, 9, 15)>
<19, (0, 23, 24)>
<21, (13, 21, 22)>
<25, (6, 8, 25)>
<29, (3, 22, 26)>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
