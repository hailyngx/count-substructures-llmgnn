Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 6) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 12) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 6) 

Response:
The unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (9, 1, 14)>
<1, (4, 7, 10)>
<2, (3, 10, 14)>
<3, (1, 10, 14)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (9, 11, 5)>
<6, (8, 12, 13)>
<7, (1, 11, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 12)>
<9, (0, 5, 11)>
<10, (1, 3, 11)>
<11, (10, 13, 5)>
<12, (6, 8, 14)>
<13, (6, 11, 2)>
<14, (0, 12, 3)>

There are 14 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [14].
