Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 4) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<6, (9, 3, 8)>
<10, (6, 11, 2)>
<0, (9, 1, 14)>
<4, (3, 10, 5)>
