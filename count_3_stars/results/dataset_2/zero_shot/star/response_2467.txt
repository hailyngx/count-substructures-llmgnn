Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars are: 
<5, (9, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 8, 1)>
<6, (5, 7, 3)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (6, 4, 1)>
<1, (9, 7, 2)>
<3, (5, 6, 0)>
<8, (9, 6, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
