Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 1, 2)>
<1, (7, 8, 5)>
<2, (6, 9, 0)>
<3, (4, 7, 0)>
<4, (7, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 1)>
<6, (4, 9, 2)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
