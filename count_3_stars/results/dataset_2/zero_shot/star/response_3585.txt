Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 13) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 19) (14, 18) (14, 12) (10, 1) (10, 18) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 4) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 7) (17, 3) (17, 13) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 11) (19, 0) (19, 2) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 2) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 11) (2, 4) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 4) (12, 9) (12, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 13) (8, 0) (8, 11) (4, 15) (4, 2) (4, 16) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 15, 16)>
<9, (5, 7, 12)>
<2, (6, 19, 11)>
