Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 0) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 1) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 9) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 3) (2, 5) (2, 12) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

<8, (13, 11, 12)>
<13, (8, 5, 3)>
<5, (13, 6, 2)>
<6, (5, 3, 0)>
<0, (13, 14, 7)>
<14, (0, 9, 5)>
<7, (8, 0, 3)>
<12, (8, 5, 4)>
