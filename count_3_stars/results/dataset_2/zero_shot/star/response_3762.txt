Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 10) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 19) (8, 4) (13, 16) (13, 6) (4, 8) (4, 11) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 19) (12, 9) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 15) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 15) (5, 1) (5, 17) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 15) (19, 3) (19, 0) (19, 12) (17, 0) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 5) (17, 9) (9, 12) (9, 17) (9, 14) (15, 12) (15, 16) (15, 2) (15, 11) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 6) (14, 1) (14, 9) (18, 11) (18, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 10) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (7, 17, 19)>
<6, (3, 12, 10)>
<10, (1, 3, 18)>
<12, (9, 16, 15)>
