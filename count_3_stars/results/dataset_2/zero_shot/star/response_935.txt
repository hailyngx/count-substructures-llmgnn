Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 2)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (8, 9, 0)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
