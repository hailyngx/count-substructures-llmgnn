Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 10) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 5) (17, 21) (1, 26) (1, 12) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 19) (18, 9) (18, 29) (22, 9) (22, 24) (25, 29) (25, 10) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 24) (15, 12) (20, 26) (20, 13) (20, 27) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 21) (26, 1) (26, 20) (26, 24) (9, 18) (9, 22) (9, 27) (24, 22) (24, 8) (24, 26) (24, 27) (24, 28) (28, 3) (28, 24) (28, 10) (28, 23) (5, 17) (5, 12) (5, 21) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 12) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 21) (0, 29) (13, 14) (13, 20) (13, 21) (21, 17) (21, 2) (21, 5) (21, 0) (21, 13) (23, 28) (23, 7) (23, 29) (27, 20) (27, 9) (27, 24) (12, 1) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 19) (29, 18) (29, 25) (29, 0) (29, 23) (7, 14) (7, 23) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 4) (10, 16) (10, 25) (10, 28) (10, 19) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is calculated as follows:

1. For each node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If yes, then count it as a 3-star.
2. Output the final count inside brackets.

After analyzing the edges provided, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 21)>
<2, (8, 11, 21)>
<3, (0, 19, 28)>
<5, (12, 17, 21)>
<6, (4, 11, 16)>
<9, (18, 22, 27)>
<10, (16, 19, 25)>
<13, (14, 20, 21)>
<14, (7, 17, 23)>
<16, (6, 10, 25)>
<17, (5, 14, 21)>
<18, (9, 25, 29)>
<19, (3, 10, 12)>
<21, (0, 2, 13)>
<23, (7, 14, 29)>
<24, (8, 22, 27)>
<25, (10, 18, 29)>
<26, (1, 20, 24)>
<28, (3, 10, 23)>
<29, (0, 18, 23)>

The total number of 3-stars is [20].
