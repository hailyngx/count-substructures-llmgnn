Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 5) 

Response:
The center nodes of the 3-stars can be identified by finding nodes with exactly three neighbors. Let's list the 3-stars in the given graph:

There are a total of [16] unique 3-stars in the graph:
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<6, (9, 1, 3)>
<6, (9, 6, 8)>
<6, (9, 8, 4)>
<1, (6, 3, 2)>
<3, (6, 1, 7)>
<4, (9, 8, 2)>
<7, (6, 1, 3)>
<7, (6, 3, 5)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<8, (6, 9, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 5, 0)>
<5, (7, 8, 2)>
<5, (8, 7, 5)>
<5, (2, 0, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
