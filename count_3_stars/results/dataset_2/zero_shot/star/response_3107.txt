Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (6, 1, 4)>
<9, (6, 3, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<1, (5, 3, 8)>
