Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 0) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 10) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 10) (10, 12) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 11) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 11) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (1, 0, 3)>
<7, (6, 12, 3)>
<1, (4, 5, 14)>
<3, (1, 5, 14)>
<6, (2, 9, 13)>
<9, (0, 11, 14)>
<8, (2, 11, 13)>
<13, (0, 6, 8)>
