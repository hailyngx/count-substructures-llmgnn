Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 17) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 12) (13, 5) (13, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 19) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 2) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 7) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 18) (2, 10) (2, 19) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 2) (7, 8) (7, 15) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 13) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 17) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<11, (16, 14, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (11, 1, 12)>
