Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
