Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 14) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

<6, (9, 10, 14)>
<9, (6, 1, 3)>
<1, (9, 3, -)>
<3, (6, 9, 10)>
<10, (6, 3, 7)>
<11, (7, 5, 2)>
<4, (8, 13, -)>
<8, (3, 4, 12)>
<7, (10, 11, 0)>
<12, (8, 5, 13)>
<0, (9, 7, 2)>
<14, (6, 9, 13)>
<5, (6, 10, 11)>
<2, (6, 7, 12)>
<13, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, there are [14] 3-stars in total.
