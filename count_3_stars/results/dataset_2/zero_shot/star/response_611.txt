Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 19) (16, 11) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 18) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 2) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 0) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 18) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 19) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 9) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 6) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 9) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 2) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 12) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 1) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<11, (16, 3, 19)>
<3, (15, 8, 13)>
<15, (3, 13, 2)>
<4, (7, 9, 17)>
<7, (4, 14, 18)>
<8, (3, 13, 14)>
<13, (15, 8, 2)>
<14, (7, 8, 0)>
<1, (17, 5, 18)>
<17, (4, 1, 19)>
<10, (12, 9, 19)>
<2, (15, 13, 6)>
