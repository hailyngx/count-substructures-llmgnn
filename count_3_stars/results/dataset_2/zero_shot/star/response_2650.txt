Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 4, 1)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<7, (9, 0, 6)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<3, (4, 1, 0)>
<6, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 8, -)>
<8, (7, 3, 6)>
<0, (9, 7, 3)>
