Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 8) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 1) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 14) (18, 2) (18, 12) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 19) (5, 17) (5, 16) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 3) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 4) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 15) (15, 7) (15, 4) (9, 13) (9, 19) (12, 18) (12, 6) (12, 8) (13, 9) (13, 3) (19, 0) (19, 9) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 15) (3, 8) (3, 13) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (10, 4, 18)>
<6, (17, 1, 14)>
<8, (14, 17, 12)>
<12, (18, 6, 8)>
