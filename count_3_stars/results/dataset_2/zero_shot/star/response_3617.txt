Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (10, 15) (10, 12) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 17) (13, 3) (13, 9) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 11) (8, 9) (8, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 4) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 17) (11, 18) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 14) (4, 16) (4, 5) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars found in this graph.
The 3-stars are as follows: 
<0, (5, 6, 11)>
<2, (11, 12, 14)>
<3, (13, 14, 18)>
<4, (5, 14, 16)>
<16, (4, 16, 19)>
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
