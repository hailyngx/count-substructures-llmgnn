Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (11, 4) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 10) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 13) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 10)
