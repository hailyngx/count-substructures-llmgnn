Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 14) (11, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 15) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 13) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 6) (8, 10) (8, 6) (16, 19) (16, 1) (16, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 8) (6, 16) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 17) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 1) (15, 12) (15, 9) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 16) (1, 9) (18, 11) (18, 12) (18, 5) (18, 17) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (17, 4) (17, 18) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (7, 14, 1)>
<1, (10, 16, 9)>
<4, (6, 9, 13)>
<5, (19, 2, 3)>
<6, (7, 16, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 15)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
