Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 5) (11, 4) (11, 9) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be obtained by looking at the nodes that form 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify them based on the edges provided. Each 3-star in the graph will have one center node and three surrounding nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

- <4, (8, 0, 11)>
- <7, (0, 9, 13)>
- <8, (4, 14, 10)>
- <3, (8, 10, 5)>
- <11, (4, 9, -)>
- <5, (3, 0, 10)>
- <13, (7, 14, 6)>
- <0, (4, 7, 5)>
- <1, (7, 8, 6)>
- <6, (13, 1, 2)>
- <2, (6, 12, 14)>
- <12, (8, 6, 9)>
- <14, (8, 13, 10)>
- <9, (7, 11, 12)>
- <10, (8, 3, 5)>

There are 15 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [15].
