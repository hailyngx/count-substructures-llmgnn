Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 27) (21, 7) (21, 3) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 28) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 25) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 27) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 5) (26, 23) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (22, 16) (22, 24) (28, 2) (28, 26) (28, 13) (17, 2) (17, 20) (17, 6) (17, 15) (20, 17) (20, 23) (27, 4) (27, 7) (27, 1) (27, 16) (5, 1) (5, 26) (5, 8) (19, 29) (19, 6) (11, 23) (23, 26) (23, 20) (23, 11) (3, 21) (3, 14) (3, 13) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 8) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 15) (16, 7) (16, 22) (16, 27) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 18) (10, 29) (24, 22) (29, 7) (29, 19) (29, 10) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (13, 28) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 25) (25, 18) (25, 13) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 6) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars found are <4, (7, 12, 27)>, <1, (5, 26, 27)>, and <2, (8, 17, 28)>.
