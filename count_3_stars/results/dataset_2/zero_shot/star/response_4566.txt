Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
<1, (6, 5, 4)>
<3, (4, 2, 0)>
<7, (6, 9, 2)>
<8, (9, 4, 0)>
<0, (9, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
