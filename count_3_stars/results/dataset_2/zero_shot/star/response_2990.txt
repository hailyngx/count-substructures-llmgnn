Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 22) (15, 17) (27, 0) (27, 26) (27, 1) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 21) (9, 13) (9, 23) (0, 27) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 5) (22, 15) (22, 11) (23, 9) (23, 4) (23, 25) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 20) (11, 22) (11, 10) (11, 21) (11, 29) (11, 25) (2, 8) (2, 28) (18, 0) (18, 1) (18, 8) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 28) (12, 7) (12, 29) (12, 3) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 21) (4, 23) (4, 5) (4, 25) (24, 19) (26, 27) (26, 20) (26, 3) (26, 17) (21, 9) (21, 11) (21, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 29) (19, 24) (19, 1) (16, 0) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 26) (29, 11) (29, 12) (29, 5) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 26) (1, 27) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 20) (20, 10) (20, 26) (20, 1) (14, 28) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 14) (28, 2) (28, 7) (28, 14) (25, 23) (25, 11) (25, 4) 

Response:
There are total of 30 nodes. Since each 3-star consists of 4 nodes, we are looking for 4-node 3-stars and as such every 3-star will contribute 1 to the total count. Here is the list of unique 3-stars and their central nodes:

[<0, (3, 18, 16)>, <1, (19, 18, 20)>, <2, (8, 28, 2)>, <4, (5, 25, 23)>, <5, (4, 10, 29)>, <6, (13, 9, 17)>, <7, (28, 10, 12)>, <11, (21, 25, 22)>, <15, (22, 17, 15)>, <26, (20, 3, 17)>, <27, (26, 1, 0)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
