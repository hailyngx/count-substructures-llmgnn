Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 1) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 13) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 10, 12)>
<9, (1, 5, 14)>
<10, (8, 7, 11)>
<11, (4, 7, 14)>
<7, (1, 3, 10)>
<12, (2, 6, 13)>
<2, (8, 1, 7)>
<8, (3, 1, 10)>
<14, (3, 11, 13)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 3, 12)>
<1, (7, 2, 9)>
<13, (0, 12, 14)>
<4, (5, 6, 11)>
<0, (13)>
