Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 8) (4, 23) (4, 28) (4, 21) (7, 24) (21, 4) (21, 25) (21, 2) (1, 13) (1, 19) (3, 13) (3, 18) (18, 22) (18, 3) (18, 5) (18, 24) (8, 22) (8, 23) (8, 9) (23, 4) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 6) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 11) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 28) (20, 11) (12, 10) (27, 20) (27, 11) (6, 23) (6, 29) (6, 25) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 20) (28, 16) (19, 1) (19, 26) (19, 29) (26, 0) (26, 19) (26, 17) (16, 28) (10, 12) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 25) (15, 23) (15, 10) (15, 2) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 24) (9, 2) (11, 0) (11, 20) (11, 27) (11, 14) (14, 13) (14, 11) (17, 26) (17, 24) (29, 6) (29, 19) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 10) (24, 7) (24, 18) (24, 0) (24, 9) (24, 17) (5, 18) (2, 21) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 9) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<13, (1, 9, 14)>
<22, (18, 8, 28)>
<4, (23, 21, 28)>
<6, (23, 25, 29)>
<10, (2, 15, 25)>
<26, (19, 17, 29)>
