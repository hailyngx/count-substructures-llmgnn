Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 11) (9, 27) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 28) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 17) (3, 21) (3, 14) (3, 26) (25, 17) (25, 8) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 16) (21, 23) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 23) (6, 16) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 13) (8, 25) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 0) (17, 7) (17, 25) (17, 18) (29, 22) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 16) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 1) (26, 3) (26, 23) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 20) (19, 27) (14, 3) (14, 6) (16, 21) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 1) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 1) (23, 21) (23, 6) (23, 26) (23, 15) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 28) (28, 9) (28, 4) (28, 15) (28, 22) (24, 10) (24, 20) (1, 13) (1, 16) (1, 12) (11, 9) (11, 19) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 24) (27, 9) (27, 19) (22, 29) (22, 28) (22, 20) (20, 19) (20, 24) (20, 22) (18, 17) (18, 12) 

Response:
There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (2, 8, 16)>
<1, (12, 13, 16)>
<4, (7, 13, 28)>
<5, (6, 9, 10)>
<9, (5, 11, 27)>
<19, (8, 19, 27)>
<20, (22, 24, 29)>
<21, (3, 7, 16)>
<23, (15, 21, 26)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
