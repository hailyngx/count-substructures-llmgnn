Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <>:
<5, (8, 4, 3)>
<9, (8, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 2, 8)>
<0, (6, 3, 4)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
