Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 20) (9, 16) (9, 23) (1, 3) (1, 29) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 0) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 25) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 28) (12, 29) (19, 29) (19, 25) (19, 24) (26, 13) (26, 20) (13, 26) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 15) (17, 20) (17, 23) (17, 8) (20, 9) (20, 26) (20, 17) (20, 28) (16, 9) (16, 28) (16, 29) (28, 3) (28, 12) (28, 20) (28, 16) (28, 23) (5, 23) (5, 27) (29, 1) (29, 12) (29, 19) (29, 16) (29, 21) (0, 3) (0, 22) (23, 9) (23, 17) (23, 28) (23, 5) (11, 13) (11, 15) (15, 7) (15, 13) (15, 11) (15, 24) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 21) (21, 29) (21, 4) (21, 22) (27, 5) (27, 8) (24, 19) (24, 15) (24, 10) (10, 24) (25, 18) (25, 19) (25, 8) (8, 17) (8, 27) (8, 25) (8, 22) (22, 0) (22, 21) (22, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. 

Given that a 3-star graph consists of a central node and three other nodes connected to it, we need to find nodes with exactly three neighbors to be considered as the center of a 3-star.

Based on the given graph, the following nodes have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 7: Neighbors (6, 12, 15)
- Node 8: Neighbors (17, 25, 22)
- Node 13: Neighbors (26, 4, 11)
- Node 15: Neighbors (7, 13, 11)
- Node 17: Neighbors (20, 23, 8)
- Node 18: Neighbors (2, 25, 0)
- Node 19: Neighbors (29, 25, 24)
- Node 21: Neighbors (29, 4, 22)
- Node 24: Neighbors (19, 15, 10)
- Node 26: Neighbors (13, 20, 0)
- Node 27: Neighbors (5, 8, 21)
- Node 28: Neighbors (3, 12, 20)

Therefore, there are 12 nodes in the given graph that can act as the center of a 3-star, and the total number of 3-stars is 12.
