Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
