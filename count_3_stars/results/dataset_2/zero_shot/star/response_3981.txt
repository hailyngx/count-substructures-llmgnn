Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (6, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
