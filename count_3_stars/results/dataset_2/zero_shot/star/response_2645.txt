Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:

<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (6, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (8, 9, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 8, 7)>
<9, (2, 8, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
