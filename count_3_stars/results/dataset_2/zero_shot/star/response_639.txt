Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 5) (27, 0) (27, 28) (27, 1) (27, 16) (1, 27) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 17) (25, 26) (25, 21) (25, 10) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 15) (7, 15) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 21) (29, 11) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 4) (26, 25) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 15) (26, 11) (20, 21) (20, 10) (2, 17) (2, 16) (22, 14) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 5) (16, 27) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 14) (23, 26) (23, 10) (23, 9) (28, 0) (28, 27) (28, 8) (28, 4) (28, 5) (6, 17) (6, 4) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 7) (15, 26) (15, 11) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 16) (14, 10) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 28) (4, 6) (9, 23) (9, 24) (21, 25) (21, 17) (21, 20) (5, 0) (5, 18) (5, 28) (5, 24) (24, 9) (24, 5) (10, 25) (10, 20) (10, 23) (10, 14) (11, 29) (11, 26) (11, 15) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (27, 28, 15)>
<8, (1, 13, 28)>
<17, (3, 6, 21)>
<26, (25, 19, 15)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
