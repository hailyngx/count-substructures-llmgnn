Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 13) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 11) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (12, 5) (11, 7) (11, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 10) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (7, 8, 13)>, <7, (4, 1, 13)>, <8, (4, 7, 3)>, <13, (4, 7, 14)>.
