Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 10) (4, 10) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 5)
