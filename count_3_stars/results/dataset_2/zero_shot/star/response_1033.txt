Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
The central node in a 3-star graph is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given edges in the graph, we can identify the 3-star graphs as follows:

1. <5, (9, 8, 1)>
2. <8, (5, 7, 1)>
3. <1, (5, 7, 0)>
4. <7, (8, 4, 3)>
5. <0, (5, 1, 8)>
6. <9, (5, 6, 2)>
7. <3, (5, 4, 7)>
8. <4, (7, 0, 3)>
9. <6, (9, 8, 3)>
10. <2, (9, 3, -)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
