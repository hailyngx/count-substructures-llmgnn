Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 9) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 13) (17, 2) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 11) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 13) (16, 18) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 14) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 5) (18, 16) (18, 14) (18, 19) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 6) (6, 19) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 19) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 12) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 14) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 6) 

Response:
There can be multiple 3-stars in a graph. Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph: 

1. <0, (10, 4, 1)>
2. <1, (0, 14, 12)>
3. <2, (4, 19, 0)>
4. <3, (8, 12, 5)>
5. <4, (2, 17, 0)>
6. <5, (14, 4, 3)>
7. <6, (13, 12, 19)>
8. <7, (11, 10, 13)>
9. <8, (9, 3, 3)>
10. <9, (15, 11, 11)>
11. <10, (7, 0, 0)>
12. <11, (7, 9, 14)>
13. <12, (14, 1, 6)>
14. <13, (6, 19, 10)>
15. <14, (12, 5, 1)>
16. <16, (18, 18, 0)>
17. <17, (2, 4, 4)>
18. <18, (16, 19, 14)>
19. <19, (18, 6, 2)>

There are a total of [19] 3-stars in the given graph.
