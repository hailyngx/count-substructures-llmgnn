Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 18) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 18) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 15) (7, 16) (12, 6) (12, 1) (2, 14) (2, 6) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 1) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 19) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 19) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 15) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 18) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 0) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 6) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 13) (18, 17) (18, 10) (18, 16)
