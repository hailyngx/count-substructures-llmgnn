Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>
<6, (3, 2, 4)>
<0, (9, 7, 4)>
<7, (9, 8, 1)>
<8, (5, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
