Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 10) (5, 8) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 14) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<4, (10, 0, 13)>
<7, (10, 0, 11)>
<10, (9, 0, 5)>
<13, (2, 4, 13)>
