Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<0, (5, 3, 1)> <1, (0, 3, 2)> <3, (1, 2, 5)> <5, (0, 3, 7)> <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)> ]
