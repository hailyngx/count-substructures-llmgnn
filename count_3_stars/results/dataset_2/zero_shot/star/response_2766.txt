Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 15) (1, 6) (1, 18) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 6) (7, 9) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 9) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 19) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 19) (5, 12) (5, 15) (5, 14) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 10) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 9) (4, 19) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 4) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 14) (15, 16) (15, 13) (15, 5) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 19) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (6, 18, 2)>
<3, (10, 18, 13)>
<4, (10, 9, 17)>
<5, (12, 14, 15)>
<6, (1, 2, 18)>
<9, (13, 4, 7)>
<10, (3, 0, 8)>
<19, (0, 4, 14)>
