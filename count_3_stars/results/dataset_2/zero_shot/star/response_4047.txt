Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star structures in this graph can be determined by analyzing the connections of each node. 

Let's identify the 3-star structures:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

There are 9 unique 3-star structures in total. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
