Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 5) (6, 18) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 18) (5, 16) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 14) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 17) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 10) (10, 15) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 13) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 17) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 12) (0, 15) (0, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (17, 15) (17, 12) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 3) (8, 14) (14, 5) (14, 8) (13, 10) (13, 12) 

Response:
The given graph contains 8 unique 3-stars:
<1, (16, 8, 15)>
<2, (19, 12, 5)>
<4, (18, 7, 12)>
<5, (16, 19, 14)>
<8, (16, 15, 1)>
<9, (1, 7, 3)>
<10, (19, 0, 15)>
<12, (4, 17, 13)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
