Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
<1, (5, 6, 0)>
<3, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 2)>
