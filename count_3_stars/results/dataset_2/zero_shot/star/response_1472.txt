Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 12) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 4) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 13) (13, 0) (13, 9) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed inside <> brackets:

<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<6, (5, 10, 14)>
<2, (5, 8, 12)>
<8, (5, 6, 11)>
<9, (11, 7, 13)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
