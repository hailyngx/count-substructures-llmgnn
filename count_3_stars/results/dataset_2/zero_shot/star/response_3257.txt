Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (2, 4, 0)>
<9, (8, 7, 1)>
<4, (0, 2, 1)>
<7, (6, 8, 0)>
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
