Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 18) (16, 4) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 3) (9, 13) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 0) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 10) (1, 15) (1, 14) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 3) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 0) (8, 5) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 0) (7, 16) (7, 15) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 4) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 18) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 3) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 3) (12, 14) (12, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated as follows:

1. Count the degrees of each node:
- Nodes 0, 1, 7, 8, 9, 15, 16 have degree 2
- Nodes 2, 11, 12, 18 have degree 0
- Nodes 3, 5, 6, 10, 13, 14, 17, 19 have degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 5

To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can only consider nodes of degree 4 or higher since a 3-star requires one node to have degree 3. Therefore, the nodes we will consider for possible 3-stars are: 3, 5, 6, 10, 13, 14, 17, 19.

2. Count the number of triangles centered at each of these nodes:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 5, 13, 17, 4
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 19, 8, 17, 3
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 14, 19, 0, 10
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 6, 19, 3
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 11, 9, 17
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 11, 6, 1, 4
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 5, 13, 0
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 18, 10

3. Count the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 3 has 1 3-star: <3, (5, 13, 17)>
- Node 5 has 1 3-star: <5, (3, 17, 8)>
- Node 6 has 1 3-star: <6, (14, 19, 0)>
- Node 10 has 1 3-star: <10, (6, 3, 19)>
- Node 13 has 1 3-star: <13, (11, 9, 17)>
- Node 14 has 1 3-star: <14, (11, 6, 4)>
- Node 17 has 1 3-star: <17, (5, 13, 0)>
- Node 19 has 1 3-star: <19, (5, 6, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
