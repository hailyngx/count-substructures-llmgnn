Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 2) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 13) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 three-star configurations in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets []:

[4]

And here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<4, (7, 9, 2)>
<6, (9, 1, 14)>
<10, (8, 6, 0)>
<11, (3, 13, 0)>
