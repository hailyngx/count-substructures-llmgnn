Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 12) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 2) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 13) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 10) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 10)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (4, 10, 2)>
<1, (2, 13, 0)>
<3, (10, 6, 2)>
<2, (9, 7, 1)>
<8, (7, 14, 0)>
<0, (5, 1, 8)>
<12, (4, 1, 2)>
<11, (5, 4, 13)>
<14, (8, 6, 10)>
