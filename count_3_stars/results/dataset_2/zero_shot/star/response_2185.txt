Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are [10] unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed within brackets:

<1, (6, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (6, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 0, 2)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (9, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 2)>
<6, (9, 1, 0)>
<9, (6, 2, 1)>
