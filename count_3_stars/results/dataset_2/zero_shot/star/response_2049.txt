Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<5, (9, 2, 3)>
<5, (9, 2, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 3)>
<6, (9, 1, 4)>
<6, (9, 1, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
