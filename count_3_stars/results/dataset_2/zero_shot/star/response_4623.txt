Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (6, 17) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 1) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 16) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 15) (8, 6) (8, 5) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 15) (0, 3) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (1, 9) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 1) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 7) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 3) (16, 10) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 3) (11, 13) (11, 19) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by counting the number of nodes each node is adjacent to and then summing up the number of possible 3-star configurations centered at each node.

From the given graph:
- Node 0 is connected to 1 node.
- Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 2 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 3 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 4 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 5 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 6 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 7 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 8 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 9 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 10 is connected to 5 nodes.
- Node 11 is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 12 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 13 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 14 is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 15 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 16 is connected to 1 node.
- Node 17 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 18 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 19 is connected to 4 nodes.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- From node 1: <1, (2, 9, 15)>, <1, (2, 15, 19)>
- From node 2: <2, (1, 14, 19)>, <2, (7, 12, 19)>, <2, (12, 13, 10)>
- From node 3: <3, (0, 7, 13)>, <3, (7, 12, 19)>, <3, (0, 12, 13)>
- From node 4: <4, (9, 15, 18)>
- From node 5: <5, (8, 10, 13)>, <5, (8, 10, 16)>, <5, (8, 13, 11)>
- From node 6: <6, (8, 10, 17)>
- From node 7: <7, (2, 3, 19)>
- From node 8: <8, (5, 6, 10)>, <8, (5, 6, 17)>
- From node 9: <9, (1, 4, 15)>
- From node 10: <10, (5, 8, 13)>, <10, (5, 8, 16)>, <10, (5, 13, 11)>
- From node 12: <12, (2, 7, 19)>
- From node 13: <13, (10, 12, 5)>, <13, (10, 12, 8)>, <13, (10, 16, 5)>, <13, (11, 5, 8)>
- From node 15: <15, (9, 1, 4)>, <15, (9, 1, 18)>, <15, (4, 9, 18)>, <15, (1, 4, 18)>
- From node 17: <17, (6, 8, 10)>
- From node 19: <19, (2, 7, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
