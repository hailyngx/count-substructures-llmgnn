Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars and their count:

[<0, (7, 1, 5)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (7, 0, 8)>]
