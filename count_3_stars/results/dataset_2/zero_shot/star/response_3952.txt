Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 28) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 29) (8, 11) (5, 23) (5, 29) (5, 27) (6, 19) (6, 20) (6, 16) (0, 2) (0, 23) (0, 19) (2, 0) (2, 23) (2, 24) (14, 22) (14, 12) (11, 8) (26, 10) (26, 12) (28, 3) (28, 19) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 24) (17, 19) (17, 27) (17, 18) (10, 26) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 27) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 24) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 28) (19, 17) (19, 18) (22, 4) (22, 14) (23, 5) (23, 0) (23, 2) (23, 27) (7, 13) (7, 29) (29, 8) (29, 5) (29, 7) (9, 15) (9, 27) (20, 6) (20, 21) (20, 16) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 1) (24, 18) (24, 21) (21, 4) (21, 20) (21, 24) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 20) (27, 5) (27, 17) (27, 10) (27, 23) (27, 9) (12, 14) (12, 26) (12, 15)
