Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<9, (5, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 1)>
<1, (4, 0, 6)>
