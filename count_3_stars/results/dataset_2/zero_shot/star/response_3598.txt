Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (2, 13) (0, 4) (0, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 14) (8, 1) (8, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<4, (0, 6, 10)>
<7, (3, 9, 11)>
<1, (5, 8, 12)>
<3, (1, 13, 7)>
<13, (2, 6, 4)>
<10, (5, 11, 12)>
<11, (5, 9, 13)>
<12, (1, 10, 11)>
<14, (6, 8, 9)>
(There are 9 unique 3-star graphs in total) 
So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
