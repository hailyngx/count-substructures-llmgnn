Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 12) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 5) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (10, 13) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 18) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 18) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 19) (12, 16) (2, 17) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (5, 16) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 1) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 2) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 14) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<11, (14, 17, 18)>
<3, (14, 15, 19)>
<9, (4, 8, 14)>
<1, (2, 5, 18)>
