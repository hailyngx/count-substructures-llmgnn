Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 10) (8, 11) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 13) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following 3-stars:

[<10, (11, 8, 13)>, <11, (10, 8, 13)>, <4, (5, 3, 0)>, <8, (10, 11, 7)>, <7, (10, 12, 5)>, <12, (7, 2, 1)>, <1, (12, 9, 0)>, <6, (7, 1, 14)>, <2, (12, 5, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 0)>, <3, (4, 2, 14)>, <14, (7, 6, 13)>, <9, (10, 1, 3)>, <13, (10, 6, 3)>, <0, (12, 1, 5)>]

Therefore, there are [15] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
