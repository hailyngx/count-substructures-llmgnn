Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 15) (5, 7) (9, 6) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 22) (6, 15) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 26) (20, 25) (20, 13) (20, 18) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 7) (0, 29) (0, 23) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 12) (21, 12) (21, 18) (21, 17) (28, 16) (28, 15) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 29) (7, 5) (7, 25) (7, 11) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 26) (14, 6) (14, 20) (14, 26) (26, 3) (26, 16) (26, 14) (26, 15) (27, 22) (27, 24) (27, 19) (2, 11) (2, 19) (22, 6) (22, 27) (17, 6) (17, 21) (17, 24) (17, 15) (24, 27) (24, 17) (24, 29) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 28) (15, 26) (15, 17) (18, 20) (18, 21) (18, 16) (18, 23) (18, 13) (23, 0) (23, 18) (23, 13) (23, 19) (19, 4) (19, 27) (19, 2) (19, 23) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 21) (13, 20) (13, 18) (13, 23) (29, 0) (29, 11) (29, 24)
