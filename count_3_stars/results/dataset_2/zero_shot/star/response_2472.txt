Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 8) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 10) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 11) (12, 1) (16, 12) (16, 9) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 13) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 1) (19, 17) (19, 6) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 2) (1, 12) (1, 18) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 1) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 9) (13, 1) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 12) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

<0, (5, 9, 2)>
<1, (12, 13, 18)>
<2, (0, 7, 14)>
<5, (0, 10, 11)>
<7, (2, 14, 18)>
<8, (4, 11, 17)>
<12, (1, 11, 16)>
<13, (1, 9, 14)>
