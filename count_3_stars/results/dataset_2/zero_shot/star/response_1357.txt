Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 24) (11, 0) (11, 27) (11, 6) (16, 13) (16, 25) (13, 16) (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 17) (4, 13) (4, 22) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 20) (7, 17) (2, 4) (2, 29) (2, 12) (29, 2) (29, 14) (29, 18) (20, 7) (20, 21) (20, 10) (25, 16) (25, 28) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 5) (18, 29) (18, 19) (18, 14) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 15) (26, 17) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 10) (14, 29) (14, 18) (14, 9) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 9) (28, 25) (28, 26) (12, 2) (12, 1) (12, 24) (10, 20) (10, 0) (24, 11) (24, 12) (24, 27) (24, 9) (15, 26) (15, 23) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 23) (17, 22) (17, 7) (17, 26) (17, 6) (5, 3) (5, 23) (5, 21) (23, 15) (23, 6) (23, 5) (23, 21) (8, 27) (21, 20) (21, 5) (21, 23) (27, 11) (27, 24) (27, 8) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 24) 

Response:
There are 3-star subgraphs in this graph. The total number of 3-stars is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<11, (0, 6, 27)>
<13, (0, 4, 7)>
