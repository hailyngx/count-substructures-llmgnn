Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 8 three-stars in this graph. The unique three-stars are:
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (4, 3, 2)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<8, (9, 4, 2)>
<6, (4, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
