Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 6) (5, 6) (5, 15) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 16) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 1) (14, 0) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 15) (8, 0) (19, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 13) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 18) (12, 3) (12, 0) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 15) (18, 6) (18, 16) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 2) (15, 13) (17, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<4, (7, 0, 2)>
<7, (4, 3, 10)>
<11, (10, 9, 13)>
<6, (5, 15, 18)>
