Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 10) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 12) (11, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 2) (7, 1) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 18) (14, 6) (14, 13) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 15) (17, 0) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 19) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 17) (15, 7) (15, 16) (18, 5) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 17) (4, 11) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 18) 

Response:
[\<1, (2, 8, 10)>, \<3, (8, 11, 12)>, \<6, (1, 6, 14)>, \<7, (1, 7, 15)>, \<9, (0, 9, 19)>, \<16, (8, 16, 17)>, \<17, (0, 17, 19)>, \<18, (5, 11, 18)>] [8]
