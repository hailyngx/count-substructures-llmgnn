Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 14) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 3) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) (1, 5) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 10, 12)>
<13, (4, 8, 14)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
