Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 23) (9, 19) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 25) (12, 23) (17, 29) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 21) (29, 17) (29, 0) (29, 18) (26, 16) (28, 16) (28, 24) (24, 28) (24, 20) (15, 22) (15, 13) (15, 4) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 27) (19, 9) (19, 17) (19, 22) (19, 11) (23, 9) (23, 12) (23, 0) (23, 27) (8, 10) (8, 11) (4, 15) (4, 13) (0, 29) (0, 23) (0, 16) (0, 21) (16, 26) (16, 28) (16, 0) (16, 14) (11, 19) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 16) (14, 11) (22, 15) (22, 19) (22, 3) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 22) (3, 20) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 25) (5, 12) (5, 25) (5, 27) (25, 9) (25, 12) (25, 2) (25, 5) (20, 24) (20, 3) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 27) (27, 10) (27, 23) (27, 5) (27, 21) (27, 18) (18, 29) (18, 27) (13, 15) (13, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<6, (9, 7, 10)>
<12, (7, 25, 23)>
<17, (29, 19, 2)>
<29, (17, 0, 18)>

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
