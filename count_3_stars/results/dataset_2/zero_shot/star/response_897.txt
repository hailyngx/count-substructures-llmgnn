Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 13) (1, 6) (1, 13) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 14) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 3, 4)>
<9, (5, 10, 4)>
<6, (1, 14, 10)>
<1, (6, 13, 0)>
<10, (9, 6, 11)>
<11, (10, 14, 7)>
<2, (8, 12, 3)>
<8, (5, 11, 2)>
<0, (6, 8, 14)>
<14, (6, 11, 0)>
<7, (11, 2, 0)>
<13, (3, 11, 1)>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
