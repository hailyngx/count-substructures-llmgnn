Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 10) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 11) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 3)
