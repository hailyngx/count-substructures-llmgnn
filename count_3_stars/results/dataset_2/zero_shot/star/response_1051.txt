Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 18) (13, 8) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 18) (14, 0) (14, 5) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 19) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 16) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 19) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 2) (16, 1) (16, 15) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 5) (6, 15) (6, 2) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 6) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 15) (5, 4) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. Their representations are:

<1, (3, 16, 17)>
<15, (0, 10, 16)>
<17, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (14, 15, 18)>
<7, (0, 5, 17)>
<18, (0, 8, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
