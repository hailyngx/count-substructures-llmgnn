Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 17) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 6) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 8) (17, 11) (5, 3) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 8) (9, 10) (0, 11) (16, 10) (4, 12) (4, 14) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 2) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (14, 19) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 14) (18, 12) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is provided in brackets based on the number of 3-stars found.

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (15, 5, 8)>
<15, (3, 17, 1)>
<7, (11, 13, 2)>
<12, (4, 13, 18)>
<1, (17, 2, 9)>
<5, (19, 3, 8)>
<19, (5, 14, 9)>
<8, (3, 17, 9)>
