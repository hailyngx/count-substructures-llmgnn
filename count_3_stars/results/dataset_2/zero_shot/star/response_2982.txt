Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 3) (16, 26) (16, 10) (16, 20) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 18) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 28) (18, 15) (18, 14) (18, 17) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 3) (23, 29) (23, 21) (23, 12) (10, 16) (10, 17) (17, 18) (17, 10) (17, 20) (2, 27) (2, 5) (2, 4) (28, 27) (28, 29) (28, 0) (29, 23) (29, 28) (29, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 22) (6, 29) (6, 19) (6, 4) (13, 25) (13, 1) (26, 16) (26, 25) (24, 7) (24, 9) (24, 19) (24, 21) (20, 16) (20, 17) (20, 12) (7, 24) (7, 25) (7, 9) (25, 13) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 8) (8, 11) (8, 25) (8, 12) (9, 24) (9, 7) (4, 11) (4, 27) (4, 2) (4, 6) (21, 22) (21, 23) (21, 24) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 3) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 24) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 23) (3, 0) (14, 18) (12, 23) (12, 5) (12, 20) (12, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<16, (3, 26, 10)>, <15, (0, 18, 27)>, <22, (6, 21, 23)>, <23, (12, 21, 29)>, <10, (16, 17, 20)>, <17, (10, 18, 20)>, <27, (2, 4, 15)>, <28, (0, 27, 29)>, <29, (6, 23, 28)>, <5, (2, 12, 6)>, <6, (22, 4, 29)>, <24, (7, 19, 21)>, <20, (12, 16, 17)>, <7, (9, 24, 25)>, <25, (7, 13, 26)>, <8, (11, 12, 25)>, <9, (7, 24, 25)>, <4, (2, 6, 27)>, <21, (22, 23, 24)>, <0, (15, 27, 28)>, <19, (6, 15, 24)>, <3, (0, 16, 23)>, <12, (5, 8, 20)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].
