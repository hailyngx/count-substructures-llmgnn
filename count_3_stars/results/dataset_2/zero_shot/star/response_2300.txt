Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 5) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 19) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 19) (5, 9) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 13) (18, 12) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 7) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 12) (16, 4) (7, 1) (7, 19) (0, 15) (0, 6) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 16) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph.
