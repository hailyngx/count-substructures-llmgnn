Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 2) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 9) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 14) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 1) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 10) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 1) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 10) 

Response:
There are 3-star graphs in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:

<4, (8, 5, 11)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 8, 13)>
<13, (5, 1, 2)>
<0, (13, 7, 12)>
<7, (0, 1, 10)>
<3, (11, 10, 9)>
<11, (4, 3, 9)>
<2, (6, 13, 11)>
<12, (0, 3, 14)>
<6, (8, 14, 2)>
<14, (6, 13, 12)>
<9, (3, 11, 2)>
<10, (4, 7, 3)>
<1, (8, 13, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 15. Therefore, the final answer is [15].
