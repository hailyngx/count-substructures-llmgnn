Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 40 edges in the given graph. The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

[<0, (9, 6, 1)>, <1, (9, 7, 4)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 6)>, <5, (2, 8, 3)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 9, 4)>, <8, (5, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 7, 0)>]

There are 10 unique 3-stars found in the graph. Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
