Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 13) (1, 2) (1, 19) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 7) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 17) (7, 0) (15, 5) (15, 6) (8, 17) (8, 19) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 16) (16, 0) (16, 19) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 18) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 18) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 18) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (18, 12) (18, 14) (18, 3) (10, 12)
