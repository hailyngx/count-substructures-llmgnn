Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 7) (5, 22) (5, 21) (9, 24) (1, 25) (1, 24) (1, 4) (1, 22) (22, 3) (22, 5) (22, 1) (22, 23) (22, 20) (23, 22) (23, 7) (23, 6) (23, 13) (12, 10) (12, 21) (12, 0) (27, 25) (27, 6) (4, 1) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 16) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 29) (21, 5) (21, 12) (21, 16) (28, 11) (28, 8) (28, 25) (13, 23) (13, 24) (13, 19) (26, 10) (11, 28) (11, 20) (11, 25) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 26) (25, 1) (25, 27) (25, 28) (25, 11) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 0) (16, 4) (16, 21) (16, 20) (8, 28) (8, 7) (6, 23) (6, 27) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 6) (17, 2) (7, 15) (7, 23) (7, 8) (29, 18) (29, 0) (2, 17) (2, 0) (14, 4) (14, 18) (20, 22) (20, 11) (20, 16) (24, 9) (24, 1) (24, 13) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 6) (0, 29) (0, 2) 

Response:
