Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 14) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 9) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 9) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 4) (14, 11) (14, 8) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 9) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 4) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 12) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by observing the graph based on its 60 edges. Since each 3-star contributes one central node, we can directly count the number of 3-stars in the graph by examining the nodes with exactly three incident edges.

From the given edges, we can identify the nodes with exactly three incident edges and count the unique 3-stars:

- Node 10 has 5 incident edges with nodes {11, 0, 7, 1, 9}.
- Node 11 has 5 incident edges with nodes {10, 3, 14, 13, 8}.
- Node 5 has 3 incident edges with nodes {13, 2, 8}.
- Node 6 has 2 incident edges with nodes {8, 0}.
- Node 2 has 5 incident edges with nodes {5, 8, 12, 3, 4}.
- Node 12 has 4 incident edges with nodes {2, 7, 1, 9}.
- Node 13 has 5 incident edges with nodes {11, 5, 4, 3, 9}.
- Node 3 has 4 incident edges with nodes {11, 2, 13, 4}.
- Node 4 has 4 incident edges with nodes {2, 13, 3, 9}.
- Node 9 has 5 incident edges with nodes {10, 7, 12, 13, 4}.
- Node 1 has 3 incident edges with nodes {10, 7, 12}.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)> in the given graph is [11]. 
The unique 3-stars are <10, (11, 0, 7)>, <5, (13, 2, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 12)>, <12, (2, 7, 1)>, <13, (11, 5, 4)>, <9, (10, 7, 12)>.
