Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<9, (6, 8, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
