Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 0) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 23) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 8) (27, 15) (27, 11) (7, 21) (7, 25) (7, 6) (7, 24) (3, 21) (3, 16) (3, 9) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 2) (13, 11) (17, 1) (17, 8) (25, 7) (25, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 22) (20, 29) (20, 19) (20, 6) (20, 10) (18, 19) (18, 28) (19, 29) (19, 20) (19, 18) (19, 22) (6, 7) (6, 20) (6, 24) (6, 2) (24, 7) (24, 6) (22, 29) (22, 19) (22, 12) (22, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 28) (23, 21) (23, 15) (23, 4) (12, 5) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 26) (10, 20) (10, 28) (14, 5) (14, 12) (0, 1) (0, 25) (0, 9) (0, 4) (4, 23) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 26) (11, 27) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 26) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 8) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 22) (8, 16) (28, 18) (28, 2) (28, 10) (26, 12) (26, 4) (26, 11) 

Response:
The 3-star graph is a simple star-like graph where one central node is connected to three other nodes.

Finding the 3-star graphs in the given graph:
1. <0, (1, 4, 25)>
2. <2, (6, 13, 28)>
3. <3, (9, 16, 21)>
4. <5, (12, 14, 26)>
5. <7, (6, 24, 25)>
6. <8, (15, 17, 22)>
7. <18, (19, 28, 29)>
8. <20, (6, 10, 29)>
9. <22, (8, 19, 29)>
10. <23, (4, 15, 21)>
11. <27, (11, 15, 26)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [11]
