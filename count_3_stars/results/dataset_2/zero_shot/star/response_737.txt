Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (18, 10) (18, 13) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (19, 13) (2, 1) (2, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 17) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 5) (14, 15) (14, 7) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 16) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (13, 15) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 2) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<3, (0, 6, 12)>
<3, (6, 15, 17)>
<3, (15, 13, 16)>
<3, (16, 9, 17)>
