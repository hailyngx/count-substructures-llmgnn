Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 2) (1, 8) (1, 14) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs can be calculated by counting the number of times each node appears as the central node in a 3-star. 

Starting from the first node:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 13, 12, 0, and 7.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, 4, 2, and 11.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, 12, and 3.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 5 and 4.
- Node 10 does not form any 3-star since it is only connected to two other nodes.
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 3, 14, 12, and 2.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 6, and 1.
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 12, 3, 0, and 6.
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 10, and 13.
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 6, and 1.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, 10, 11, 13, and 2.
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, 11, 13, and 14.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 13, 14, and 2.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 8 and 14.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 11, 3, 6.

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [15]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 13, 12, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 4, 2)>
<4, (9, 7, 12)>
<7, (5, 4)>
<11, (9, 3, 14, 12, 2)>
<8, (9, 6, 1)>
<13, (5, 12, 3, 0, 6)>
<0, (5, 10, 13)>
<14, (11, 6, 1)>
<3, (9, 4, 10, 11, 13, 2)>
<12, (5, 4, 11, 13, 14)>
<6, (8, 13, 14, 2)>
<1, (8, 14)>
<2, (9, 11, 3, 6)>
