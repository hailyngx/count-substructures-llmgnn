Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 25) (1, 24) (21, 28) (21, 25) (21, 15) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (0, 10) (0, 8) (27, 12) (27, 9) (12, 4) (12, 27) (12, 10) (12, 23) (20, 3) (26, 28) (26, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 15) (8, 0) (8, 24) (8, 15) (28, 21) (28, 26) (28, 10) (22, 15) (29, 19) (18, 6) (18, 13) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 24) (5, 14) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 28) (10, 3) (16, 2) (16, 24) (24, 1) (24, 8) (24, 5) (24, 16) (3, 20) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 9) (3, 19) (17, 3) (17, 23) (17, 11) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 19) (19, 29) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 23) (6, 18) (6, 11) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 6) (9, 7) (9, 27) (9, 3) (23, 12) (23, 17) (23, 19) (15, 21) (15, 2) (15, 8) (15, 22) (15, 13) (14, 7) (14, 5) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 15) 

Response:
There are 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (25, 21, 24)>
<4, (7, 12, 2)>
<7, (4, 9, 14)>
<0, (10, 8, 12)>
<21, (28, 25, 15)>
<2, (4, 5, 15)>
<12, (27, 10, 23)>
<20, (3, 26, 5)>
<26, (28, 5, 21)>
<8, (24, 15, 0)>
<29, (19, 3, 25)>
<18, (6, 13, 11)>
