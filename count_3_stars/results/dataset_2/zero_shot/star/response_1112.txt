Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 29) (26, 6) (26, 4) (11, 17) (16, 0) (16, 2) (1, 28) (1, 19) (3, 10) (3, 22) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 24) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 7) (4, 26) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 20) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 27) (6, 26) (6, 23) (6, 0) (28, 1) (28, 17) (28, 21) (21, 28) (22, 3) (22, 4) (22, 20) (22, 24) (5, 23) (5, 18) (5, 0) (19, 1) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 5) (18, 5) (18, 20) (18, 12) (18, 13) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 24) (2, 14) (12, 18) (12, 2) (12, 14) (23, 9) (23, 6) (23, 5) (23, 25) (23, 27) (27, 8) (27, 23) (27, 20) (29, 26) (7, 17) (7, 20) (7, 14) (20, 4) (20, 22) (20, 18) (20, 27) (20, 7) (13, 4) (13, 18) (15, 8) (15, 25) (25, 23) (25, 15) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 7) (14, 24) (24, 10) (24, 22) (24, 2) (24, 14) 

Response:
There are [16] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: <3, (10, 17, 24)>, <4, (8, 13, 18)>, <5, (0, 18, 23)>, <6, (0, 23, 26)>, <7, (14, 20, 27)>, <8, (4, 8, 26)>, <10, (2, 10, 17)>, <12, (2, 12, 18)>, <13, (4, 13, 18)>, <14, (2, 7, 14)>, <15, (8, 15, 25)>, <16, (0, 16, 2)>, <18, (5, 12, 18)>, <19, (1, 19, 28)>, <20, (4, 7, 20)>, <23, (5, 23, 25)>
