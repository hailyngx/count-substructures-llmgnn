Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 29) (27, 6) (27, 8) (1, 15) (1, 20) (1, 19) (3, 16) (3, 2) (22, 2) (22, 17) (23, 5) (23, 20) (23, 28) (8, 27) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 18) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 9) (6, 27) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 7) (6, 12) (28, 23) (28, 6) (28, 7) (28, 19) (20, 1) (20, 23) (20, 14) (29, 15) (29, 25) (29, 24) (19, 1) (19, 28) (19, 9) (2, 3) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 15) (0, 16) (0, 26) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 25) (24, 6) (24, 29) (24, 4) (24, 5) (14, 20) (14, 9) (26, 0) (5, 23) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 24) (17, 22) (17, 12) (4, 24) (4, 9) (9, 11) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 7) (7, 6) (7, 28) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 18) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 21) (25, 29) (25, 16) (25, 18) (21, 12) (18, 13) (18, 7) (18, 25) 

Response:
There are a total of 20 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<16, (0, 13, 25)>
<16, (13, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 23, 24)>
<9, (4, 14, 19)>
<9, (7, 11, 19)>
<12, (6, 17, 21)>
<18, (7, 13, 25)>
<19, (1, 9, 28)>
<20, (1, 14, 23)>
<24, (4, 5, 29)>
