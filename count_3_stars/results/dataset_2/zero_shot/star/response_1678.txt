Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 5) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 9) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (2, 5) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 1) (8, 5) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 9) (13, 10) (13, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 13) 

Response:
There are \[12\] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (8, 11, 9)>  
<1, (6, 10, 12)>  
<2, (5, 8, 12)>  
<3, (5, 6, 9)>  
<4, (6, 10, 11)>  
<5, (2, 3, 8)>  
<6, (1, 4, 7)>  
<7, (6, 9, 11)>  
<8, (0, 5, 14)>  
<9, (0, 7, 11)>  
<10, (4, 6, 12)>  
<13, (9, 10, 13)>
