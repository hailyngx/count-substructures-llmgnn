Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 12) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 13) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 13) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: <1, (10, 11, 6)>, <4, (2, 8, 12)>
