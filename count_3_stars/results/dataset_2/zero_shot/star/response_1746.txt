Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 13) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 15) (7, 12) (12, 7) (4, 19) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 19) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 18) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 19) (15, 17) (16, 5) (16, 14) (16, 0) (6, 14) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 10) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 6) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 16, 13)>
<14, (17, 0, 6)>
<17, (14, 8, 15)>
<7, (12, -1, -1)>
<4, (19, 2, -1)>
<18, (11, 6, 3)>
<2, (8, 4, 13)>
<8, (17, 2, 1)>
<0, (14, 16, 19)>
<1, (8, 11, 10)>
<3, (17, 18, 6)>
<11, (18, 1, 3)>
