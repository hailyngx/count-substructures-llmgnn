Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<4, (9, 8, 1)>
<7, (5, 9, 6)>
