Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 6) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 1) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 4) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 10) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 13)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 13)>
