Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 10) (7, 18) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 14) (6, 16) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 18) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 10) (19, 0) (19, 1) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 1) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 13) (1, 18) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by finding the number of occurrences of each node as the center of a 3-star. Since each 3-star has one center and three leaves, we can simply count the frequency of each node in the list of edges. 

Here are the frequencies of each node being the center of a 3-star:
- Node 0: 4 occurrences
- Node 1: 4 occurrences
- Node 2: 3 occurrences
- Node 3: 2 occurrences
- Node 4: 2 occurrences
- Node 5: 3 occurrences
- Node 6: 3 occurrences
- Node 7: 1 occurrence
- Node 8: 3 occurrences
- Node 9: 3 occurrences
- Node 10: 4 occurrences
- Node 11: 2 occurrences
- Node 12: 2 occurrences
- Node 13: 2 occurrences
- Node 14: 2 occurrences
- Node 15: 2 occurrences
- Node 16: 2 occurrences
- Node 17: 1 occurrence
- Node 18: 2 occurrences
- Node 19: 2 occurrences

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is the sum of the above occurrences, which is \([4 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2] = 43\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (4, 10, 19)>
- <1, (4, 16, 19)>
- <2, (3, 5, 10)>
- <3, (2, 5, 12)>
- <6, (5, 10, 16)>
- <7, (10, 18, 7)>
- <8, (11, 9, 18)>
- <9, (14, 15, 13)>

Therefore, the final answer is \([43]\).
