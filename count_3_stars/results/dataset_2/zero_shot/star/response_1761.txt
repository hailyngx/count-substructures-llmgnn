Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 2) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 17) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 11) (9, 19) (1, 14) (1, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 14) (18, 16) (13, 15) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 0) (17, 15) (17, 13) (17, 7) (8, 19) (8, 7) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 8) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (12, 14) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 2) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 7)
