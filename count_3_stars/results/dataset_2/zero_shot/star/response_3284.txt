Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 8) (10, 5) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 13) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 12) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (0, 7, 10)>
<12, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (4, 13, 14)>
<11, (7, 13, 14)>
