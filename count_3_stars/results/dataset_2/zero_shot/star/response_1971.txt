Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 23) (15, 0) (15, 11) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 2) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 28) (7, 4) (7, 20) (7, 19) (7, 28) (2, 17) (2, 8) (29, 13) (29, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 16) (8, 2) (8, 24) (8, 20) (8, 12) (22, 6) (26, 18) (26, 23) (26, 21) (9, 18) (9, 21) (18, 26) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 12) (21, 26) (21, 9) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 27) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 22) (5, 29) (5, 28) (23, 3) (23, 26) (23, 20) (23, 12) (11, 15) (24, 8) (24, 27) (27, 16) (27, 24) (27, 20) (20, 7) (20, 8) (20, 23) (20, 27) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 23) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 29) (13, 12) (13, 19) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 25) (25, 14) (25, 16) (25, 19) (28, 4) (28, 7) (28, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (15, 16, 19)>
<4, (7, 13, 28)>
<8, (2, 12, 24)>
<16, (10, 18, 27)>
