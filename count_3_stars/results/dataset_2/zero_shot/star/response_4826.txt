Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<7, (4, 1, 2)>
<1, (4, 7, 3)>
<3, (1, 6, 2)>
