Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 17) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 10) (0, 27) (0, 12) (0, 1) (3, 25) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 4) (25, 21) (6, 9) (6, 21) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 12) (10, 27) (10, 12) (10, 23) (17, 15) (17, 21) (17, 7) (28, 14) (28, 19) (29, 19) (22, 9) (22, 14) (26, 13) (26, 11) (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 18) (21, 25) (21, 6) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 24) (20, 3) (20, 8) (8, 21) (8, 20) (8, 19) (8, 24) (19, 28) (19, 29) (19, 8) (19, 18) (18, 15) (18, 13) (18, 19) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 11) (5, 2) (14, 3) (14, 28) (14, 22) (14, 7) (24, 21) (24, 8) (24, 7) (24, 23) (1, 0) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 11) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 24) (16, 23) (16, 4) (4, 25) (4, 16) (4, 23) (4, 11) (23, 10) (23, 24) (23, 16) (23, 4) (11, 26) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 4) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<3, (25, 2, 14)>
<7, (17, 24, 28)>
<8, (21, 20, 19)>
<12, (0, 9, 13)>
<14, (28, 22, 7)>
<15, (17, 18, 27)>
<21, (6, 25, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
