Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 13) (14, 7) (14, 15) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 8) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 7) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 17) (8, 9) (8, 18) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 12) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 12) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 19) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 7) (0, 17) (0, 3) (0, 18) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 4) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 9) (18, 0) (19, 15) (19, 1) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 19) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 9) 

Response:
The center node of a 3-star can have 3 possible configurations:
1. The center node is connected to nodes (x, y, z).
2. The center node is connected to nodes (x, y, z).
3. The center node is connected to nodes (x, y, z).

Let's count the number of 3-stars in each configuration:
1. <10, (15, 7, 9)>
2. <12, (4, 13, 3)>
3. <1, (2, 19, 9)>

Thus, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
