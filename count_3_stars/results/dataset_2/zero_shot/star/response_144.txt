Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are <1, (5, 4, 3)>, <1, (5, 9, 4)>, <1, (9, 3, 4)>, <1, (4, 7, 6)>, and <1, (3, 8, 0)>.
Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the graph.
