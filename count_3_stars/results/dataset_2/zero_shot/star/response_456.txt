Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 18) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 3) (18, 16) (18, 5) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (17, 11) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 14) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 19) (9, 12) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 19) (12, 4) (12, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 0) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (14, 1) (14, 10) (2, 19) (2, 3) (0, 15) (0, 6) (0, 19) (0, 5) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 3) (5, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<11, (1, 16, 17)>
<16, (11, 13, 18)>
<4, (7, 12, 13)>
<7, (4, 9, 12)>
<9, (7, 8, 19)>
<19, (11, 13, 9)>
