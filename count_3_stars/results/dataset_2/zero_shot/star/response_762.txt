Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in this graph. 

[<4, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>]
