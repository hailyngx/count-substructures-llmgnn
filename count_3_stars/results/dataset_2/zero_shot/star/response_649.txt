Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 22) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 2) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 18) (3, 15) (3, 24) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 6) (12, 20) (12, 23) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 20) (27, 17) (20, 12) (20, 27) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 0) (28, 5) (28, 10) (4, 27) (4, 18) (4, 21) (18, 16) (18, 4) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 28) (5, 25) (5, 0) (17, 27) (17, 24) (17, 23) (29, 9) (29, 26) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 16) (8, 3) (21, 6) (21, 4) (21, 19) (10, 28) (9, 11) (9, 29) (9, 13) (19, 21) (19, 14) (19, 24) (7, 16) (7, 2) (7, 22) (23, 12) (23, 17) (23, 26) (23, 24) (23, 13) (26, 29) (26, 23) (1, 0) (1, 22) (24, 3) (24, 17) (24, 19) (24, 23) (24, 13) (14, 27) (14, 19) (13, 9) (13, 23) (13, 24) (13, 25) (25, 5) (25, 13) (25, 22) (22, 11) (22, 7) (22, 1) (22, 25) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<11, (5, 9, 2)>
<16, (8, 18, 7)>
<3, (24, 15, 8)>
<15, (3, 6, 5)>
<27, (20, 17, 4)>
<20, (12, 27, 6)>
<6, (15, 5, 0)>
<5, (28, 11, 6)>
<17, (23, 24, 27)>
<29, (26, 9, 23)>
<13, (24, 9, 25)>
<25, (13, 5, 22)>
