Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are [10] nodes and the number of edges is not needed to count the number of 3-star graphs. 

From the provided edge list, we can identify the central nodes and their leaves to find all the 3-stars:

<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 0)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (5, 4, 3)>
<1, (3, 2, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 1)>
<6, (5, 3, 8)>
<8, (7, 1, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (5, 9, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
