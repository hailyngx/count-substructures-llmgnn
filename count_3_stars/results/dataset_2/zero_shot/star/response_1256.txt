Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 11) (7, 23) (7, 8) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 26) (27, 10) (27, 13) (27, 8) (2, 12) (2, 18) (2, 17) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 13) (8, 7) (8, 27) (8, 15) (8, 26) (23, 7) (23, 1) (28, 29) (28, 9) (28, 25) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 22) (13, 27) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 9) (26, 12) (26, 8) (6, 15) (21, 2) (21, 3) (21, 11) (16, 24) (16, 25) (16, 3) (16, 9) (3, 12) (3, 21) (3, 16) (3, 0) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 15) (1, 12) (1, 23) (1, 20) (1, 19) (19, 29) (19, 1) (22, 29) (22, 24) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 10) (10, 27) (10, 0) (10, 24) (10, 5) (10, 14) (24, 16) (24, 22) (24, 10) (11, 7) (11, 21) (11, 5) (11, 20) (25, 28) (25, 16) (25, 9) (9, 28) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 25) (14, 10) (20, 1) (20, 11) (5, 18) (5, 10) (5, 11) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 17) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<7, (11, 8, 23)>
<12, (2, 1, 26)>
<27, (10, 13, 8)>
<2, (12, 18, 21)>
<1, (12, 23, 20)>
<10, (27, 24, 5)>
