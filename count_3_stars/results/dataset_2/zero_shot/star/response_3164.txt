Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 19) (11, 9) (11, 15) (4, 18) (4, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (19, 10) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 0) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 16) (16, 7) (16, 14) (12, 1) (12, 10) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 17) (17, 6) (17, 15) (14, 3) (14, 16) (14, 15) (14, 13) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 15) (0, 13) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 14) (15, 0) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 0) (9, 11) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 12, 10)>
<3, (1, 2, 14)>
<10, (12, 19, 18)>
<18, (10, 4, 19)>
