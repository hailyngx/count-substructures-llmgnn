Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<5, (6, 8, 4)>
<5, (6, 3, 8)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<3, (5, 1, 4)>
<3, (6, 1, 7)>
<1, (3, 0, 7)>
<2, (9, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 1)>

Therefore, the total count of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
