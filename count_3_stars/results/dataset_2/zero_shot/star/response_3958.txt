Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 9) (15, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (2, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (17, 13) (17, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 19) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 0) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 16) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 6) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 14) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (14, 16) (14, 12) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 17) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by counting the number of nodes that can serve as the central node and then counting the number of possible connections to three other nodes.

In this case, nodes 3, 9, 4, 8, 2, 1, 13, 5, 7, 16, 6, 11, 12, and 10 can be central nodes. However, not all of these nodes have 3-stars associated with them.

Finding the unique 3-stars in the graph yields the following pairs:
<3, (2, 9, 12)>
<4, (0, 9, 13)>
<5, (7, 11, 13)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (6, 11, 12)>
<10, (3, 18, 12)>
<12, (3, 8, 14)>
<13, (4, 5, 17)>
<16, (7, 14, 18)>
<18, (15, 10, 16)>
<9, (3, 15, 17)>

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
