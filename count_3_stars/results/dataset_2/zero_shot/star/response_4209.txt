Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 13) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (9, 12, 13)>
<3, (11, 13, 0)>
<4, (9, 7, 12)>
<5, (14, 8, 11)>
<6, (7, 11, 14)>
<7, (6, 4, 12)>
<8, (1, 5, 11)>
<9, (4, 3, 11)>
<10, (1, 0, 14)>
<11, (3, 8, 11)>
<12, (4, 7, 12)>
<13, (3, 0, 13)>
<14, (2, 6, 12)>
<0, (10, 13, 14)>
<1, (8, 10, 2)>
<2, (14, 2, 13)>
<3, (11, 13, 4)>
