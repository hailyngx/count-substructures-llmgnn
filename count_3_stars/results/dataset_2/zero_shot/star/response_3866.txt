Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 9, 4)>
<5, (7, 8, 6)>
