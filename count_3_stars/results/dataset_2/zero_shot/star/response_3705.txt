Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 10) (14, 17) (14, 16) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 1) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 18) (10, 15) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 9) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 11) (4, 12) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 1) (18, 13) (18, 12) (18, 4) (18, 9) (1, 17) (1, 4) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 16) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 9) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 16) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 2) 

Response:
There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph represented by:

<3, (15, 5, 10)>
<10, (15, 14, 17)>
<14, (17, 16, 10)>
<17, (14, 10, 1)>
<8, (13, 16, 0)>
<13, (8, 18, 10)>
<12, (7, 18, 0)>
<4, (12, 18, 2)>
<18, (13, 12, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph.
