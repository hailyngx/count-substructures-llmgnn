Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 3) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 4) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 4) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (9, 6, 13)>
<13, (8, 3, 7)>
