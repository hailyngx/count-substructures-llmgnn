Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed once each:
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
<9, (8, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
