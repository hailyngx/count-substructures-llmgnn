Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 0) (4, 10) (4, 16) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 9) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 9) (18, 17) (18, 1) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 17) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 9) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 10) (0, 15) (0, 11) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 16) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 5) (17, 6) (17, 12) (12, 17) (12, 9) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 1) (1, 18) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (16, 4) (16, 6) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 12) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

[4]

<1, (9, 10, 1)>
<3, (15, 0, 2)>
<7, (13, 14, 19)>
<17, (6, 5, 18)>
