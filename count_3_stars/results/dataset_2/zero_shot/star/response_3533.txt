Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are 5 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, and <4, (2, 3, 8)>.
Therefore, the answer is [5].
