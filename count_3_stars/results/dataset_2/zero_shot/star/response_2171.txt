Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 1) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) 

Response:
There are [16] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<6, (9, 5, 10)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<7, (4, 11, 3)>
<9, (6, 8, 3)>
<10, (6, 11, 0)>
<11, (7, 10, 14)>
<1, (4, 8, 14)>
<0, (10, 14, 12)>
<14, (4, 11, 13)>
<3, (6, 7, 13)>
<8, (9, 4, 1)>
<5, (6, 12, 2)>
<13, (7, 14, 3)>
<2, (6, 4, 0)>
<12, (6, 11, 5)>
<   0, (10, 12, 14)>
