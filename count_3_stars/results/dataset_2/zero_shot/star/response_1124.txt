Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (6, 7, 5)>
<4, (9, 7, 0)>
