Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 19) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 17) (17, 11) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 18) (18, 1) (18, 4) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 2) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 6) (12, 15) (12, 16) (6, 19) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 16) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 13) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 2) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <5, (9, 4, 16)>, <9, (5, 4, 0)>, <1, (3, 15, 13)>, and <15, (1, 19, 0)>.
