Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 14) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 13) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 14) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 9) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 1) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (13, 1, 9)>
<2, (13, 6, 12)>
<3, (5, 7, 14)>
<4, (12, 5, 14)>
<8, (13, 5, 9)>
<10, (11, 6, 7)>
<11, (1, 13, 12)>
<13, (1, 11, 9)>
