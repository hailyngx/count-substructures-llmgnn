Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 9) (8, 11) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 9) 

Response:
The given graph contains 6 3-stars. 
Here is the count of the 3-stars and the unique 3-stars found:
[6]

<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (3, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 8, 13)>
<14, (0, 8, 9)>
