Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 17) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 19) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 17) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 16) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 18) (17, 11) (17, 2) (17, 1) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 19) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 9) (7, 13) (7, 16) (16, 14) (16, 7) (16, 3) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 18) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 19) (12, 11) (12, 8) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

<4, (8, 14, 3)>
<13, (15, 7, 18)>
<0, (8, 19, 3)>
<8, (4, 0, 12)>
<15, (1, 19, 13)>
<2, (10, 17, 9)>
<3, (4, 0, 16)>
<1, (17, 9, 15)>
