Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 14) (4, 7) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 17) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 9) (2, 12) (2, 14) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 8) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 0) (15, 4) (15, 18) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 0) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (6, 18) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 0) (14, 16) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 3) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 3) (8, 10) (8, 18) (8, 1) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 6) (3, 16) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 19) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<4, (7, 3, 15)>
<7, (4, 1, 17)>
<1, (13, 0, 8)>
<10, (17, 8, 10)>
<17, (7, 9, 12)>
<9, (14, 3, 17)>
<18, (6, 8, 15)>
<13, (1, 0, 19)>
<15, (4, 18, 0)>
<12, (11, 17, 2)>
<6, (18, 0, 19)>
<14, (16, 2, 9)>
<19, (13, 3, 6)>
<8, (10, 1, 18)>
<0, (13, 1, 6)>
<3, (16, 9, 19)>
