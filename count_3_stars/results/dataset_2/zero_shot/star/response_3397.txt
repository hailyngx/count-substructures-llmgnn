Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 1) (4, 8) (4, 14) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (7, 8, 13)>
<9, (0, 12, 14)>
<8, (4, 11, 12)>
<13, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (8, 14, 9)>
<0, (9, 10, 14)>
<5, (1, 11, 12)>
<3, (7, 11, 12)>
<11, (0, 5, 8)>
<10, (0, 7, 12)>
<2, (3, 5, 12)>
<12, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 10)>
<1, (0, 5, 13)>
