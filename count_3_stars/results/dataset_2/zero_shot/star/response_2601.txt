Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 1, 2)>
<6, (7, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
