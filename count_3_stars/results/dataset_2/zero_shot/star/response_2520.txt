Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 28) (22, 14) (22, 3) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (6, 17) (6, 20) (14, 22) (14, 17) (14, 23) (14, 25) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 19) (1, 5) (1, 21) (1, 18) (21, 1) (21, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 7) (12, 4) (29, 17) (29, 11) (4, 12) (27, 3) (27, 28) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 25) (16, 25) (16, 18) (16, 10) (28, 13) (28, 27) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 23) (3, 13) (3, 22) (3, 5) (3, 27) (10, 16) (10, 0) (10, 24) (23, 14) (23, 0) (23, 26) (23, 24) (26, 23) (26, 15) (26, 11) (15, 26) (15, 8) (20, 6) (20, 7) (20, 18) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 15) (8, 11) (25, 14) (25, 19) (25, 16) (25, 18) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 20) (18, 25) (24, 10) (24, 23) (11, 5) (11, 29) (11, 26) (11, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by examining the nodes connected to every node in the graph and seeing if they form a 3-star configuration. 

The nodes with exactly three edges connected to them are: 1, 4, 6, 9, 16, 20, 21, 22, 24, 27, 28

Let's identify the 3-star configurations for each of these nodes:

<1, (5, 19, 21)>
<4, (12, 26, 29)>
<6, (17, 20, 14)>
<9, (2, 12, 4)>
<16, (18, 25, 10)>
<20, (7, 18, 6)>
<21, (1, 12, 0)>
<22, (14, 3, 23)>
<24, (10, 23, 24)>
<27, (3, 28, 15)>
<28, (13, 27, 14)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find 10 unique 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
