Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (6, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 0, 7)>
<1, (5, 3, 6)>
