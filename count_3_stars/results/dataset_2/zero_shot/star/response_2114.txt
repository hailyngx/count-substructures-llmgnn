Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the graph:

<6, (9, 3, 4)>
<9, (6, 3, 0)>
<2, (8, 0, 5)>
<8, (6, 2, 7)>
<0, (9, 2, 7)>
<7, (8, 0, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
