Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
