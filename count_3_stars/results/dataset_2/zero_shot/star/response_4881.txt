Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (12, 9) (12, 7) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<5, (9, 1, 2)>, <9, (5, 10, 8)>, <4, (7, 13, 0)>, <7, (4, 12, 11)>, <1, (5, 3, 6)>, <3, (9, 10, 14)>, <10, (9, 3, 8)>, <8, (9, 7, 10)>, <13, (4, 3, 11)>, <12, (9, 7, 6)>, <6, (7, 1, 2)>, <0, (4, 11, 6)>, <2, (5, 1, 6)>, <14, (4, 7, 3)>]
There are total [14] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
