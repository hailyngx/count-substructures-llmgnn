Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are <5, (1, 3, 0)>, <9, (6, 4, 2)>, <6, (9, 1, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 3)>, <3, (5, 1, 7)>, <4, (9, 1, 2)>, <8, (3, 2, 0)>, <2, (9, 1, 4)>, <0, (5, 9, 8)>, and <7, (9, 6, 0)>. Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
