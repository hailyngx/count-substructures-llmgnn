Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
[<0, (8, 9, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 7, 6)>, <3, (8, 4, 1)>, <4, (9, 8, 6)>, <6, (2, 1, 4)>, <7, (2, 0, 8)>, <8, (7, 0, 3)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>]
