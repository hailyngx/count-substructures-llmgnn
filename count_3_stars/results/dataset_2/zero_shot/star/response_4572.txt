Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
