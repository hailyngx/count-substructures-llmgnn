Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are [11] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 1, 6)>
<5, (9, 8, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>
<9, (5, 2, 1)>
<4, (7, 8, 2)>
<4, (7, 3, 8)>
<4, (7, 2, 3)>
<7, (9, 4, 2)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<3, (4, 7, 1)>
<0, (5, 8, 3)>
