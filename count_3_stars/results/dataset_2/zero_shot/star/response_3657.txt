Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 6) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 10) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (6, 8, 13)>
<7, (9, 11, 12)>
<12, (5, 7, 14)>
<8, (3, 6, 14)>
<9, (4, 7, 11)>
