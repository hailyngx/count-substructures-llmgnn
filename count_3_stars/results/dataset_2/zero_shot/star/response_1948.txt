Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 5) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 15) (9, 20) (9, 23) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 27) (3, 19) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 29) (10, 11) (10, 12) (20, 9) (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 23) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 0) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 22) (6, 22) (6, 4) (6, 27) (28, 8) (28, 27) (28, 19) (8, 28) (8, 0) (19, 3) (19, 28) (14, 20) (14, 26) (14, 1) (26, 14) (26, 2) (27, 3) (27, 25) (27, 6) (27, 28) (2, 5) (2, 26) (2, 1) (2, 24) (2, 21) (24, 16) (24, 2) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 3) (17, 18) (13, 16) (13, 7) (13, 21) (21, 2) (21, 13) (21, 29) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 4) (0, 25) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 23) (4, 6) (4, 1) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 29) (22, 12) (22, 6) (23, 9) (23, 20) (23, 0) (23, 29) (29, 15) (29, 21) (29, 18) (29, 23) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. The final answer is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (25, 8, 18)>
<4, (6, 1, 21)>
<9, (15, 20, 23)>
<10, (11, 12, 22)>
<16, (11, 24, 13)>
