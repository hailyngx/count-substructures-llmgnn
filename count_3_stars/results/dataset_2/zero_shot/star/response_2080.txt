Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 9) (12, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. The answer is [5].
The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (12, 5, 1)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<10, (4, 11, 14)>
<13, (8, 5, 1)>
<2, (8, 12, 14)>
