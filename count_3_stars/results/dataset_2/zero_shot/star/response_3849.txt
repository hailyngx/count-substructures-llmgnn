Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 14) (9, 23) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 29) (26, 11) (5, 1) (5, 7) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 18) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (21, 6) (21, 8) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 29) (20, 0) (20, 13) (20, 27) (20, 23) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 22) (28, 26) (28, 17) (28, 24) (6, 7) (6, 21) (6, 19) (6, 27) (4, 3) (4, 16) (27, 20) (27, 6) (27, 18) (27, 1) (11, 26) (11, 3) (11, 2) (13, 20) (13, 12) (13, 29) (13, 1) (17, 28) (17, 19) (14, 9) (14, 26) (14, 7) (14, 22) (14, 2) (18, 15) (18, 27) (18, 19) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 23) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 14) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 25) (16, 10) (1, 5) (1, 27) (1, 13) (29, 26) (29, 0) (29, 13) (25, 16) (22, 12) (22, 14) (23, 9) (23, 20) (23, 19) (8, 21) (24, 0) (24, 28) (10, 3) (10, 16) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <>:
<1, (5, 27, 13)>
<6, (21, 27, 19)>
<7, (5, 14, 6)>
<12, (13, 20, 29)>
<14, (9, 26, 22)>
<16, (4, 10, 25)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
