Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 18) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 15) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 1) (2, 0) (2, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 18) (17, 1) (17, 11) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 15) (16, 12) (16, 9) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 2) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 15) (4, 19) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 11) (15, 6) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 12)
