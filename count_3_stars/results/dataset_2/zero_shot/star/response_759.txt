Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (6, 2, 1)>
<9, (6, 8, 0)>
<4, (8, 0, 1)>
<3, (9, 6, 4)>
