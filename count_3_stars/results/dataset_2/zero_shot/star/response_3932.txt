Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count is written inside brackets []:

<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<5, (9, 7, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 7, 2)>
<4, (9, 7, 6)>
<7, (9, 5, 8)>
