Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 6) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 1) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 4) (11, 15) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 17) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 16) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 16) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 8) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 12) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (12, 15) (12, 4) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 13) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 8) (16, 7) (18, 5) (18, 13) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<17, (2, 9, 3)>
<11, (14, 10, 15)>
<5, (19, 18, 0)>
<10, (8, 16, 5)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<13, (0, 6, 18)>
