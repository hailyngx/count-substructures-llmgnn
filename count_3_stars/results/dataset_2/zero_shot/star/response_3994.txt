Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 16) (3, 10) (4, 9) (4, 19) (18, 12) (18, 13) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 17) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 12) (15, 2) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 13) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 13) (16, 1) (16, 14) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (17, 2) (17, 11) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 12) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 6) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 19) (7, 6) (7, 14) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 7) (14, 12) (12, 18) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
There are 10 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<2, (8, 5, 17)>
<4, (9, 0, 19)>
<11, (5, 17, 13)>
<12, (18, 9, 14)>
<13, (18, 15, 0)>
<14, (16, 19, 7)>
<15, (2, 10, 6)>
<16, (1, 14, 16)>
<17, (2, 15, 11)>
<18, (12, 13, 0)>

Therefore, the count of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
