Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

[4]

<5, (9, 6, 13)>
<9, (5, 10, 14)>
<6, (5, 9, 8)>
<3, (11, 14, 12)>
