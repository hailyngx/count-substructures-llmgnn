Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 9) (1, 15) (1, 11) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 17) (18, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 8) (14, 7) (17, 18) (17, 16) (17, 11) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 13) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 16) (12, 4) (12, 5) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 5) (19, 11) (5, 18) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (16, 2) (16, 17) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 6) (10, 4) (10, 16) (13, 18) (13, 15) (6, 16) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars found:
<4, (7, 8, 12)>
<2, (3, 18, 8)>
<8, (4, 2, 9)>
<11, (17, 19, 5)>
