Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (1, 9, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
