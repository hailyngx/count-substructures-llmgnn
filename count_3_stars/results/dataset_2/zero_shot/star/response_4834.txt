Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 14) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 3) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 10) (1, 7) (1, 9) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [8]
