Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 3) (15, 29) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 23) (4, 7) (4, 22) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (3, 15) (3, 25) (3, 0) (3, 13) (25, 3) (25, 8) (25, 14) (25, 10) (6, 2) (6, 13) (6, 16) (9, 21) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 7) (12, 9) (12, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 11) (29, 15) (29, 22) (29, 24) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 23) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 28) (18, 24) (26, 2) (16, 6) (16, 28) (16, 8) (16, 14) (28, 13) (28, 16) (14, 25) (14, 16) (19, 11) (19, 0) (22, 4) (22, 29) (22, 20) (22, 1) (22, 21) (21, 9) (21, 22) (21, 2) (8, 25) (8, 17) (8, 16) (2, 6) (2, 26) (2, 21) (2, 23) (0, 3) (0, 19) (23, 27) (23, 5) (23, 2) (11, 9) (11, 17) (11, 19) (10, 25) (10, 12) (10, 20) (20, 27) (20, 22) (20, 10) (1, 7) (1, 22) (1, 24) (24, 29) (24, 18) (24, 1)
