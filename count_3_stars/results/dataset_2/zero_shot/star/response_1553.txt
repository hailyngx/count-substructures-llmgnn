Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 16) (8, 18) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) (0, 17) (0, 6) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 12) (10, 4) (10, 16) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 17) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 11) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 18) (5, 4) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 19) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 6) (17, 19) (3, 14) (3, 9) (16, 8) (16, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 17) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 3) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 11) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
