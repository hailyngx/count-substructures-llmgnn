Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 24) (5, 16) (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 22) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 0) (10, 8) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 27) (10, 7) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 24) (2, 8) (2, 22) (2, 27) (2, 25) (26, 28) (26, 20) (26, 29) (26, 16) (28, 26) (28, 3) (1, 4) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 27) (22, 6) (22, 2) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 25) (16, 5) (16, 26) (16, 21) (16, 12) (16, 14) (21, 13) (21, 16) (21, 20) (3, 10) (3, 28) (3, 27) (12, 9) (12, 16) (12, 19) (12, 23) (11, 24) (11, 18) (11, 4) (24, 5) (24, 17) (24, 11) (24, 19) (7, 8) (7, 10) (14, 16) (27, 10) (27, 2) (27, 29) (27, 3) (18, 11) (18, 25) (23, 12) (20, 26) (20, 22) (20, 21) (25, 2) (25, 22) (25, 18) (0, 13) (0, 22) (0, 19) (19, 12) (19, 24) (19, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:

<5, (16, 17, 24)>
<9, (6, 12, 29)>
<26, (16, 28, 29)>
<22, (2, 20, 25)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
