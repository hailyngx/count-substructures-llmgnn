Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 7) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 11) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 7) (2, 6) (2, 10) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 1, 13)>
<9, (5, 8, 11)>
<1, (5, 11, 14)>
<8, (9, 4, 14)>
<0, (9, 1, 14)>
<14, (1, 8, 0)>
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
