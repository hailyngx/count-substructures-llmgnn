Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 4) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) 

Response:
There are [16] 3-stars in the given graph.

<2, (7, 10, 14)>
<3, (5, 4, 12)>
<4, (6, 1, 13)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (9, 1, 4)>
<7, (2, 7, 14)>
<8, (7, 8, 13)>
<9, (6, 9, 13)>
<10, (0, 11, 14)>
<11, (1, 8, 11)>
<12, (0, 5, 3)>
<13, (8, 4, 12)>
<14, (10, 11, 2)>
<15, (5, 1, 7)>
