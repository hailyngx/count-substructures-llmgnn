Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 5) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 7) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 4) (2, 18) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 12) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 6) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 11) (3, 2) (11, 2) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 19) (1, 10) (1, 15) (15, 13) (15, 1) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 19) (12, 18) (12, 16) (12, 0) (16, 14) (16, 12) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 19) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 12) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<14, (17, 8, 19)>
<13, (8, 5, 15)>
<10, (6, 1, 4)>
<18, (2, 4, 12)>
<5, (17, 13, 6)>
<11, (2, 6, 4)>
<1, (10, 15, 1)>
<0, (6, 9, 12)>
