Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 15) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 8) (12, 16) (12, 0) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 15) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 18) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 4) (18, 11) (18, 13) (18, 19) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 4) (9, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 15) (4, 16) (4, 19) (4, 5) (15, 17) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 2) 

Response:
There are 16 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 10, 8)>
<3, (1, 11, 9)>
<10, (1, 19, 14)>
<17, (13, 8, 15)>
<7, (16, 6, 8)>
<12, (16, 0, 7)>
<0, (12, 6, 16)>
<14, (10, 15, 5)>
<11, (3, 19, 18)>
<13, (17, 16, 15)>
<16, (7, 12, 13)>
<18, (11, 13, 19)>
<19, (10, 11, 18)>
<9, (3, 5, 4)>
<5, (8, 4, 16)>
<2, (6, 15, 2)>
