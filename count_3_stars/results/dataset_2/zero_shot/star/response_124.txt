Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<4, (9, 7, 0)>
<7, (9, 4, 3)>
<1, (7, 3, 2)>
<3, (9, 7, 1)>
<6, (9, 7, 2)>
<8, (5, 3, 0)>
