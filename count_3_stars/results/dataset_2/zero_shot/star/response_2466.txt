Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars. The count of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

<5, (4, 3, 9)>
<4, (5, 0, 6)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>
