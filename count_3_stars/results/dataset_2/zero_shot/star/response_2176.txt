Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 7) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 13) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 14) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 3) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 2, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<10, (0, 12, 8)>
<4, (9, 12, 13)>
