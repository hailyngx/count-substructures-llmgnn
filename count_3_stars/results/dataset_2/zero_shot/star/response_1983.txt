Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
The center node of each 3-star can be any node with exactly 3 neighbors. Let's identify all the possible 3-star configurations based on the given graph:

1. Center node: 5
   Leaves: 1, 2, 7

2. Center node: 9
   Leaves: 2, 3, 4

3. Center node: 4
   Leaves: 0, 7, 8

4. Center node: 7
   Leaves: 0, 1, 4

5. Center node: 8
   Leaves: 1, 4, 5

6. Center node: 0
   Leaves: 3, 4, 6

7. Center node: 1
   Leaves: 2, 5, 7

8. Center node: 2
   Leaves: 1, 3, 9

9. Center node: 3
   Leaves: 0, 2, 9

10. Center node: 6
    Leaves: 0, 7

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 2, 7)> <9, (2, 3, 4)> <4, (0, 7, 8)> <7, (0, 1, 4)> <8, (1, 4, 5)> <0, (3, 4, 6)> <1, (2, 5, 7)> <2, (1, 3, 9)> <3, (0, 2, 9)> <6, (0, 7)>
