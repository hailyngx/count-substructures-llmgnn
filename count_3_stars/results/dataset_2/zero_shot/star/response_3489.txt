Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 10) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 15) (7, 13) (6, 14) (6, 18) (6, 11) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 17) (8, 16) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 16) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 13) (1, 0) (1, 15) (1, 19) (15, 4) (15, 1) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 0) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 19) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 12) (16, 18) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 16) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 3) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<> <5, (9, 11, 10)>
<> <9, (5, 14, 10)>
<> <14, (9, 6, 12)>
<> <4, (17, 19, 15)>
