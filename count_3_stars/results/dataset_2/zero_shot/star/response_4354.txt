Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<8, (5, 4, 2)>
<4, (9, 8, 6)>
<1, (5, 3, 0)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (9, 3, 6)>
<5, (9, 8, 1)>
