Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 21) (3, 26) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 5) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 27) (18, 23) (18, 10) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 1) (8, 14) (8, 29) (8, 25) (8, 11) (13, 2) (13, 7) (10, 18) (10, 17) (10, 28) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 23) (0, 17) (0, 20) (20, 15) (20, 0) (20, 19) (20, 11) (28, 10) (28, 11) (28, 24) (5, 15) (5, 22) (5, 26) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 7) (14, 25) (11, 8) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 4) (21, 3) (21, 2) (29, 9) (29, 8) (29, 23) (29, 12) (26, 3) (26, 5) (26, 14) (26, 7) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 26) (7, 16) (16, 22) (16, 7) (1, 6) (1, 22) (1, 24) (2, 13) (2, 21) (12, 29) (19, 15) (19, 20) (19, 24) (19, 27) (25, 8) (25, 14) (25, 27) (27, 9) (27, 19) (27, 25) (27, 24) (23, 18) (23, 17) (23, 29) (24, 28) (24, 1) (24, 19) (24, 27) (4, 15) (4, 11) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<8, (11, 20, 28)>
<29, (9, 12, 23)>
<15, (4, 5, 19)>
<14, (7, 8, 25)>
<15, (0, 20, 19)>
<15, (4, 15, 5)>
