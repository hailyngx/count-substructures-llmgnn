Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (1, 0, 4)>
<6, (9, 2, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (9, 6, 7)>
