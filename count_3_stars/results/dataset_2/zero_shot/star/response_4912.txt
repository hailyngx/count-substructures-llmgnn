Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 17) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 15) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 2) (15, 14) (15, 3) (15, 12) (13, 5) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 19) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 12) (12, 15) (12, 19) (16, 4) (16, 6) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 19) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 0) (6, 10) (6, 16) (0, 5) (0, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (7, 5) (7, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of occurrences of each node as the central node in all 3-stars.

We will list all the unique 3-stars and then count them.

Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 13, 0)>
<9, (5, 18, 17)>
<14, (11, 7, 15)>
<17, (9, 19, 2)>
<1, (3, 10, 18)>
<3, (1, 15, 8)>
<10, (1, 11, 6)>
<11, (14, 10, 2)>
<15, (14, 12, 3)>
<13, (5)>
<18, (9, 1, 19)>
<19, (17, 18, 2)>
<12, (15, 19)>
<16, (4, 6)>
<2, (17, 1, 11, 19)>
<4, (19, 16, 0)>
<6, (10, 16)>
<0, (5, 4)>
<8, (1, 3)>
<7, (5, 14)>

Count of 3-stars: [19]
