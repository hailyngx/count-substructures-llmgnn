Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (7, 2, 4)>
<9, (3, 1, 7)>
<1, (9, 5, 4)>
<3, (9, 7, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
