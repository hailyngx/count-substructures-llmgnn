Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 13) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 10) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 10) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

<6, (1, 3, 10)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (5, 4, 14)>
<3, (8, 12, 13)>
