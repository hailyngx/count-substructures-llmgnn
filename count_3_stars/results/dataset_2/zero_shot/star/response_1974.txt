Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (6, 8, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (7, 9, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 0)>
