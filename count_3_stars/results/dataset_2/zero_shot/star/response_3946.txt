Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 21) (15, 11) (15, 16) (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 25) (21, 15) (21, 1) (21, 14) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 20) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (2, 6) (2, 28) (12, 7) (12, 27) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 6) (28, 3) (28, 2) (28, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 3) (14, 21) (14, 0) (14, 26) (14, 23) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 18) (26, 20) (18, 3) (18, 26) (25, 1) (25, 9) (25, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 9) (17, 3) (17, 13) (17, 22) (8, 0) (8, 9) (19, 22) (19, 6) (22, 17) (22, 19) (9, 25) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 23) (10, 15) (10, 28) (10, 6) (11, 15) (24, 27) (24, 5) (5, 25) (5, 24) (5, 23) (23, 14) (23, 9) (23, 5) (23, 16) (20, 4) (20, 26) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 13) (16, 23) (6, 2) (6, 27) (6, 19) (6, 10)
