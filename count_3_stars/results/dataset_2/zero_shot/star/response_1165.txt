Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<4, (7, 5, 1)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (7, 6, 3)>
