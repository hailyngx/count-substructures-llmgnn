Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 19) (7, 4) (7, 5) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 16) (9, 4) (9, 2) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 11) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 19) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 18) (3, 8) (11, 17) (11, 8) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 14) (15, 0) (15, 5) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (16, 6) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 18) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 14) (19, 4) (19, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 14) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 5) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-star structures in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (2, 9, 19)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 13, 16)>
<1, (6, 10, 14)>
<12, (0, 17, 18)>
<15, (0, 5, 14)>
