Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 4) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 6) (4, 16) (4, 9) (4, 17) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 12) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 12) (17, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 9) (15, 5) (15, 6) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 19) (6, 15) (10, 13) (10, 0) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 18) (7, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 7) (18, 16) (18, 7) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (8, 10, 14)>
<4, (16, 9, 17)>
<6, (13, 15, 19)>
<7, (3, 5, 18)>
<9, (4, 7, 14)>
<11, (8, 16, 6)>
<13, (8, 10, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
