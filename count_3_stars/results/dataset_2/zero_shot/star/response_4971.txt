Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) 

Response:
The center of a 3-star must have exactly three adjacent nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:
- For node 5, possible 3-star combinations: <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (9, 3, 4)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>, <5, (6, 4, 8)>.
- For node 9, possible 3-star combinations: <9, (5, 3, 1)>.
- For node 1, possible 3-star combination: <1, (9, 2, 4)>.
- For node 3, possible 3-star combinations: <3, (5, 9, 8)>, <3, (5, 9, 4)>, <3, (5, 4, 8)>.
- For node 4, possible 3-star combinations: <4, (5, 1, 3)>, <4, (5, 3, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 6)>.
- For node 8, possible 3-star combination: <8, (5, 3, 2)>.
- For node 6, possible 3-star combination: <6, (5, 4, 7)>.
- For node 7, possible 3-star combination: <7, (8, 6, 0)>.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
