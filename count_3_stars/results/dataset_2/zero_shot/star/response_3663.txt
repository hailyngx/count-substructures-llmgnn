Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
