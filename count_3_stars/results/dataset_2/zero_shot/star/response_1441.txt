Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 7, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<6, (9, 2, 0)>
<1, (9, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 2)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
<8, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (6, 3, 4)>
<0, (5, 6, 0)>
