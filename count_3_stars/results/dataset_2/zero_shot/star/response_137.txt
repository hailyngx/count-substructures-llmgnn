Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 4) (12, 10) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 0) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4.

[4]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (6, 8, 11)>
<9, (0, 7, 14)>
<4, (8, 10, 12)>
<3, (1, 10, 11)>
