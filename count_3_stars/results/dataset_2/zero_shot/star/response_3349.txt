Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 18) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 11) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 14) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 18) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 19) (5, 17) (5, 8) (5, 11) (6, 15) (6, 16) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 16) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (13, 16) (13, 11) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 2) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 13) (15, 6) (15, 9) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 16) (16, 6) (16, 18) (16, 13) (16, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with degree 3 are 4, 10, 17, 8, 1, 3, 11, 16, 18. 

<4, (19, 10, 3)>
<17, (10, 5, 8)>
<8, (17, 5, 14)>
<1, (2, 10, 12)>
<3, (4, 0, 14)>
<11, (7, 17, 5)>
<16, (6, 18, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
