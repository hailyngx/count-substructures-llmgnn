Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs present in the given graph are as follows:

<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 2, 3)>
<4, (5, 3, 0)>
<7, (9, 6, 0)>
<1, (9, 3, 6)>
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<8, (1, 3, 0)>
<6, (7, 1, 0)>
<2, (9, 7, 1)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
