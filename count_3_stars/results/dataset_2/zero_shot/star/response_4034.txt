Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 18) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 9) (15, 1) (15, 4) (2, 13) (2, 9) (12, 10) (12, 19) (14, 6) (14, 8) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 3) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 9) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (19, 7) (19, 12) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 12) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 7)
