Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 1) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 14) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (9, 13, 14)>
<4, (7, 10, 11)>
<6, (5, 9, 13)>
<7, (4, 6, 14)>
