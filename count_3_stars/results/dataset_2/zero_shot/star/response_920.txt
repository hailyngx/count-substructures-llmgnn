Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 20) (13, 0) (13, 27) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 11) (26, 4) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 29) (11, 26) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (6, 1) (6, 12) (21, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (15, 16) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 20) (19, 11) (19, 5) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 23) (25, 18) (27, 13) (27, 25) (27, 9) (27, 8) (16, 15) (16, 29) (16, 8) (2, 12) (2, 20) (2, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 29) (17, 9) (0, 13) (0, 8) (28, 22) (28, 23) (18, 11) (18, 25) (18, 23) (23, 25) (23, 28) (23, 18) (8, 27) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 29) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 7) (14, 10) (22, 28) (22, 14) (4, 26) (4, 2) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 27) (9, 17) (9, 4) (20, 13) (20, 5) (20, 2) (29, 3) (29, 16) (29, 12) (29, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (24, 12) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<13, (26, 21, 20)>
<26, (13, 25, 11)>
<3, (11, 9, 5)>
<11, (26, 3, 19)>
<6, (1, 12, 21)>
<1, (6, 10, 13)>
<16, (15, 29, 8)>
<15, (16, 29, 8)>
<2, (12, 20, 4)>
<12, (6, 2, 24)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
