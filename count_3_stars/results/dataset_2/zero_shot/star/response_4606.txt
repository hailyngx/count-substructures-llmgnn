Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 2)>
<4, (6, 5, 9)>
Therefore, the final answer is [3].
