Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 6)
