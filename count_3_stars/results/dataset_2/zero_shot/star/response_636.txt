Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 13) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 18) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 19) (7, 9) (15, 17) (15, 16) (13, 14) (13, 17) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 6) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 4) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 6) (6, 14) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 4) (18, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be determined by counting the number of nodes that have 3 connections to other nodes. Since each 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can by counting the occurence of such nodes.

Firstly, let's analyze the nodes based on their degree:

- Node 11 has a degree of 6.
- Node 3, 8, 12, 16, and 4 have a degree of 4.
- Node 0, 2, 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 19 have a degree of 3.
- Node 1, 7, 10, and 18 have a degree of 2.

From the list above, we can see that the nodes with a degree of 3 are the central nodes of the 3-stars in this graph. There are 9 such nodes: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, 15, and 17. 

Therefore, the count of 3-stars in the graph is simply the number of central nodes with a degree of 3, which is [9]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in this graph:
- <0, (10, 6, 9)>
- <2, (11, 8, 5)>
- <5, (11, 2, 4)>
- <6, (14, 0, 19)>
- <9, (11, 0, 4)>
- <13, (14, 17, 13)>
- <14, (13, 6, 17)>
- <15, (17, 16, 15)>
- <17, (15, 13, 16)>
