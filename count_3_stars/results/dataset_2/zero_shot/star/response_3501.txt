Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 7) 

Response:
There are [11] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (6, 8, 10)>
<6, (4, 5, 14)>
<9, (4, 7, 11)>
<10, (5, 12, 4)>
<11, (9, 14, 7)>
<12, (3, 10, 13)>
<14, (6, 11, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 9, 13)>
<4, (2, 6, 10)>
