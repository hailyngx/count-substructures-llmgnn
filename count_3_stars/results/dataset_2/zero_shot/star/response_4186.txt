Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 total 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are listed below:
<9, (5, 0, 1)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<7, (9, 4, 2)>
<1, (9, 4, 0)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (9, 4, 3)>
<6, (4, 8, 2)>
<2, (9, 7, 1)>

Thus, the final answer is [8].
