Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (1, 0, 3)>
<9, (8, 4, 3)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
<8, (9, 4, 2)>
<6, (7, 3, 2)>
<2, (8, 1, 3)>
