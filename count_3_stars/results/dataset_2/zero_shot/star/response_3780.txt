Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 5) (21, 29) (21, 14) (3, 22) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 28) (5, 21) (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 0) (9, 23) (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 2) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 10) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 23) (8, 23) (8, 26) (23, 9) (23, 12) (23, 8) (23, 18) (23, 2) (6, 2) (28, 15) (28, 22) (28, 19) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 14) (19, 0) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 10) (22, 3) (22, 28) (22, 7) (13, 26) (4, 3) (4, 12) (17, 20) (17, 24) (17, 11) (29, 21) (29, 9) (29, 11) (16, 21) (16, 2) (16, 14) (10, 25) (10, 26) (10, 7) (24, 17) (24, 0) (14, 21) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 16) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 7) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 24) (0, 11) (7, 15) (7, 22) (7, 10) (7, 18) (2, 20) (2, 23) (2, 6) (2, 16) (11, 20) (11, 17) (11, 29) (11, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (21, 15, 5)>
<21, (1, 16, 5)>
<5, (21, 9, 29)>
<9, (5, 23, 0)>
<20, (25, 17, 11)>
<26, (8, 19, 10)>
