Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 19) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 5) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 1) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 13) (8, 19) (9, 11) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 8) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 11) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 6) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 13) (15, 0) (4, 13) (4, 6) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 6) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 13) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<18, (1, 2, 5)>
<13, (0, 1, 4)>
<16, (3, 6, 17)>
<5, (3, 11, 18)>
<1, (2, 13, 18)>
<6, (13, 16, 4)>
<12, (13, 3, 10)>
<17, (14, 16, 19)>
<14, (7, 17, 3)>
<0, (13, 15, 19)>
<15, (0, 13, 19)>
<4, (6, 13, 16)>
<11, (5, 7, 19)>
<10, (11, 12, 7)>
<9, (11, 19, 8)>
<8, (11, 19, 8)>
