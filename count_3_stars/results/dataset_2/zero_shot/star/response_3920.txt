Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)> 
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)> 

There are 8 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final answer is [8].
