Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<5, (9, 4, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 2)>
<7, (5, 4, 3)>
<0, (5, 9, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
