Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 14) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 11) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 12) 

Response:
There are `10` 3-stars in the given graph.
