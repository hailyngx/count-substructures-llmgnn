Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 14) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) 

Response:
There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (9, 7, 14)>
<1, (4, 3, 12)>
<2, (4, 13, 14)>
<3, (1, 11, 8)>
<4, (6, 1, 14)>
<5, (6, 11, 12)>
<7, (11, 0, 13)>
<8, (6, 3, 9)>
<10, (1, 7, 12)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
