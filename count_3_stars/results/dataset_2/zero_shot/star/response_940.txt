Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 13) (6, 2) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 13) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 16) (17, 12) (17, 2) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 13) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 0) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 7) (12, 19) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 10) (2, 6) (2, 17) (10, 0) (10, 16) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 1) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 4) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 19) (4, 11) (4, 19) (19, 12) (19, 1) (19, 4) (16, 14) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 1) (5, 3) (5, 18) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (9, 11, 19)>
<2, (6, 12, 17)>
<8, (3, 13, 15)>
<18, (1, 14, 16)>
