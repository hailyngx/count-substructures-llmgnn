Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (2, 12, 4)>
<9, (6, 14, 1)>
