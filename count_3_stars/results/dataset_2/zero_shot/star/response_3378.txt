Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 7, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (9, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 2, 8)>
<3, (6, 1, 7)>
<0, (9, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 0, 7)>
<7, (5, 1, 3)>
