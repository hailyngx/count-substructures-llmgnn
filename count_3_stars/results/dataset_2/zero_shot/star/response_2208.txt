Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
There are <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <9, (4, 3, 1)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (9, 7, 1)>, <7, (5, 3, 2)>, <2, (5, 7, 0)>, <8, (5, 7, 3)>, <0, (6, 4, 2)>, <1, (9, 4, 0)>, <3, (5, 9, 8)>.

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
