Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 24) (26, 14) (26, 20) (26, 27) (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 23) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 20) (7, 21) (7, 27) (21, 3) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 13) (0, 24) (0, 18) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 22) (8, 19) (8, 28) (8, 5) (19, 8) (19, 17) (14, 26) (14, 6) (14, 2) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 13) (28, 10) (4, 11) (4, 29) (4, 17) (22, 1) (22, 5) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 23) (16, 12) (16, 23) (16, 10) (29, 1) (29, 4) (29, 13) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 11) (5, 8) (5, 22) (5, 17) (23, 15) (23, 12) (23, 16) (10, 6) (10, 21) (10, 28) (10, 16) (13, 21) (13, 28) (13, 29) (13, 2) (13, 25) (20, 26) (20, 6) (20, 1) (25, 13) (24, 9) (24, 0) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 27) (27, 26) (27, 7) (27, 18) (17, 19) (17, 4) (17, 2) (17, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) 

Response:
There are 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which can be listed as follows:
<3, (15, 1, 23)>
<6, (14, 2, 10)>
<7, (21, 27, 13)>
<8, (19, 5, 28)>
<10, (6, 21, 16)>
<12, (18, 16, 23)>
<13, (2, 29, 25)>
<14, (26, 6, 2)>
<15, (3, 1, 23)>
<16, (12, 10, 23)>
<19, (8, 17, 28)>
<21, (3, 7, 10)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
