Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 7) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 13) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 13) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
<4, (14, 6, 0)>
<5, (8, 6, 11)>
<6, (5, 3, 13)>
<8, (5, 9, 10)>
<11, (5, 2, 3)>
<12, (5, 14, 1)>
<13, (6, 14, 7)>
<1, (11, 12, 10)>
<2, (11, 9, 13)>
<3, (6, 0, 2)>
<7, (14, 9, 13)>
<9, (8, 2, 7)>
<10, (8, 14, 1)>
<14, (4, 12, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
