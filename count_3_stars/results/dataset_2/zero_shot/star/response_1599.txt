Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (2, 1, 4)>
<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (5, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 0)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (5, 1, 4)>
<2, (5, 1, 4)>
<8, (6, 7, 2)>
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (6, 8, 2)>
