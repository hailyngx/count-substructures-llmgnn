Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 11) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 12) (1, 17) (1, 8) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 18) (0, 11) (0, 6) (7, 15) (8, 1) (8, 12) (9, 18) (9, 14) (16, 5) (16, 10) (12, 15) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 10) (18, 17) (18, 9) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 19) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 5) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 13) (5, 17) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 10) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
