Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (1, 11, 6)>
<9, (4, 10, 14)>
<4, (7, 13, 3)>
<7, (0, 14, 6)>
<10, (2, 11, 0)>
<11, (12, 2, 9)>
<6, (8, 13, 2)>
<2, (1, 6, 10)>
<0, (13, 7, 10)>
