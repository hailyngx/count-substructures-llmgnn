Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 6) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 12) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 6) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 12) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations in this graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 9, 10)>
<3, (7, 12, 14)>
<2, (8, 11, 13)>
<5, (0, 11, 14)>
<13, (2, 4, 10)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<12, (3, 5, 14)>
<11, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
