Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. Thus, the final answer is [6].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (8, 0, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (9, 0, 7)>
<0, (4, 2, 9)>
