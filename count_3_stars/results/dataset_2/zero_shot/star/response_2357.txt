Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. The answer is [8].
The 3-stars are:
<9, (1, 3, 0)>
<1, (9, 2, 7)>
<3, (9, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (6, 1, 4)>
<2, (9, 1, 5)>
<0, (9, 4, 5)>
