Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 18) (16, 10) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 10) (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 7) (6, 7) (6, 12) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 0) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 15) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 16) (18, 2) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 4) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 13) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 0) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 0) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 4) (0, 12)
