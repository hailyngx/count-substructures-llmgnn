Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 2) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 2) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 19) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 2) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 8) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 19) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 6) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 14) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 1) (1, 18) (1, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 16) (4, 15) (4, 9) (4, 6) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 18) (14, 9) (14, 13) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (13, 11) (13, 14) (19, 10) (19, 16) (19, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 19) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (17, 10, 2)>
<16, (12, 19, 2)>
<9, (16, 14, 4)>
<18, (5, 1, 9)>
<1, (18, 8, 13)>
<11, (0, 13, 3)>
<5, (15, 0, 18)>
<6, (19, 8, 12)>
