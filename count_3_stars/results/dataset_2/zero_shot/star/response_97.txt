Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 14) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 12) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) (1, 6) (1, 8) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) 

Response:
There is a total of [30] 3-stars in the given graph.
