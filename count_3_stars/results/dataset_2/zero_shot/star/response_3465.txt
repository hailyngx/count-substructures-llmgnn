Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 14) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 12) (15, 10) (15, 7) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 12) (13, 14) (17, 9) (17, 19) (10, 1) (10, 18) (10, 15) (10, 6) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 18) (12, 19) (12, 4) (12, 14) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 7) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 6) (0, 9) (0, 6) (11, 9) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

[4]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (9, 6, 0)>
<1, (3, 10, 1)>
<2, (3, 14, 2)>
<7, (5, 15, 8)>
