Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 13) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 13) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 7) 

Response:
There are <5, (9, 6, 2)>, <9, (5, 8, 12)>, <4, (8, 12, 2)>, <8, (9, 4, 2)>, <6, (5, 14, 7)>, <2, (5, 9, 4)>, <12, (9, 4, 13)>, <1, (5, 2, 10)>, <7, (6, 11, 10)>, and <11, (5, 12, 7)> as the unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
