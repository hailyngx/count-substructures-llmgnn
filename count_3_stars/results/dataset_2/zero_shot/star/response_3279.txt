Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 10) (2, 19) (2, 9) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 18) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 9) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 19) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 3) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 18) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 15) (0, 12) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 13) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 15) (10, 7) (10, 19) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<1, (7, 13, 17)>
<4, (7, 9, 13)>
<7, (1, 4, 10)>
<9, (2, 4, 16)>
<10, (7, 14, 19)>
<13, (3, 7, 15)>
<14, (3, 6, 18)>
<15, (9, 13, 17)>
<16, (9, 12, 18)>
<17, (11, 15, 16)>
<18, (12, 14, 16)>
<19, (8, 10, 14)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [12]
