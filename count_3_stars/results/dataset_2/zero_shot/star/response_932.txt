Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 22) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 11) (2, 29) (2, 16) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 14) (18, 12) (18, 25) (22, 5) (22, 9) (22, 8) (15, 16) (15, 24) (20, 12) (4, 10) (28, 9) (28, 29) (28, 0) (28, 13) (17, 3) (17, 21) (17, 7) (19, 5) (19, 29) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 6) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 14) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 8) (6, 19) (6, 14) (23, 25) (23, 10) (26, 21) (26, 27) (26, 7) (21, 17) (21, 16) (21, 26) (21, 11) (21, 25) (0, 28) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 8) (24, 2) (24, 15) (24, 16) (11, 9) (11, 21) (14, 29) (14, 16) (14, 6) (14, 10) (27, 29) (27, 26) (12, 18) (12, 20) (12, 1) (13, 28) (25, 18) (25, 23) (25, 21) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 26) (7, 8) (10, 4) (10, 23) (10, 14) (8, 22) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (19, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 17, 8)>
<7, (17, 19, 8)>
<8, (22, 1, 7)>
<9, (22, 28, 5)>
<29, (2, 28, 19)>
