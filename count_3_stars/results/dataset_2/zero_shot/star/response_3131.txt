Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) 

Response:
There are [10] total nodes and [40] edges in the graph. To find the number of 3-stars, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern in the graph.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
<5, (9, 8, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<6, (7, 3, 2)>
<4, (9, 6, 3)>
<8, (5, 0, 1)>
<0, (5, 8, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 1)>
<1, (9, 8, 7)>
<2, (9, 6, 4)>
<3, (6, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [(10)].
