Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is [4].
The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 1, 6)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>
<4, (5, 0, 3)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
