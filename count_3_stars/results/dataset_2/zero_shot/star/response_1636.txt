Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [18] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 1, 8)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<2, (9, 4, 0)>
<8, (6, 5, 0)>
<0, (2, 8, 7)>
<7, (9, 0, 3)>
<1, (6, 9, 0)>
<3, (8, 7, 4)>
<4, (9, 2, 0)>
<5, (8, 0, 7)>
