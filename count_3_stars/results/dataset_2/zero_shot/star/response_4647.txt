Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 12) (11, 4) (11, 13) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 0) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) 

Response:
There are 11 total 3-stars in this graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
<6, (9, 2, 4)>
<9, (6, 8, 1)>
<4, (6, 3, 13)>
<7, (12, 0, 14)>
<1, (9, 0, 3)>
<3, (4, 1, 5)>
<12, (9, 7, 5)>
<0, (7, 1, 5)>
<14, (7, 13, 0)>
<2, (6, 4, 13)>
<8, (6, 9, 12)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
