Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 3) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 19) (15, 19) (15, 7) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 8) (5, 14) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 14) (4, 8) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (7, 15) (7, 18) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 10) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 2) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 12) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 6) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 19) (13, 3) (13, 19) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 1) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-star graphs in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 12, 16)>
<1, (6, 10, 17)>
<2, (7, 10, 18)>
<3, (13, 16, 19)>
<4, (8, 12, 14)>
<5, (0, 10, 14)>
<6, (1, 11, 19)>
<7, (2, 15, 18)>
<8, (4, 12, 14)>
<9, (5, 8, 14)>
<15, (7, 15, 19)>
<17, (1, 14, 17)>
