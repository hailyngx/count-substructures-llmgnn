Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 19) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 19) (15, 4) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 18) (5, 3) (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 17) (9, 5) (1, 5) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 0) (19, 16) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 6) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 8) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 10) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 2) (2, 14) (2, 10) (12, 3) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 7) (6, 13) (7, 6) (7, 13) (13, 16) (13, 6) (13, 7) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 10)
