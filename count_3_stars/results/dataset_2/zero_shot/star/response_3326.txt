Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 23) (9, 0) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 3) (8, 4) (13, 15) (13, 27) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 6) (22, 24) (23, 9) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 1) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 27) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 27) (4, 8) (4, 20) (4, 6) (4, 15) (16, 28) (16, 14) (28, 9) (28, 16) (28, 3) (28, 14) (29, 1) (29, 5) (21, 12) (21, 19) (2, 22) (2, 27) (12, 21) (12, 11) (12, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 20) (11, 25) (14, 16) (14, 28) (14, 11) (1, 23) (1, 29) (6, 22) (6, 4) (6, 25) (3, 26) (3, 10) (3, 28) (3, 12) (5, 29) (5, 0) (15, 26) (15, 13) (15, 23) (15, 4) (20, 4) (20, 11) (20, 18) (25, 11) (25, 6) (25, 24) (24, 22) (24, 25) (18, 10) (18, 20) (18, 27) (18, 0) (27, 13) (27, 10) (27, 17) (27, 2) (27, 18) (19, 17) (19, 21) (19, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 19) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<9, (0, 23, 28)>
<26, (3, 9, 28)>
<22, (2, 6, 23)>
<10, (3, 17, 27)>
<17, (10, 19, 27)>
<4, (6, 15, 26)>
<11, (12, 20, 25)>
<18, (0, 10, 27)>
