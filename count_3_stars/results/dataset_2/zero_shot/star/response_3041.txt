Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 1) (14, 0) (14, 3) (17, 9) (17, 12) (17, 18) (10, 4) (10, 16) (11, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 0) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (3, 14) (3, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (19, 16) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 13) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 13) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 1) (7, 18) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 15) (6, 18) (6, 15) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 16) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 9, 16)>
<4, (0, 13, 16)>
<7, (3, 13, 18)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 17)>
<12, (2, 13, 17)>
<15, (6, 7, 11)>
<18, (2, 6, 7)>
