Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 6) (4, 16) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 15) (8, 0) (13, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 17) (1, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 18) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 6) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 12) (14, 16) (14, 4) (14, 3) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 2) (6, 16) (6, 15) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 0) (12, 10) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 19) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 17)
