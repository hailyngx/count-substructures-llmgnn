Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 19) (17, 6) (17, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 5) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 15) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 18) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 16) (4, 12) (4, 14) (12, 13) (12, 4) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 16) (16, 3) (16, 15) (16, 7) (14, 4) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 18) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 8) (8, 18) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (1, 2, 13)>
<3, (5, 7, 16)>
<4, (12, 14, 4)>
<5, (11, 13, 15)>
<6, (2, 17, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 17)>
<10, (0, 15, 19)>
<11, (3, 19, 5)>
<12, (13, 18, 4)>
<13, (0, 12, 5)>
<15, (7, 10, 16)>
<16, (3, 7, 15)>
