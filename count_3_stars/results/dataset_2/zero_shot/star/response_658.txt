Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <5, (9, 2, 1)>
- <9, (5, 6, 1)>
- <6, (9, 7, 3)>
- <4, (7, 1, 3)>
- <7, (6, 4, 0)>
- <1, (5, 9, 4)>
- <3, (6, 4, 8)>
- <0, (7, 8, none)>
- <8, (7, 3, 0)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
