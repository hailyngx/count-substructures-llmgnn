Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 1) (16, 9) (16, 5) (16, 6) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 14) (4, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 0) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 10) (17, 0) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 15) (18, 9) (18, 2) (8, 11) (8, 5) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 0) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 12) (1, 16) (1, 14) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 0) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 19) (14, 1) (14, 13) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 12) (13, 15) (13, 14) 

Response:
The given graph contains multiple 3-stars. Let's count the number of 3-stars by listing and then counting the unique ones:

<11, (3, 8, 15)>
<16, (1, 9, 5)>
<16, (1, 9, 6)>
<16, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (11, 7, 12)>
<15, (11, 18, 13)>
<15, (11, 18, 14)>
<15, (11, 13, 14)>
<7, (3, 4, 2)>
<9, (16, 6, 18)>
<9, (16, 0, 18)>
<10, (17, 12, 0)>
<2, (7, 18, 14)>
<8, (11, 5, 16)>
<19, (6, 14, 0)>
<5, (16, 8, 12)>
<1, (16, 14, 9)>
<14, (15, 2, 19)>
<0, (9, 17, 19)>
<0, (9, 12, 17)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
