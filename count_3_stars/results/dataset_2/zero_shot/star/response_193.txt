Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The central nodes in this graph can have IDs {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. 
Given that each 3-star has one central node and three leaf nodes, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking at the nodes connected to each central node.

- Central node 0 has 5 edges (0-1, 0-2, 0-4, 0-6, 0-7), which forms <0, (1, 2, 4)> and <0, (1, 2, 6)>.
- Central node 2 has 5 edges (2-0, 2-6, 2-7, 2-8, 2-9), which forms <2, (0, 6, 8)> and <2, (0, 6, 9)>.
- Central node 3 has 3 edges (3-1, 3-4, 3-9), which forms <3, (1, 4, 9)>.
- Central node 4 has 2 edges (4-0, 4-3), which forms <4, (0, 3, 6)>.
- Central node 5 has 4 edges (5-6, 5-7, 5-8, 5-9), which forms <5, (6, 7, 8)>.
- Central node 6 has 5 edges (6-2, 6-4, 6-5, 6-9, 6-0), which forms <6, (2, 4, 5)> and <6, (0, 5, 9)>.
- Central node 7 has 4 edges (7-0, 7-2, 7-5, 7-8), which forms <7, (0, 2, 5)>.
- Central node 8 has 3 edges (8-2, 8-5, 8-7), which forms <8, (2, 5, 7)>.
- Central node 9 has 5 edges (9-0, 9-2, 9-3, 9-5, 9-6), which forms <9, (0, 3, 5)> and <9, (3, 5, 6)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is the total count of combinations found above, which is 12.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
