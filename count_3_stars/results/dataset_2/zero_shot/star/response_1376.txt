Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 3-stars present in the graph, and they are:
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
