Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 2, 7)>
<8, (9, 3, 4)>
