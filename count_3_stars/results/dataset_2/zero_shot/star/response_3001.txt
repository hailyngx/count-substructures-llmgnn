Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 17) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 11) (2, 13) (2, 0) (18, 19) (18, 5) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 15) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 9) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 8) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 12) (5, 18) (5, 15) (8, 16) (8, 11) (9, 16) (9, 15) (9, 12) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 6) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 12) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 12) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (4, 7, 17)>
<7, (1, 13, 11)>
<10, (0, 17, 6)>
<16, (6, 8, 9)>
<19, (3, 18, 15)>
