Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (12, 4) (12, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 14) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4.

[4]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (0, 9, 12)>
<7, (1, 11, 14)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
