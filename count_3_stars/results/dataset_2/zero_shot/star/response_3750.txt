Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 12) (4, 12) (4, 9) (18, 16) (17, 3) (17, 8) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 14) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 16) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 6) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 11) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 19) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 9) (16, 6) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (11, 15) (11, 5) (11, 6) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 13) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 12) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 14) (5, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (7, 8, 19)>, <2, (7, 12, 6)>, <3, (17, 13, 12)>, <4, (12, 9, 2)>, <6, (10, 16, 2)>, <7, (1, 0, 16)>, <8, (17, 0, 14)>, <9, (4, 10, 16)>, <10, (9, 15, 6)>, <11, (15, 5, 6)>, <12, (3, 4, 19)>, <13, (0, 7, 14)>, <14, (8, 6, 13)>, <15, (10, 19, 11)>, <16, (18, 7, 6)>, <17, (3, 8, 13)>, <19, (0, 15, 12)>]
Hence, there are 17 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [17].
