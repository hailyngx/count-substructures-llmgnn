Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 13) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (11, 12) (11, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 9) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is given in brackets:

[4]

The unique 3-stars are listed below:
<4, (7, 13, 9)>
<7, (4, 12, 8)>
<9, (3, 8, 13)>
<13, (4, 1, 0)>
