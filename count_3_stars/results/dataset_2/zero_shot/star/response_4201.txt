Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 21) (2, 29) (2, 16) (2, 28) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 26) (29, 0) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 23) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 18) (23, 22) (23, 1) (23, 14) (12, 27) (12, 10) (12, 14) (27, 12) (27, 28) (27, 5) (10, 12) (10, 17) (10, 15) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 26) (0, 2) (0, 29) (20, 29) (20, 1) (9, 22) (9, 17) (7, 6) (7, 15) (5, 27) (5, 25) (19, 29) (19, 11) (19, 4) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 26) (15, 24) (8, 3) (8, 25) (8, 11) (18, 3) (18, 14) (26, 29) (26, 17) (26, 15) (26, 4) (16, 2) (16, 21) (16, 6) (21, 13) (21, 22) (21, 16) (11, 19) (11, 8) (24, 15) (24, 14) (6, 22) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 4) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 6) (4, 19) (4, 26) (4, 6) (25, 5) (25, 8) (28, 2) (28, 27) 

Response:
There are <22, (13, 21, 23)>, <2, (29, 16, 28)>, <29, (2, 20, 19)>, <1, (3, 20, 23)>, <3, (1, 8, 18)>, <12, (27, 10, 14)>, <27, (12, 28, 5)>, <10, (17, 15, 12)>, <17, (10, 9, 26)>, <0, (2, 29, 20)>, <20, (29, 1, 19)>, <9, (22, 17, 9)>, <7, (6, 15, 7)>, <5, (27, 25, 5)>, <19, (29, 11, 4)>, <15, (10, 7, 26)>, <8, (3, 25, 11)>, <18, (3, 14, 4)>, <16, (2, 21, 6)>, <21, (13, 22, 16)>, <11, (19, 8, 11)>, <24, (15, 14, 24)>, <6, (22, 16, 14)>, <14, (23, 12, 18)> as unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
