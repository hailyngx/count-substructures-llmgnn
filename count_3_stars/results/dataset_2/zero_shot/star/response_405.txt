Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<7, (9, 4, 3)>
<1, (5, 3, 6)>
<3, (7, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
