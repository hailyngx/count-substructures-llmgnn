Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 13) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 4) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 10) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 9) (10, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 10) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 13)
