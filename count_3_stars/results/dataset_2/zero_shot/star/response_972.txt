Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 19) (10, 17) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 19) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 14) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 1) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 16) (11, 15) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 6) (16, 5) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 1) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 19) (12, 2) (12, 15) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 13) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 15) (1, 5) (1, 18) (1, 16) (6, 7) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 15) 

Response:
There are 5 different 3-stars in the given graph. 

[5]
<5, (1, 9, 16)>
<9, (3, 5, 13)>
<3, (9, 13, 16)>
<13, (2, 9, 17)>
<2, (4, 13, 19)>
