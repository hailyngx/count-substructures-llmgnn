Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes in a star-like structure. 

Based on the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
<6, (9, 3, 8)>
<1, (9, 7, -)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 0)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (6, 3, 7)>
<0, (9, 6, 4)>
<2, (5, 6, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
