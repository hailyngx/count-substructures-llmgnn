Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (1, 10) (1, 14) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 14) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 12) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars found:
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (6, 11, 12)>
<10, (0, 3, 4)>
