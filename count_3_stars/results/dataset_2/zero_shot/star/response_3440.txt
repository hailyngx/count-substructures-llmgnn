Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of ways we can choose a central node and then the three leaf nodes connected to it. Since each 3-star has one central node and three leaf nodes, we can calculate the count by selecting a central node first and then choosing 3 nodes to connect to it.

Since the graph consists of 10 nodes, there are 10 choices for a central node. Once the central node is chosen, we need to select 3 nodes to be connected to it. This can be done in (10-1) choose 3 ways, since we cannot select the central node itself again. 

Calculating (10-1) choose 3 = 84, we find that there are 84 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is: [84]
  
Here are a few unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 0, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (4, 8, 3)>
<8, (5, 7, 6)>
<0, (4, 7, 2)>
<1, (6, 8, 7)>
<3, (9, 4, 7)>
