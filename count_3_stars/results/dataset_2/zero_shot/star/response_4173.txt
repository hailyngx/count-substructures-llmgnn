Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 3) 

Response:
[<0, (9, 11, 1)>, <2, (9, 3, 14)>, <4, (8, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 14, 7)>, <8, (5, 4, 1)>, <10, (9, 11, 3)>, <12, (13, 14, 12)>, <13, (10, 11, 3)>]
