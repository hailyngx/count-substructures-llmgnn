Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 6) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 12) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by identifying the nodes that form a 3-star pattern with the center connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Considering the given edges, the possible 3-stars are:
- <<0, (1, 5, 9)>>
- <<1, (0, 4, 10)>>
- <<2, (0, 5, 7)>>
- <<3, (2, 10, 3)>>
- <<4, (1, 7, 8)>>
- <<5, (0, 2, 11)>>
- <<6, (1, 6, 10)>>
- <<7, (2, 4, 12)>>
- <<8, (4, 6, 13)>>
- <<9, (0, 1, 13)>>
- <<10, (1, 3, 6)>>
- <<11, (5, 10, 12)>>
- <<12, (7, 11, 14)>>
- <<13, (8, 9, 6)>>
- <<14, (12, 0, 14)>>

Therefore, there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
