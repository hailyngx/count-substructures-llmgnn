Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 7) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 2) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 1) (14, 11) (14, 7) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 14) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (6, 1, 0)>
<8, (13, 7, 3)>
<13, (6, 8, 11)>
<10, (1, 4, 2)>
<11, (13, 3, 14)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
