Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 4) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 7) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (17, 6) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 11) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (5, 4) (5, 12) (0, 11) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 3) (3, 12) (3, 19) (15, 19) (15, 16) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 14) (1, 10) (1, 16) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 1) (11, 8) (11, 17) (11, 18) (11, 0) (14, 19) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

<6, (17, 10, 12)>
<18, (4, 9, 11)>
<12, (17, 2, 5)>
<19, (6, 13, 15)>
