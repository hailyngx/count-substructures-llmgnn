Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (10, 5) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 8) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 12) (0, 15) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 2) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 16) (13, 4) (13, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 1) (12, 4) (11, 9) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 2) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 3) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 8) (18, 10) (8, 17) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 3) (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
The center node along with its leaf nodes form a 3-star. Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes with a degree of 1 or 2 cannot be a part of any 3-star, as a 3-star requires the center node to have exactly 3 edges to other nodes. Therefore, the center node of a 3-star must have a degree of 3.

Nodes with degree 3: 0, 11, 13, 18

Let's examine each of these nodes as potential centers for 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 15), (0, 15), (0, 15) - No 3-star as all three connections are to the same node.

2. Node 11: (11, 9), (11, 14), (11, 9) - <11, (9, 14, 9)> 

3. Node 13: (13, 4), (13, 6), (13, 4) - <13, (4, 6, 4)>

4. Node 18: (18, 10), (18, 10), (18, 10) - No 3-star as all three connections are to the same node.

Hence, there are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: <11, (9, 14, 9)>, <13, (4, 6, 4)>
