Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
