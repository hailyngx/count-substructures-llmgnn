Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are 3-star graphs with center nodes 5, 9, 6, 4, 7, 1, and 3. Let's count how many unique 3-stars we can form:

<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<5, (9, 4, 1)>
<5, (9, 3, 4)>
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<5, (4, 9, 3)>
<5, (4, 9, 1)>
<5, (0, 6, 2)>
<5, (6, 1, 2)>
<5, (4, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 6, 4)>
<5, (3, 4, 2)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 4, 1)>
<9, (5, 0, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
<9, (6, 5, 4)>
<9, (6, 5, 1)>
<9, (4, 5, 0)>
<9, (4, 5, 3)>
<9, (4, 5, 1)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 2)>
<9, (6, 5, 1)>
<9, (6, 1, 2)>
<6, (9, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 5, 2)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (5, 9, 3)>
<4, (5, 3, 1)>
<4, (9, 5, 3)>
<4, (9, 3, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 1)>
<4, (7, 9, 3)>
<7, (9, 3, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 1)>
<1, (5, 6, 4)>
<1, (5, 4, 2)>
<1, (6, 5, 4)>
<1, (6, 5, 2)>
<1, (4, 5, 2)>
<1, (4, 2, 6)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (5, 4, 1)>
<3, (9, 5, 4)>
<3, (9, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 1)>
<3, (7, 9, 3)>

There are 53 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the answer is [53].
