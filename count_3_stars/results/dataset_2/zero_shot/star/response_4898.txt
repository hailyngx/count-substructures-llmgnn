Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 0) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) 

Response:
There are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (4, 11, 1)>
<1, (7, 12, -)>
<3, (5, 10, 14)>
<10, (5, 3, 11)>
<11, (7, 10, 13)>
<6, (5, 0, -)>
<2, (9, 13, 14)>
