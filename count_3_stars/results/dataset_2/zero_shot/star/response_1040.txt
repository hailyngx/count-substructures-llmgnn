Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 29) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 24) (9, 13) (3, 7) (3, 27) (3, 18) (15, 9) (15, 0) (15, 22) (7, 3) (21, 6) (21, 12) (21, 8) (21, 18) (20, 25) (20, 12) (20, 22) (20, 6) (25, 20) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 14) (25, 24) (8, 21) (8, 23) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 1) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 14) (13, 9) (13, 28) (6, 21) (6, 20) (6, 1) (6, 29) (6, 26) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 6) (1, 17) (17, 1) (18, 3) (18, 21) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 24) (19, 25) (19, 18) (11, 18) (27, 3) (27, 22) (27, 10) (29, 5) (29, 6) (29, 26) (29, 14) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 28) (0, 12) (28, 13) (28, 0) (28, 22) (12, 21) (12, 20) (12, 0) (4, 23) (4, 16) (22, 15) (22, 20) (22, 27) (22, 28) (26, 6) (26, 29) (24, 9) (24, 25) (24, 18) (10, 2) (10, 27) (16, 2) (16, 4) (14, 25) (14, 2) (14, 29) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
So, the output is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (29, 9, 15)>
<9, (13, 5, 24)>
<6, (29, 1, 26)>
<0, (15, 12, 28)>
<8, (23, 0, 21)>
<2, (16, 14, 10)>
