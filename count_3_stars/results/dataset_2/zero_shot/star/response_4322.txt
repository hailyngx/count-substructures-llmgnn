Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
[**6**]  
Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>
<6, (9, 5, 0)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<8, (9, 5, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
