Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 17) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 0) (1, 8) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 8) (5, 16) (5, 7) (19, 11) (19, 16) (10, 18) (10, 15) (10, 2) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 12) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 14) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 13) (0, 18) (0, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 15) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 14) 

Response:
[4]
<4, (7, 12, 13)>
<4, (12, 11, 13)>
<7, (4, 5, 2)>
