Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 11) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 14) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 11, 12)>
<9, (6, 8, 14)>
<11, (6, 3, 13)>
<1, (5, 12, 8)>
<9, (8, 13, 3)>
<13, (9, 8, 14)>
<3, (11, 7, 0)>
<8, (9, 1, 13)>
<13, (4, 11, 14)>
<4, (13, 11, 14)>
<5, (1, 0, 2)>
<14, (7, 13, 2)>
