Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3)
