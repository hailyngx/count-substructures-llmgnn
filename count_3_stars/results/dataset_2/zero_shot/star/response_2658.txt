Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 14) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].

<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<9, (6, 2, 14)>
<1, (13, 4, 12)>
<3, (9, 14, 13)>
<10, (9, 11, 2)>
<11, (10, 14, 8)>
<4, (1, 13, 5)>
<8, (11, 14, 2)>
