Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 3)>
<1, (5, 8, 7)>
<6, (9, 0, 3)>
