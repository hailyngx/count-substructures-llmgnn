Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are [10] total nodes in the graph. To find the number of 3-stars, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

The possible 3-stars in the graph are:
<6, (9, 5, 8)>
<9, (6, 3, 1)>
<1, (9, 3, 8)>
<3, (9, 1, 5)>
<4, (6, 7, 5)>
<7, (4, 0, 5)>
<5, (6, 3, 4)>
<0, (6, 9, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (6, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
