Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) 

Response:
[4]
Unique 3-stars: <4, (9, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 2)>, <2, (4, 8, 5)>, <3, (9, 6, 4)>
