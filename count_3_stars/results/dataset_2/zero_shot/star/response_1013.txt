Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (8, 4, 0)>
<9, (6, 8, 1)>
<6, (9, 7, 2)>
<4, (5, 7, 0)>
<7, (9, 6, 4)>
<8, (5, 9, 3)>
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
