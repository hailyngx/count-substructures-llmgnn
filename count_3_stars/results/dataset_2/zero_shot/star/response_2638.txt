Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (0, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 9) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of nodes that can serve as the center of a 3-star. In this case, nodes 4 and 11 each have 4 connections (degree = 4), while the rest of the nodes have 3 connections. 

Thus, the number of 3-stars in this graph can be found by summing the number of 3-stars with centers as nodes 4 and 11 with those centered at the other nodes. 

For node 4:
- <4, (7, 12, 14)>
- <4, (1, 11, 14)>

For node 11:
- <11, (4, 8, 13)>
- <11, (2, 13, 14)>

Then, adding the other central nodes:
- <7, (4, 3, 6)>
- <1, (4, 3, 5)>
- <13, (8, 7, 10)>
- <2, (8, 12, 5)>
- <12, (4, 2, 0)>
- <14, (4, 11, 9)>
- <0, (12, _)>
- <8, (13, 2, 6)>
- <3, (7, 1, 5)>
- <5, (1, 3, 2)>
- <6, (7, 3, 8)>
- <9, (1, 14, 10)>
- <10, (7, 1, 13)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [16].
