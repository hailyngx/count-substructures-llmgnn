Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 13) (17, 18) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 12) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 8) (7, 5) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 12) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 16) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 4) (19, 13) (19, 10) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 10) (6, 13) (6, 12) (11, 18) (11, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 15) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 5) (10, 16) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 10) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 6) 

Response:
There are [16] 3-stars in the given graph.

<10, (2, 5, 19)>
<11, (5, 10, 18)>
<12, (1, 3, 6)>
<13, (14, 17, 19)>
<14, (4, 13, 15)>
<15, (12, 14, 4)>
<16, (9, 10, 18)>
<18, (11, 16, 17)>
