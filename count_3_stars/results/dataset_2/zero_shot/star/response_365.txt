Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 12) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is [3].

<8, (13, 0, 12)>
<10, (13, 11, 2)>
<0, (8, 11, 7)>
