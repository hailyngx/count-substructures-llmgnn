Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 10) (2, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0)
