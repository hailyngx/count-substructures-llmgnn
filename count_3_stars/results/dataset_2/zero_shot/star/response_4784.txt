Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 0) (0, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 2) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
The central nodes can have degrees 3, 4, or 5. Since the graph has 15 nodes and each 3-star has 4 nodes in total, there can be at most 15/4 = 3 central nodes in the graph.

After analyzing the given graph, the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 8, 10)>
<3, (2, 4, 10)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 13, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
