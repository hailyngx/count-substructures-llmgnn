Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
There is a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is presented below:

[7]

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<9, (4, 1, 7)>
<4, (9, 1, 6)>
<7, (9, 0, 3)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (7, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 3)>
