Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<7, (5, 4, 0)>
<1, (9, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 0)>
