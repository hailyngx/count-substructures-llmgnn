Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 21) (16, 4) (16, 20) (3, 10) (3, 2) (15, 10) (15, 29) (15, 17) (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 2) (6, 23) (9, 6) (9, 13) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 29) (4, 16) (4, 24) (8, 1) (28, 29) (28, 12) (28, 14) (28, 20) (29, 15) (29, 10) (29, 28) (29, 24) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 27) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 21) (21, 16) (21, 18) (24, 4) (24, 29) (24, 27) (26, 20) (26, 17) (23, 11) (23, 6) (23, 18) (23, 14) (23, 19) (12, 11) (12, 28) (12, 2) (12, 14) (20, 16) (20, 28) (20, 26) (19, 23) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 13) (22, 6) (22, 0) (22, 7) (27, 2) (27, 24) (27, 1) (7, 19) (7, 22) (7, 17) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 27) (5, 11) (5, 0) (0, 22) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 28) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 19) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 0) (17, 15) (17, 26) (17, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph: <10, (3, 15, 29)>, <12, (11, 28, 14)>, <16, (4, 21, 20)>, <29, (15, 10, 24)>.
