Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 4) (11, 15) (16, 12) (16, 26) (16, 27) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 27) (21, 5) (21, 25) (2, 1) (2, 29) (2, 14) (29, 2) (29, 5) (29, 4) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 26) (25, 21) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 15) (20, 25) (15, 11) (15, 25) (15, 27) (15, 17) (27, 16) (27, 1) (27, 15) (27, 24) (8, 23) (8, 4) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 13) (4, 11) (4, 29) (4, 8) (4, 19) (6, 24) (6, 12) (28, 9) (28, 7) (28, 12) (0, 14) (0, 22) (14, 2) (14, 23) (14, 0) (14, 18) (19, 4) (19, 26) (19, 22) (19, 24) (26, 16) (26, 3) (26, 19) (13, 23) (13, 17) (7, 25) (7, 28) (17, 15) (17, 13) (17, 24) (17, 22) (17, 18) (18, 14) (18, 17) (24, 3) (24, 27) (24, 6) (24, 19) (24, 17) (22, 0) (22, 19) (22, 17) (10, 9) (10, 5) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 28) (9, 28) (9, 10) (5, 1) (5, 21) (5, 29) (5, 10) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars found in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [8].

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 5, 27)>
<4, (11, 8, 29)>
<5, (2, 10, 21)>
<9, (10, 28, 9)>
<12, (16, 6, 28)>
<13, (17, 23, 13)>
<14, (0, 18, 23)>
<15, (11, 17, 27)>
