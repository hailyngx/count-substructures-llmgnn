Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars present in the graph. 
Therefore, the answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (4, 2, 4)>
<9, (8, 2, 7)>
<4, (8, 5, 7)>
<7, (9, 0, 6)>
<1, (6, 3, 6)>
<3, (8, 1, 6)>
<8, (9, 4, 3)>
<0, (9, 7, 0)>
