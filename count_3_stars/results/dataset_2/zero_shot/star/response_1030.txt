Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 15) (16, 0) (16, 17) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 14) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 6) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 10) (6, 1) (6, 19) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 18) (3, 8) (3, 18) (3, 2) (14, 12) (14, 10) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 2) (5, 7) (5, 15) (5, 14) (2, 3) (2, 17)
