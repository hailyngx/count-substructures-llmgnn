Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 9) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (6, 13) (6, 14) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9)
