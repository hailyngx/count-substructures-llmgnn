Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
