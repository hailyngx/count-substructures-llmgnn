Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 21) (9, 23) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 12) (15, 4) (15, 28) (27, 11) (27, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 28) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 8) (7, 27) (7, 19) (21, 9) (21, 24) (25, 3) (25, 6) (25, 16) (25, 24) (10, 17) (10, 22) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 28) (17, 2) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 13) (24, 21) (24, 25) (22, 10) (22, 12) (22, 8) (11, 27) (11, 1) (11, 28) (11, 18) (11, 4) (28, 15) (28, 1) (28, 17) (28, 11) (28, 5) (5, 26) (5, 28) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 4) (13, 17) (13, 14) (13, 2) (16, 25) (29, 0) (6, 25) (6, 14) (6, 23) (12, 9) (12, 26) (12, 22) (12, 18) (4, 15) (4, 11) (4, 19) (18, 14) (18, 11) (18, 12) (2, 17) (2, 13) (2, 23) (23, 9) (23, 10) (23, 6) (23, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 22)
