Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 10, 13)>
<2, (0, 5, 14)>
<2, (5, 9, 14)>
<4, (8, 10, 14)>
<6, (5, 9, 14)>
<10, (1, 13, 14)>
<11, (8, 12, 13)>
