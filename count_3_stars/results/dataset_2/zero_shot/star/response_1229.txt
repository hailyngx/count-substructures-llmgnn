Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) 

Response:
There are \[12\] 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (6, 9, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 5)>
<2, (6, 9, 8)>
<3, (9, 4, 8)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<5, (4, 7, 1)>
<6, (9, 4, 2)>
<7, (9, 7, 4)>
<8, (9, 4, 8)>
<9, (6, 2, 8)>
<(0, 1, 3), 8>
<(0, 3, 8), 1>
