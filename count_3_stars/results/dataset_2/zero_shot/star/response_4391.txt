Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are [16] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 1)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<7, (5, 9, 1)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 9, 3)>
<6, (5, 1, 3)>
<2, (5, 6, 0)>
<0, (7, 8, 6)>
