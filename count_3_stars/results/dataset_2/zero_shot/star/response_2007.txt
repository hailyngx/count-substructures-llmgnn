Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (6, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (6, 3, 4)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
