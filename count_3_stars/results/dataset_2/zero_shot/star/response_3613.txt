Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 7) (1, 11) (1, 16) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 19) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 15) (8, 5) (8, 18) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (13, 4) (13, 2) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 12) (0, 18) (0, 19) (16, 1) (16, 12) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 18) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 18) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 7) (2, 13) (2, 9) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 9) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (11, 16, 3)>
<5, (8, 18, 12)>
<9, (4, 15, 2)>
<10, (17, 7, 6)>
