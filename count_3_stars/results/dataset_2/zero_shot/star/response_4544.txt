Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 17) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 19) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 18) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 15) (0, 4) (14, 12) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 9) (19, 5) (19, 18) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 8) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 12) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 3) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 16) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 12) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 2) (3, 4) (3, 18) (2, 1) (2, 17) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are <4, (0, 3, 18)>, <6, (7, 9, 10)>, <9, (1, 6, 19)>, <11, (1, 5, 17)>, and <15, (1, 8, 12)>.
