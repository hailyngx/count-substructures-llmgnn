Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 19) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 19) (14, 2) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 4) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 19) (2, 14) (2, 3) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 15) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (12, 9) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 15) (0, 3) (0, 19) (0, 13) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 0) (8, 5) (8, 15) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated as follows:

1. Count how many times each node appears as the center node in a 3-star:
- Node 1 appears as the center node in 3 different 3-stars.
- Node 2 appears as the center node in 1 3-star.
- Node 3 appears as the center node in 2 different 3-stars.
- Node 4 appears as the center node in 4 different 3-stars.
- Node 5 appears as the center node in 3 different 3-stars.
- Node 6 appears as the center node in 2 different 3-stars.
- Node 7 appears as the center node in 1 3-star.
- Node 8 appears as the center node in 2 different 3-stars.
- Node 9 appears as the center node in 3 different 3-stars.
- Node 10 appears as the center node in 2 different 3-stars.
- Node 11 appears as the center node in 2 different 3-stars.
- Node 13 appears as the center node in 1 3-star.
- Node 15 appears as the center node in 1 3-star.
- Node 16 appears as the center node in 2 different 3-stars.
- Node 17 appears as the center node in 2 different 3-stars.
- Node 18 appears as the center node in 2 different 3-stars.
- Node 19 appears as the center node in 2 different 3-stars.

2. Summing up all the counts above, we find that there are a total of [32] 3-stars in the given graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (11, 10, 13)>
<2, (14, 3, 5)>
<3, (16, 2, 5)>
<4, (17, 18, 9)>
<5, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (6, 17, 15)>
<7, (7, 5, 8)>
<8, (8, 5, 15)>
<9, (9, 4, 16)>
<10, (10, 1, 19)>
<11, (11, 1, 19)>
<13, (13, 1, 4)>
<15, (15, 6, 8)>
<16, (16, 3, 9)>
<17, (17, 4, 18)>
<18, (18, 4, 17)>
<19, (19, 10, 0)>
