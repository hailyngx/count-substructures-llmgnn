Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 2) (13, 4) (13, 9) (0, 3) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 10) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 11) (11, 2) (11, 4) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 9) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 

<1, (2, 10, 12)>
<3, (0, 9, 12)>
<5, (4, 6, 10)>
<7, (5, 10, 14)>
<8, (1, 3, 12)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
