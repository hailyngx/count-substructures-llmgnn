Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (12, 5) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 2) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 2) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 10) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 13) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 10) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (1, 8, 13)>
<0, (3, 4, 14)>
<14, (0, 6, 9)>
<11, (2, 5, 13)>
