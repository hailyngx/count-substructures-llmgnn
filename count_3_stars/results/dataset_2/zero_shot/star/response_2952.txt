Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 9 unique 3-stars in this graph:  
<5, (9, 6, 4)>  
<9, (5, 6, 4)>  
<4, (5, 9, 3)>  
<7, (0, 6, 1)>  
<1, (7, 6, 0)>  
<3, (9, 4, 0)>  
<6, (5, 9, 7)>  
<2, (5, 8, 0)>  
<8, (3, 2, 0)>  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
