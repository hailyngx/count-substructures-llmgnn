Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 8) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 2) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<5, (9, 4, 10)>
<9, (5, 3, 13)>
<1, (5, 6, 10)>
<3, (9, 0, 8)>
<7, (11, 6, 14)>
<12, (5, 4, 0)>
<0, (3, 12, 2)>
<4, (5, 9, 12)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<11, (7, 6, 14)>
<14, (7, 11, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 13)>
<8, (1, 3, 14)>
<10, (5, 9, 1)>
<13, (9, 1, 6)>

There are [15] unique 3-star graphs in the given graph.
