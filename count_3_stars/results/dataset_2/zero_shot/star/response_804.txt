Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 15) (12, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 19) (8, 17) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 3) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 9) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 0) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 17) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 9) (16, 1) (11, 2) (11, 18) (14, 2) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 10) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 11) (10, 7) (10, 9) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 19) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 4) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars found:
<5, (13, 6, 3)>
<2, (6, 3, 14)>
<9, (12, 1, 0)>
