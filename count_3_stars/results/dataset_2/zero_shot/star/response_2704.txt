Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is [5].
The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (9, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 8, -)>
<0, (1, 8, 2)>
