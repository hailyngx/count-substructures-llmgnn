Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

[<0, (9, 8, 2)>, <1, (5, 4, 3)>, <6, (9, 1, 0)>]
