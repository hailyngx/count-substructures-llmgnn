Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
There are 9 different 3-stars in this graph. 

1. <5, (6, 1, 0)>
2. <5, (6, 7, 1)>
3. <5, (6, 4, 0)>
4. <5, (1, 9, 7)>
5. <4, (2, 6, 0)>
6. <4, (2, 8, 0)>
7. <8, (2, 7, 1)>
8. <6, (5, 4, 7)>
9. <0, (5, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
