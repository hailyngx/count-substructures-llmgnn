Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs can be identified by looking for nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes. In this graph, we find the following 3-stars:

<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<9, (8, 1, 0)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<1, (9, 3, 8)>
<6, (5, 4, 2)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 9, 1)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (4, 7, 1)>

There are a total of [10] 3-star graphs in this graph.
