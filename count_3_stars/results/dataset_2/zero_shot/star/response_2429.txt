Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
[<0, (9, 10, 11)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 8, 13)>, <3, (5, 6, 14)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (3, 5, 13)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (2, 7, 13)>, <9, (0, 1, 13)>, <10, (11, 14, 0)>, <11, (10, 12, 13)>, <12, (4, 11, 5)>, <13, (8, 9, 11)>, <14, (10, 3, 5)>]
