Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 5) (14, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 7) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 12) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 9) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 9) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 0, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 11)>
<8, (0, 5, 14)>
