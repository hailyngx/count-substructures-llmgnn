Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 10) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 4) (11, 14) (11, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 1) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

<7, (9, 12, 3)>
<8, (2, 0, 1)>
<0, (9, 10, 1)>
<2, (6, 8, 13)>
<12, (7, 5, 13)>
