Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [0] 3-stars in this graph. 

<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
