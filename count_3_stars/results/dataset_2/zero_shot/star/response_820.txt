Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
There are <6, (1, 3, 0)>, <9, (8, 3, 1)>, <4, (7, 0, 2)>, <7, (4, 3, 5)>, <8, (9, 7, 0)>, <5, (7, 2, 3)>, <1, (6, 9, 7)>, <3, (6, 9, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 1)>, and <0, (6, 9, 4)> as the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars present in the graph.
