Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 27) (8, 23) (8, 28) (23, 8) (23, 7) (23, 1) (26, 5) (26, 28) (26, 21) (26, 3) (26, 12) (28, 8) (28, 26) (28, 19) (6, 7) (6, 25) (21, 26) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 17) (25, 6) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 24) (27, 9) (27, 25) (27, 13) (2, 5) (2, 17) (12, 26) (12, 24) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 20) (16, 18) (16, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 20) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 11) (24, 3) (24, 13) (15, 19) (19, 28) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 20) (7, 9) (7, 23) (7, 6) (29, 25) (1, 23) (1, 10) (3, 26) (3, 24) (3, 14) (3, 4) (14, 16) (14, 3) (17, 21) (17, 2) (20, 21) (20, 10) (20, 11) (20, 19) (22, 21) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (13, 27) (13, 24) (13, 18) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 2, 11)>
<9, (5, 11, 7)>
<26, (5, 21, 28)>
<7, (9, 23, 6)>
<28, (8, 26, 19)>
<27, (25, 9, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
