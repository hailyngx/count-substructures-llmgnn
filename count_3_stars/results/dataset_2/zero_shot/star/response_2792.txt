Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 18) (8, 7) (8, 18) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 18) (9, 2) (15, 17) (19, 4) (19, 6) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 3) (4, 17) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (16, 5) (16, 17) (18, 13) (18, 8) (18, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (14, 5) (14, 1) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 16) (17, 2) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 17) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

<4, (5, 13, 19)>
<5, (4, 13, 16)>
<7, (8, 12, 1)>
<9, (10, 11, 18)>
<11, (0, 2, 6)>
<13, (3, 5, 18)>
