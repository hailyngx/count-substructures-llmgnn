Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 2) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 12) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 0) (15, 1) (8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 18) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 13) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 7) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 4) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 0) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 2) (3, 8) (3, 19) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 12) (19, 0) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 19) (4, 14) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 4) 

Response:
[6]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 15, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 11)>, <6, (7, 13, 1)>, <7, (6, 14, 16)>, <10, (5, 16, 11)>, <12, (5, 17, 19)>, <13, (4, 6, 7)>, <14, (4, 18, 7)>, <16, (7, 8, 10)>, <18, (0, 14, 8)>, <19, (0, 3, 12)>]
