Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in this graph. The answer is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (1, 8, 0)>
<9, (4, 3, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 4)>
<1, (5, 3, _)>
<3, (9, 1, 0)>
<4, (9, 6, 7)>
<7, (9, 6, 2)>
