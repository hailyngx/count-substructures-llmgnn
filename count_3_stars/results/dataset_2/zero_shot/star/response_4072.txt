Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 26) (3, 8) (15, 26) (15, 5) (1, 21) (1, 29) (21, 1) (21, 9) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 14) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 7) (22, 25) (5, 15) (5, 9) (5, 24) (5, 0) (5, 28) (9, 21) (9, 5) (9, 7) (7, 22) (7, 9) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 8) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 4) (6, 0) (28, 5) (28, 6) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 23) (17, 11) (29, 1) (29, 10) (4, 18) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 13) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 26) (26, 3) (26, 15) (26, 13) (26, 0) (11, 3) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 2) (23, 28) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 0) (25, 22) (25, 16) (25, 2) (27, 16) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 20) (14, 18) (14, 11) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 28) (8, 20) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 28) (0, 26) (0, 19) (20, 24) (20, 8) (16, 22) (16, 25) (16, 27) (10, 29) (10, 2) (2, 11) (2, 25) (2, 10)
