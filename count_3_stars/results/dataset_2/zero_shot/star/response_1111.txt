Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 0) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 13) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 2) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 1) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 8, 14)>
<8, (4, 10, 0)>
<10, (7, 11, 13)>
<14, (6, 12, 1)>
