Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 12) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 12) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (1, 11, 14)>
<9, (0, 12, 14)>
<10, (4, 11, 14)>
<11, (1, 9, 10)>
<12, (0, 1, 13)>
<13, (3, 6, 12)>
<4, (2, 10, 13)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
