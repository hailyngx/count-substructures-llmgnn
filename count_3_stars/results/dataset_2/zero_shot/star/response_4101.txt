Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 12, 13)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 10)>
<5, (0, 4, 12)>
<6, (0, 9, 10)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (9, 11, 14)>
<9, (6, 8, 13)>
<10, (6, 4, 11)>
<11, (8, 10, 13)>
<12, (2, 5, 0)>
<13, (9, 11, 14)>
<14, (8, 9, 11)>
