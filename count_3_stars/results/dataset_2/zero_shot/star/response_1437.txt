Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 8) (11, 15) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 13) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 2) (1, 15) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 12) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 16) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 16) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 12) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 6) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (3, 18) (3, 6) (3, 8) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (9, 17) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 12) (6, 3) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 9)
