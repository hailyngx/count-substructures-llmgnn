Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 5) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 12) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 3) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars:
[10]

<2, (3, 5, 14)>
<3, (2, 10, 11)>
<4, (1, 10, 13)>
<5, (2, 6, 13)>
<6, (0, 2, 13)>
<7, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (8, 9, 13)>
<9, (7, 9, 10)>
<10, (1, 4, 11)>
<11, (0, 3, 14)>
