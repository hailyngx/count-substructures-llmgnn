Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 10) (26, 20) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 18) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 7) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 2) (1, 3) (1, 29) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 24) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 7) (22, 23) (22, 0) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 16) (12, 27) (12, 29) (6, 5) (6, 11) (19, 15) (19, 21) (19, 20) (21, 19) (21, 29) (28, 7) (28, 25) (0, 22) (0, 10) (0, 24) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 20) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 11) (14, 18) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 25) (29, 1) (29, 12) (29, 21) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 23) (24, 27) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 4) (20, 26) (20, 19) (20, 10) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 28) (4, 13) (4, 24) (4, 16) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 4) (16, 2) (25, 23) (25, 28) (25, 18) (25, 2) (2, 27) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 25) 

Response:
There are 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed:

<17, (3, 9, 23)>
<5, (8, 6, 18)>
<27, (15, 12, 2)>
<1, (8, 3, 29)>
<22, (23, 0, 25)>
<0, (10, 2, 24)>
<25, (18, 23, 2)>
<4, (13, 16, 24)>
<16, (8, 23, 2)>
<9, (10, 17, 18)>
<20, (26, 19, 10)>
<15, (19, 7, 27)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
