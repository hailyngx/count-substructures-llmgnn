Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 8) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 13) (14, 11) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 10) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 9) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. Here is the count and the unique 3-stars:
[<4, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 12)>, <1, (3, 0, 6)>, <3, (1, 12, 11)>, <5, (4, 7, 6)>, <10, (0, 8, 13)>, <12, (7, 3, 8)>, <11, (3, 12, 14)>, <0, (1, 6, 10)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <14, (11, 9, 13)>]
