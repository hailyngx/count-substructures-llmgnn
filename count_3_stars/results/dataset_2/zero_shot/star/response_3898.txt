Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 0) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 14) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 9) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
  
Unique 3-stars:
<10, (8, 13, 9)>
<10, (8, 13, 14)>
<11, (1, 0, 8)>
<11, (1, 0, 12)>
<5, (13, 4, 3)>
<5, (13, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 12, 0)>
<2, (9, 4, 7)>
<13, (10, 5, 4)>
<4, (5, 2, 13)>
<12, (11, 6, 0)>
<14, (10, 3, 1)>
