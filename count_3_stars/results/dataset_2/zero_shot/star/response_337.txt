Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (8, 9, 3)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
