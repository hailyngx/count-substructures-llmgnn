Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 27) (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 10) (17, 20) (17, 12) (17, 5) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 28) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 24) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 12) (7, 18) (7, 26) (21, 24) (28, 29) (28, 3) (28, 13) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 25) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 23) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 26) (8, 22) (22, 6) (22, 8) (22, 5) (13, 28) (13, 26) (13, 15) (26, 7) (26, 18) (26, 8) (26, 13) (26, 1) (20, 14) (20, 17) (20, 12) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 1) (3, 28) (19, 2) (19, 11) (23, 14) (23, 18) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 20) (0, 6) (0, 11) (1, 10) (1, 26) (1, 16) (1, 27) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 22) (5, 25) (25, 2) (25, 4) (25, 5) (15, 13) (15, 24) (27, 9) (27, 1) (24, 10) (24, 21) (24, 15) 

Response:
There are a total of 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:

<6, (0, 12, 22)>
<9, (8, 27, 1)>
<14, (10, 20, 23)>
<17, (5, 12, 20)>
<2, (8, 19, 29)>
<10, (1, 11, 16)>
<11, (0, 10, 12)>
<7, (18, 26, 7)>
<21, (15, 24, 21)>
<4, (5, 18, 25)>
<13, (15, 26, 28)>
<3, (13, 28, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [12].
