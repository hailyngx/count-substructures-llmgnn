Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) 

Response:
There is a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (5, 3, 2)>
<9, (8, 1, 7)>
