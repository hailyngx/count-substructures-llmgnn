Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<9, (6, 8, 2)>
<7, (4, 1, 0)>
<1, (4, 6, 2)>
<3, (9, 4, 6)>
