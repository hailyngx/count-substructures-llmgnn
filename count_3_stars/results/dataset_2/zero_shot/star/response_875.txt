Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 16) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (3, 11) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 11) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 17) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (17, 13) (17, 14) (17, 1) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 16) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 19) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 12) (10, 9) (10, 8) (16, 9) (16, 18) (19, 4) (19, 1) 

Response:
There are 6 total 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 14, 15)>
<5, (6, 9, 16)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<11, (3, 14, 18)>
<13, (8, 15, 17)>
<4, (2, 12, 19)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
