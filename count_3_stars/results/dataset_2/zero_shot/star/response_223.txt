Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (6, 4, 2)>
<9, (3, 7, 0)>
<4, (5, 7, 6)>
<7, (9, 4, 1)>
<1, (7, 0, 8)>
