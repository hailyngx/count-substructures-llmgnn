Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 3) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 3) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 12) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 12) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 6) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 6, 11)>
<7, (4, 0, 10)>
<10, (7, 0, 13)>
<11, (4, 6, 14)>
<0, (4, 8, 3)>
<5, (10, 13, 12)>
<12, (5, 13, 14)>
