Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 8) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 11) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 3) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 15) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 19) (0, 17) (7, 3) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 11) (16, 4) (16, 13) (16, 15) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 19) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 3) (14, 1) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 1) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 12) (10, 4) (10, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (17, 5) (17, 0) 

Response:
[<0, (17, 5, 13)>, <2, (18, 8, 14)>, <4, (19, 11, 16)>, <5, (19, 13, 15)>, <1, (9, 12, 14)>, <3, (7, 8, 14)>, <6, (3, 10, 6)>]
