Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
