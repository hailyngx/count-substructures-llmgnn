Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 6) (26, 4) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 0) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 18) (23, 29) (23, 6) (12, 27) (12, 24) (27, 9) (27, 12) (27, 14) (27, 3) (27, 16) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 11) (0, 19) (20, 0) (20, 19) (28, 9) (28, 21) (28, 13) (29, 23) (29, 25) (29, 24) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 17) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 8) (17, 21) (17, 1) (17, 2) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 13) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 11) (6, 26) (6, 23) (6, 24) (6, 4) (24, 12) (24, 29) (24, 6) (24, 8) (24, 5) (25, 29) (25, 11) (19, 22) (19, 0) (19, 20) (19, 7) (5, 23) (5, 24) (5, 18) (18, 23) (18, 5) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (16, 27) (8, 1) (8, 24) (8, 14) (14, 27) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 8) (11, 0) (11, 15) (11, 25) (13, 28) (13, 3) (2, 17) (2, 7) (4, 26) (4, 15) (4, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting how many nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes in the given graph. Let's analyze the nodes:
- Node 9 is connected to 3 nodes: 26, 28, 27. So, <9, (26, 28, 27)> is a 3-star.
- Node 26 is connected to 3 nodes: 9, 6, 4. So, <26, (9, 6, 4)> is a 3-star.
- Node 22, 23, 12, 0, 20, 29, 21, 17, 3, 15, 24, 5, 18, 7, 8, 14, 11, 13, 2 are not part of any 3-stars as they are connected to less or more than 3 nodes.

Therefore, considering only the unique 3-stars found above, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
