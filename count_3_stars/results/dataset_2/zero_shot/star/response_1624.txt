Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (8, 1, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 3)>
<7, (9, 8, 4)>
<2, (8, 6, 3)>
<8, (5, 7, 2)>
<0, (5, 1, 6)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
