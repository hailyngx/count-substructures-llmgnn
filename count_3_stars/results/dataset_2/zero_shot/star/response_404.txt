Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 12) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 10) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (9, 4, 6)>
<1, (7, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 13, 14)>
<13, (8, 2, 11)>
<6, (7, 5, 11)>
<0, (9, 4, 8)>
<14, (8, 12, 0)>
<11, (13, 6, 12)>
<12, (0, 14, 11)>
