Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 15) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 18) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 17) (2, 15) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 10) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 13) (11, 3) (11, 0) (7, 6) (7, 13) (15, 1) (15, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 6) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 10) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 17) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 5) (16, 8) (16, 17) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 19) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (3, 11, 14)>
<1, (3, 15, 2)>
<2, (9, 15, 17)>
<3, (1, 11, 19)>
<4, (9, 18, 10)>
<16, (5, 8, 17)>
