Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 11) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) 

Response:
The 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 10, 6)>
<3, (4, 12, 6)>
<8, (13, 4, 5)>
<8, (11, 0, 12)>
<13, (8, 2, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 13)>
<6, (1, 10, 14)>
<0, (8, 5, 9)>
<10, (3, 6, 7)>
<11, (8, 5, 14)>
<14, (4, 6, 11)>
<7, (1, 10, 11)>
<5, (8, 0, 11)>
<2, (13, 4, 7)>
<9, (13, 0, 2)>
<12, (3, 8, 13)>

Count of 3-stars: [16]
