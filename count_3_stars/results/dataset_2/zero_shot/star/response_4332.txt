Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 18) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 15) (8, 10) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 15) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (15, 4) (15, 14) (15, 2) (15, 5) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 9) (16, 7) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 19) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 18) (19, 4) (19, 6) (19, 17) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 11) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 7) (12, 0) (13, 1) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<1, (3, 11, 13)>, <3, (1, 5, 14)>, <4, (11, 15, 19)>, <6, (2, 7, 11)>, <7, (6, 9, 16)>, <9, (0, 10, 7)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
