Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 7) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (17, 19) (17, 15) (2, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 6) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 15) (4, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 0) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 18) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 18) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 18) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 9) (18, 6) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 6) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 15) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated based on the number of nodes they contain, which is 4 (1 center node + 3 leaf nodes). 

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars by finding nodes with exactly 3 edges. Nodes with 3 edges connected to them will represent the center nodes of the 3-stars.

Let's list the 3-stars found:
<1, (10, 3, 16)>
<3, (7, 1, 13)>
<5, (8, 13, 19)>
<7, (0, 6, 13)>
<9, (4, 7, 18)>
<10, (0, 1, 12)>
<13, (6, 7, 14)>
<15, (6, 17, 19)>
<16, (0, 1, 5)>
<18, (6, 9, 14)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of 10.

Therefore, the answer is [10].
