Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 9) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 1) (12, 4) (12, 14) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<4, (8, 3, 12)>
<7, (11, 10, 6)>
<10, (7, 11, 1)>
<11, (7, 10, 13)>
