Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<5, (2, 1, 4)>
<9, (8, 2, 1)>
<4, (7, 3, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<3, (6, 2, 4)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<0, (7, 1, 6)>
