Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 2) (1, 11) (1, 27) (21, 6) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 2) (14, 15) (17, 25) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 15) (22, 24) (22, 29) (22, 25) (22, 8) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 25) (0, 12) (27, 1) (27, 0) (27, 4) (8, 22) (8, 19) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 15) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 6) (4, 27) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 29) (29, 22) (29, 4) (29, 23) (29, 11) (13, 26) (13, 19) (13, 23) (6, 21) (6, 19) (6, 20) (10, 21) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 16) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 10) (15, 11) (16, 10) (16, 23) (3, 12) (28, 8) (28, 7) (25, 17) (25, 22) (25, 0) (7, 28) (11, 1) (11, 29) (11, 15) (24, 22) (24, 5) (24, 20) (20, 6) (20, 24) (2, 26) (2, 21) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 24) (23, 29) (23, 13) (23, 16) (23, 12) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 23) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<9, (26, 18, 12)>
<26, (9, 13, 2)>
<1, (11, 27, 15)>
<21, (6, 10, 12)>
<14, (15, 18, 5)>
<17, (25, 22, 0)>
<22, (24, 29, 25)>
<0, (27, 10, 25)>
<8, (22, 19, 4)>
<19, (8, 13, 6)>
<4, (27, 8, 5)>
<29, (22, 4, 23)>
<13, (26, 19, 23)>
<6, (21, 19, 20)>
<10, (21, 0, 15)>
<16, (10, 23, 3)>
<28, (8, 7, 15)>
<7, (28, 11, 29)>
<24, (22, 5, 20)>
<20, (6, 24, 5)>
<2, (26, 21, 12)>
<3, (12, 23, 16)>

There are 22 unique 3-stars in total. Hence, the final answer is [22].
