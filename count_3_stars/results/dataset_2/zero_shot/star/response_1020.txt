Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 8) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 10, 11)>
<7, (1, 9, 10)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<10, (4, 7, 6)>
<11, (4, 7, 8)>
<12, (0, 6, 13)>
<13, (5, 10, 6)>
<14, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (14, 9, 13)>
<0, (4, 9, 12)>
