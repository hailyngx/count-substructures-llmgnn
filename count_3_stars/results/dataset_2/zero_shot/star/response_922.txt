Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 13) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 9) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (8, 4, 5)>
<3, (13, 9, 12)>
<10, (8, 11, 14)>
<11, (8, 5, 6)>
<14, (10, 0, 2)>
