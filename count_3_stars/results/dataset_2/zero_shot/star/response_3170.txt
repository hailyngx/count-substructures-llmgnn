Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 0) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (6, 2) (6, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 4, 14)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, x, x)> (No other possible connections)
<1, (9, 4, 11)>
<3, (9, 4, 11)>
<8, (5, 4, 14)>
<2, (5, 3, 11)>
<14, (9, 8, 12)>
<6, (2, 10, x)> (No other possible connections)
<10, (9, 1, 12)>
<12, (10, 14, 0)>
