Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 13) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 13) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 13) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-star graphs in the given network can be calculated as follows:

1. To form a 3-star, we need to select a central node and then choose 3 adjacent nodes (leaves). Since each 3-star consists of 4 nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars by considering each node as a potential center.

2. Count the number of 3-stars for each node by determining the number of ways to choose 3 adjacent nodes connected to the center node.

Let's go through the nodes one by one and count the number of 3-stars:

For node 0:
- Possible 3-star: <0, (9, 10, 3)>
- Number of 3-stars for node 0: 1

For node 1:
- Possible 3-star: <1, (9, 7, 13)>
- Number of 3-stars for node 1: 1

For node 2:
- Possible 3-star: <2, (8, 12, 14)>
- Number of 3-stars for node 2: 1

For node 3:
- Possible 3-star: <3, (8, 13, 14)>
- Number of 3-stars for node 3: 1

For node 4:
- Possible 3-star: <4, (5, 9, 11)>
- Number of 3-stars for node 4: 1

For node 5:
- Possible 3-star: <5, (9, 4, 11)>
- Number of 3-stars for node 5: 1

For node 6:
- Possible 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 13)>
- Number of 3-stars for node 6: 1

For node 7:
- Possible 3-star: <7, (8, 12, 1)> or <7, (8, 0, 6)>
- Number of 3-stars for node 7: 2

For node 8:
- Possible 3-star: <8, (11, 2, 3)>
- Number of 3-stars for node 8: 1

For node 9:
- Possible 3-star: <9, (5, 4, 1)> or <9, (5, 0, 12)>
- Number of 3-stars for node 9: 2

For node 10:
- Possible 3-star: <10, (11, 0, 13)>
- Number of 3-stars for node 10: 1

For node 11:
- Possible 3-star: <11, (5, 10, 8)>
- Number of 3-stars for node 11: 1

For node 12:
- Possible 3-star: <12, (7, 9, 2)>
- Number of 3-stars for node 12: 1

For node 13:
- Possible 3-star: <13, (10, 1, 3)> or <13, (1, 7, 14)>
- Number of 3-stars for node 13: 2

For node 14:
- Possible 3-star: <14, (3, 13, 2)>
- Number of 3-stars for node 14: 1

Counting the total number of 3-stars from each node, the final answer is [15]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 10, 3)>, <1, (9, 7, 13)>, <2, (8, 12, 14)>, <3, (8, 13, 14)>, <4, (5, 9, 11)>, <5, (9, 4, 11)>, <6, (1, 7, 13)>, <7, (8, 12, 1)>, <7, (8, 0, 6)>, <8, (11, 2, 3)>, <9, (5, 4, 1)>, <9, (5, 0, 12)>, <10, (11, 0, 13)>, <11, (5, 10, 8)>, <12, (7, 9, 2)>, <13, (10, 1, 3)>, <13, (1, 7, 14)>, <14, (3, 13, 2)>.
