Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 16) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 11) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 16) (4, 9) (18, 13) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (5, 13) (5, 19) (13, 18) (13, 5) (13, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 8) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 6) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 8) (12, 15) (12, 2) (1, 2) (1, 8) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 6) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 13) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 11) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (15, 6, 9)>
<15, (3, 6, 12)>
<14, (17, 0, 9)>
<17, (14, 10, 11)>
<10, (15, 7, 17)>
<0, (14, 2, 7)>
<7, (10, 0, 8)>
<16, (15, 0, 8)>
