Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<5, (1, 9, 7)>
<9, (2, 8, 1)>
<4, (7, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 2)>
<1, (5, 3, 0)>
<3, (1, 9, 4)>
<2, (9, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
