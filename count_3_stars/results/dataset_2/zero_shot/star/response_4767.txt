Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
[]
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. The count is [2].
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (7, 6, 9)>
<2, (6, 9, 0)>
