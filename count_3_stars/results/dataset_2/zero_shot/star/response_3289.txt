Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 3) (13, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 11) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 4) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<9, (5, 10, 1)>
<1, (9, 3, 14)>
<3, (5, 1, 11)>
<8, (3, 13, 14)>
<10, (9, 11, 6)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
