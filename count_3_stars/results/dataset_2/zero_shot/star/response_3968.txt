Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 12) (16, 10) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 18) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 19) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 15) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 15) (2, 8) (2, 19) (0, 4) (0, 15) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 18) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 13) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 1) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 2) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 0) (18, 17) (18, 10) (18, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<8, (2, 15, 9)>
<15, (0, 8, 12)>
<18, (3, 10, 17)>
<12, (5, 15, 13)>
<4, (0, 14, 19)>
<6, (1, 11, 14)>
<9, (3, 8, 13)>
<13, (1, 9, 5)>
<19, (2, 4, 10)>
<10, (16, 18, 19)>
<11, (3, 6, 12)>
<17, (14, 18, 6)>
