Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 19) (2, 6) (2, 18) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 16) (11, 13) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 15) (13, 14) (17, 15) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 8) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 15) (10, 0) (10, 4) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 19) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 7) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 13) (14, 8) (14, 12) (4, 1) (4, 10) (12, 1) (12, 14) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 17) (15, 16) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 1, 0)>
<18, (2, 15, 16)>
