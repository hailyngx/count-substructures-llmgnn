Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 13) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 3) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 10) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 14) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 2) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 13) 

Response:
The total count of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
Unique 3-stars found:
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 11)>
<14, (0, 7, 12)>
