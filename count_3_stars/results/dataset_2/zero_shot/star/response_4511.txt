Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 19) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 19) (4, 12) (18, 11) (18, 17) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 10) (15, 1) (15, 10) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 14) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 17) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 0) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 17) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (16, 12) (3, 9) (3, 2) (14, 1) (14, 10) (7, 6) (7, 2) (17, 18) (17, 19) (17, 0) (17, 5) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 5) (5, 0) (5, 17) (5, 11) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
