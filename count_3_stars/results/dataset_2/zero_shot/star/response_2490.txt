Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 19) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 7) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 14) (4, 17) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 15) (2, 16) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 5) (7, 13) (7, 10) (7, 15) (15, 6) (15, 7) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 3) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 18) (12, 16) (12, 14) (9, 18) (9, 14) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 17) (3, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
The total count of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<11, (8, 10, 19)>
<16, (2, 12, 13)>
<6, (5, 15, 17)>
<14, (1, 3, 9)>
