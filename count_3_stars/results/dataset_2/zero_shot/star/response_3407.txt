Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 6) (14, 16) (14, 10) (17, 28) (17, 0) (3, 25) (3, 26) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 26) (25, 18) (4, 11) (8, 29) (8, 0) (28, 17) (28, 0) (28, 12) (29, 8) (29, 20) (29, 12) (6, 14) (6, 22) (6, 18) (6, 13) (15, 20) (15, 7) (15, 24) (20, 29) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 2) (2, 20) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 11) (18, 25) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 7) (10, 14) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 19) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 13) (22, 6) (23, 5) (23, 13) (26, 3) (26, 25) (26, 27) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 28) (0, 1) (16, 14) (16, 24) (16, 19) (16, 27) (24, 15) (24, 16) (24, 5) (5, 23) (5, 24) (9, 25) (9, 7) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 0) (12, 28) (12, 29) (12, 20) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 9) (7, 19) (27, 21) (27, 26) (27, 16) (11, 4) (11, 2) (19, 10) (19, 16) (19, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 21) (13, 23)
