Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:

<6, (9, 10, 0)>
<1, (3, 11, 8)>
<4, (10, 11, 12)>
<0, (12, 14, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
