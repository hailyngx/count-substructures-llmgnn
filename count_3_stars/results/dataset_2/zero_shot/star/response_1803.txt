Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 0) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 3) (10, 13) (10, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 14) 

Response:
There are 1 <5, (9, 13, 7)>. 
There are 4 <9, (5, 2, 1)>, <13, (8, 10, 14)>, <4, (0, 10, 6)>, <1, (9, 8, 11)>. 
There are 3 <12, (2, 6, 11)>, <8, (13, 2, 11)>, <14, (13, 1, 3)>. 
There are 5 <6, (4, 12, 0)>, <11, (8, 1, 12)>, <10, (13, 4, 0)>, <0, (4, 6, 12)>, <3, (5, 8, 14)>. 
There are 0 <7, (5, 13, 14)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
