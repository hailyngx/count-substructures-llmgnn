Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 10) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 18) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 15) (7, 19) (7, 10) (16, 13) (16, 18) (1, 6) (1, 9) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 15) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 15) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 19) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 17) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 17) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 17) (17, 9) (17, 2) (17, 11) (17, 3) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (13, 0) (13, 16) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<5, (6, 2, 15)>
<6, (5, 1, 4)>
<18, (8, 16, 19)>
<15, (12, 5, 19)>
