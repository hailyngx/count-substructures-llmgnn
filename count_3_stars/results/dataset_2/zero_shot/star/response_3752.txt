Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 19) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 18) (6, 12) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 8) (2, 17) (8, 1) (8, 2) (15, 10) (15, 19) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 13) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 4) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 17) (7, 3) (17, 2) (17, 16) (17, 18) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 9) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 18) (13, 10) (13, 16) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is [4].

<1, (3, 9, 16)>
<11, (2, 5, 12)>
<2, (8, 11, 14)>
<18, (5, 6, 9)>
