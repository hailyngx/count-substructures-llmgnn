Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 1) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 10) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 2) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (6, 8, 14)>
<9, (6, 4, 14)>
<6, (5, 9, 11)>
<4, (9, 8, 13)>
<3, (9, 7, 12)>
<11, (6, 8, 3)>
<2, (7, 1, 10)>
<1, (7, 13, 12)>
