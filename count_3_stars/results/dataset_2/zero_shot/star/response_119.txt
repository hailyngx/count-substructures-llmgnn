Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
[<5, (2, 4, 0)>, <9, (8, 4, 2)>, <4, (5, 9, 0)>, <3, (9, 1, 6)>, <2, (5, 9, 7)>, <8, (9, 3, 6)>, <6, (4, 7, 3)>, <0, (5, 9, 4)>]
