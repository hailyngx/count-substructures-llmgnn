Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 6) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 18) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 9) (15, 16) (15, 19) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 19) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 19) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 14) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 18) (17, 8) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 17) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 9, 17)>
<3, (4, 8, 13)>
<9, (7, 17, 18)>
<12, (2, 5, 14)>
