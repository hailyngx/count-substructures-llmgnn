Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 15) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (10, 9) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 7) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 8) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 16) (2, 0) (2, 19) (15, 5) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 14) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 13) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) (17, 9) (17, 4) (17, 16) (19, 2) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are 12 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 11, 6)>
<5, (4, 15, 12)>
<6, (9, 3, 8)>
<7, (8, 12, 1)>
<8, (9, 14, 8)>
<11, (10, 0, 14)>
<12, (7, 5, 8)>
<13, (15, 14, 16)>
<14, (13, 11, 8)>
<15, (1, 5, 18)>
<16, (0, 17, 13)>
<18, (15, 1, 8)>
