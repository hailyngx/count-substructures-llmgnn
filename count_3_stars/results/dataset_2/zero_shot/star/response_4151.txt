Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 18) (14, 2) (14, 5) (17, 10) (17, 15) (17, 4) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 12) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 9) (2, 14) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 11) (8, 1) (19, 11) (19, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 13) (11, 2) (11, 19) (11, 15) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (16, 2) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 7) (12, 10) (12, 15) (12, 9) (5, 14) (5, 1) (5, 18) (5, 4) (4, 17) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 6) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 18) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 7) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 12) (6, 3) (6, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 13, 9)>
<2, (14, 16, 11)>
<3, (10, 6, 13)>
<4, (17, 5, 6)>
<5, (14, 1, 18)>
<18, (14, 15, 7)>
