Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 8) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 17) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 4) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 10) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 4) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 6) (7, 9) (7, 12) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 18) (19, 8) (19, 0) (0, 16) (0, 19) (1, 9) (1, 4) (6, 10) (6, 13) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 13) (2, 4) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 18) (13, 4) (4, 14) (4, 15) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 13) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<16, (11, 5, 0)>
<5, (11, 8, 17)>
<9, (8, 1, 7)>
<14, (17, 18, 4)>
<10, (17, 3, 15)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
