Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 6) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 5) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

<4, (7, 8, 13)>
<4, (7, 11, 1)>
<7, (4, 14, 9)>
<7, (4, 9, 2)>
<7, (1, 9, 14)>
<1, (4, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 10, 2)>
<8, (10, 5, 12)>
<5, (6, 8, 12)>
<2, (7, 8, 12)>
<13, (4, 5, 0)>
<12, (9, 8, 5)>
<0, (11, 8, 2)>
<14, (7, 10, 5)>

There are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
