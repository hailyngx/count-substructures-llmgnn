Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<4, (7, 9, 8)>
<7, (4, 0, 9)>
<1, (5, 3, 6)>
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<6, (5, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
