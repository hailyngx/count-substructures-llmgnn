Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 8) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 12) (5, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 2) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the count of 3-stars is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (10, 11, 14)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 14)>
<8, (7, 11, 13)>
<10, (1, 9, 14)>
<11, (0, 8, 12)>
<14, (1, 3, 10)>
