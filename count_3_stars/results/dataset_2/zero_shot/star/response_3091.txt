Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 11) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 14) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 14) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 10) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 14) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) 

Response:
The given graph can be described by the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 12)>
<1, (3, 6, 11)>
<2, (3, 11, 14)>
<5, (8, 13, 14)>
<7, (0, 10, 13)>
<9, (1, 13, 2)>
<10, (5, 7, 14)>
<11, (1, 8, 14)>
<13, (7, 9, 14)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the number of 3-stars in brackets is [9].
