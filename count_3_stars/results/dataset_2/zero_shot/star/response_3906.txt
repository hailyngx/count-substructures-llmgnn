Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 27) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 29) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 7) (23, 20) (12, 20) (12, 17) (12, 1) (27, 9) (27, 13) (0, 9) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 7) (20, 22) (20, 23) (20, 12) (20, 0) (20, 19) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 28) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 18) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 3) (28, 18) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 11) (29, 26) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 24) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 17) (11, 5) (7, 22) (7, 0) (7, 16) (1, 12) (1, 29) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 14) (19, 9) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 13) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 24) (16, 7) (16, 4) (16, 6) (10, 21) (10, 13) (6, 29) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 16) (13, 27) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 10) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 24) (24, 29) (24, 5) (24, 4) (14, 15) (18, 21) (18, 28) (18, 17)
