Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 5) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 4) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 16) (13, 16) (13, 18) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 13) (18, 2) (5, 15) (5, 8) (6, 12) (6, 19) (11, 14) (11, 7) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 19) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 10) (16, 8) (16, 13) (19, 17) (19, 6) (19, 0) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 6) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of nodes that have at least 3 neighbors.

In this graph, the 3-stars are as follows:
<2, (8, 18, 12)>
<4, (1, 7, 14)>
<8, (2, 5, 16)>
<14, (4, 11, 17)>
<15, (1, 5, 9)>
