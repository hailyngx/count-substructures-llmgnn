Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 6, 2)>
<1, (5, 7, 3)>
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 1, 0)>
<8, (9, 4, 3)>
