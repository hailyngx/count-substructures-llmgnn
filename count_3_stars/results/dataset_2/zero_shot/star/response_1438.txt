Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. The answer is [5].
The unique 3-stars are:
<9, (8, 2, 3)>
<2, (9, 0, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (5, 2, 0)>
<1, (9, 6, 4)>
