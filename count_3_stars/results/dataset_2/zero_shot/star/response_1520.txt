Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 8) (27, 4) (27, 24) (4, 27) (4, 5) (4, 29) (4, 6) (7, 15) (7, 6) (1, 26) (1, 25) (1, 16) (1, 5) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 18) (26, 20) (26, 17) (19, 26) (19, 9) (11, 23) (11, 17) (11, 2) (28, 8) (28, 13) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 13) (13, 28) (13, 5) (13, 29) (18, 26) (18, 29) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 7) (21, 3) (21, 25) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 20) (3, 23) (10, 22) (10, 16) (23, 11) (23, 3) (23, 14) (23, 12) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 20) (2, 24) (2, 17) (12, 23) (12, 2) (12, 29) (22, 10) (8, 15) (8, 28) (8, 14) (0, 3) (0, 24) (9, 19) (9, 25) (9, 20) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 9) (20, 26) (20, 3) (20, 2) (20, 9) (20, 16) (14, 23) (14, 8) (24, 27) (24, 2) (24, 0) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 20) (17, 26) (17, 11) (17, 2) (29, 4) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 12) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be determined by counting the number of nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph. Let's analyze the given graph to identify all the 3-stars.

The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 2: (2, 11, 12, 17)
- Node 3: (3, 20, 21, 23)
- Node 8: (8, 14, 15, 28)
- Node 9: (9, 19, 20, 25)
- Node 11: (2, 11, 17, 23)
- Node 12: (2, 12, 23, 29)
- Node 13: (5, 13, 28, 29)
- Node 14: (8, 14, 23, 29)
- Node 15: (6, 7, 8, 15)
- Node 16: (1, 16, 20, 26)
- Node 17: (2, 11, 17, 26)
- Node 18: (18, 26, 29, 29)
- Node 19: (9, 19, 26, 29)
- Node 20: (2, 16, 20, 26)
- Node 21: (3, 21, 23, 25)
- Node 23: (3, 11, 12, 14)
- Node 24: (0, 2, 24, 27)
- Node 25: (1, 9, 21, 25)
- Node 26: (1, 16, 17, 18)
- Node 28: (8, 13, 14, 28)
- Node 29: (4, 12, 13, 18)

There are a total of 23 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<[2, (11, 12, 17)]>
<[3, (20, 21, 23)]>
<[8, (14, 15, 28)]>
<[9, (19, 20, 25)]>
<[11, (2, 17, 23)]>
<[12, (2, 23, 29)]>
<[13, (5, 28, 29)]>
<[14, (8, 23, 29)]>
<[15, (6, 7, 8)]>
<[16, (1, 20, 26)]>
<[17, (2, 11, 26)]>
<[18, (26, 29, 29)]>
<[19, (9, 26, 29)]>
<[20, (2, 16, 26)]>
<[21, (3, 23, 25)]>
<[23, (3, 11, 12)]>
<[24, (0, 2, 27)]>
<[25, (1, 9, 21)]>
<[26, (1, 17, 18)]>
<[28, (8, 13, 14)]>
<[29, (4, 12, 13)]>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].
