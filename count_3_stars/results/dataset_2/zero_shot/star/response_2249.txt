Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, and <9, (0, 2, 6)>. Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
