Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
