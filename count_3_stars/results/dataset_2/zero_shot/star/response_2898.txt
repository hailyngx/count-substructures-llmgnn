Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 10) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 14) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 14) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be obtained by first identifying all nodes with degree 3. 

Here, we see that node 5, node 9, node 10 have degree 3. Therefore, there are 3 possible 3-stars in this graph.

So, the final count of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
<10, (9, 3, 11)>
