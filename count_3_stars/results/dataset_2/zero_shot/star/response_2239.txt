Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 8) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 12) (11, 17) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 16) (18, 3) (18, 2) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 4) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 17) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 8) (0, 10) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 8) (16, 2) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 1) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 9) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 8) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 17) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 4) (19, 9) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 13) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 13) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 9) 

Response:
The key observation here is that a 3-star must have a central node connected to exactly three leaves. Given the edges provided, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<0, (10, 1, 16)>
<2, (13, 4, 18)>
<6, (19, 4, 14)>
<7, (17, 12, 16)>
<8, (14, 17, 15)>
<9, (13, 1, 19)>
<11, (12, 17, 8)>
<12, (17, 11, 8)>
<16, (1, 7, 2)>
<17, (16, 7, 12)>
<18, (3, 2, 19)>
<19, (9, 4, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
