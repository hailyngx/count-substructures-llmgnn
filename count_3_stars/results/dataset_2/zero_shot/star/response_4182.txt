Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) 

Response:
The central node in each 3-star is specified as the first node in the tuple, and the leaf nodes are all the other nodes connected to the central node. Using this information, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

Since each 3-star consists of a center node and exactly three other nodes, we can analyze the given edges to identify all the possible 3-stars.

<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 0)>
<6, (9, 7, 5)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (6, 4, 3)>
<8, (5, 7, 2)>
<2, (4, 8, 0)>
<0, (9, 8, 2)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (5, 9, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
