Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 1) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 total 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, (7, 14, 13)>
<3, (1, 11, 10)>
<10, (8, 0, 3)>
<11, (7, 5, 12)>
<8, (4, 0, 10)>
<12, (3, 11, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
