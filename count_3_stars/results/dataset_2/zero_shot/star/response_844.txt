Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 15) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 9) (21, 3) (21, 8) (12, 27) (12, 17) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 1) (4, 27) (4, 20) (8, 21) (8, 2) (8, 17) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 15) (29, 16) (29, 14) (29, 24) (2, 27) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 25) (24, 29) (24, 26) (24, 20) (26, 24) (26, 18) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 22) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 0) (13, 18) (18, 26) (18, 13) (18, 28) (18, 1) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 23) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 10) (3, 6) (14, 29) (14, 19) (28, 18) (28, 3) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 14) (23, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (25, 2) (25, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 22) (20, 4) (20, 24) (20, 22) (1, 27) (1, 5) (1, 18) (6, 3) (6, 15) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 20) (15, 16) (15, 17) (15, 6) 

Response:
There are 9 unique 3-stars in this graph. The final answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<11, (16, 19, 5)>
<16, (11, 29, 15)>
<21, (3, 8, 5)>
<27, (12, 4, 2)>
<4, (27, 20, 1)>
<8, (21, 17, 2)>
<17, (12, 8, 15)>
<29, (16, 14, 24)>
<2, (27, 8, 9)>
