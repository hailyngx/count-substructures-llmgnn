Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 14) (10, 15) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 18) (11, 6) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 7) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 0) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 0) (16, 17) (16, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 4) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 4) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 13) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 0) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 19) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 17) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 19) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph:
<3, (15, 5, 12)>
<10, (15, 9, 14)>
<11, (18, 6, 1)>
<2, (18, 6, 7)>
<17, (16, 19, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
