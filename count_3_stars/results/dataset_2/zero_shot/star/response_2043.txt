Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<5, (9, 8, 0)>
<8, (5, 9, 1)>
