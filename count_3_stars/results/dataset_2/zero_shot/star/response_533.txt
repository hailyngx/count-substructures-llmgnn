Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 19) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 17) (1, 16) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (2, 11) (2, 18) (18, 16) (18, 2) (18, 5) (0, 1) (0, 5) (14, 15) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 1) (13, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (10, 3) (10, 8) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 12) (9, 15) (9, 8) (12, 8) (12, 17) (6, 11) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 19) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 17) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 19) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:

<16, (11, 1, 3)>
<3, (16, 15, 10)>
<18, (16, 2, 5)>
<5, (18, 0, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
