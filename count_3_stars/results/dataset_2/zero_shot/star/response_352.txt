Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
There is a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 4, 0)>
<4, (9, 8, 6)>
<8, (5, 4, 6)>
<0, (9, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
