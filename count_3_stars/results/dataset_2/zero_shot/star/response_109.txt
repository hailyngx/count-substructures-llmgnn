Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 10) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 10) (14, 11) (7, 3) (7, 2) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 11) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [(7)]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 4, 13)>.
