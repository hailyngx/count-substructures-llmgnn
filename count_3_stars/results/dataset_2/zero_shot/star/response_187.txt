Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 15) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 14) (16, 10) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 13) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 13) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 13) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 18) (7, 5) (7, 2) (19, 17) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 18) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by calculating the number of unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The <5, (2, 7, 12)>, <9, (1, 6, 14)>, <6, (8, 9, 12)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, and <1, (2, 8, 9)> are the 3-stars present in the graph. Therefore, there are 6 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Thus, the final answer is [6].
