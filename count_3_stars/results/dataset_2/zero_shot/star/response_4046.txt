Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 13) (12, 10) (12, 14) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are 8 total 3-stars in the given graph in the format [(center node, leaf node 1, leaf node 2, leaf node 3)]:

Total 3-stars: [8]
Unique 3-stars: <6, (9, 10, 11)> <9, (6, 14, 1)> <4, (7, 11, 3)> <7, (4, 0, 8)> <1, (9, 7, 3)> <3, (4, 1, 14)> <10, (6, 3, 12)> <14, (9, 3, 12)>
