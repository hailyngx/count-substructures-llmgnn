Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (10, 2) (10, 16) (10, 14) (17, 19) (17, 11) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 11) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 19) (15, 1) (15, 13) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 19) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (7, 18) (7, 19) (7, 5) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 9) (19, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 12) (16, 10) (16, 9) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 three-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 8, 11)>
<1, (3, 15, 13)>
<2, (10, 18, 11)>
<4, (17, 19, 14)>
<5, (3, 7, 5)>
<6, (8, 3, 13)>
<9, (8, 16, 13)>
<10, (2, 14, 16)>
<12, (14, 11, 12)>

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
