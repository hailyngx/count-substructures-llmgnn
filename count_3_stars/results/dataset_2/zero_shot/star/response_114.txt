Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 5) (4, 1) (4, 16) (4, 14) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (6, 10) (6, 17) (13, 5) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 12) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 3) (7, 15) (0, 3) (0, 15) (16, 4) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 14) (9, 19) (9, 15) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 9) (15, 18) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 16) (1, 4) (1, 18) (14, 4) (14, 16) (14, 12) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 14) (18, 15) (18, 1) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<10, (11, 2, 6)>
<11, (10, 19, 5)>
<4, (1, 14, 16)>
<8, (19, 5, 7)>
<7, (8, 3, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
