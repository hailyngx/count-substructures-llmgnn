Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
