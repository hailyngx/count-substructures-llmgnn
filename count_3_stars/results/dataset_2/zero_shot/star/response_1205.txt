Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 14) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 10) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 11) (13, 10) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<6, (5, 1, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (6, 2, 14)>
<1, (6, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 7, 14)>
<4, (6, 0, 2)>
<8, (1, 14, 8)>
<5, (6, 0, 7)>
<2, (6, 4, 10)>
<0, (4, 14, 7)>
<14, (9, 3, 8)>
