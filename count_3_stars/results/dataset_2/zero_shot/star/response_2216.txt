Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 23) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 28) (9, 16) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 29) (25, 3) (25, 13) (25, 18) (25, 10) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 27) (8, 6) (8, 20) (8, 17) (13, 25) (13, 4) (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 2) (27, 21) (27, 0) (27, 2) (22, 26) (22, 11) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 23) (24, 3) (24, 26) (24, 12) (24, 1) (1, 24) (1, 14) (1, 10) (17, 8) (17, 4) (18, 25) (18, 26) (11, 22) (11, 19) (11, 15) (23, 6) (23, 7) (23, 26) (16, 9) (16, 7) (5, 26) (5, 29) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 19) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 12) (29, 3) (29, 7) (29, 5) (28, 9) (28, 0) (12, 24) (12, 19) (12, 14) (20, 8) (20, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 10) (10, 25) (10, 1) (10, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 27) (2, 20) (2, 14) 

Response:
There are 3-stars present in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (24, 25, 29)>
<6, (8, 9, 15)>
<9, (6, 16, 28)>
<25, (3, 10, 13)>
