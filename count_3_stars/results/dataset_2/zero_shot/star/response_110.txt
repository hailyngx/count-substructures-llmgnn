Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 8, 1)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<2, (9, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 9, 6)>
<0, (4, 7, 3)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 8, 0)>
<3, (5, 4, 7)>
