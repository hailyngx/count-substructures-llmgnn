Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

<0, (9, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (5, 9, 0)>
<3, (5, 8, 2)>
<4, (7, 5, 1)>
<6, (5, 9, 1)>
<7, (6, 9, 4)>
<8, (6, 9, 2)>
<9, (6, 9, 0)>
