Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 7) (5, 3) (5, 27) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 11) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 28) (18, 25) (18, 1) (21, 0) (21, 12) (21, 25) (21, 17) (28, 18) (28, 13) (28, 15) (20, 29) (20, 1) (29, 20) (29, 10) (11, 4) (11, 23) (11, 22) (23, 11) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 24) (23, 27) (14, 26) (14, 8) (14, 2) (26, 23) (26, 14) (26, 3) (8, 14) (8, 24) (8, 25) (7, 9) (1, 18) (1, 20) (1, 16) (1, 0) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 13) (17, 21) (17, 23) (17, 12) (24, 23) (24, 8) (24, 10) (24, 2) (0, 21) (0, 1) (0, 22) (19, 3) (3, 5) (3, 26) (3, 19) (3, 10) (10, 29) (10, 24) (10, 3) (13, 6) (13, 28) (13, 16) (22, 11) (22, 0) (22, 15) (25, 18) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 2) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 24) (2, 25) (12, 21) (12, 17) (27, 5) (27, 23) (15, 6) (15, 28) (15, 22) 

Response:
