Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 5) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 11) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 5) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be found as follows:

1. Identify the nodes with degree of 4, which are 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, and 12.
2. For each of these nodes, count the number of 3-stars it participates in.
3. Sum up the counts of 3-stars from all these nodes.

Let's go ahead and count the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

We have:
- Node 2 participates in 4 3-stars: <2, (5, 7, 0)>, <2, (5, 14, 8)>, <2, (5, 0, 10)>, <2, (5, 11, 1)>.
- Node 5 participates in 4 3-stars: <5, (2, 7, 10)>, <5, (2, 8, 14)>, <5, (2, 0, 11)>, <5, (2, 14, 8)>.
- Node 8 participates in 4 3-stars: <8, (5, 14, 2)>, <8, (5, 10, 0)>, <8, (5, 2, 7)>, <8, (5, 0, 1)>.
- Node 10 participates in 4 3-stars: <10, (5, 0, 11)>, <10, (5, 7, 2)>, <10, (5, 11, 0)>, <10, (5, 8, 14)>.
- Node 11 participates in 4 3-stars: <11, (5, 0, 2)>, <11, (5, 2, 10)>, <11, (5, 14, 8)>, <11, (5, 8, 7)>.
- Node 12 participates in 4 3-stars: <12, (8, 4, 13)>, <12, (8, 1, 9)>, <12, (8, 6, 3)>, <12, (8, 12, 9)>.

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [6].
