Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 8, 1)>
<4, (9, 6, 8)>
<7, (3, 1, 0)>
<0, (9, 6, 7)>
