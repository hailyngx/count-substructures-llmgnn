Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 11) (2, 13) (2, 3) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 3) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 14) (19, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 16) (9, 18) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 6) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (11, 17) (11, 1) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 0) (14, 5) (14, 8) (15, 7) (16, 4) (16, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in this graph.  

Unique 3-stars: 
<4, (7, 1, 16)>
<7, (4, 15, 10)>
<10, (7, 17, 8)>
<17, (10, 13, 12)>
<13, (17, 2, 0)>
<1, (4, 5, 12)>
