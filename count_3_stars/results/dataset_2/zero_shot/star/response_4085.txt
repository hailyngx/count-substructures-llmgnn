Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed:
<0, (5, 1, 9)>
<1, (9, 0, 8)>
<2, (5, 4, 7)>
<3, (5, 0, 4)>
<4, (9, 4, 8)>
<5, (9, 2, 3)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
