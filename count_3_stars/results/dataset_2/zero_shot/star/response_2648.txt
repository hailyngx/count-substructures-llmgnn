Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 2) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 14) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 2) (2, 16) (2, 17) (18, 16) (18, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 19) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 6) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 19) (1, 16) (1, 15) (1, 7) (1, 5) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 8) (19, 12) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 5) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 14) (9, 8) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 13) (13, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (7, 17, 14)>
<1, (16, 15, 5)>
<4, (18, 19, 14)>
<5, (12, 0, 1)>
<6, (15, 4, 13)>
<8, (11, 10, 9)>
