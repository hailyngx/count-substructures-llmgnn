Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 12) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 10) 

Response:
There are <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 10, 0)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 14)>, <5, (7, 9, 11)>, <6, (3, 4, 11)>, <7, (10, 9, 14)>, <8, (0, 6, 12)>, <9, (5, 7, 11)>, <10, (0, 2, 7)>, <11, (5, 9, 6)>, <12, (8, 13, 9)>, <13, (12, 14, 5)>, <14, (13, 4, 7)>.

There are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
