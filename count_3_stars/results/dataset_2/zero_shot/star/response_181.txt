Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 5) 

Response:
There is a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
