Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 23) (13, 7) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 0) (22, 3) (15, 27) (15, 7) (15, 5) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 24) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 11) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 7) (23, 13) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 25) (1, 26) (1, 4) (1, 18) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 16) (20, 8) (20, 14) (7, 13) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 8) (17, 6) (17, 24) (29, 19) (29, 3) (24, 27) (24, 26) (24, 17) (24, 2) (10, 13) (21, 11) (3, 22) (3, 29) (3, 4) (28, 19) (28, 2) (0, 22) (0, 12) (11, 15) (11, 12) (11, 21) (11, 14) (14, 20) (14, 11) (9, 18) (9, 19) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 6) (2, 24) (2, 28) (2, 5) (2, 25) (5, 15) (5, 12) (5, 2) (6, 17) (6, 18) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 19) (19, 29) (19, 28) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 16) (16, 26) (16, 19) (25, 23) (25, 2) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<13, (22, 10, 23)>
<22, (13, 0, 3)>
<15, (27, 7, 5)>
<27, (15, 12, 24)>
<12, (27, 7, 5)>
<8, (23, 20, 7)>
<23, (13, 8, 26)>
<26, (23, 1, 24)>
<20, (8, 14, 22)>
<7, (13, 15, 12)>
<17, (6, 24, 16)>
<29, (19, 3, 28)>
<24, (27, 26, 17)>
<10, (13, 22, 0)>
<21, (11, 14, 6)>
<3, (22, 29, 4)>
<28, (19, 2, 17)>
<0, (22, 12, 2)>
<11, (15, 12, 21)>
<14, (20, 11, 6)>
<9, (18, 19, 6)>
<6, (17, 18, 14)>
<18, (13, 1, 9)>
<2, (24, 5, 28)>
<5, (15, 12, 2)>
<4, (1, 3, 19)>
<19, (29, 9, 4)>
<16, (26, 19, 17)>
<25, (23, 2, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [29] 3-star configurations in the given graph.
