Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 13) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (5, 6) (5, 18) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 17) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 15) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 18) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 12) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 14) (12, 19) (12, 14) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 13) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 12) (1, 2) (1, 19) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 13) (17, 2) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 18) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<4, (7, 11, 3)>
<7, (4, 11, 10)>
<6, (5, 8, 0)>
<9, (13, 10, 15)>
<5, (6, 18, 3)>
<2, (8, 1, 17)>
<8, (6, 2, 19)>
<3, (4, 0, 18)>
<19, (8, 15, 1)>
<0, (10, 3, 16)>
<16, (0, 14, 13)>
<12, (19, 14, 1)>
