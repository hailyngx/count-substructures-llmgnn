Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 12) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 12) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 14) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

<9, (1, 8, 13)>
<1, (4, 9, 10)>
<3, (0, 2, 14)>
<0, (2, 3, 13)>
<2, (0, 10, 14)>
<4, (1, 10, 13)>
<6, (3, 7, 14)>
