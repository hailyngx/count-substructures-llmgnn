Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 6) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 16) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 15) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 18) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 18) (13, 12) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 19) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 18) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 0) (6, 12) (6, 14) (19, 2) (19, 3) (19, 13) (10, 7) (10, 1) (4, 13) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 18) (15, 14) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 1) 

Response:
There are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (9, 17, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, 13)>
<7, (16, 10, 8)>
<12, (13, 18, 6)>
<2, (8, 16, 14)>
<8, (9, 7, 2)>
<0, (14, 16, 6)>
<14, (2, 0, 15)>
<3, (5, 11, 19)>
<18, (12, 11, 17)>
