Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 29) (5, 7) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 6) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 12) (0, 20) (0, 10) (0, 13) (20, 0) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 7) (18, 8) (6, 22) (6, 2) (6, 28) (6, 14) (28, 6) (28, 27) (19, 26) (26, 23) (26, 19) (26, 17) (26, 3) (3, 2) (3, 26) (3, 21) (21, 3) (21, 17) (21, 14) (8, 9) (8, 18) (8, 24) (8, 10) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 27) (10, 1) (4, 22) (4, 16) (4, 25) (4, 11) (12, 23) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 7) (7, 5) (7, 18) (7, 16) (17, 26) (17, 21) (29, 5) (29, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (11, 4) (11, 29) (11, 1) (11, 13) (15, 24) (14, 6) (14, 21) (14, 25) (24, 8) (24, 15) (24, 25) (25, 5) (25, 4) (25, 14) (25, 24) (27, 5) (27, 28) (27, 10) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<5, (9, 7, 27)>
<9, (5, 8, 13)>
<22, (23, 4, 6)>
<23, (22, 26, 12)>
<26, (23, 17, 3)>
<3, (2, 21, 26)>
<8, (9, 18, 24)>
<10, (0, 1, 27)>
<4, (22, 16, 25)>
<16, (4, 12, 7)>
<7, (5, 18, 16)>
<17, (26, 21, 17)>
<29, (5, 11, 29)>
<1, (2, 10, 11)>
<11, (4, 13, 29)>
<14, (6, 21, 25)>
<24, (8, 15, 25)>
<27, (5, 28, 10)>
<13, (9, 0, 11)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
