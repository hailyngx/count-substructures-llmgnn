Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 10) 

Response:
