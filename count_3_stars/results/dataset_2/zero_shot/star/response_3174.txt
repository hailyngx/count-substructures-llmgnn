Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 14) (3, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 12) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 12) (10, 14) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 12) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
