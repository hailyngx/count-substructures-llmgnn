Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 11) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 11) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 11) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 4) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (9, 8, 12)>
<9, (6, 8, 10)>
<7, (9, 10, 13)>
<12, (6, 10, 8)>
<2, (8, 5, 13)>
<8, (6, 9, 2)>
<5, (2, 13, 1)>
<13, (7, 5, 2)>
<11, (9, 13, 14)>
<14, (6, 11, 2)>
<1, (7, 5, 11)>
<0, (9, 11, 3)>
