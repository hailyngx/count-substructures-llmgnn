Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<4, (7, 0, 3)>
<2, (5, 1, 8)>
<5, (9, 2, 6)>
<1, (5, 7, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, 0)>
<6, (5, 4, 3)>
<8, (9, 1, 2)>
<7, (4, 1, 0)>
