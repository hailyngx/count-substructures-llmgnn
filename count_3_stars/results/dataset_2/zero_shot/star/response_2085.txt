Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
Unique 3-stars:
<4, (9, 5, 6)>
<8, (5, 0, 7)>
<5, (4, 8, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 1)>
<0, (8, 3, 1)>
<2, (4, 1, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 0)>
<3, (5, 6, 0)>
