Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 1) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 1) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 10) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (4, 7, 11)>, <1, (0, 10, 12)>, <2, (8, 12, 13)>, <3, (7, 8, 14)>, <5, (2, 12, 14)>, <6, (9, 10, 11)>] 
Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the graph.
