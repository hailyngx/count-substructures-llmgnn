Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 5) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 7) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 5) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 4) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:
There are [13] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 2, 14)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 12)>
<4, (1, 10, 13)>
<5, (4, 7, 11)>
<6, (6, 8, 10)>
<7, (7, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 8, 9)>
<10, (7, 10, 6)>
<11, (5, 7, 11)>
<12, (0, 3, 12)>
<13, (1, 4, 10)>
