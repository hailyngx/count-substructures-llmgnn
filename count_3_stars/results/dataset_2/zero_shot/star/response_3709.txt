Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 8) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 16) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (19, 1) (19, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 15) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (16, 17) (16, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 14) (6, 0) (6, 18) (15, 7) (15, 4) (15, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 16) (2, 13) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 2) (18, 6) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 12, 4)>
<9, (5, 2, 10)>
<4, (5, 9, 15)>
<12, (5, 0, 10)>
<10, (9, 0, 13)>
<14, (5, 8, 2)>
<0, (7, 12, 6)>
<7, (19, 15, 1)>
