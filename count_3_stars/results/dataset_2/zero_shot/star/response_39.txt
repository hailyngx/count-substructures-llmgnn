Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 3) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 13) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 12) (3, 13) (3, 9) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 14) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<10, (11, 12, 2)>
<11, (10, 5, 1)>
<4, (0, 14, 1)>
<8, (2, 9, 14)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<12, (10, 3, 3)>
<5, (11, 6, 1)>
<6, (10, 13, 5)>
<2, (10, 9, 8)>
<3, (12, 13, 9)>
<13, (11, 6, 3)>
