Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 17) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 11) (15, 8) (10, 6) (10, 13) (5, 19) (19, 8) (19, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 18) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 14) (12, 2) (12, 16) (14, 11) (14, 16) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 3) (18, 0) (13, 4) (13, 10) (17, 9) (17, 4) (17, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (0, 8, 18)>
<9, (1, 16, 17)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 13, 17)>
<11, (1, 14, 16)>
<9, (6, 16, 18)>
