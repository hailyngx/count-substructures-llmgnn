Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 12) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 2) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars found:
<4, (5, 7, 14)>
<11, (1, 7, 10)>
<5, (3, 4, 14)>
