Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: <3, (6, 1, 5)>, <4, (1, 8, 2)>, <5, (6, 3, 7)>, <0, (3, 8, 2)>
