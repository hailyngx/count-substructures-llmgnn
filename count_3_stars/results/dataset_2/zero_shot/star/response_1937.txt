Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 9) (4, 14) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 12) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 12) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<5, (9, 8, 1)>
<9, (4, 6, 3)>
<6, (2, 7, 10)>
<1, (5, 10, 11)>
<2, (5, 6, 3)>
<12, (13, 2, 11)>
<11, (1, 0, 12)>
<14, (9, 4, 11)>
