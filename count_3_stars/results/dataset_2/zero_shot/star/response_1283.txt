Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 3-star structures in the given graph. The count is [9].

<5, (2, 0, 3)>
<9, (8, 4, 1)>
<4, (9, 6, 3)>
<7, (5, 9, 0)>
<1, (9, 6, 0)>
<3, (5, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 1, 2)>
<2, (5, 3, 6)>
<8, (9, 7, 3)>
