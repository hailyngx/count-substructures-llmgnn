Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 17) (22, 10) (22, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 28) (17, 18) (17, 5) (17, 11) (19, 2) (19, 26) (19, 20) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 6) (26, 25) (26, 4) (4, 18) (4, 26) (4, 15) (13, 1) (13, 26) (13, 0) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 24) (27, 25) (27, 9) (27, 5) (12, 2) (12, 28) (12, 29) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (14, 11) (14, 20) (16, 24) (16, 8) (16, 5) (7, 3) (7, 22) (7, 11) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 21) (0, 29) (24, 25) (24, 16) (5, 17) (5, 27) (5, 16) (8, 11) (8, 16) (20, 19) (20, 14) (29, 12) (29, 0) (29, 21) (15, 18) (15, 4) (23, 10) (23, 28) (21, 0) (21, 29) (6, 3) (6, 26) (6, 10) (10, 22) (10, 23) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 28) (9, 27) (9, 10) (9, 28) (28, 2) (28, 12) (28, 23) (28, 10) (28, 9)
