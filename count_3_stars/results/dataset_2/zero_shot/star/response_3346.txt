Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 1, 8)>
<9, (6, 8, 1)>
<1, (6, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 1, 8)>
