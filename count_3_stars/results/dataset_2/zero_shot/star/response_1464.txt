Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The central nodes of 3-stars in this graph are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's count the number of 3-stars:

- For node 0: (0, 9, 4), (0, 2, 5) [2]
- For node 1: (1, 2, 5), (1, 8, 7) [2]
- For node 2: (2, 1, 5), (2, 3, 9), (2, 8, 5), (2, 0, 9) [4]
- For node 3: (3, 9, 2), (3, 7, 5) [2]
- For node 4: (4, 7, 3), (4, 0, 9) [2]
- For node 5: (5, 1, 2), (5, 8, 2), (5, 7, 3), (5, 6, 7) [4]
- For node 6: (6, 9, 7), (6, 5, 7) [2]
- For node 7: (7, 6, 5), (7, 4, 3), (7, 1, 8), (7, 3, 5) [4]
- For node 8: (8, 2, 5), (8, 1, 7), (8, 9, 2) [3]
- For node 9: (9, 6, 7), (9, 8, 2), (9, 3, 7), (9, 0, 2) [4]

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25].
