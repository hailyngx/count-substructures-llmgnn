Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 1) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be counted by looking at nodes with exactly 3 incident edges. 

The nodes with degrees 3 are: 
- Node 0
- Node 4
- Node 6
- Node 9

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (10, 11, 3)>
<4, (14, 3, 7)>
<6, (10, 1, 7)>
<9, (13, 5, 1)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
