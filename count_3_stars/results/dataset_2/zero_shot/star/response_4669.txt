Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (6, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (7, 3, 9)>
