Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 27) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 24) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 24) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 29) (13, 26) (13, 20) (13, 14) (26, 18) (26, 13) (26, 15) (26, 25) (26, 16) (6, 19) (21, 0) (21, 25) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 21) (25, 1) (16, 26) (28, 8) (28, 17) (28, 20) (27, 4) (27, 3) (27, 23) (0, 21) (0, 5) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 20) (19, 6) (19, 5) (19, 10) (2, 1) (2, 11) (8, 28) (8, 10) (8, 1) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 1) (17, 28) (17, 23) (17, 22) (3, 27) (3, 9) (3, 29) (1, 25) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 11) (15, 26) (15, 23) (15, 9) (14, 13) (14, 22) (14, 9) (22, 17) (22, 14) (20, 12) (20, 13) (20, 28) (20, 5) (23, 27) (23, 17) (23, 15) (23, 29) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 14) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 10) (10, 19) (10, 8) (10, 24) (29, 18) (29, 3) (29, 23) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <4, (7, 18, 27)>, <7, (4, 12, 24)>, <12, (7, 20, 24)>, <18, (4, 26, 29)>, and <26, (13, 15, 25)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
