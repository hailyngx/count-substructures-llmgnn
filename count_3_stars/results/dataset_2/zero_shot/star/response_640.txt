Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 3) (0, 7) (0, 17) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 8) (15, 19) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 17) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 12) (8, 7) (8, 12) (3, 9) (3, 18) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 12) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 19) (17, 4) (17, 18) (17, 0) (17, 2) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<16, (11, 13, 6)>
<4, (6, 18, 19)>
<0, (7, 17, 19)>
<9, (6, 14, 1)>
<18, (4, 17, 3)>
<7, (0, 19, 14)>
<12, (2, 14, 8)>
<5, (11, 4, 12)>
