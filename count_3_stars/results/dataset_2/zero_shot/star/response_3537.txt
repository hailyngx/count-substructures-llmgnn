Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in this graph. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
