Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 18) (16, 14) (16, 15) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 17) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 14) (17, 18) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 10) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 15) (12, 8) (12, 18) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars are:
<11, (7, 18, 19)>
<16, (14, 15, 1)>
<5, (6, 10, 19)>
<4, (8, 1, 18)>
<8, (2, 4, 12)>
<18, (11, 4, 17)>
