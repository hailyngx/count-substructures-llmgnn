Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 14) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 9) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 12) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<10, (0, 2, 5)>
<11, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (6, 8, -)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 14)>
