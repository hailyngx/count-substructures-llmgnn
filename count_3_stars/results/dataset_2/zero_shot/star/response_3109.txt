Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (3, 5) (3, 2) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 1) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 13) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 13) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 9, 10)>
<1, (11, 13, 14)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 9, 12)>
<5, (2, 5, 12)>
<6, (8, 10, 14)>
<7, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 14)>
<9, (4, 7, 12)>
