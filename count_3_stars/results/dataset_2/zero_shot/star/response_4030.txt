Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 12) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars found: 
<5, (9, 1, 0)>
<7, (4, 11, 14)>
<9, (5, 6, 10)>
<13, (8, 3, 0)>
