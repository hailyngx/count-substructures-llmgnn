Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 3) (14, 4) (17, 10) (17, 5) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 16) (12, 10) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 18) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 3) (19, 8) (19, 0) (4, 14) (4, 0) (0, 19) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 18) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 5) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 13) (15, 11) (15, 9) (15, 18) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 15) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<11, (16, 7, 15)>
<10, (17, 12, 1)>
