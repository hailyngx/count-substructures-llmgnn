Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 14) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 3) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 3) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 14) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) 

Response:
There are 9 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count is as follows: [9]

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 8, 13)>
<9, (6, 11, 10)>
<8, (6, 4, 11)>
<13, (6, 2, 14)>
<4, (8, 12, 5)>
<7, (6, 12, 2)>
<12, (9, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 0, 3)>
<3, (5, 0, 11)>
