Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
