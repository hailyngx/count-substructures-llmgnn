Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are [13] 3-star graphs in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets:

<4, (7, 9, 0)>
<4, (7, 1, 6)>
<7, (4, 9, 2)>
<1, (4, 3, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 0)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (7, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 1)>
<5, (4, 1, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 1)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
