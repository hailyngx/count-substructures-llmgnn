Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<9, (6, 4, 3)>
<1, (3, 5, 0)>
<3, (6, 9, 1)>
<4, (6, 9, 0)>
<8, (1, 2, 0)>
<5, (6, 1, 4)>
