Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 19) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 18) (3, 5) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 7) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 1) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 12) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 12) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 19) (19, 16) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 6) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 12) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 19) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 6) 

Response:
[11]
