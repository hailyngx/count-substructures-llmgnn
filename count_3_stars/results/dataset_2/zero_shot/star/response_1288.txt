Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 20) (26, 10) (26, 27) (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 29) (6, 9) (6, 25) (2, 17) (29, 15) (29, 14) (29, 10) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 27) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 8) (21, 14) (21, 4) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 21) (8, 24) (23, 12) (23, 13) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (17, 2) (17, 20) (17, 1) (17, 16) (19, 28) (19, 27) (13, 23) (13, 16) (13, 20) (22, 9) (22, 14) (22, 0) (20, 9) (20, 17) (20, 13) (20, 12) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 22) (4, 21) (4, 12) (4, 24) (4, 1) (27, 26) (27, 7) (27, 19) (27, 10) (11, 12) (5, 3) (12, 23) (12, 20) (12, 4) (12, 11) (28, 19) (1, 7) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 10) (16, 18) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 10) (10, 26) (10, 29) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 16) (14, 29) (14, 21) (14, 22) (14, 25) (24, 8) (24, 4) (25, 6) (25, 14) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted as follows:

1. There are four nodes (1, 5, 11, 28) which have degree less than 3, making them unable to be part of any 3-star.
2. The remaining 26 nodes have degree equal to or more than 3, making them able to be central nodes of 3-stars.
3. For each of the 26 nodes, we need to check if they have exactly 3 neighbors, which would form a 3-star. 

After examining the graph, we find that the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<3, (15, 5, 8)>
<6, (9, 25, 27)>
<7, (21, 0, 1)>
<8, (3, 15, 24)>
<9, (6, 22, 20)>
<10, (26, 16, 1)>
<12, (23, 20, 4)>
<13, (23, 16, 20)>
<14, (29, 21, 22)>
<15, (3, 18, 29)>
<16, (18, 17, 13)>
<17, (2, 20, 1)>
<18, (15, 16, 0)>
<20, (9, 17, 12)>
<21, (7, 8, 14)>
<22, (9, 14, 0)>
<24, (8, 4, 1)>
<25, (6, 14, 0)>
<26, (10, 27, 5)>
<27, (26, 7, 19)>
<28, (19, 13, 27)>
<29, (15, 14, 10)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [22].
