Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 26) (15, 9) (15, 8) (1, 21) (1, 28) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 22) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 23) (21, 18) (21, 17) (8, 15) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 26) (22, 1) (22, 23) (23, 21) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 17) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 18) (2, 3) (2, 26) (2, 28) (19, 1) (19, 26) (19, 0) (26, 15) (26, 13) (26, 2) (26, 19) (9, 15) (9, 20) (9, 27) (29, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 4) (14, 25) (7, 10) (7, 11) (6, 14) (6, 4) (18, 21) (18, 23) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 20) (4, 14) (4, 6) (12, 21) (12, 25) (12, 0) (24, 27) (24, 17) (27, 9) (27, 24) (27, 17) (27, 5) (20, 9) (20, 18) (5, 27) (5, 25) (25, 14) (25, 12) (25, 5) (25, 28) (17, 21) (17, 23) (17, 24) (17, 27) (0, 19) (0, 29) (0, 12) (28, 1) (28, 2) (28, 25) (16, 10) 

Response:

<21, (1, 23, 17)>
<15, (26, 9, 8)>
<10, (1, 11, 7)>
<26, (2, 13, 19)>
<14, (11, 6, 18)>
<18, (21, 23, 20)>
<25, (14, 12, 28)>
