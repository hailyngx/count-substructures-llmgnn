Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are 7 3-star configurations in the given graph, which are as follows: 
<[5, (9, 6, 4)]>, <[9, (5, 6, 1)]>, <[6, (9, 7, 3)]>, <[4, (5, 8, 1)]>, <[7, (6, 4, 2)]>, <[8, (5, 4, 7)]>, <[0, (4, 2, 3)]>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [7].
