Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 8, 1)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
<4, (7, 8, 6)>
<7, (4, 1, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 6)>
<6, (4, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
