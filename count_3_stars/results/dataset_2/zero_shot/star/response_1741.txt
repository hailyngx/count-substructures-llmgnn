Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 12) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 19) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 2) (18, 17) (4, 11) (17, 18) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 14) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 8) (7, 5) (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 6) (19, 1) (19, 2) (9, 15) (9, 17) (12, 15) (12, 13) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (14, 2) (14, 5) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 5)
