Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 12) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 4) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in this graph. The count is [4].
The unique 3-stars are <5, (3, 7, 10)>, <4, (2, 8, 12)>, <6, (1, 2, 12)>, and <13, (0, 11, 5)>.
