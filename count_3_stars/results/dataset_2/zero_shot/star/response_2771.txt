Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 15) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 1) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 18) (11, 14) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 13) (14, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 9) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 17) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 16) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 13) (17, 15) (17, 18) (6, 0) (13, 14) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 19) (18, 12) (18, 0) (18, 17) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 16) (16, 14) (16, 10) (16, 19) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 1, 6)>
<2, (8, 7, 15)>
<3, (5, 0, 4)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<10, (14, 13, 16)>
<12, (8, 4, 18)>
<13, (14, 9, 19)>
<14, (11, 10, 16)>
<15, (2, 7, 17)>
<16, (14, 10, 19)>
<17, (15, 18, 17)>
<18, (12, 0, 17)>
<19, (13, 0, 16)>
