Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 3) 

Response:
There are 10 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 13, 14)>
<1, (0, 8, 10)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 10)>
<4, (2, 11, 14)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 10)>
<9, (2, 11, 14)>
<10, (1, 7, 11)>
<11, (4, 9, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
