Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 6) (4, 8) (4, 10) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 10, 14)>
<1, (3, 8, 13)>
<2, (0, 6, 12)>
<3, (1, 10, 11)>
<4, (8, 10, -)>
<5, (7, 9, 13)>
<6, (2, 11, 13)>
<7, (5, 8, 12)>
<8, (2, 4, 13)>
<9, (5, 7, 13)>
<10, (0, 1, 4)>
<11, (3, 6, 7)>
<12, (2, 7, 13)>
<13, (8, 11, 12)>
<14, (0, 5, -)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
