Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 12) (5, 14) (18, 13) (18, 8) (1, 15) (1, 11) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 2) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 14) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (10, 7) (10, 2) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 12) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 11) (3, 17) (3, 8) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (8, 18) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 12) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 16) (14, 8) (13, 18) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 11) (2, 6) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 17) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

<0, (15, 19, 12)>
<6, (9, 7, 2)>
<7, (6, 16, 14)>
<15, (1, 19, 0)>
<8, (18, 3, 14)>
<12, (9, 0, 19)>
<9, (6, 12, 17)>
<17, (6, 3, 11)>
