Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 12) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 29) (5, 9) (5, 28) (5, 27) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 19) (7, 20) (7, 24) (7, 19) (7, 26) (21, 13) (21, 11) (21, 15) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 14) (27, 5) (27, 12) (27, 24) (28, 5) (28, 2) (29, 22) (29, 25) (29, 15) (29, 14) (26, 13) (26, 7) (26, 10) (26, 25) (26, 4) (10, 26) (10, 1) (15, 9) (15, 21) (15, 29) (15, 14) (11, 9) (11, 21) (11, 23) (11, 24) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 24) (8, 20) (8, 18) (1, 10) (6, 14) (19, 22) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 2) (24, 7) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 23) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 4) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 29) (14, 15) (14, 6) (20, 7) (20, 8) (20, 4) (20, 16) (2, 28) (2, 19) (2, 17) (4, 26) (4, 23) (4, 17) (4, 20) (25, 29) (25, 26) (16, 20) (18, 13) (18, 8) (18, 17) 

Response:
There are 9 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 27, 28)>
<9, (5, 15, 11)>
<10, (26, 1, 13)>
<13, (22, 21, 12)>
<14, (5, 15, 6)>
<15, (9, 29, 14)>
<19, (22, 7, 2)>
<21, (13, 11, 15)>
<26, (13, 7, 10)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
