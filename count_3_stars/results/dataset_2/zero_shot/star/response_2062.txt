Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 26) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 23) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 20) (2, 7) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 5) (7, 2) (7, 21) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 28) (21, 7) (4, 7) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 25) (23, 9) (23, 15) (23, 19) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 17) (20, 2) (20, 29) (20, 0) (20, 1) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 24) (18, 28) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 1) (22, 6) (26, 6) (26, 25) (26, 17) (3, 9) (3, 13) (24, 0) (24, 18) (24, 12) (15, 23) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 23) (19, 25) (1, 20) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 27) (11, 1) (11, 12) (13, 3) (13, 28) (13, 27) (25, 8) (25, 26) (25, 19) (16, 17) (16, 10) (17, 0) (17, 26) (17, 16) (17, 12) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 28) (5, 29) (5, 18) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 16) (12, 24) (12, 11) (12, 17) (28, 7) (28, 18) (28, 13) (28, 27)
