Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 3-stars in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<6, (9, 7, 0)>
<9, (6, 1, 0)>
<1, (9, 3, 4)>
<3, (6, 1, 0)>
<4, (1, 5, 2)>
<8, (3, 5, 2)>
<5, (3, 8, 4)>
<2, (4, 8, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
