Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (9, 4, 1)>, <3, (4, 7, 2)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
