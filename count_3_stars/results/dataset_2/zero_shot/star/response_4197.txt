Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-star graphs in this given graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<2, (9, 8, 1)>
<8, (5, 2, 3)>
<0, (2, 7, 4)>
<7, (5, 9, 0)>
<1, (2, 8, 4)>
<3, (5, 9, 8)>
