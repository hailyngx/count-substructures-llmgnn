Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 0) (9, 21) (9, 13) (26, 9) (26, 25) (26, 11) (26, 4) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 18) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (4, 26) (4, 8) (4, 21) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 0) (28, 11) (28, 24) (29, 9) (29, 15) (6, 17) (6, 19) (11, 26) (11, 28) (11, 2) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 24) (5, 14) (25, 26) (25, 16) (25, 2) (15, 13) (15, 29) (15, 16) (15, 10) (16, 25) (16, 15) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 27) (20, 8) (2, 11) (2, 25) (22, 14) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 24) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 18) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 17) (24, 27) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 0) (14, 5) (14, 22) (14, 21) (18, 3) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 23) (23, 18) (27, 16) (27, 24) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 19) (21, 9) (21, 4) (21, 14) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 unique 3-stars. 

The 3-stars are:
<9, (26, 29, 0)>
<26, (9, 25, 11)>
<1, (3, 10, 0)>
<1, (3, 5, 18)>
<8, (13, 7, 20)>
<8, (13, 5, 18)>
<13, (9, 8, 15)>
<4, (26, 8, 21)>
<5, (3, 13, 12)>
<5, (3, 24, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
