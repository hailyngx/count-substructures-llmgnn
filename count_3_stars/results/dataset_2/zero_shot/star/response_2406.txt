Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<7, (9, 4, 8)>
