Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graph in this case is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<5, (9, 8, 1)>
<6, (9, 4, 2)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 0)>
<7, (9, 4, 8)>
<2, (6, 4, -)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (9, 6, 4)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 0)>
