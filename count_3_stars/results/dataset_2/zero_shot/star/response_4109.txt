Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 0) (9, 28) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 16) (26, 8) (13, 22) (13, 29) (13, 20) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 20) (22, 17) (2, 14) (2, 21) (2, 11) (29, 13) (29, 17) (29, 25) (0, 9) (0, 5) (27, 4) (27, 18) (27, 7) (27, 5) (20, 13) (20, 22) (20, 25) (20, 17) (25, 29) (25, 20) (25, 1) (25, 24) (17, 22) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 19) (17, 7) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 18) (28, 9) (28, 26) (4, 22) (4, 27) (4, 19) (4, 21) (3, 16) (21, 2) (21, 4) (21, 23) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 16) (10, 14) (15, 10) (15, 12) (5, 0) (5, 27) (5, 10) (5, 19) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 5) (14, 26) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 10) (1, 25) (1, 6) (1, 23) (6, 1) (8, 26) (8, 24) (8, 18) (23, 21) (23, 1) (23, 24) (24, 25) (24, 8) (24, 23) (7, 27) (7, 17) (18, 27) (18, 11) (18, 8) (16, 26) (16, 3) (16, 10) (12, 15) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph, let's identify and count them:

1. <4, (27, 21, 19)>
2. <5, (27, 0, 10)>
3. <6, (1, 23, 9)>
4. <7, (17, 27, 4)>
5. <8, (26, 24, 18)>
6. <11, (18, 2, 14)>
7. <12, (15, 6, 27)>
8. <13, (22, 29, 20)>
9. <16, (3, 26, 10)>
10. <17, (7, 22, 29)>
11. <19, (5, 4, 17)>
12. <24, (8, 23, 24)>
13. <25, (24, 1, 20)>
14. <28, (26, 9, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
