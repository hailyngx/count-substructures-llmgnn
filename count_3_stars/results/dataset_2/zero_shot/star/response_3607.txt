Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 16) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 5) (7, 17) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 5) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 13) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 18) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 17) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 17) (9, 13) (18, 1) (18, 13) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 17) (17, 7) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 8) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 17) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 18) 

Response:
