Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 24) (29, 28) (29, 0) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 21) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 13) (1, 10) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 15) (26, 20) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 24) (21, 11) (21, 27) (21, 22) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 14) (25, 15) (16, 28) (16, 19) (16, 27) (5, 26) (5, 12) (5, 0) (0, 29) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 24) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 23) (15, 26) (15, 25) (15, 8) (15, 24) (20, 26) (20, 13) (20, 22) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 22) (8, 15) (8, 14) (22, 6) (22, 21) (22, 20) (22, 14) (27, 21) (27, 16) (27, 17) (13, 18) (13, 20) (13, 4) (24, 2) (24, 28) (24, 0) (24, 15) (12, 6) (12, 18) (12, 5) (4, 13) (23, 3) (23, 17) (17, 27) (17, 23) (17, 19) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 17)
