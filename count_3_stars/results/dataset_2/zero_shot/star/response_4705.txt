Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 18) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 19) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 16) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 10) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 0) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 12) (2, 12) (2, 11) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 8) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 19) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 2) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 7) (19, 17) (19, 7) (10, 4) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-star graphs in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (15, 6, 9)>
<15, (3, 18, 17)>
<5, (6, 13, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 13)>
<4, (18, 9, 10)>
<18, (15, 5, 4)>
<0, (5, 18, 12)>
<2, (12, 11, 0)>
<13, (5, 6, 11)>
<1, (16, 9, 8)>
<14, (8, 7, 12)>
<7, (16, 11, 19)>
