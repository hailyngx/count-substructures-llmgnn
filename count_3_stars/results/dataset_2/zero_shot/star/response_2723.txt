Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 2, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
<4, (8, 0, 1)>
<8, (9, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 8, 6)>
<7, (8, 6, 2)>
<1, (4, 8, 6)>
<6, (4, 0, 7)>
<3, (9, 4, 2)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
