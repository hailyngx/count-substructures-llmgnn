Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars: 
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (7, 9, 0)>
<1, (4, 9, 8)>
