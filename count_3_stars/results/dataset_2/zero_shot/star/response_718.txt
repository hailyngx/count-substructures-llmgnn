Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (1, 7, 6)>
<9, (8, 4, 2)>
<6, (7, 3, 8)>
<0, (3, 2, 6)>
