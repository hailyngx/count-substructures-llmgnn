Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.

<3, (1, 9, 7)>
<4, (7, 9, 8)>
<4, (2, 8, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 1)>
<6, (1, 5, 0)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
