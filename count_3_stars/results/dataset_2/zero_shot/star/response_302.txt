Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The count is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<5, (9, 1, 7)>
<7, (5, 4, 6)>
<8, (9, 3, 1)>
