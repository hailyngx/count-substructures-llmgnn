Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

Below are the unique 3-stars found:
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 7, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
