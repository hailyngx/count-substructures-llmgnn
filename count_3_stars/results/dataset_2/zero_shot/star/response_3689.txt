Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 9) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 14) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 9) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 14) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (8, 6, 7)>
<4, (13, 2, 12)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<12, (4, 3, 0)>
