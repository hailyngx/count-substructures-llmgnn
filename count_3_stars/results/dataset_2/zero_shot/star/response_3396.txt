Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
So, the final answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 9, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (7, 2, 0)>
<0, (6, 1, 9)>
