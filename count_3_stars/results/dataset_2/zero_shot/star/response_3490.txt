Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 1, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (9, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 9, 8)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
