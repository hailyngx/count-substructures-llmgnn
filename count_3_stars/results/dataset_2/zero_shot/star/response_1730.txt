Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:

<1, (8, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 1)>
<4, (5, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
