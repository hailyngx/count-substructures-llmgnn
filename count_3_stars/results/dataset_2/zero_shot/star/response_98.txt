Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (4, 9) (4, 14) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are [10] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 2, 10)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (9, 10, 14)>
<10, (5, 6, 12)>
<11, (6, 1, 8)>
<12, (10, 11, 13)>
<0, (12, 2, 3)>
<2, (5, 0, 13)>
<8, (9, 11, 1)>
<1, (11, 7, 12)>
