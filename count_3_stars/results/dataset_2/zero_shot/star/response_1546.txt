Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 12) (4, 6) (4, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 2) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 13) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<6, (5, 10, 4)>
<9, (14, 7, 13)>
<1, (3, 14, 13)>
<10, (6, 11, 12)>
<11, (10, 13, 12)>
<7, (9, 1, 12)>
<12, (10, 11, 7)>
<5, (6, 0, 14)>
<0, (1, 3, 10)>
<14, (9, 1, 5)>
<8, (6, 7, 12)>
<4, (6, 13, 5)>
<13, (9, 1, 10)>
<2, (3, 11, 14)>

Therefore, there are [14] unique 3-stars in the graph.
