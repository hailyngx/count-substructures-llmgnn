Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 9) (21, 7) (21, 28) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 23) (22, 14) (22, 6) (22, 8) (23, 7) (23, 11) (23, 0) (0, 23) (0, 14) (0, 15) (20, 6) (20, 10) (20, 16) (14, 22) (14, 0) (14, 15) (14, 5) (17, 1) (17, 29) (17, 4) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 25) (28, 21) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 2) (5, 1) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 8) (13, 5) (13, 25) (8, 22) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 28) (9, 8) (11, 23) (11, 26) (11, 2) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 28) (2, 11) (2, 12) (6, 22) (6, 20) (6, 24) (24, 7) (24, 6) (24, 18) (24, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 26) (15, 18) (26, 11) (26, 15) (26, 27) (3, 4) (3, 18) (27, 29) (27, 26) (27, 19) (25, 29) (25, 13) (25, 16) (16, 1) (16, 20) (16, 25) (18, 24) (18, 15) (18, 3) (10, 20) (10, 24) (19, 28) (19, 27) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 9, 17)>
<14, (0, 5, 15)>
<22, (6, 8, 14)>
<23, (0, 11, 7)>
<24, (6, 10, 18)>
<28, (2, 9, 19)>
