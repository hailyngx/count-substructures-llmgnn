Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed below:

<4, (9, 6, 2)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 2)>
<3, (9, 1, 7)>
<6, (4, 1, 9)>
<9, (6, 3, 1)>

So, the answer is [6].
