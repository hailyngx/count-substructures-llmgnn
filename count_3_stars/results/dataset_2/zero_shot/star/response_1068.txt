Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. The final answer is [6].
The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 8, 1)>
<9, (5, 2, 6)>
<2, (9, 8, 1)>
<6, (1, 7, 3)>
<0, (6, 2, 3)>
<8, (5, 2, 7)>
