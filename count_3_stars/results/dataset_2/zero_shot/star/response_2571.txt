Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 11) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 2) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

<6, (5, 3, 9)>
<9, (6, 2, 1)>
<1, (9, 0, 3)>
<3, (6, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 13, 14)>
<7, (5, 11, 12)>
<12, (3, 7, 10)>
<2, (9, 13, 10)>
