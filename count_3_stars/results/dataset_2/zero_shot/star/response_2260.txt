Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 14) (12, 13) (12, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 3) (3, 0) (3, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 5) 

Response:
There are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 10, 6)>
<7, (4, 13, 1)>
<8, (13, 0, 1)>
<13, (7, 8, 5)>
<10, (4, 11, 6)>
<11, (8, 10, 5)>
<2, (8, 5, 0)>
<0, (4, 8, 2)>
<5, (13, 11, 2)>
<12, (13, 9, 0)>
<14, (8, 11, 5)>
<3, (0, 14, 1)>
<6, (4, 7, 10)>
<9, (7, 0, 12)>
<1, (7, 8, 13)>
