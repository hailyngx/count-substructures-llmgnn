Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <6, (5, 9, 7)>, and <1, (5, 2, 7)>.
