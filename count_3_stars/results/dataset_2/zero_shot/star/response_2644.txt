Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 18) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 19) (10, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (3, 12) (3, 18) (1, 11) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 17) (15, 4) (8, 9) (13, 6) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 5) (17, 15) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 15) (12, 11) (12, 3) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 19) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 19) (14, 19) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 14) (18, 16) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<11, (16, 1, 12)>
<16, (11, 7, 18)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 4)>
<15, (1, 17, 4)>
