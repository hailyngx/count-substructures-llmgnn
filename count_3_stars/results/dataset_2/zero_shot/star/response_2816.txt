Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 11) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 0) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 12) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 12, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 10)>
<3, (2, 4, 14)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (8, 1, 6)>
<6, (5, 4, 12)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (5, 10, 13)>
<9, (0, 7, 13)>
<10, (8, 2, 4)>
<11, (1, 12, 14)>
