Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count is [7].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (5, 1, 7)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<4, (5, 3, 0)>
<3, (5, 1, 4)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 6)>
