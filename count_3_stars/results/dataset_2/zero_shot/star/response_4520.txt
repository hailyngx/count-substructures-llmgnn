Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (11, 4, 12)>
<4, (6, 11, 1)>
<9, (2, 14, 10)>
<10, (9, 4, 12)>
