Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (9, 17) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 16) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 10) (13, 1) (13, 19) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 18) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 0) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 17) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 16) (2, 7) (2, 15) (2, 17) (12, 14) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 14) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 14) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 18) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 18) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 16) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 19) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by considering each node as the center of a potential 3-star and checking if it fulfills the criteria of being connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this case, the number of 3-stars can be found by counting the number of nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 

By examining the given edge set, we can find the nodes that satisfy this criteria:

Nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 8
- Node 9
- Node 10
- Node 11
- Node 16
- Node 18

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is the number of such nodes, which is 9. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (7, 1, 19)>
<5, (1, 13, 16)>
<6, (3, 8, 16)>
<8, (6, 7, 10)>
<9, (0, 11, 17)>
<10, (3, 8, 18)>
<11, (0, 3, 19)>
<16, (1, 6, 18)>
<18, (0, 10, 16)>

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
