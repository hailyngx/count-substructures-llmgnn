Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (6, 8, 3)>
<9, (8, 4, 0)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (4, 6, 2)>
<3, (5, 7, 0)>
