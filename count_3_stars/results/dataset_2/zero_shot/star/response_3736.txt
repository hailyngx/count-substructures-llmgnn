Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 15) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 3) (10, 6) (10, 13) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 11) (3, 19) (3, 17) (3, 16) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 11) (11, 0) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 17) (7, 18) (7, 14) (7, 15) (7, 13) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 7) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 12) (1, 19) (1, 4) (16, 2) (16, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by counting the occurrences of nodes that satisfy the definition of being the center node surrounded by exactly three other nodes. 

By analyzing the given edges, we find that the 3-stars are:

[<0, (9, 11, 17)>, <1, (4, 19, 3)>, <2, (5, 16, 15)>, <3, (19, 17, 16)>, <4, (14, 9, 1)>, <5, (6, 8, 2)>, <6, (10, 15, 5)>, <7, (18, 14, 15)>, <8, (19, 17, 5)>, <9, (18, 0, 4)>, <10, (6, 13, 15)>, <11, (19, 0, 17)>, <13, (12, 7, 10)>, <14, (18, 7, 4)>, <15, (6, 7, 2)>, <16, (5, 3, 2)>, <17, (19, 8, 11)>, <18, (15, 7, 9)>, <19, (8, 1, 3)>]

There are 19 unique 3-stars in total, so the answer is [19].
