Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 11) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 10) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 9) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 9) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 9) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars are <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 11, 12)>, <10, (0, 7, 12)>, and <13, (1, 3, 9)>.
