Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star graphs in this given graph. The number of 3-stars is [4].

Unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
<4, (3, 1, 2)>
<3, (5, 7, 6)>
