Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 1)
