Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 21) (7, 14) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 18) (21, 17) (21, 7) (22, 9) (22, 5) (22, 10) (23, 11) (23, 26) (23, 18) (9, 22) (9, 2) (9, 3) (26, 23) (26, 28) (26, 27) (28, 26) (28, 19) (28, 5) (28, 10) (28, 25) (20, 8) (20, 4) (20, 24) (6, 8) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 12) (16, 27) (11, 23) (11, 4) (11, 29) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 2) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 0) (1, 0) (1, 25) (1, 13) (29, 11) (29, 4) (29, 18) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 22) (5, 28) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 25) (27, 26) (27, 16) (18, 7) (18, 23) (18, 15) (18, 29) (18, 5) (8, 14) (8, 20) (8, 6) (19, 28) (19, 24) (25, 28) (25, 1) (25, 5) (12, 15) (12, 13) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 12) (24, 7) (24, 20) (24, 19) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 14) (4, 20) (4, 11) (4, 29) (4, 3) 

Response:
