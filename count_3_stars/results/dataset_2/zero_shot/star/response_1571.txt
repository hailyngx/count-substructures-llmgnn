Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (12, 5) (12, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 4, 10)>
<9, (5, 6, 11)>
<4, (5, 8, 13)>
<3, (9, 7, 10)>
<10, (5, 3, 11)>
<11, (9, 10, 0)>
<0, (10, 11, 8)>
