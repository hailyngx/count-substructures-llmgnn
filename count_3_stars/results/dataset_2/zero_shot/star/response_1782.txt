Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 10) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 10) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 7) 

Response:
