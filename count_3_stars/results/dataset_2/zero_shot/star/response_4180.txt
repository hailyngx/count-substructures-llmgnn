Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 17) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 16) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 18) (7, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 11) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 0) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 19) (1, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 0) (12, 8) (12, 19) (16, 9) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 6) (6, 15) (6, 14) (6, 19) (13, 15) (13, 2) 

Response:
The graph has a total of 7 unique 3-stars:
<3, (11, 4, 19)>
<15, (6, 13, 17)>
<5, (9, 2, 14)>
<9, (5, 16, 10)>
<4, (8, 3, 18)>
<17, (15, 18, 11)>
<2, (8, 13, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
