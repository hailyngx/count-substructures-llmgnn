Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The graph contains 3-star subgraphs. Let's count the number of 3-stars.

First, let's identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves:
- Node 1: (5, 8, 9)
- Node 4: (9, 3, 1)
- Node 6: (5, 0)
- Node 7: (9, 6, 0)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-star subgraphs:
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (9, 3, 1)>
- <6, (5, 0)>
- <7, (9, 6, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [4].
