Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 2) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 13) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 1) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 9) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 16) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 2) (8, 5) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 11) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 17) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 17) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 17) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [five] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (13, 1, 14)>
<2, (15, 2, 16)>
<6, (3, 6, 13)>
<9, (3, 9, 14)>
<12, (5, 12, 17)>
