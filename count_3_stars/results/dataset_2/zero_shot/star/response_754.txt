Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 12) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (10, 7) (10, 3) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 12) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

[7] 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 7, 12)>
<2, (0, 6, 14)>
<3, (0, 6, 13)>
<4, (7, 9, 12)>
<5, (3, 6, 13)>
<8, (5, 11, 12)>
<11, (1, 8, 14)>
