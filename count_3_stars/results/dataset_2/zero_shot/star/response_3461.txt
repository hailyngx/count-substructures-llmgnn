Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The center node must have 3 edges, forming a 3-star.
From the given edges, we find the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 7, 4)>
<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<3, (9, 1, 0)>
<4, (6, 7, 0)>
<7, (5, 6, 4)>
<2, (5, 9, 1)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 3, 4)>
Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [10].
