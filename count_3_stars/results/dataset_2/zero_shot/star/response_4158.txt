Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 1) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 3) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 3) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
