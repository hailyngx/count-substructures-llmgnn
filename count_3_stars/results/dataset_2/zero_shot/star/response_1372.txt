Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 6) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (1, 2, 11)>
<4, (0, 9, 12)>
<7, (1, 9, 11)>
<10, (2, 7, 11)>
<0, (4, 8, 14)>
<12, (3, 13, 14)>
<13, (1, 6, 10)>
<6, (2, 11, 13)>
