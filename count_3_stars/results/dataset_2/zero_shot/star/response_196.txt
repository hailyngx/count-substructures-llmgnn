Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 14) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 2) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 12) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 13) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
