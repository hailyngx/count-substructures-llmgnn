Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below:
<1, (3, 6, 10)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 12, 14)>
<13, (1, 2, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
