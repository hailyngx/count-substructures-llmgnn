Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the graph.
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<3, (9, 4, 6)>
