Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (6, 4, 7)>
<9, (8, 7, 0)>
