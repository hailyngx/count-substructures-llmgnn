Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 21) (7, 4) (7, 20) (7, 23) (7, 2) (18, 22) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 28) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 6) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 26) (3, 29) (25, 5) (25, 8) (25, 14) (25, 11) (12, 24) (12, 17) (27, 10) (27, 1) (8, 25) (8, 5) (24, 12) (24, 26) (24, 2) (24, 15) (26, 3) (26, 24) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 15) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 19) (20, 7) (20, 2) (20, 23) (9, 15) (29, 3) (29, 1) (29, 0) (19, 17) (19, 21) (1, 27) (1, 29) (1, 16) (6, 4) (6, 22) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 29) (0, 10) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 26) (10, 0) (23, 7) (23, 26) (23, 20) (28, 18) (28, 3) (28, 13) (15, 24) (15, 26) (15, 9) (2, 7) (2, 24) (2, 20) (2, 6) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 25) (5, 8) (5, 2) (16, 22) (16, 17) (16, 1) (21, 4) (21, 19) (13, 28) (11, 18) (11, 25) (14, 25) 

Response:
There are 14 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the answer is: [14]

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (6, 5, 21)>
<7, (2, 23, 20)>
<18, (11, 28, 10)>
<22, (6, 16, 18)>
<3, (6, 28, 29)>
<25, (8, 14, 11)>
<12, (17, 24, 16)>
<27, (1, 10, 18)>
<24, (2, 15, 26)>
<26, (15, 23, 10)>
<17, (19, 12, 16)>
<20, (2, 7, 23)>
<29, (0, 1, 3)>
<10, (0, 26, 27)>
