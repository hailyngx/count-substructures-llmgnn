Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 14) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (14, 10) (14, 5) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 three-star graphs in the given graph. Here they are listed with their central node and leaf nodes:

[<4, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 11, 12)>, <11, (2, 5, 13)>, <10, (0, 4, 14)>]
