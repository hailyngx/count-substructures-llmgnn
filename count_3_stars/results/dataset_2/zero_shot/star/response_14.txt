Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (3, 12) (15, 11) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 9) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 8) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 0) (19, 14) (19, 18) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 10) (9, 7) (9, 17) 

Response:
There are [<10>] 3-stars in the given graph.
Unique 3-stars: <0, (11, 13, 14)>, <1, (6, 7, 11)>, <2, (5, 12, 18)>, <3, (12, 16, 17)>, <4, (5, 7, 13)>, <5, (4, 6, 18)>, <7, (1, 4, 13)>, <9, (7, 9, 17)>, <10, (11, 16, 10)>, <14, (0, 13, 19)>
