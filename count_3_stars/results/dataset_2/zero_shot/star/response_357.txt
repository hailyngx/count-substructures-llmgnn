Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars present in the given graph. The count is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 6, 1)>
<7, (4, 9, 3)>
<6, (4, 9, 1)>
<9, (7, 6, 2)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (7, 9, 0)>
<5, (4, 2, 0)>
<2, (9, 3, 5)>
