Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (2, 4) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in this graph. 

<5, (6, 8, 0)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 1)>
<1, (6, 4, 0)>
<8, (5, 9, 6)>
