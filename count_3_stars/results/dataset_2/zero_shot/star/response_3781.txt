Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 1) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 22) (21, 24) (20, 1) (20, 26) (20, 13) (20, 10) (25, 6) (25, 18) (2, 22) (2, 11) (29, 22) (29, 18) (12, 7) (12, 15) (5, 13) (5, 10) (6, 25) (6, 24) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 8) (22, 21) (22, 2) (22, 29) (13, 20) (13, 5) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 26) (18, 25) (18, 29) (18, 26) (18, 3) (26, 20) (26, 0) (26, 18) (26, 17) (10, 21) (10, 20) (10, 5) (15, 12) (15, 17) (15, 28) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 27) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 23) (24, 21) (24, 6) (24, 11) (24, 27) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 24) (14, 1) (14, 23) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 17) (17, 26) (17, 15) (17, 3) (1, 7) (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 14) (28, 0) (28, 15) (23, 19) (23, 14) (27, 21) (27, 8) (27, 24) (16, 4) (16, 6) (16, 19) 

Response:
The central nodes in all 3-stars will be nodes that have exactly 3 unique neighbors. 
By examining the given graph, we find several such nodes: 4, 7, 21, 20, 25, 2, 29, 12, 5, 9, 13, 0, 18, 10, 28, 23, 27, and 16.

Now, let's list out the 3-stars:
<4, (7, 11, 16)>
<7, (4, 12, 0)>
<21, (10, 27, 22)>
<20, (1, 26, 13)>
<25, (6, 18, N)>
<2, (22, 11, N)>
<29, (22, 18, N)>
<12, (7, 15, N)>
<5, (13, 10, N)>
<9, (8, N, N)>
<13, (20, 5, N)>
<0, (7, 28, N)>
<18, (25, 29, N)>
<10, (21, 20, N)>
<28, (0, 15, N)>
<23, (19, 14, N)>
<27, (21, 8, N)>
<16, (4, 6, N)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [17] 3-stars in the graph.
