Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 28) (1, 4) (1, 9) (21, 13) (2, 22) (2, 7) (29, 27) (29, 11) (0, 27) (0, 24) (0, 19) (27, 29) (27, 0) (27, 14) (27, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 29) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 22) (5, 15) (6, 23) (6, 4) (20, 23) (20, 28) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 9) (22, 2) (22, 11) (25, 16) (25, 4) (23, 6) (23, 20) (23, 26) (26, 23) (26, 15) (26, 16) (26, 3) (26, 8) (14, 27) (14, 11) (14, 28) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 26) (15, 9) (13, 21) (13, 19) (13, 12) (13, 28) (7, 2) (7, 24) (7, 8) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 15) (9, 24) (9, 16) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 3) (24, 0) (24, 7) (24, 9) (8, 10) (8, 26) (8, 7) (8, 18) (28, 1) (28, 20) (28, 14) (28, 13) (16, 25) (16, 26) (16, 9) (3, 27) (3, 26) (3, 12) (3, 18) (3, 4) (18, 8) (18, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 25) (4, 3) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are: <0, (24, 27, 19)>, <1, (4, 9, 28)>, <2, (7, 11, 22)>, <3, (18, 26, 27)>, <4, (1, 6, 25)>, <8, (10, 18, 8)>, <9, (1, 15, 24)>, <11, (10, 14, 29)>, <13, (12, 19, 28)>, <16, (9, 25, 26)>, <20, (23, 28, 20)>
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
