Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: <5, (2, 12, 9)>, <0, (1, 11, 8)>
