Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 2) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 2) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 14) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 17) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 19) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 19) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 6) (14, 5) (14, 16) (14, 4) (7, 19) (7, 13) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 15) (19, 12) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 1) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 18) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 19) (8, 0) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 13) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (15, 9, 11)>
<2, (9, 11, 15)>
<4, (12, 14, 17)>
<4, (17, 14, 12)>
<5, (1, 14, 16)>
<5, (16, 14, 1)>
<6, (17, 18, 19)>
<11, (10, 13, 2)>
<13, (11, 12, 7)>
<15, (17, 18, 19)>
<16, (12, 14, 5)>
<17, (4, 6, 14)>
<18, (0, 13, 15)>
<19, (1, 12, 7)>

There are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
