Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 15) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 7) (8, 11) (8, 18) (13, 3) (13, 19) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 6) (0, 3) (0, 11) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 12) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 4) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 1) (3, 13) (3, 0) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 15) (7, 17) (4, 2) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 10) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 18) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<5, (1, 9, 16)>
<9, (5, 15, 1)>
<14, (6, 17, 19)>
<17, (2, 6, 12)>
<10, (1, 15, 16)>
<15, (6, 9, 10)>
<16, (5, 10, 12)>
<2, (4, 11, 17)>
<12, (1, 16, 17)>
<3, (0, 13, 19)>
<6, (10, 14, 15)>
<18, (8, 11, 12)>
<1, (10, 12, 5)>
<11, (0, 2, 8)>
<19, (13, 14, 10)>
As there are 15 unique 3-star graphs, the total number of 3-stars is [15].
