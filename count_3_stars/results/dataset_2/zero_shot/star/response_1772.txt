Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 18) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 18) (8, 16) (13, 15) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 19) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 15) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 12) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 15) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 11) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 9) (19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 9) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 19) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 5) (16, 8) (16, 5) 

Response:
There are 10 different 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars: 
<4, (2, 7, 11)>
<7, (1, 4, 17)>
<1, (3, 7, 10)>
<3, (1, 12, 18)>
<8, (16, 5, 6)>
<13, (15, 10, 12)>
<5, (6, 16, 18)>
<0, (2, 9, 12)>
<14, (10, 19, 14)>
<9, (0, 11, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
