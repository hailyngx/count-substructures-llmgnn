Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 15) (5, 16) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 19) (4, 1) (7, 3) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (2, 5) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 0) (18, 13) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 19) (14, 10) (14, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 18) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 4) (1, 0) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 16) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 12) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 0) (19, 17) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 17) (6, 17) (6, 12) (17, 19) (17, 16) (17, 6) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
