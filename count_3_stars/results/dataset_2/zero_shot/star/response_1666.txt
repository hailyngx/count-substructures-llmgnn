Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 14) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 13) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 3) 

Response:
The center node of a 3-star graph must have degree 3, meaning it must have exactly 3 adjacent nodes. 

In this graph, the nodes that meet this criteria are: 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 14. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each potential central node:

For node 5, the possible 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 11, 3)>
<5, (9, 11, 10)>
<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<5, (9, 4, 10)>
<5, (10, 11, 3)>
<5, (10, 11, 4)>
<5, (9, 4, 10)>
<5, (4, 11, 3)>
Total 3-stars for node 5 = 7

For node 7, the possible 3-stars are:
<7, (1, 11, 13)>
<7, (1, 11, 14)>
<7, (1, 6, 13)>
<7, (1, 6, 2)>
<7, (1, 6, 14)>
<7, (1, 2, 14)>
Total 3-stars for node 7 = 6

For node 8, the possible 3-stars are:
<8, (11, 0, 12)>
Total 3-stars for node 8 = 1

For node 10, the possible 3-stars are:
<10, (1, 11, 12)>
<10, (1, 11, 7)>
<10, (1, 4, 12)>
<10, (1, 4, 13)>
<10, (1, 4, 7)>
<10, (1, 7, 12)>
Total 3-stars for node 10 = 6

For node 11, the possible 3-stars are:
<11, (10, 7, 8)>
Total 3-stars for node 11 = 1

For node 14, the possible 3-stars are:
<14, (4, 7, 12)>
<14, (4, 7, 2)>
<14, (4, 12, 7)>
Total 3-stars for node 14 = 3

Adding up all the counts, the number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [24]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (9, 11, 3)>, <5, (9, 11, 10)>, <5, (9, 4, 10)>, <5, (4, 11, 3)>, 
<7, (1, 11, 13)>, <7, (1, 11, 14)>, <7, (1, 6, 13)>, <7, (1, 6, 2)>, <7, (1, 6, 14)>, 
<7, (1, 2, 14)>, <8, (11, 0, 12)>, 
<10, (1, 11, 12)>, <10, (1, 11, 7)>, <10, (1, 4, 12)>, <10, (1, 4, 13)>, <10, (1, 4, 7)>, <10, (1, 7, 12)>, 
<11, (10, 7, 8)>, 
<14, (4, 7, 12)>, <14, (4, 7, 2)>, <14, (4, 12, 7)>.
