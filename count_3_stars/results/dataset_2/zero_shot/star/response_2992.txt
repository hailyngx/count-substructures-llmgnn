Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 1) (17, 5) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 1) (18, 19) (18, 15) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 19) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 1) (15, 18) (15, 10) (15, 6) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 12) (7, 16) (7, 2) (7, 10) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 3) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 12) (9, 11) (1, 16) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 19)
