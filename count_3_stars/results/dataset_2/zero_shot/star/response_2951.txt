Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 14) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 1) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 2) (8, 16) (8, 19) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 0) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 18) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 19) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 1) (13, 12) (13, 1) (18, 11) (18, 0) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (17, 5)
