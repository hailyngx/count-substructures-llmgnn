Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 11) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 14) (10, 17) (10, 19) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 18) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 14) (4, 15) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 9) (12, 11) (19, 10) (19, 18) (11, 15) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (6, 14) (6, 16) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 6) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (15, 1, 17)>
<8, (13, 2, 9)>
<13, (15, 8, 16)>
<17, (3, 10, 4)>
<2, (1, 8, 17)>
<18, (2, 19, 9)>
