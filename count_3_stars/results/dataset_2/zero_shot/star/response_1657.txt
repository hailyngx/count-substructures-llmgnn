Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
There are [72] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<5, (9, 1, 3)>
<5, (9, 8, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (5, 3, 2)>
<3, (5, 1, 2)>
<3, (5, 1, 4)>
<4, (9, 6, 3)>
<8, (9, 6, 0)>
<8, (9, 0, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (9, 8, 6)>
<7, (9, 5, 8)>
