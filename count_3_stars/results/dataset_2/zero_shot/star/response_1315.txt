Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 18) (10, 15) (10, 16) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 19) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 11) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 13) (8, 18) (8, 6) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 19) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 15) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 5) (11, 2) (11, 1) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 16) (3, 13) (16, 10) (16, 3) (9, 0) (9, 13) (5, 4) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 13) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 6) 

Response:
There are [48] 3-star graphs in this given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 17, 18)>
<1, (5, 11, 14)>
<2, (3, 4, 11)>
<3, (2, 13, 17)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (8, 13, 6)>
<7, (12, 15, 19)>
<10, (15, 16, 10)>
<13, (3, 6, 9)>
<14, (0, 1, 12)>
<15, (7, 10, 19)>
<16, (10, 3, 16)>
<18, (0, 8, 19)>
