Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 11) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 10) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 1) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the 3-stars found:

<5, (6, 13, 3)>
<9, (8, 3, 12)>
<7, (12, 0, 10)>
<12, (9, 7, 6)>
<2, (8, 6, 3)>
<8, (9, 2, 10)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
