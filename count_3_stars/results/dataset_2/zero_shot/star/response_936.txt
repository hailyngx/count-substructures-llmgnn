Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The count of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<5, (6, 4, 1)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<1, (5, 3, 0)>
