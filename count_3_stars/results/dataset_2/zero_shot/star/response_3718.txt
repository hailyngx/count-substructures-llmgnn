Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 3) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 14) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 1) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are 9 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<5, (13, 8, 4)>
<9, (3, 8, 0)>
<4, (5, 8, 10)>
<8, (9, 4, 3)>
<7, (12, 0, 6)>
<12, (7, 13, 14)>
<6, (4, 7, 0)>
<0, (9, 7, 3)>
<2, (10, 14, 11)>

So, the final answer is [9].
