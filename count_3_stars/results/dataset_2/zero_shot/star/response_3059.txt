Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 15) (9, 6) (9, 8) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 10) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 8) (18, 14) (18, 13) (17, 15) (17, 1) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 10) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 2) (16, 4) (16, 2) (12, 8) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 11) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 12) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 10) (13, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 13) 

Response:
There are 11 3-stars in the graph. The unique 3-stars are: 
<3, (15, 2, 8)>
<15, (3, 9, 17)>
<9, (15, 6, 8)>
<1, (17, 14, 10)>
<4, (15, 13, 16)>
<7, (19, 14, 8)>
<18, (14, 13, 1)>
<5, (19, 11, 10)>
<19, (6, 7, 5)>
<8, (3, 9, 7)>
<13, (4, 18, 10)>
Therefore, the final answer is [11].
