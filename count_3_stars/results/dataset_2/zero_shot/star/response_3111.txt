Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 2, 7)>
<3, (5, 1, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 3)>
