Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here are the 3-stars listed within <>:
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (4, 8, 7)>  

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
