Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <5, (9, 8, 3)> and <1, (9, 6, 2)>.
