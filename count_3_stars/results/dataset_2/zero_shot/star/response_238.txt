Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (12, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 6) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 13) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 6) (13, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in this graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<10, (6, 7, 13)>
<11, (3, 14, 1)>
<4, (8, 6, 2)>
