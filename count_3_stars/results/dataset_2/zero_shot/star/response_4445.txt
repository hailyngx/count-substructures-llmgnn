Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 17) (12, 9) (12, 10) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 14) (19, 9) (19, 5) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 17) (8, 15) (8, 0) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 0) (2, 3) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 13) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 13) (13, 14) (13, 18) (13, 3) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 17) (17, 7) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 0) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 16) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 16) 

Response:
There are [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<6, (9, 1, 10)>
<9, (6, 12, 19)>
<10, (6, 9, 12)>
<11, (7, 4, 16)>
<7, (11, 15, 17)>
<15, (7, 8, 17)>
