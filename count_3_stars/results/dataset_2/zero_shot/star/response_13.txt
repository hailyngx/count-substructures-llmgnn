Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 13) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 22) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 24) (15, 3) (15, 5) (4, 8) (4, 12) (7, 16) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 22) (6, 18) (6, 23) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 27) (9, 23) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 22) (8, 18) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 25) (5, 0) (5, 10) (17, 3) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 27) (29, 17) (29, 1) (29, 21) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 10) (26, 20) (28, 19) (28, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 27) (2, 20) (24, 11) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 21) (19, 28) (19, 20) (14, 22) (14, 27) (22, 16) (22, 6) (22, 8) (22, 14) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 19) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 24) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 13) (27, 9) (27, 17) (27, 2) (27, 14) (25, 11) (25, 5) (10, 5) (10, 1) (13, 11) (13, 28) (13, 18) (23, 6) (23, 9) (23, 21) (21, 29) (21, 24) (21, 23) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<11, (16, 13, 24)>
<5, (15, 25, 0)>
<6, (9, 22, 23)>
<17, (3, 27, 29)>
