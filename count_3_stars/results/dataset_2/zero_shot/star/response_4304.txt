Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 15) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 16) (2, 8) (2, 15) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 4) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 18) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 4) (13, 14) (13, 3) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 19) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 12) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 19) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 15) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 16) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by looking at the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

The nodes that form 3-stars are: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 10, and 4
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 12, 13, and 14
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 15, and 17
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 15, and 18
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 6, 15, and 19

Therefore, there are 6 unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 10, 4)>, <3, (12, 13, 14)>, <7, (6, 15, 17)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <11, (10, 15, 18)>, <16, (6, 15, 19)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is therefore [6].
