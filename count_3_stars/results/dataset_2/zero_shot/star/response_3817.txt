Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 6) (1, 6) (1, 18) (3, 4) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 19) (2, 18) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 15) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 17) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 16) (16, 7) (16, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (17, 2) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 15) (19, 11) (19, 17) (8, 14) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 17) (0, 13) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<5, (9, 13, 11)>
<4, (7, 10, 15)>
<9, (5, 14, 12)>
<12, (9, 7, 13)>
<13, (5, 10, 12)>
<6, (7, 1, 17)>
