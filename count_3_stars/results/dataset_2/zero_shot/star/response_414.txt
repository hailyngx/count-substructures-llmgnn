Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
