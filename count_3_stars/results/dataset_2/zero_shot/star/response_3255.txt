Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<6, (9, 1, 2)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
<1, (6, 4, 8)>
<3, (7, 2, 4)>
<4, (9, 1, 3)>
<7, (9, 3, 2)>
<5, (6, 4, 0)>
<2, (6, 3, 7)>
