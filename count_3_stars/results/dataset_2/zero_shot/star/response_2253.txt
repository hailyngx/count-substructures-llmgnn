Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 12) (15, 2) (7, 19) (7, 5) (12, 15) (12, 1) (2, 3) (2, 15) (8, 1) (1, 12) (1, 8) (9, 10) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 18) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 14) (16, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 18) (11, 17) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 13) (17, 16) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 4) (14, 16) (14, 10) (14, 19) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 13) (4, 10) (4, 17) (18, 0) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 16) (5, 17) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 19) (13, 18) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the final answer is [8].

The 3-stars are:
<1, (12, 8, 15)>
<2, (3, 15, 5)>
<5, (3, 19, 7)>
<6, (17, 18, 19)>
<10, (4, 17, 14)>
<13, (10, 6, 19)>
<14, (16, 19, 10)>
<16, (0, 17, 5)>
