Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (2, 8, 4)>
<9, (7, 0, 3)>
<6, (7, 2, 8)>
<4, (5, 0, 3)>
<8, (5, 6, 2)>
<2, (5, 8, 1)>
<0, (9, 4, 1)>
<7, (9, 6, 1)>
