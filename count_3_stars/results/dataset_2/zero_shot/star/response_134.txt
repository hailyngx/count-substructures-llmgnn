Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 11) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 6) (7, 14) (7, 6) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 19) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 1) (1, 15) (1, 8) (1, 13) (19, 12) (19, 8) (16, 14) (16, 12) (16, 18) (0, 15) (0, 13) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 13) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 16) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 3-stars in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found: 

<5, (9, 10, 18)>
<15, (3, 0, 1)>
<14, (17, 7, 16)>

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
