Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 18) (2, 29) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 5) (29, 10) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 15) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 6) (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 5) (27, 22) (27, 28) (27, 1) (27, 19) (23, 8) (23, 5) (23, 21) (23, 10) (23, 24) (21, 23) (21, 20) (21, 4) (28, 27) (28, 24) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 25) (26, 3) (5, 29) (5, 0) (5, 23) (5, 15) (19, 27) (19, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 19) (9, 24) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 27) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 5) (4, 21) (22, 27) (22, 6) (10, 2) (10, 29) (10, 23) (10, 26) (3, 14) (3, 26) (3, 24) (7, 20) (20, 14) (20, 21) (20, 7) (20, 18) (24, 0) (24, 23) (24, 28) (24, 9) (24, 3) (12, 8) (25, 26) (25, 18) (6, 13) (6, 22) (18, 16) (18, 20) (18, 25) 

Response:
There are total of 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (16, 5, 24)>
<1, (2, 14, 27)>
<3, (14, 24, 26)>
<5, (29, 0, 23)>
<8, (23, 9, 13)>
<10, (26, 2, 23)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
