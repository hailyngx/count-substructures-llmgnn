Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (25, 3) (25, 17) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 16) (23, 28) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 5) (17, 25) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 2) (17, 26) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 24) (2, 28) (18, 12) (18, 8) (12, 18) (12, 24) (27, 9) (7, 15) (21, 9) (21, 29) (28, 23) (28, 2) (28, 29) (28, 11) (29, 21) (29, 28) (29, 16) (29, 4) (26, 17) (26, 13) (26, 24) (11, 28) (13, 1) (13, 26) (13, 9) (13, 14) (4, 3) (4, 22) (4, 29) (24, 2) (24, 12) (24, 26) (24, 15) (5, 10) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 8) (19, 20) (16, 23) (16, 29) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 9) (8, 22) (8, 18) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 20) (15, 7) (15, 24) (15, 20) (9, 17) (9, 27) (9, 21) (9, 13) (9, 14) (20, 19) (20, 8) (20, 15) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (25, 1, 0)>
<10, (17, 2, 5)>
<17, (25, 10, 9)>
