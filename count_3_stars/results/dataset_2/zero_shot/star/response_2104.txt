Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 3) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 7) (3, 5) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 10) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 4) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 2) (1, 8) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 10) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 1) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 10) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 12) (4, 0) (4, 16) (12, 10) (12, 16) (7, 9) (7, 16) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 7) (16, 2) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 6) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 11) (2, 14) (2, 16) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the graph. So, the answer is [4].

<3, (5, 15, 17)>
<8, (1, 13, 19)>
<10, (1, 9, 19)>
<16, (2, 4, 7)>
