Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) 

Response:
The center nodes in the 3-stars can be any node with degree three. Using the given edge list, we find the three-star structures:

<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (8, 2, 3)>
<1, (9, 3, 2)>
<3, (5, 9, 1)>
<4, (3, 8, 2)>
<8, (9, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 8, 7)>
<0, (9, 8, 6)>

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [8].
