Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 0) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 8, 13)>
<0, (7, 10, 14)>
<1, (3, 11, 14)>
<2, (5, 11, 13)>
<2, (4, 10, 14)>
<3, (1, 8, 11)>
<4, (9, 6, 14)>
<5, (13, 2, 7)>
<6, (4, 10, 14)>
<7, (5, 0, 12)>
<9, (4, 2, 12)>
<10, (8, 13, 2)>
<11, (1, 2, 4)>
<12, (7, 9, 11)>
<13, (5, 8, 10)>
<14, (1, 6, 7)>
