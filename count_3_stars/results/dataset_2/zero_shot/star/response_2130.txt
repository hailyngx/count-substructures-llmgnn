Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 13) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 9) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 9) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

<4, (2, 8, 10)>
<8, (4, 7, 14)>
<12, (2, 9, 14)>
<5, (0, 6, 10)>
<13, (1, 3, 11)>
<1, (9, 13, 14)>
