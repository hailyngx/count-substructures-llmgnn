Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 18) (4, 8) (4, 18) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 17) (5, 15) (5, 10) (19, 0) (19, 9) (9, 8) (9, 19) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 16) (0, 19) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (16, 1) (16, 6) (14, 9) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 15) (7, 18) (7, 17) (7, 13) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 7) (11, 18) (11, 9) (11, 12) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 12) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
