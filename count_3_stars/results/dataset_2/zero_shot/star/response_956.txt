Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 0) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 7) (17, 16) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 19) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 15) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 18) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 19) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 9) (11, 17) (11, 3) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 7) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 5) (18, 0) (18, 14) (1, 6) (1, 13) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 2) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 15) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 2) (13, 6) (13, 1) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 9, 14)>
<3, (0, 9, 15)>
<4, (3, 5, 19)>
<5, (4, 7, 12)>
<6, (1, 12, 13)>
<7, (5, 10, 17)>
