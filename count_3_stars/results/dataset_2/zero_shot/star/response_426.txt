Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 0) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 9, 14)>
<1, (6, 9, 13)>
<5, (3, 11, 12)>
<8, (6, 7, 12)>
<10, (4, 11, 14)>
<14, (4, 10, 2)>
