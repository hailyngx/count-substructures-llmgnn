Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<1, (7, 9, 5)>
<3, (4, 6, 0)>
<5, (4, 7, 1)>
<6, (9, 8, 5)>
<7, (4, 8, 5)>
<8, (7, 6, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
