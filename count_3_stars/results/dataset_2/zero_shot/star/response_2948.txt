Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 19) (5, 0) (9, 15) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (1, 11) (1, 3) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 13) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 2) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 8) (18, 4) (18, 10) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 17) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 19) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 15) (6, 0) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 8) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 17) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 15) (13, 4) (13, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 total 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<11, (14, 1, 16)>
<4, (13, 3, 7)>
<10, (18, 2, 17)>
<0, (6, 16, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
