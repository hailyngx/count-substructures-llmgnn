Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 2, 3)>
<5, (6, 0, 3)>
<9, (5, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 6, 3)>
<7, (0, 6, 1)>
<8, (0, 6, 1)>
