Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 14) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 6) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 8) 

Response:
There are [10] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 2, 13)>
<9, (5, 2, 11)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 1, 8)>
<1, (4, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 8, 6)>
<8, (4, 3, 10)>
<0, (9, 14, 12)>
<14, (0, 11, 12)>
<13, (5, 4, 12)>
