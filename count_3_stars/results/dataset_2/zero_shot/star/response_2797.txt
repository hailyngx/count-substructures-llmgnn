Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 8) (14, 12) (14, 9) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 18) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 18) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 13) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (5, 2) (5, 16) (6, 13) (6, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 16) (15, 7) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 13) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 18) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 10) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

<4, (9, 19, 11)>
<8, (10, 17, 0)>
<7, (12, 15, 19)>
<12, (7, 14, 9)>
<3, (11, 2, 18)>
<1, (17, 16, 18)>
<13, (17, 15, 19)>
<5, (2, 9, 16)>
