Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
[12]
