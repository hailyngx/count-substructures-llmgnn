Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 10) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 10, 12)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 13)>
<3, (1, 11, 14)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (2, 6, 13)>
<11, (3, 7, 14)>
