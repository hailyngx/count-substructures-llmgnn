Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] nodes and [40] edges in the given graph. To count the number of 3-stars, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:
<1, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (9, 1, 8)>
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<4, (8, 0, 1)>
<7, (9, 3, 1)>
<6, (5, 1, 2)>
<8, (9, 4, 6)>
<3, (7, 0, 2)>
<0, (5, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. The unique 3-stars are <1, (5, 4, 7)>, <2, (9, 1, 8)>, <5, (9, 6, 0)>, <9, (5, 8, 2)>, <4, (8, 0, 1)>, <7, (9, 3, 1)>, <6, (5, 1, 2)>, <8, (9, 4, 6)>, <3, (7, 0, 2)>, and <0, (5, 4, 8)>.
