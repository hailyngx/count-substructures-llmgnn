Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
<1, (9, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 0)>
<4, (5, 3, 2)>
<8, (1, 3, 2)>
