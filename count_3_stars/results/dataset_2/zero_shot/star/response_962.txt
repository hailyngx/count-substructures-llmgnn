Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
