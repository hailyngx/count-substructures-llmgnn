Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 7) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
<11, (1, 4, 12)>
<12, (9, 3, 0)>
<13, (8, 7, 14)>
<14, (9, 10, 13)>
<2, (8, 4, 7)>
<3, (9, 12, 0)>
<4, (5, 11, 8)>
<5, (10, 4, 3)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
