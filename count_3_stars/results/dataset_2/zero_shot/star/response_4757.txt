Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
