Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 17) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 18) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 16) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 11) (15, 16) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 13) (0, 3) (0, 2) (10, 1) (10, 7) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 2) (16, 12) (16, 15) (16, 17) (16, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 16) (17, 9) (17, 16) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 19) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (14, 19, 13)>
<5, (11, 2, 3)>
<7, (10, 11, 2)>
<9, (17, 16, 18)>
<14, (6, 1, 4)>
<16, (15, 12, 17)>
<18, (8, 9, 13)>
<19, (4, 1, 13)>
<2, (16, 5, 7)>
<13, (4, 18, 19)>
