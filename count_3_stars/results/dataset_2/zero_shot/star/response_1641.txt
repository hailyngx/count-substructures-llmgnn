Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 19) (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (17, 5) (17, 7) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 11) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 13) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 11) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 11) (7, 8) (7, 17) (7, 10) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 12) (18, 1) (18, 5) (18, 0) (12, 15) (12, 0) (12, 11) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 19) (11, 15) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 16) 

Response:
