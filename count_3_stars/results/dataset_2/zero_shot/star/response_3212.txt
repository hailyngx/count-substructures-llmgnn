Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 12) (17, 15) (17, 11) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 18) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 18) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (18, 12) (18, 0) (18, 5) (19, 13) (19, 2) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 5) (16, 1) (16, 4) (16, 5) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 16) (4, 6) (2, 14) (2, 10) (2, 19) (6, 11) (6, 4) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 16) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<14, (3, 1, 4)>
<17, (12, 15, 11)>
<1, (3, 16, 0)>
<3, (14, 1, 0)>
<9, (3, 8, 4)>
<12, (17, 1, 7)>
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
