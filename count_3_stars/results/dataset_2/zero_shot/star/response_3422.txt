Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are 8 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<5, (9, 1, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (9, 3, 6)>
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<8, (5, 9, 6)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
