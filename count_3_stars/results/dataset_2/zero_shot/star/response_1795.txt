Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

<0, (9, 3, 8)>
<3, (5, 9, 1)>
<4, (5, 0, 6)>
<5, (9, 4, 7)>
<6, (8, 4, 7)>
<7, (5, 8, 6)>
<8, (4, 8, 0)>
<9, (1, 9, 5)>
