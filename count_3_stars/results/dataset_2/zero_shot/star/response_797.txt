Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
There are <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 2, 4)>, <4, (1, 6, 3)>, <7, (5, 3, 2)>, <6, (5, 4, 1)>, <2, (9, 7, 1)>, <8, (5, 7, 3)>, and <0, (5, 6, 1)>.

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
