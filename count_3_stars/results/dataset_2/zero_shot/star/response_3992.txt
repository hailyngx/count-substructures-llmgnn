Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 10) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 3) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by determining the number of nodes that can be at the center of a 3-star. Once we determine this count, we can calculate the number of unique 3-stars we can form using the given graph.

The possible centers of 3-stars in this graph are nodes 9, 10, 4, 8, 0, 14, 3, 13, and 1. Since each 3-star consists of a central node and three leaves, we need to check the number of edges each potential central node has to see if they form 3-stars.

- Node 9 has 8 edges, so <9, (5, 8, 7)> forms a 3-star.
- Node 10 has 5 edges, so <10, (11, 0, 8)> forms a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 6 edges, so <4, (9, 10, 8)> forms a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 6 edges, so <8, (5, 9, 10)> forms a 3-star.
- Node 0 has 5 edges, so <0, (10, 4, 7)> forms a 3-star.
- Node 14 has 6 edges, so <14, (4, 12, 6)> forms a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 edges, so <3, (12, 0, 13)> forms a 3-star.
- Node 13 has 5 edges, so <13, (9, 10, 3)> forms a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 edges, so <1, (9, 8, 14)> forms a 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
