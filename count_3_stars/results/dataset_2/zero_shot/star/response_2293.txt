Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<5, (2, 1, 3)>
<9, (6, 8, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 6)>
<7, (6, 4, 9)>
