Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 6) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 3) (11, 9) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 0) (13, 18) (10, 5) (10, 7) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 17) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 4) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 6) (4, 2) (4, 17) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 14) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 9) (9, 11) (9, 18) (9, 7) (0, 3) (0, 13) (1, 2) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 12) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 16) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 9) 

Response:
Since each 3-star contains a central node and three leaves, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars based on the given edges:

1. Node 2 is connected to 1, 6, and 7: <<2, (1, 6, 7)>>
2. Node 8 is connected to 6, 15, and 19: <<8, (6, 15, 19)>>
3. Node 3 is connected to 0, 11, and 14: <<3, (0, 11, 14)>>
4. Node 11 is connected to 3, 9, and 14: <<11, (3, 9, 14)>>
5. Node 5 is connected to 10, 13, and 17: <<5, (10, 13, 17)>>
6. Node 13 is connected to 0, 5, and 18: <<13, (0, 5, 18)>>
7. Node 10 is connected to 5, 7, and 17: <<10, (5, 7, 17)>>
8. Node 15 is connected to 8, 14, and 17: <<15, (8, 14, 17)>>
9. Node 17 is connected to 4, 5, and 16: <<17, (4, 5, 16)>>
10. Node 19 is connected to 6, 8, and 18: <<19, (6, 8, 18)>>
11. Node 4 is connected to 2, 12, and 17: <<4, (2, 12, 17)>>
12. Node 12 is connected to 4, 14, and 17: <<12, (4, 14, 17)>>
13. Node 18 is connected to 9, 13, and 19: <<18, (9, 13, 19)>>
14. Node 9 is connected to 7, 11, and 18: <<9, (7, 11, 18)>>
15. Node 1 is connected to 2 only: <<1, (2)>>

Therefore, there are 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph, and the count of 3-stars is [15].
