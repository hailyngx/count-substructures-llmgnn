Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 22) (10, 9) (10, 5) (17, 10) (4, 27) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 7) (6, 28) (6, 1) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 0) (29, 21) (29, 11) (26, 28) (26, 0) (26, 27) (27, 4) (27, 26) (27, 25) (27, 14) (18, 24) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 25) (15, 1) (15, 25) (15, 12) (9, 10) (9, 24) (9, 13) (9, 12) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 23) (25, 27) (25, 1) (25, 15) (25, 2) (16, 8) (16, 22) (16, 3) (16, 5) (21, 29) (21, 14) (24, 18) (24, 9) (24, 12) (3, 4) (3, 16) (3, 0) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 22) (2, 13) (2, 25) (2, 11) (5, 10) (5, 16) (0, 28) (0, 26) (0, 3) (11, 29) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 22) (19, 20) (19, 12) (19, 23) (20, 19) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 24) (12, 19) (22, 10) (22, 16) (22, 7) (22, 11) (14, 27) (14, 21) (23, 13) (23, 19) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
<10, (17, 8, 9)>
<4, (27, 13, 1)>
<8, (10, 16, 7)>
<6, (28, 1, 26)>
<29, (21, 11, 14)>
<26, (28, 0, 27)>
<27, (4, 26, 25)>
<18, (24, 9, 12)>
<1, (4, 6, 15)>
<15, (1, 25, 12)>
<9, (10, 24, 13)>
<13, (4, 9, 2)>
<25, (27, 1, 15)>
<16, (8, 22, 5)>
<21, (29, 14, 11)>
<24, (18, 9, 12)>
<3, (4, 16, 0)>
<7, (8, 22, 11)>
<2, (13, 25, 11)>
<5, (10, 16, 0)>
<0, (28, 26, 3)>
<11, (29, 7, 22)>
<19, (20, 12, 23)>
<20, (19, 12, 23)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
