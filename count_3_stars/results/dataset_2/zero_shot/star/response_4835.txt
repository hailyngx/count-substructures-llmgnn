Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 11) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 10) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 10)>
<5, (2, 13, 14)>
<7, (4, 12, 14)>
