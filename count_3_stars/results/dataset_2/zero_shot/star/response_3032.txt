Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 4) (15, 7) (15, 14) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (18, 10) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 16) (6, 10) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 18) (10, 6) (10, 0) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 19) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 9) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 13) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 9) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 9) (12, 19) (12, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 9) (9, 1) (9, 16) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 19) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
Unique 3-stars:
<3, (4, 16, 19)>
<4, (0, 14, 2)>
<7, (1, 2, 15)>
<10, (0, 6, 18)>
<5, (8, 11, 16)>
<13, (0, 2, 11)>
<17, (16, 19, 3)>
<9, (12, 14, 19)>
