Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (18, 4) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (0, 13) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 16) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 11) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 0) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 2) (14, 11) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 9) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 5) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 2) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 6) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 16) (5, 16) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 12) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (3, 15, 13)>
<17, (1, 7, 19)>
<11, (15, 14, 19)>
<2, (1, 6, 19)>
