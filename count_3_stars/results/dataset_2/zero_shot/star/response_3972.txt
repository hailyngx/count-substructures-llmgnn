Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph:  
<0, (5, 8, 7)>  
<1, (9, 4, 8)>  
<2, (7, 0, 6)>  
<3, (7, 2, 6)>  
<4, (9, 8, 6)>  
<5, (9, 8, 0)>  
<6, (4, 3, 2)>  
<7, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
