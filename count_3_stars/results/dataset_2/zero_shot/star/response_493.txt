Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
Unique 3-stars: 
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
