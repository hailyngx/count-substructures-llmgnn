Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 4) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 5) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 1) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 9) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<7, (3, 8, 13)>
<12, (4, 5, 14)>
<0, (5, 8, 14)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<11, (1, 8, 13)>
<10, (3, 4, 5)>
