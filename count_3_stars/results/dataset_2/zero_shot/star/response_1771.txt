Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (16, 9) (16, 5) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 29) (27, 0) (27, 6) (27, 13) (27, 8) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 26) (2, 10) (2, 25) (29, 0) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 15) (12, 17) (12, 3) (12, 26) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 17) (5, 16) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 11) (6, 27) (6, 5) (8, 27) (8, 23) (8, 4) (23, 8) (23, 3) (21, 28) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 4) (28, 21) (28, 22) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 21) (26, 2) (26, 12) (26, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 19) (20, 21) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 25) (25, 2) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 22) (1, 25) (1, 14) (1, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 9) (15, 29) (15, 19) (19, 29) (19, 17) (19, 15) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 23) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 3) (22, 21) (22, 28) (22, 25) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 10) (13, 27) (13, 3)
