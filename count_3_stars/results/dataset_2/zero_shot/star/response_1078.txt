Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
