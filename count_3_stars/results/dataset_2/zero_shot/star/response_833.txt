Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 14) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
[There are 6 3-stars in the given graph.]

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (3, 9, 2)>
<3, (1, 13, 14)>
<10, (4, 11, 13)>
<14, (7, 2, 12)>
<5, (0, 13, 12)>
<12, (8, 14, 5)>
