Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (9, 1, 0)>
<5, (6, 3, 8)>
<6, (9, 5, 2)>
<8, (1, 5, 2)>
