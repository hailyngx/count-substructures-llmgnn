Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (12, 11) (12, 2) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) 

Response:
[<0, (9, 4, 10)>, <1, (5, 9, 14)>, <2, (9, 7, 10)>]
