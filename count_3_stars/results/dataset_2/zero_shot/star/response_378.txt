Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [9]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (9, 8, 6)>
<2, (5, 4, 7)>
<3, (8, 7, 0)>
<4, (6, 5, 2)>
<6, (4, 6, 1)>
<7, (9, 7, 0)>
<8, (8, 1, 7)>
<9, (1, 9, 7)>
