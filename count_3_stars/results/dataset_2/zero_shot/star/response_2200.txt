Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 12) (16, 17) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 18) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (19, 18) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (18, 14) (18, 19) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 1) (12, 16) (12, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 4) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 4) (2, 3) (15, 13) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 4) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 13, 14)>
<1, (4, 12, 13)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 17)>
<5, (0, 10, 13)>
<6, (0, 7, 17)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (9, 13, 14)>
<11, (4, 14, 17)>
<12, (1, 13, 16)>
<13, (0, 8, 5)>
<14, (0, 8, 11)>
