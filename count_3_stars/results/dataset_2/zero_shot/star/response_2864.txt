Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 13) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 13) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 7) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<8, (4, 9, 5)>
<7, (1, 10, 13)>
<2, (5, 14, 9)>
<6, (5, 10, 11)>
