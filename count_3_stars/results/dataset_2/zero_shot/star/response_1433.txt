Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 14) (4, 19) (4, 13) (8, 5) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 10) (18, 15) (18, 7) (1, 17) (1, 7) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 11) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 1) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 16) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 12) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 3) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 5) (11, 0) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 12) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 16) (10, 14) (10, 16) (16, 13) (16, 5) (16, 10) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 15) (12, 11)
