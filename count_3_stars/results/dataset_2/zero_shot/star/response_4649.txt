Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 9) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 4) (9, 14) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 4) (11, 2) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 3) (0, 14) (0, 17) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 16) (18, 12) (1, 4) (1, 19) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 8) (19, 5) (19, 1) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 3) (7, 17) (7, 2) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 4) (16, 2) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 12) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 3) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (14, 17, 9)>
<9, (14, 6, 15)>
<10, (11, 16, 15)>
<11, (9, 2, 4)>
<4, (6, 1, 16)>
<5, (10, 19, 3)>
<12, (18, 8, 2)>
<13, (9, 10, 3)>
