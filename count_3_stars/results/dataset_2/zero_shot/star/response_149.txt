Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 13) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 13) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 0) (5, 12) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 13) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12]. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 1, 3)>
<9, (6, 4, 7)>
<1, (6, 3, 2)>
<3, (6, 1, 10)>
<4, (9, 8, 2)>
<8, (4, 2, 14)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 11, 5)>
<14, (8, 7, 13)>
<7, (9, 8, 14)>
<12, (6, 1, 13)>
<13, (2, 7, 10)>
