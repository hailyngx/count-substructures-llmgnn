This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0)
