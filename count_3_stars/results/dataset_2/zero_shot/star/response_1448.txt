Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (7, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
There are 6 total 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<5, (6, 0, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 0)>
<6, (9, 5, 2)>
<1, (5, 0, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the answer is [6].
