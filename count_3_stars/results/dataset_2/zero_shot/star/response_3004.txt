Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 10) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
