Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 13) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 1) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 1) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<6, (9, 11, 12)>
<9, (6, 3, 7)>
<0, (9, 3, 8)>
<14, (11, 8, 4)>
<13, (14, 2, 1)>
<7, (9, 10, 1)>
<4, (14, 12, 3)>
<12, (6, 4, 2)>
<1, (13, 7, 4)>
<2, (5, 13, 12)>
<11, (6, 5, 14)>
<3, (9, 0, 4)>
<8, (6, 14, 1)>
<10, (5, 7, 4)>

There are 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [14].
