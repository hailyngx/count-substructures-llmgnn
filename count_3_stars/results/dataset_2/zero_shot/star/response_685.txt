Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 5) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 19) (17, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 16) (8, 11) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 19) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 6) (5, 15) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 16) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 19) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 0) (6, 1) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 9) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 9) (19, 14) (16, 8) (16, 13) (14, 19) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

[4]

Unique 3-stars: 
<3, (6, 15, 18)>
<10, (1, 4, 13)>
<7, (0, 2, 12)>
<18, (4, 6, 7)>
