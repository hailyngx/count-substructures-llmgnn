Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 5) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 10) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 9) (2, 16) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 2) (18, 3) (18, 8) (3, 18) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 6) (15, 1) (15, 0) (8, 18) (8, 19) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 12) (12, 4) (12, 19) (12, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 6) (10, 14) (10, 2) (5, 16) (5, 4) (13, 16) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) 

Response:
There are 120 triangles in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<11, (1, 9, 16)>
<16, (2, 5, 11)>
<14, (10, 13, 18)>
<4, (5, 6, 13)>
<7, (9, 4, 19)>
<2, (0, 10, 16)>
<18, (3, 8, 14)>
<3, (13, 18, 4)>
<1, (6, 11, 15)>
<15, (0, 1, 15)>
<8, (18, 19, 8)>
<19, (0, 7, 12)>
<12, (9, 12, 19)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<0, (2, 6, 15)>
<10, (14, 2, 10)>
<5, (4, 5, 16)>
<13, (3, 4, 14)>
<9, (7, 11, 12)> 

Therefore, the total count of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
