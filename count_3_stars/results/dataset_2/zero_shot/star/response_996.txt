Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 12) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 6) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 0) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 10) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 10) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 14) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 13, 14)>
<9, (2, 1, 7)>
<12, (7, 8, 0)>
<14, (1, 3, 10)>
