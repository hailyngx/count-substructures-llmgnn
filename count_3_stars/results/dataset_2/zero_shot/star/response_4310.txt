Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations within this graph. Let's count them:

1. Node 5 can be the center of a 3-star, connected to nodes 9, 6, and 8. <5, (9, 6, 8)>
2. Node 9 can be the center of a 3-star, connected to nodes 5, 1, and 2. <9, (5, 1, 2)>
3. Node 4 can be the center of a 3-star, connected to nodes 5, 7, and 1. <4, (5, 7, 1)>
4. Node 7 can be the center of a 3-star, connected to nodes 9, 4, and 8. <7, (9, 4, 8)>
5. Node 1 can be the center of a 3-star, connected to nodes 9, 4, and 3. <1, (9, 4, 3)>
6. Node 3 can be the center of a 3-star, connected to nodes 5, 1, and 2. <3, (5, 1, 2)>
7. Node 8 can be the center of a 3-star, connected to nodes 5, 7, and 2. <8, (5, 7, 2)>
8. Node 6 can be the center of a 3-star, connected to nodes 5, 1, and 0. <6, (5, 1, 0)>
9. Node 2 can be the center of a 3-star, connected to nodes 9, 4, and 3. <2, (9, 4, 3)>
10. Node 0 can be the center of a 3-star, connected to nodes 5, 8, and 2. <0, (5, 8, 2)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the graph.
