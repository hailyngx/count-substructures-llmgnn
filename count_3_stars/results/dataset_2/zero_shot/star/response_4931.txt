Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 0) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 10) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 10) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<6, (1, 7, 12)>
