Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 12) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (7, 12, 13)>
<1, (9, 3, 10)>
<2, (5, 9, 6)>
<3, (1, 11, 14)>
<4, (9, 12, 7)>
<5, (2, 10, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (4, 12, 0)>
<8, (12, 11, 2)>
<9, (1, 4, 13)>
<10, (5, 1, 14)>
<11, (7, 3, 12)>
<12, (4, 8, 0)>
<13, (9, 0, 14)>
<14, (7, 11, 3)>
