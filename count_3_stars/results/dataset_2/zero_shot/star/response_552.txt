Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, and <6, (0, 7, 8)> 3-stars in the given graph. 
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
