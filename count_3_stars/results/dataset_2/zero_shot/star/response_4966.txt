Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<4, (5, 1, 6)>
<8, (9, 0, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 2)>
<6, (4, 8, 5)>
<0, (8, 7, 3)>
