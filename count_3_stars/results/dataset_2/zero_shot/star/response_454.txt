Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 16) (6, 17) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 18) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 17) (8, 9) (8, 13) (13, 6) (13, 8) (1, 3) (1, 15) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 14) (16, 15) (16, 14) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 19) (17, 6) (17, 11) (17, 19) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 2) (14, 18) (14, 16) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 17) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<3, (1, 0, 4)>
<6, (17, 12, 19)>
<9, (8, 4, 10)>
<4, (3, 9, 7)>
<7, (10, 4, 18)>
<11, (17, 10, 5)>
