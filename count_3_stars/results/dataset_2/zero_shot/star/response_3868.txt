Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (17, 16) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 13) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 15) (13, 18) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 4) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 12) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 0) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 2) (19, 1) (19, 11) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 2) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 9) (8, 1) (8, 18) (7, 15) (9, 14) (9, 11) (9, 2) (18, 5) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 8) (0, 12) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (19, 2, 8)>
<3, (4, 16, 5)>
<5, (6, 13, 18)>
<13, (6, 18, 5)>
<14, (12, 11, 9)>
<15, (10, 7, 4)>
Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
