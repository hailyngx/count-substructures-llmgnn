Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 14) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 10) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (10, 2, 3)>
<1, (2, 8, 11)>
<4, (8, 9, 10)>
<12, (6, 7, 13)>
