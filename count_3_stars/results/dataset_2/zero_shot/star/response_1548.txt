Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are: 

<5, (9, 8, 7)>
<5, (4, 8, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<4, (5, 8, 3)>
<7, (5, 3, 1)>
<1, (7, 3, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
