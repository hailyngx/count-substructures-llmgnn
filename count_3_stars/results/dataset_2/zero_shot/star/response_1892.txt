Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
[<- (5, 9, 6), <5, (1, 4, 0)>, <9, (3, 7, 2)>, <4, (8, 5, 0)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (5, 2, 0)>, <3, (9, 7, 6)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>]
