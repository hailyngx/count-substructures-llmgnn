Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 13) (5, 6) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 13) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (9, 5, 8)>
<9, (6, 4, 3)>
<8, (6, 0, 14)>
<13, (11, 14, 2)>
