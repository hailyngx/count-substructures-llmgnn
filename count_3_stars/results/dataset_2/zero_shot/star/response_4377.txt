Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 17) (4, 1) (4, 6) (18, 11) (18, 0) (1, 4) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 16) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 11) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 10) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 12) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 6) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 12) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 14) (11, 18) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 8) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 15) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 7) (13, 2) (13, 0) (7, 8) (7, 10) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations present in the given graph. Let's count them:

1. <3, (15, 14, 16)>
2. <15, (3, 9, 17)>
3. <1, (4, 17, 11)>
4. <5, (19, 2, 10)>
5. <19, (5, 2, 12)>
6. <12, (16, 6, 19)>
7. <2, (5, 19, 10)>
8. <11, (18, 1, 17)>
9. <14, (3, 2, 8)>
10. <8, (11, 14, 0)>
11. <6, (4, 12, 0)>
12. <10, (5, 2, 7)>
13. <13, (2, 0, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
