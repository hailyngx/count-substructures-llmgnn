Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 20) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 10) (13, 22) (13, 24) (13, 7) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 25) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 6) (29, 15) (18, 28) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 2) (10, 14) (23, 22) (23, 2) (23, 3) (23, 21) (23, 0) (12, 27) (12, 15) (27, 12) (27, 3) (3, 23) (3, 27) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 9) (25, 22) (25, 3) (0, 23) (0, 24) (6, 29) (6, 1) (6, 19) (28, 18) (28, 3) (5, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (20, 11) (20, 29) (20, 1) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 15) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 21) (19, 17) (14, 10) (14, 26) (14, 4) (14, 15) (26, 14) (26, 21) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 20) (1, 24) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 9) (24, 13) (24, 0) (24, 8) (24, 1) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 21) (15, 29) (15, 12) (15, 8) (15, 14) (21, 23) (21, 19) (21, 26) (21, 9) (4, 16) (4, 14) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

- <2, (29, 10, 23)>
- <3, (27, 25, 23)>
- <5, (8, 19, 6)>
- <7, (1, 13, 20)>
- <9, (21, 9, 17)>
- <12, (15, 27, 12)>
- <26, (21, 14, 26)>
- <28, (3, 18, 28)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
