Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 10) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 12) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 11) (5, 12) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) 

Response:
There are a total of  [15] nodes in the graph and we can find the number of 3-stars by inspecting the given edges and counting the occurrences of the central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (9, 1, 10)>
<9, (6, 8, 14)>
<1, (6, 2, ##)>
<3, (9, 5, 4)>
<0, (7, 11, 5)>
<14, (9, 10, ##)>
<11, (0, 13, 5)>
<7, (0, 8, 13)>
<8, (9, 0, 11)>
<4, (3, 11, 12)>
<12, (6, 4, 13)>
<2, (9, 1, 12)>
<5, (3, 0, 11)>
<13, (6, 11, 7)>
<10, (6, 14, ##)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
