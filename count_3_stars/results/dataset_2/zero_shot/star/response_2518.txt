Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 4, 0)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
