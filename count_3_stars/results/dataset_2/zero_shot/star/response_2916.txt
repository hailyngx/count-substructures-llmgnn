Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 29) (26, 16) (26, 3) (1, 15) (1, 4) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 15) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 16) (8, 18) (8, 10) (8, 11) (2, 18) (2, 23) (28, 14) (28, 24) (17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 12) (29, 26) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 25) (3, 26) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 27) (11, 8) (11, 3) (15, 1) (15, 21) (15, 19) (20, 7) (20, 14) (7, 20) (7, 19) (25, 29) (25, 5) (16, 26) (16, 4) (16, 24) (0, 22) (0, 17) (10, 22) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 5) (6, 24) (6, 23) (6, 12) (24, 9) (24, 28) (24, 16) (24, 6) (24, 27) (19, 15) (19, 7) (13, 21) (13, 14) (5, 22) (5, 25) (5, 10) (5, 23) (23, 21) (23, 2) (23, 6) (23, 5) (27, 22) (27, 29) (27, 3) (27, 24) (14, 28) (14, 20) (14, 13) (12, 17) (12, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph can be calculated based on the number of nodes. Since each 3-star requires a center node and three connected leaf nodes, we can count the number of such configurations.

There are a total of 30 nodes in the graph, and each 3-star has 4 nodes (1 center node + 3 leaf nodes). We can calculate the total number of 3-stars as follows:

Number of 3-stars = (Total number of nodes) - 1 - 3 = 30 - 1 - 3 = 26

Hence, there are 26 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

[26] 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<9, (26, 24, 29)>
<26, (9, 16, 3)>
<1, (15, 4, 21)>
<21, (13, 23, 15)>
<18, (22, 2, 8)>
<22, (18, 27, 5)>
<4, (1, 10, 16)>
<8, (18, 10, 11)>
<2, (18, 23, 0)>
<17, (29, 3, 0)>
<29, (26, 17, 27)>
<3, (26, 17, 11)>
<11, (8, 3, 10)>
<15, (1, 21, 19)>
<20, (7, 14, 28)>
<7, (20, 19, 13)>
<25, (29, 5, 23)>
<16, (26, 4, 24)>
<0, (22, 17, 10)>
<10, (22, 4, 8)>
<6, (24, 23, 12)>
<24, (9, 28, 16)>
<19, (15, 7, 13)>
<13, (21, 14, 19)>
<5, (22, 25, 10)>
<23, (21, 2, 6)>
<27, (22, 29, 3)>
<14, (28, 20, 13)>

These are the unique 3-stars present in the given graph.
