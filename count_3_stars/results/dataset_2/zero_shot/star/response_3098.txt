Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 6) (0, 12) (0, 19) (14, 6) (2, 12) (2, 19) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 1) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 10) (4, 1) (18, 4) (18, 3) (3, 11) (3, 18) (3, 17) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 4) (15, 8) (15, 10) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 15) (10, 7) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 6) (9, 16) (7, 10) (7, 13) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 19) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 5) (5, 8) (5, 17) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 13) (13, 16) (13, 7) (13, 19) 

Response:
