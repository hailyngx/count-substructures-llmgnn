Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is written inside brackets as [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 4, 1)>
<9, (5, 2, 3)>
<4, (5, 0, 1)>
<7, (9, 0, 6)>
<3, (9, 4, 0)>
