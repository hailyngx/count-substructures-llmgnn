Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) 

Response:
There are [2] unique 3-stars in the given graph.

<4, (7, 3, 2)>
<7, (4, 1, 5)>
