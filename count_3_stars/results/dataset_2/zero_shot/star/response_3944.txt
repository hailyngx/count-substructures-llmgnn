Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 6) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 6) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 6) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<5, (2, 12, 4)>, <9, (8, 11, 13)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is:
[2]
