Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<7, (4, 0, 6)>
