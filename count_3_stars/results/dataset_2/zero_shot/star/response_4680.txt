Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 11) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (11, 15) (11, 9) (0, 5) (0, 13) (7, 10) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 12) (17, 16) (4, 15) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 18) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 4) (19, 18) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (8, 5) (8, 10) (16, 3) (16, 6) (16, 17) (16, 2) (2, 9) (2, 16) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
Unique 3-stars: <<3, (1, 14, 16)>, <15, (4, 10, 11)>, <6, (5, 12, 16)>, <9, (2, 11, 14)>>.
