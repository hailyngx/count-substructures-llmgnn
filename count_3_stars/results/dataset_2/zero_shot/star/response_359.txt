Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 2) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (3, 7, 13)>
<8, (3, 11, 13)>
<12, (3, 4, 5)>
<10, (6, 9, 13)>
