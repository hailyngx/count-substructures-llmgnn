Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. The final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 8, 3)>
<7, (4, 9, 2)>
<6, (1, 0, 9)>
<9, (7, 2, 0)>
<8, (4, 7, 5)>
<5, (8, 1, -)>
Note: Node 5's last leaf is represented as "-" because it is not connected to any node in the given edges information.
