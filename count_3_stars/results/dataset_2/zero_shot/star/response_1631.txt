Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 4) (13, 9) (13, 12) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<6, (14, 10, 12)>
<9, (8, 14, 13)>
<1, (3, 5, 10)>
<0, (1, 8, 10)>
