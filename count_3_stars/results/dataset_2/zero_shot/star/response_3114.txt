Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 10) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 19) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 7) (17, 9) (17, 14) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 18) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 19) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 6) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 12) (19, 16) (19, 9) (19, 4) (0, 1) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 6) (6, 18) (6, 15) (6, 12) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (5, 8, 13)>
<4, (11, 16, 19)>
<6, (12, 15, 18)>
