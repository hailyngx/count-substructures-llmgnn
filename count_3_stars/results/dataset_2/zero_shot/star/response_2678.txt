Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 13) (10, 7) (10, 1) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 13) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 16) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 12) (0, 3) (0, 18) (16, 13) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 0) (7, 10) (7, 11) (14, 5) (14, 15) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 15) (4, 17) (4, 1) (4, 19) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 14) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<6, (9, 11, 8)>
<13, (9, 11, 5)>
<1, (10, 4, 12)>
<15, (19, 14, 2)>
<18, (17, 5, 0)>
<16, (13, 5, 0)>
<7, (10, 11, 7)>
<19, (15, 18, 4)>
