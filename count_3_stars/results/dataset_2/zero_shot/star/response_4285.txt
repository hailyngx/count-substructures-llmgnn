Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (2, 1) (2, 8) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 0) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 12) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<1, (2, 14, 5)>, <4, (3, 7, 11)>, <5, (1, 14, 13)>, <6, (7, 9, 10)>, <8, (7, 13, 2)>, <10, (5, 6, 12)>, <11, (4, 8, 9)>, <12, (10, 5, 0)>, <13, (4, 8, 10)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
