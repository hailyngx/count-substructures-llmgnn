Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 13) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 11) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 5) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 6) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (11, 14, 10)>
<7, (12, 0, 9)>
<12, (2, 11, 13)>
<2, (9, 13, 10)>
<8, (9, 5, 0)>
<5, (13, 11, 4)>
<13, (12, 5, 14)>
<0, (8, 5, 4)>
<4, (5, 0, 9)>
