Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 12) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 12) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (13, 7) (13, 9) (10, 2) (10, 7) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.

<2, (8, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 8, 2)>
<0, (4, 3, 7)>
<3, (8, 2, 11)>
<11, (8, 3, 14)>
<7, (3, 0, 10)>
<1, (11, 7, 14)>
<6, (2, 0, 1)>
<14, (11, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 13, 12)>
