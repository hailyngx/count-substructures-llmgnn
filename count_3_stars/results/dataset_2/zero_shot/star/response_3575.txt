Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 15) (1, 16) (1, 12) (3, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 7) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 15) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 9) (7, 13) (7, 0) (17, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 15) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 19) (19, 0) (19, 4) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 15) (18, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 18) (9, 0) (9, 17) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 15) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 2) 

Response:
There are 8 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are: 
<11, (16, 5, 4)>
<16, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (12, 3, 0)>
<3, (2, 15, 0)>
<8, (14, 10, 0)>
<13, (12, 7, 0)>
<6, (14, 10, 15)>
<17, (9, 0, 13)>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
