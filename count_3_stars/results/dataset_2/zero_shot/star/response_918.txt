Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 0) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 12) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (2, 8, 10)>, <1, (5, 12, 14)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 11)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 13, 14)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (2, 4, 11)>, <8, (0, 2, 12)>, <9, (1, 13, 14)>, <10, (0, 11, 12)>, <11, (7, 10, 12)>, <12, (5, 10, 11)>, <13, (5, 9, 11)>, <14, (0, 1, 5)>]
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
