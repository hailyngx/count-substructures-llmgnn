Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 11) (22, 0) (22, 25) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 12) (26, 10) (26, 11) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 24) (7, 21) (7, 19) (7, 5) (21, 7) (21, 10) (0, 13) (0, 22) (0, 27) (0, 11) (27, 0) (27, 14) (3, 25) (3, 8) (25, 22) (25, 3) (25, 12) (8, 3) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 18) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 17) (4, 22) (4, 8) (4, 23) (28, 6) (28, 18) (28, 20) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 10) (15, 10) (15, 2) (10, 26) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 15) (20, 28) (20, 29) (20, 12) (29, 20) (18, 8) (18, 28) (18, 19) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 24) (24, 6) (24, 19) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 0) (11, 8) (2, 15) (2, 5) (2, 14) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 17) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 14) (17, 23) (17, 5) (17, 16) (12, 9) (12, 25) (12, 20) (14, 27) (14, 2) (14, 16)
