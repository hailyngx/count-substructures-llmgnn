Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (2, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 1)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 0, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 3)>
<0, (9, 6, 8)>
