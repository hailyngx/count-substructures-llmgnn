Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 10) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 14) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 4) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 13) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 10) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 11, 13)>
<1, (8, 11, 14)>
<2, (9, 3, 14)>
<3, (5, 2, 11)>
<4, (12, 3, 10)>
<5, (6, 3, 10)>
<6, (5, 7, 10)>
<7, (6, 0, 14)>
<8, (9, 5, 11)>
<9, (8, 2, 0)>
<10, (6, 4, 13)>
<11, (8, 3, 1)>
