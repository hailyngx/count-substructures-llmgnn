Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 2) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 4) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 1) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 5) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 5) (13, 17) (13, 1) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (19, 14) (19, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 6) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 3) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 0) (5, 12) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 6) (14, 4) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 4) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
  
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 12)>
<3, (7, 9, 16)>
<4, (1, 14, 17)>
<5, (0, 12, 15)>
<9, (11, 14, 3)>
<14, (4, 6, 9)>
<17, (10, 13, 15)>
