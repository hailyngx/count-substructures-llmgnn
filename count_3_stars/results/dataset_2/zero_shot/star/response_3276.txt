Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 4) (17, 14) (17, 1) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 14) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 15) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 1) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 19) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 15) (8, 4) (1, 17) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 13) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 19) (16, 1) (16, 12) (16, 3) (12, 13) (12, 16) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 13) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 16) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 11, 15)>
<14, (10, 17, 19)>
<17, (1, 4, 14)>
<18, (0, 1, 5)>
<1, (13, 15, 16)>
