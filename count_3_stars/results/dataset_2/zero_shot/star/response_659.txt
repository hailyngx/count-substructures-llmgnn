Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<9, (5, 1, 6)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<1, (9, 2, 4)>
<3, (6, 2, 0)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<7, (6, 4, 8)>
<8, (6, 1, 0)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (5, 9, 7)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
