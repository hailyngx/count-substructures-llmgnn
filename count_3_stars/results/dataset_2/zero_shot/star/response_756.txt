Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 6) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 8) (17, 18) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 15) (0, 5) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 19) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 1) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 10) (7, 16) (7, 10) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 6) (3, 4) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 15) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 15) (10, 14) (10, 9) (10, 7) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 12) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 1) (1, 0) (1, 19) (1, 12) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count of 3-stars is [4].
The unique 3-stars are:
<9, (8, 18, 10)>
<6, (8, 16, 15)>
<4, (11, 3, 15)>
<12, (11, 14, 1)>
