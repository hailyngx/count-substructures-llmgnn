Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 24) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 20) (8, 10) (8, 21) (8, 26) (23, 25) (23, 0) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 13) (20, 3) (20, 15) (17, 27) (17, 26) (29, 6) (29, 21) (29, 18) (4, 28) (18, 29) (18, 27) (18, 0) (18, 28) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 5) (26, 8) (26, 17) (26, 22) (26, 24) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 22) (9, 0) (24, 1) (24, 26) (24, 25) (0, 23) (0, 18) (0, 9) (0, 5) (7, 25) (7, 10) (25, 23) (25, 24) (25, 7) (25, 2) (21, 8) (21, 29) (21, 28) (21, 13) (21, 27) (28, 4) (28, 18) (28, 21) (28, 19) (12, 16) (12, 14) (16, 12) (16, 5) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (13, 15) (13, 21) (13, 11) (6, 29) (6, 22) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 2) (19, 28) (19, 14) (19, 27) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 16) (27, 17) (27, 18) (27, 21) (27, 19) (10, 8) (10, 7) (2, 25) (2, 11) (2, 14) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, and they are as follows:

1. <1, (9, 15, 24)>
2. <18, (0, 27, 28)>
3. <21, (8, 13, 29)>
4. <25, (2, 7, 24)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
