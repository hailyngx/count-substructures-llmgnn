Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 14) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 23) (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 18) (1, 26) (1, 11) (1, 4) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 0) (23, 27) (23, 22) (23, 9) (14, 15) (14, 4) (17, 2) (0, 27) (0, 22) (2, 17) (2, 29) (2, 10) (2, 25) (29, 27) (29, 2) (29, 12) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 8) (12, 29) (12, 13) (12, 9) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 20) (21, 28) (21, 13) (28, 15) (28, 21) (28, 9) (28, 19) (13, 12) (13, 21) (13, 11) (24, 26) (24, 5) (24, 10) (24, 19) (25, 2) (25, 8) (25, 18) (18, 3) (18, 25) (18, 9) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 20) (6, 3) (6, 22) (6, 7) (19, 28) (19, 24) (19, 11) (19, 10) (9, 23) (9, 12) (9, 28) (9, 18) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 19) (11, 4) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 16) (10, 2) (10, 24) (10, 19) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 7) (8, 25) (5, 24) (5, 16) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (4, 11, 13)>
<2, (17, 25, 29)>
<3, (6, 16, 18)>
<15, (14, 27, 28)>
<20, (7, 16, 26)>
<23, (9, 22, 27)>
<24, (10, 19, 26)>
<25, (2, 8, 18)>
