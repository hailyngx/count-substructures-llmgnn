Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, (9, 1, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 7)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)> 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, there are [3] total 3-stars in the graph.
