Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 4) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 16) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 18) (7, 1) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 13) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 6) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 5) (8, 15) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 8) (19, 2) (19, 16) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 17) (16, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 17) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 2) (5, 15) (5, 14) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 17) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

<3, (9, 15, 4)>
<15, (16, 5, 13)>
