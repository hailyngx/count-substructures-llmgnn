Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 three stars in the given graph. Here they are listed within brackets:

[6]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
