Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 13) (14, 17) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 2) (8, 19) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 0) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 4) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 16) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 6) (0, 13) (0, 18) (0, 6) (5, 16) (15, 13) (15, 10) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 9) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 9) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 19) (9, 16) (18, 7) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 0) 

Response:
There are 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 16, 3)>
<7, (4, 6, 18)>
<14, (17, 18, 6)>
<17, (14, 6, 2)>
<8, (19, 1, 2)>
<13, (7, 15, 0)>
<1, (11, 19, 18)>
<10, (11, 15, 16)>
<0, (13, 18, 6)>
<5, (16, 4, 12)>
<19, (8, 1, 9)>
<2, (4, 17, 19)>
<12, (2, 16, 5)>
<16, (4, 10, 12)>
<6, (7, 17, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [15].
