Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<5, (9, 8, 4)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<4, (5, 7, 0)>
<7, (9, 4, 0)>
<0, (5, 4, 2)>
<1, (9, 7, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 2)>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
