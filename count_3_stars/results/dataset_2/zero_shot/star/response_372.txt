Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 18) (4, 19) (18, 3) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 12) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 10) (8, 19) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 15) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 10) (6, 16) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 12) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 17) (15, 19) (15, 8) (14, 5) (14, 8) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 12) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 9) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 7, 17)>
<1, (3, 7, 11)>
<2, (3, 7, 12)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (13, 14, 19)>
<8, (14, 15, 19)>
<9, (10, 11, 19)>
<9, (10, 19, 8)>
