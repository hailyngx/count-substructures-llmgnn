Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 0) (0, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<4, (8, 9, 14)>
<8, (4, 2, 5)>
<7, (12, 11, 14)>
<12, (7, 13, 1)>
<2, (8, 10, 0)>
<5, (8, 11, 10)>
<13, (12, 9, 14)>
<9, (4, 8, 13)>
<0, (2, 10, 6)>
<10, (2, 5, 0)>
<11, (4, 7, 2)>
<14, (4, 7, 13)>
<3, (8, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 12, 10)>
<6, (8, 13, 0)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
