Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<4, (7, 8, 2)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<6, (7, 1, 8)>
