Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count of 3-stars is [4].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (5, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
