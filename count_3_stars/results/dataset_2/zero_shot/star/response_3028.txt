Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star must have exactly three neighbors. Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <6, (1, 7, 4)>
2. <9, (1, 8, 6)>
3. <4, (7, 8, 6)>
4. <7, (0, 2, 6)>
5. <8, (1, 4, 9)>
6. <5, (1, 3, 4)>
7. <0, (2, 3, 7)>
8. <3, (0, 4, 5)>
9. <2, (0, 1, 7)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final count is [9].
