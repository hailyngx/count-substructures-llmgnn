Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <5, (9, 6, 0)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>, <4, (7, 8, 0)>, <7, (9, 4, 6)>, <1, (7, 3, 2)>, and <3, (1, 8, 0)>.
Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
