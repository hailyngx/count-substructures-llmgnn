Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 9) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 12) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (15, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 3) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (16, 4) (16, 7) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 6) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (6, 18) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 2) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 12) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 19) (10, 12) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 10) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 11) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding all nodes with exactly three edges and considering them as the central nodes. 
After analyzing the graph:

- Node 4 is a central node with leaves 9, 5, and 16
- Node 17 is a central node with leaves 13, 6, and 5
- Node 7 is a central node with leaves 16, 3, and 6
- Node 13 is a central node with leaves 1, 17, and 19
- Node 12 is a central node with leaves 18, 11, and 19
- Node 2 is a central node with leaves 14, 3, and 19

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:
<4, (9, 5, 16)>, <17, (13, 6, 5)>, <7, (16, 3, 6)>, <13, (1, 17, 19)>, <12, (18, 11, 19)>, <2, (14, 3, 19)>

There are a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the graph.
