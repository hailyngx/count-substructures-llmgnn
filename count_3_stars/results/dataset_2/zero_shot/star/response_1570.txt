Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 4) (14, 15) (17, 0) (17, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 7) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 10) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 18) (11, 0) (11, 15) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 2) (15, 14) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 12) (18, 3) (18, 19) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 12) (7, 13) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 4) (16, 9) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 9) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 16) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 19) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 9) (9, 3) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <8, (13, 5, 16)>, <13, (8, 19, 7)>, <3, (13, 10, 18)>, and <10, (6, 15, 2)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
