Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (14, 6) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 10) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 11) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

<3, (6, 9, 1)>
<5, (6, 13, 1)>
<6, (13, 9, 12)>
<9, (6, 5, 3)>
<10, (1, 0, 12)>
<12, (6, 9, 13)>
<13, (5, 12, 9)>
<4, (0, 9, 10)>
