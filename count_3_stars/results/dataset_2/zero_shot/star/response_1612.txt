Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<7, (9, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 2)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (9, 4, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 1)>
<0, (5, 3, 6)>
