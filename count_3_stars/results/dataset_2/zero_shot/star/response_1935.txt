Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 5) (11, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 12) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 1) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 10)>
<10, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (7, 10, 13)>
