Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 11) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<5, (9, 13, 0)>
<9, (5, 2, 11)>
<4, (8, 0, 14)>
<7, (6, 8, 2)>
<10, (6, 12, 1)>
<11, (9, 3, 1)>
<8, (4, 7, 12)>
<13, (5, 7, 11)>
