Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 12) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 1) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 9) 

Response:
The total number of possible 3-stars can be calculated by finding the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. Looking at the given edges:

- Node 1 has 6 edges connected to it.
- Node 2 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 3 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 4 has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 5 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 6 has 5 edges connected to it.
- Node 7 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 8 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 9 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 10 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 11 has 6 edges connected to it.
- Node 12 has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 13 has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 14 has 5 edges connected to it.

Thus, nodes 4, 12, and 13 are the only nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them, making them the centers of potential 3-stars. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<4, (7, 5, 3)>, <12, (14, 6, 11)>, <13, (1, 3, 9)>

The final answer is 3, thus outputting [3].
