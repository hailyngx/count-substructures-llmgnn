Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<7, (6, 9, 4)>
<5, (6, 4, 8)>
<2, (9, 4, 1)>
<3, (7, 5, 2)>
