Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 1) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (8, 13) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 19) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 17) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 18) (15, 16) (15, 18) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 19) (6, 14) (6, 12) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 1) (19, 10) (19, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 15) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 12) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<13, (0, 17, 8)>
<10, (11, 1, 18)>
<16, (4, 15, 17)>
<1, (9, 10, 12)>
<4, (16, 3, 13)>
