Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 11) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 5) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (10, 8) (10, 12) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 2) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 11) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (0, 2, 13)>
<6, (3, 7, 14)>
<7, (1, 12, 0)>
<12, (2, 8, 10)>
