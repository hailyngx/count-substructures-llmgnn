Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 23) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 3) (26, 0) (3, 26) (3, 24) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 29) (15, 21) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 21) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 28) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 5) (17, 2) (21, 15) (21, 6) (21, 10) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 28) (16, 1) (16, 28) (16, 22) (16, 27) (28, 10) (28, 1) (28, 16) (28, 25) (13, 17) (13, 23) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 20) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 4) (25, 28) (25, 0) (25, 22) (0, 26) (0, 25) (11, 19) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 22) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 20) (23, 9) (23, 13) (23, 18) (7, 11) (7, 18) (24, 3) (24, 8) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 7) (12, 29) (20, 8) (20, 14) (20, 2) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 29) (29, 15) (29, 12) (29, 4) (27, 16) (5, 17) (22, 16) (22, 25) (22, 11) (2, 17) (2, 20) 

Response:
There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<9, (26, 6, 8)>
<26, (3, 0, 9)>
<3, (26, 24, 18)>
<15, (1, 6, 29)>
<6, (9, 15, 21)>
<10, (17, 21, 28)>
<17, (10, 13, 5)>
<21, (15, 6, 10)>
<1, (15, 16, 28)>
<16, (1, 28, 22)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
