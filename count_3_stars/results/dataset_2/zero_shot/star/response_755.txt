Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 2) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count is as follows: [7]

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (0, 11, 7)>
<9, (2, 14, 10)>
<4, (5, 14, 11)>
<8, (1, 10, 5)>
<3, (11, 12, 0)>
<12, (7, 5, 3)>
<0, (1, 10, 6)>
