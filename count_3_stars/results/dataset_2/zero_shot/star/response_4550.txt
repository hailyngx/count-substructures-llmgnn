Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 18) (6, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (3, 8) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 17) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 15) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 11) (17, 12) (10, 15) (10, 1) (15, 8) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 16) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 19) (7, 9) (7, 1) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 16) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 17) (18, 6) (18, 13) (18, 1) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 18) (2, 15) (2, 16) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (12, 1, 9)>
<8, (9, 11, 6)>
<11, (13, 19, 8)>
