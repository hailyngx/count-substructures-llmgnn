Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 12) (9, 10) (9, 8) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 14) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 6)
