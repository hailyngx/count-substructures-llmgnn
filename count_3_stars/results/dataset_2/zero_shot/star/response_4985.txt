Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 17) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 8) (10, 17) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 3) (11, 19) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 12) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 5) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 18) (18, 16) (18, 9) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 12) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 2) (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 14) (2, 14) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 9)
