Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (7, 6, 0)>
