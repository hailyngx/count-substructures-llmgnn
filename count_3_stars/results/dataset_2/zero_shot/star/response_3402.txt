Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are 8 [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (8, 6, 2)>
<1, (4, 7, 3)>
<2, (6, 9, 5)>
<3, (1, 7, 0)>
<4, (9, 6, 1)>
<5, (2, 4, 3)>
<6, (9, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 4, 7)>
