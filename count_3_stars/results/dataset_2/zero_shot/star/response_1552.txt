Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 14) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 7) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 9) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:
[<1, (5, 7, 13)>, <3, (0, 9, 14)>, <10, (0, 11, 12)>, <11, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (8, 11, 12)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 13)>, <6, (3, 5, 14)>, <2, (0, 7, 13)>, <13, (5, 7, 12)>, <12, (5, 10, 13)>, <0, (2, 3, 10)>, <14, (3, 6, 12)>, <9, (3, 7, 14)>, <7, (1, 2, 13)>]
There are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
