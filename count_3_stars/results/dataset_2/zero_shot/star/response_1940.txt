Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 11) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 11) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14)
