Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 10) (6, 12) (6, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 9) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [8].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<4, (2, 9, 10)>
<7, (9, 12, 13)>
<8, (0, 5, 4)>
<13, (1, 3, 10)>
<12, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (10, 4, 11)>
<3, (0, 6, 14)>
<11, (2, 3, 14)>
