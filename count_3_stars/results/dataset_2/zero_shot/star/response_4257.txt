Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 20) (7, 21) (7, 23) (7, 26) (7, 13) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 11) (21, 18) (3, 28) (3, 17) (25, 9) (25, 22) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 20) (17, 3) (17, 14) (17, 4) (28, 21) (28, 3) (22, 9) (22, 25) (22, 5) (22, 29) (5, 22) (5, 13) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 0) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 29) (27, 16) (1, 10) (1, 23) (1, 0) (15, 29) (15, 24) (15, 2) (26, 7) (26, 20) (26, 16) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 10) (19, 8) (19, 12) (19, 23) (12, 14) (12, 19) (12, 20) (16, 27) (16, 26) (16, 2) (18, 9) (18, 21) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 1) (29, 22) (29, 4) (29, 15) (20, 9) (20, 14) (20, 26) (20, 12) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 21) (23, 7) (23, 1) (23, 19) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 10) (24, 15) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<6, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (6, 22, 18)>
<22, (9, 25, 5)>
<7, (21, 23, 26)>
<21, (7, 28, 11)>
<3, (28, 17, 3)>
<17, (3, 14, 4)>
<28, (3, 22, 21)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [(8)].
