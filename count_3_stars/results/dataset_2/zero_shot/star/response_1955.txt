Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 2) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 14) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [20]

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (1, 10, 0)>
<9, (4, 6, 3)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 14, 4)>
<3, (9, 13, 0)>
<10, (5, 11, 4)>
<11, (10, 2, 14)>
<4, (9, 1, 7)>
<7, (4, 12, 0)>
<12, (7, 14, 8)>
<13, (5, 7, 2)>
<0, (5, 3, 7)>
<14, (1, 11, 12)>
<8, (5, 6, 14)>
<2, (9, 11, 13)>
