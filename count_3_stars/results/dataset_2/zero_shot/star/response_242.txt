Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (5, 0, 7)>
<4, (7, 2, 3)>
<9, (2, 0, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
