Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
