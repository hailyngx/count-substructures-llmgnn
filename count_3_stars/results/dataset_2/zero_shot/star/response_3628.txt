Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 2) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 10) (12, 7) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 10) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. They are:

<4, (1, 6, 11)>
<7, (1, 9, 13)>
<6, (4, 9, 14)>
<9, (3, 7, 12)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
