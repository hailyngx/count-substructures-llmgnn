Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 5) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 19) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 18) (11, 8) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 5) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 7) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 17) (4, 10) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (18, 11) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 6) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 17) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 2) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 7) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 5) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 17) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 7) (13, 18) (13, 7) 

Response:
There are 9 unique 3-stars in this graph. The number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (1, 5, 14)>
<15, (7, 9, 6)>
<1, (3, 14, 19)>
<10, (4, 2, _)>
<11, (18, 8, _)>
<12, (4, 16, 18)>
<18, (11, 12, 19)>
<19, (1, 16, 6)>
<2, (10, 9, 17)>
