Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 17) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 8) (3, 13) (15, 5) (15, 18) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 16) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 17) (12, 4) (18, 7) (18, 15) (18, 14) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 11) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 19) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 11) (0, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 13) (16, 10) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (2, 14, 15)>
<9, (6, 11, 13)>
<6, (4, 7, 11)>
<4, (6, 12, 17)>
<7, (4, 14, 18)>
<10, (1, 16, 19)>
