Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 4) (9, 2) (26, 22) (26, 27) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 24) (21, 6) (21, 4) (21, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 28) (28, 13) (29, 16) (29, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 11) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 27) (22, 10) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 12) (6, 1) (6, 21) (6, 0) (6, 16) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 5) (16, 29) (16, 6) (16, 25) (16, 20) (23, 20) (23, 27) (4, 9) (4, 21) (4, 22) (4, 5) (4, 11) (11, 2) (11, 4) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 27) (5, 21) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 24) (18, 10) (18, 25) (27, 26) (27, 22) (27, 23) (27, 19) (27, 10) (3, 13) (3, 29) (3, 19) (10, 22) (10, 7) (10, 18) (10, 27) (20, 16) (20, 23) (12, 8) (12, 14) (17, 15) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 16) (25, 18) (25, 15) (24, 1) (24, 5) (15, 17) (15, 25)
