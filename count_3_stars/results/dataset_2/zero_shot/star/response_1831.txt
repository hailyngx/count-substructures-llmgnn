Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 14) (17, 10) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 15) (8, 7) (8, 15) (12, 9) (12, 19) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 13) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 15) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 8) (15, 5) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 19) (16, 13) (13, 18) (13, 0) (13, 16) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (10, 16, 18)>
<3, (0, 5, 13)>
<4, (7, 9, 19)>
<7, (2, 8, 15)>
<9, (4, 12, 18)>
<10, (1, 11, 17)>
<11, (10, 14, 0)>
<13, (0, 16, 18)>
<15, (2, 5, 8)>
<16, (1, 3, 19)>
<18, (9, 10, 19)>

Therefore, there are [11] 3-stars in total.
