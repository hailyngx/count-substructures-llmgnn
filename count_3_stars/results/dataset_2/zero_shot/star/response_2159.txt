This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7)
