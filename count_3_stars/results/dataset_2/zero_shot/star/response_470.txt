Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 9) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 15) (6, 17) (6, 19) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 14) (8, 17) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 18) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 7) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 13) (10, 0) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 9) (7, 19) (7, 17) (7, 9) (15, 5) (15, 13) (13, 16) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 9) (18, 5) (18, 14) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) 

Response:
