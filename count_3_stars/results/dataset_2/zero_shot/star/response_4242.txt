Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (17, 19) (17, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 18) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (0, 10) (0, 5) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 4) (14, 9) (14, 15) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 18) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 15) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 4) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 16) (15, 14) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 5) (12, 5) (12, 19) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 12) (18, 8) (18, 3) (18, 16) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (19, 17) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 12) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
