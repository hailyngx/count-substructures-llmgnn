Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 7) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 7) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 11)>
<6, (9, 5, 3)>
<10, (11, 8, 13)>
<11, (9, 10, 3)>
<8, (10, 14, 3)>
<3, (6, 11, 8)>
