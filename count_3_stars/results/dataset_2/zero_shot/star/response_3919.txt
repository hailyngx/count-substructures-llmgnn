Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 9) (16, 21) (16, 29) (16, 18) (28, 4) (28, 18) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 4) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 25) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 7) (13, 6) (20, 29) (20, 24) (29, 16) (29, 1) (29, 20) (29, 0) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 14) (23, 3) (23, 21) (2, 6) (2, 24) (22, 6) (22, 25) (21, 16) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 24) (25, 1) (25, 17) (25, 22) (25, 4) (25, 18) (26, 10) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 27) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 14) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 9) (8, 15) (8, 3) (7, 13) (14, 23) (14, 15) (12, 1) (12, 6) (0, 29) (0, 19) (0, 9) (0, 18) (9, 11) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 3) (27, 10) (18, 16) (18, 28) (18, 25) (18, 10) (18, 0) (4, 28) (4, 1) (4, 23) (4, 25) (24, 20) (24, 2) (24, 21) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 3) (3, 23) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6)
