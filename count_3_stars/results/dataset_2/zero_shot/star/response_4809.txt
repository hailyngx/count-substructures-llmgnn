Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 0)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (7, 1, 6)>
<8, (4, 0, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 3)>
<6, (7, 3, 8)>
<0, (9, 1, 8)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
