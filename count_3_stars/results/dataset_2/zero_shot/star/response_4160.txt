Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 4) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 4) (15, 2) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 2) (13, 14) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 1) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 12) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 4) (17, 16) (17, 7) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 7) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 5) (1, 10) (1, 18) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 7) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 18) (4, 16) (4, 15) (4, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 10, 19)>
<3, (15, 10, 19)>
<4, (16, 14, 15)>
<5, (11, 12, 18)>
<7, (17, 2, 18)>
<8, (12, 9, 0)>
<13, (14, 2, 6)>
<16, (4, 3, 15)>
