Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 3) (11, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 1) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 5) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

Unique 3-stars found:
<4, (7, 10, 12)>
<7, (4, 6, 5)>
<6, (4, 9, 0)>
<0, (4, 6, 12)>
<9, (6, 11, 13)>
<10, (4, 7, 3)>
