Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 5) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (7, 14) (7, 12) (12, 17) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 1) (0, 16) (0, 13) (1, 12) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 11) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 5) (10, 8) (10, 18) (11, 14) (11, 15) (11, 5) (11, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 15) (5, 17) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 11) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 13) (3, 13) (3, 19) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 16) (8, 10) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 10) (13, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (19, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [6].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (16, 13, 5)>
<3, (13, 4, 19)>
<5, (15, 11, 16)>
<6, (9, 2, 18)>
<8, (16, 12, 10)>
<12, (17, 7, 1)>
