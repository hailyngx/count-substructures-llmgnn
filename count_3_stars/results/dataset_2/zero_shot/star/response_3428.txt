Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (3, 8) (3, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 6) (4, 2) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of 3 nodes where one node is connected to the other two nodes but the two other nodes are not directly connected. 

Given the above graph, the 3-stars can be found as follows:
<5, (9, 13, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>
<8, (5, 9, 14)>
<13, (5, 14, 0)>
<7, (9, 12, 1)>
<12, (7, 10, 0)>
<3, (8, 11, 3)>
<11, (5, 12, 14)>
<0, (9, 13, 7)>
<4, (2, 1, 6)>
<10, (12, 0, 6)>
<14, (8, 13, 11)>
<1, (7, 11, 10)>
<6, (8, 7, 0)>
<2, (4, 1, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
