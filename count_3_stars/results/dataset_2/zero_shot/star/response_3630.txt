Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
