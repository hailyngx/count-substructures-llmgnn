Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 4) (7, 28) (18, 4) (18, 22) (18, 28) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 10) (22, 8) (20, 0) (20, 21) (20, 14) (25, 8) (25, 15) (25, 21) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 24) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 27) (0, 20) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 24) (28, 7) (28, 18) (28, 3) (28, 13) (29, 1) (29, 26) (29, 15) (14, 20) (14, 0) (14, 13) (1, 29) (1, 26) (26, 29) (26, 1) (26, 16) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 19) (17, 12) (17, 21) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 10) (5, 27) (11, 19) (23, 16) (23, 10) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 13) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 23) (16, 24) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 16) (19, 2) (19, 11) (13, 28) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 21) (21, 20) (21, 25) (21, 17) (21, 5) (21, 13) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 9) (27, 5) (8, 18) (8, 22) (8, 25) (10, 22) (10, 5) (10, 23) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 20, 24)>
<3, (0, 28, 24)>
<5, (6, 12, 21)>
<8, (18, 22, 25)>
<9, (2, 6, 27)>
<16, (22, 23, 24)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
