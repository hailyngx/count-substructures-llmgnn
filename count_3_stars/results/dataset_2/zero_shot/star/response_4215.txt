Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 12) (16, 3) (16, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 5) (17, 7) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 5) (6, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 18) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (15, 4) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 9) (2, 16) (2, 13) (2, 19) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 8) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 18) (9, 0) (18, 13) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 7) (3, 16) (3, 12) (8, 12) (8, 10) (8, 7) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 8) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 4) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 15) (4, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
