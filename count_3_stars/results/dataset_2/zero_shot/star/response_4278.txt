Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (5, 1, 8)>
<6, (5, 0, 8)>
<8, (9, 4, 2)>
<8, (4, 5, 1)>
