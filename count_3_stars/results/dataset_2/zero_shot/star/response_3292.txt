Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 4) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 10) (12, 5) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 11) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <1, (3, 6, 10)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (8, 12, 4)>, <11, (0, 14, 2)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
