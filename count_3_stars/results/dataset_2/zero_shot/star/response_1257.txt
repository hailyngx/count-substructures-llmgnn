Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (9, 28) (9, 11) (26, 19) (26, 27) (0, 24) (0, 11) (0, 19) (27, 26) (27, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 22) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 20) (3, 4) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 18) (23, 18) (23, 17) (15, 8) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 14) (20, 3) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 10) (19, 26) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 25) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (21, 11) (21, 22) (7, 6) (7, 17) (25, 19) (25, 24) (29, 9) (29, 22) (14, 15) (14, 18) (28, 9) (28, 3) (28, 13) (28, 18) (17, 23) (17, 7) (17, 4) (2, 27) (2, 22) (2, 24) (22, 1) (22, 21) (22, 29) (22, 2) (5, 1) (16, 13) (16, 4) (24, 0) (24, 25) (24, 2) (18, 8) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 28) (18, 12) (12, 20) (12, 18) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 16) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 21) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 16) (4, 10) (10, 20) (10, 4) 

Response:
The graph contains a total of 8 different 3-stars. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (11, 24, 25)>
<4, (10, 16, 17)>
<7, (6, 17, 23)>
<12, (18, 20, 28)>
<13, (1, 16, 28)>
<14, (15, 18, 19)>
<21, (11, 22, 29)>
<26, (19, 26, 27)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
