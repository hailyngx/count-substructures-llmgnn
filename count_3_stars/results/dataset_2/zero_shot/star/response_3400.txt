Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars found:
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
