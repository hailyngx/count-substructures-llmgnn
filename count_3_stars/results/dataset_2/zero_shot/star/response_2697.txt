Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 29) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 27) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 4) (18, 0) (22, 26) (22, 15) (22, 7) (7, 22) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 27) (12, 8) (28, 6) (28, 8) (28, 25) (29, 5) (29, 23) (4, 6) (4, 21) (4, 24) (21, 6) (21, 4) (21, 23) (21, 2) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 16) (26, 17) (11, 7) (11, 14) (23, 29) (23, 21) (23, 1) (23, 3) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 19) (16, 26) (16, 0) (16, 15) (25, 28) (25, 27) (25, 17) (27, 9) (27, 7) (27, 25) (27, 8) (17, 5) (17, 26) (17, 25) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 24) (2, 21) (2, 19) (24, 4) (24, 14) (24, 19) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 0) (3, 14) (8, 12) (8, 28) (8, 27) (1, 23) (1, 13) (20, 26) (20, 10) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 24) (19, 10) (10, 20) (10, 19) (15, 5) (15, 22) (15, 16) (13, 1) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Each 3-star is shown below:

<5, (9, 17, 29)>
<6, (9, 28, 21)>
<7, (22, 3, 11)>
<0, (18, 16, 19)>
<3, (7, 14, 23)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
