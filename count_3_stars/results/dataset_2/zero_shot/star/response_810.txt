Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 4) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations within the given graph. They are:
<5, (9, 2, 12)>
<9, (5, 6, 11)>
<6, (9, 14, 12)>
<1, (3, 14, 0)>
<3, (1, 7, 14)>
<8, (1, 2, 13)>
<13, (9, 2, 10)>
<7, (9, 3, 14)>
<12, (5, 6, 2)>
<2, (5, 8, 13)>
<0, (1, 13, 4)>
<14, (6, 1, 3)>
<10, (3, 13, 14)>
<11, (5, 9, 12)>
<4, (6, 0, 10)>
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
