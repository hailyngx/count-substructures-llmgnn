Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 0, 3)>
<5, (9, 7, 12)>
<4, (8, 1, 11)>
<8, (9, 4, 1)>
<7, (5, 9, 12)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>
<12, (9, 7, 13)>
<3, (5, 4, 11)>
<11, (4, 8, 13)>
<0, (5, 12, 10)>
<10, (8, 0, 2)>
<13, (12, 11, 1)>
