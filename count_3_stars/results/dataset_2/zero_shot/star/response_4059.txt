Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
Unique 3-stars found: 
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 1)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (2, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
