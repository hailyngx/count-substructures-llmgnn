Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 10) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 4) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 7) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 4) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, (13, 4, 14)>
<1, (8, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 14, 10)>
<4, (11, 9, 14)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<10, (0, 2, 12)>
