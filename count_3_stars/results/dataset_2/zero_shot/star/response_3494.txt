Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 0) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 7) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 15) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (15, 10) (15, 18) (19, 8) (19, 13) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 4) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 11) (6, 3) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 16) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by observing that each 3-star consists of a central node (center) and three connected nodes (leaves). Since each 3-star has 3 leaves and only unique 3-stars are counted, we can calculate the number of 3-stars by counting the number of central nodes and the number of unique sets of 3 leaves connected to each central node.

First, let's analyze the given graph to identify the central nodes and their connected nodes to form 3-stars:
- Central nodes: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18

Based on the edges provided, we can determine the distinct sets of leaves connected to each central node:
- <0, (10, 12, 14)> (0 is connected to 10, 12, and 14)
- <2, (8, 18, 15)> (2 is connected to 8, 18, and 15)
- <3, (6, 18, 12)> (3 is connected to 6, 18, and 12)
- <5, (9, 4, 18)> (5 is connected to 9, 4, and 18)
- <7, (9, 11, 14)> (7 is connected to 9, 11, and 14)
- <9, (5, 0, 12)> (9 is connected to 5, 0, and 12)
- <12, (9, 14, 6)> (12 is connected to 9, 14, and 6)
- <13, (1, 8, 19)> (13 is connected to 1, 8, and 19)
- <14, (17, 0, 7)> (14 is connected to 17, 0, and 7)
- <16, (17, 8, 4)> (16 is connected to 17, 8, and 4)
- <18, (2, 5, 15)> (18 is connected to 2, 5, and 15)

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is therefore [11].
