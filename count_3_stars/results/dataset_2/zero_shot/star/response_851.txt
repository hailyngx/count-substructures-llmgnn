Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) 

Response:
There are [15] total nodes in the graph, but as we are interested in identifying 3-stars, we will focus on nodes that are part of a 3-star.

Counting the nodes with degree 4:
- Node 5 has degree 5
- Node 1 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 6
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 5
- Node 14 has degree 5

From the given edge list, we find the unique 3-stars to be:
<5, (6, 13, 8)>
<5, (6, 1, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 12)>
<1, (5, 3, 7)>
<1, (5, 3, 14)>
<3, (1, 11, 7)>
<3, (1, 11, 14)>
<9, (6, 8, 0)>
<7, (6, 1, 8)>
<7, (6, 1, 3)>
<14, (9, 1, 4)>

Our final count is [12] unique 3-stars.
