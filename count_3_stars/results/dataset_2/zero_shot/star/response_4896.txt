Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) 

Response:
There are [10] total nodes and [40] edges in the graph.
Now let's count the number of 3-stars:

1. <4, (0, 5, 6)>
2. <8, (1, 5, 7)>
3. <5, (2, 4, 8)>
4. <6, (0, 1, 2)>
5. <0, (4, 6, 9)>
6. <7, (1, 8, 7)>
7. <9, (0, 3, 8)>
8. <1, (6, 7, 8)>
9. <3, (4, 8, 9)>
10. <2, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
