Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
