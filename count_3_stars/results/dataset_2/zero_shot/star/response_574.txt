Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 15) (22, 17) (22, 29) (22, 25) (14, 13) (14, 17) (14, 7) (17, 22) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 24) (17, 18) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 18) (0, 27) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 3) (8, 9) (8, 25) (8, 26) (23, 0) (23, 19) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 12) (15, 22) (15, 20) (15, 11) (11, 15) (11, 28) (11, 2) (28, 11) (4, 6) (4, 27) (4, 2) (4, 1) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 12) (1, 18) (26, 8) (26, 10) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 21) (21, 16) (21, 12) (21, 5) (21, 25) (10, 13) (10, 26) (10, 2) (24, 17) (24, 19) (24, 29) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 1) (19, 23) (19, 24) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 10) (7, 14) (7, 20) (7, 5) (12, 20) (12, 1) (12, 21) (12, 29) (29, 22) (29, 24) (29, 12) (5, 21) (5, 7) (25, 22) (25, 8) (25, 21) (3, 27) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by choosing 1 node as the center and 3 nodes from the remaining 29 nodes as the leaves. This can be done in C(30, 1) * C(29, 3) ways.

Calculating C(30, 1) = 30 and C(29, 3) = 3654, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 30 * 3654 = 109620.

There are a total of 109620 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:

<22, (13, 17, 15)>
<14, (13, 17, 7)>
