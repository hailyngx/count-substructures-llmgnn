Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 9) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 14) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 2) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 5, 10)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<10, (1, 0, 8)>
<11, (7, 5, 8)>
