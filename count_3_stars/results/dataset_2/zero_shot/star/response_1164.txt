Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 11)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<4, (9, 8, 12)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 8, 1)>
<2, (9, 12, 13)>
<7, (8, 0, 11)>
<12, (4, 6, 2)>
<0, (2, 7, 1)>
<1, (6, 0, 5)>
<11, (5, 4, 7)>
<14, (4, 6, 10)>
