Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 18) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 15) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 8) (13, 19) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 7) (3, 14) (3, 16) (11, 12) (11, 1) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 5) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 10) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 16) (16, 3) (16, 10) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (5, 17) (5, 1) (5, 2) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 13)
