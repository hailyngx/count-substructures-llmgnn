Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 15) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 13) (17, 3) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 4) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 10) (18, 5) (18, 15) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 19) (19, 14) (19, 8) (19, 3) (19, 10) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 0) (5, 18) (5, 2) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 18) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 2) (0, 4) (0, 12) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <11, (16, 8, 15)>
- <6, (2, 13, 17)>
- <9, (2, 3, 12)>
- <14, (12, 19, 9)>
- <4, (16, 13, 0)>
- <7, (3, 15, 10)>
- <18, (5, 15, 0)>
- <1, (8, 13, 19)>
- <17, (13, 3, 7)>

Thus, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [8].
