Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (7, 8, 5)>
<1, (4, 9, 3)>
<2, (7, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
