Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 14) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 14) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 11) 

Response:
