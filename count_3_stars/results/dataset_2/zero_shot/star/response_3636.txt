Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (3, 8, 2)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
