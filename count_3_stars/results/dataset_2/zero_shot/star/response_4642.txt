Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 14) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 14) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 10, 11)>
<7, (4, 3, 13)>
<3, (7, 5, 9)>
<10, (4, 7, 6)>
<11, (4, 10, 0)>
<6, (10, 8, 12)>
<0, (11, 6, 2)>
<2, (4, 13, 5)>
<5, (3, 6, 2)>
<12, (4, 10, 6)>
<14, (10, 13, 9)>
