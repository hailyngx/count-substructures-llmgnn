Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 29) (11, 20) (16, 28) (16, 19) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 27) (0, 20) (0, 18) (0, 1) (27, 0) (27, 25) (18, 0) (18, 20) (18, 24) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 10) (22, 7) (23, 22) (23, 7) (23, 19) (23, 12) (10, 22) (10, 17) (10, 21) (17, 10) (17, 15) (20, 11) (20, 0) (20, 18) (20, 3) (20, 4) (28, 16) (28, 25) (29, 11) (29, 21) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 23) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 14) (26, 6) (3, 20) (3, 4) (4, 20) (4, 3) (4, 24) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 17) (21, 10) (21, 29) (25, 27) (25, 28) (25, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (6, 26) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 22) (2, 24) (2, 14) (2, 7) (24, 18) (24, 4) (24, 2) (24, 12) (14, 16) (14, 26) (14, 2) (8, 11) (8, 25) (8, 1) (7, 22) (7, 23) (7, 6) (7, 2) (12, 23) (12, 24) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated as follows:
Since each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look at each node and see how many 3-stars it belongs to.

Here is the breakdown of the number of 3-stars each node participates in:
- Node 0: (0, 9, 18), (0, 9, 20), (0, 18, 20) [3 3-stars]
- Node 1: (1, 6, 8) [1 3-star]
- Node 2: (2, 7, 14), (2, 7, 22), (2, 14, 24), (2, 22, 24) [4 3-stars]
- Node 3: (3, 4, 20) [1 3-star]
- Node 4: (4, 20, 24) [1 3-star]
- Node 5: (5, 9, 15), (5, 9, 19) [2 3-stars]
- Node 6: (6, 7, 26) [1 3-star]
- Node 7: (7, 22, 23) [1 3-star]
- Node 8: (8, 11, 25) [1 3-star]
- Node 9: (9, 15, 17) [1 3-star]
- Node 10: (10, 17, 21), (10, 17, 22) [2 3-stars]
- Node 11: (11, 20, 29) [1 3-star]
- Node 12: (12, 23, 24) [1 3-star]
- Node 14: (14, 16, 26) [1 3-star]
- Node 15: (15, 17, 19) [1 3-star]
- Node 16: (16, 19, 28) [1 3-star]
- Node 18: (18, 20, 24) [1 3-star]
- Node 19: (19, 23, 26) [1 3-star]
- Node 20: (20, 27, 29) [1 3-star]
- Node 22: (22, 23, 24) [1 3-star]
- Node 24: (24, 26, 28) [1 3-star]
- Node 26: (26, 27, 28) [1 3-star]

Counting all the unique 3-stars found, we have:
<0, (9, 18, 20)>, <1, (6, 8, 0)>, <2, (7, 14, 24)>, <3, (4, 20, 0)>, <4, (20, 24, 0)>, <5, (15, 9, 19)>, <6, (26, 7, 1)>, <7, (23, 22, 2)>, <8, (25, 11, 8)>, <9, (17, 15, 9)>, <10, (21, 17, 10)>, <12, (24, 23, 12)>, <14, (26, 16, 2)>, <16, (28, 19, 14)>, <18, (24, 20, 18)>, <19, (26, 23, 19)>, <20, (29, 27, 20)>, <22, (24, 23, 22)>, <24, (28, 26, 24)>, <26, (28, 27, 26)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
