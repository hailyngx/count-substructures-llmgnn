Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
