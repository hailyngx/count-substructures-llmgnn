Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 6) (7, 11) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 1) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 6) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 14) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<9, (5, 10, 13)>
<10, (9, 11, 3)>
<11, (10, 7, 14)>
<12, (7, 4, 6)>
<14, (11, 12, 6)>
