Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 11) (8, 2) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 4) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3)
