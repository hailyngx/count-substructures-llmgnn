Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars found in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
