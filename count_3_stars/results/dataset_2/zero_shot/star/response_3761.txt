Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in this graph. The number of 3-stars is [7].
