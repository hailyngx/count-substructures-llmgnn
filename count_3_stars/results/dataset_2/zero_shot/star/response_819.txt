Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 21) (29, 2) (29, 27) (29, 11) (1, 3) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (22, 26) (22, 15) (22, 24) (26, 22) (26, 13) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 15) (13, 9) (17, 20) (17, 5) (17, 18) (20, 17) (20, 8) (20, 4) (20, 6) (8, 20) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 23) (9, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 19) (7, 5) (16, 13) (16, 19) (12, 3) (12, 18) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 0) (28, 4) (28, 15) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 6) (10, 6) (10, 24) (10, 25) (5, 17) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 20) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 11) (24, 22) (24, 13) (24, 10) (27, 29) (27, 21) (14, 3) (14, 5) (23, 9) (23, 4) (21, 2) (21, 27) (4, 20) (4, 28) (4, 23) (4, 25) (15, 22) (15, 13) (15, 28) (11, 29) (11, 6) (25, 10) (25, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
Unique 3-stars found in the graph: <9, (0, 19, 23)>, <13, (9, 15, 24)>, <19, (1, 7, 16)>, <20, (4, 6, 28)>.
