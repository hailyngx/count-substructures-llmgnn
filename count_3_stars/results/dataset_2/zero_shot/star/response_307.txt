Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 14) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 2) (9, 2) (9, 14) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (2, 10, 5)>
<7, (12, 3, 5)>
<10, (4, 11, 5)>
<11, (10, 8, 12)>
<12, (7, 11, 13)>
<13, (5, 12, 6)>
