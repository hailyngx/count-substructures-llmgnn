Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 10) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 0) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 12) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
