Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (13, 20) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 15) (22, 1) (9, 26) (26, 9) (26, 12) (6, 13) (6, 1) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 5) (21, 13) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 4) (21, 2) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 28) (18, 17) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 12) (23, 4) (23, 24) (23, 27) (28, 21) (28, 18) (28, 27) (29, 8) (29, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 10) (19, 18) (19, 20) (1, 22) (1, 6) (1, 10) (15, 22) (15, 16) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 15) (17, 18) (17, 3) (3, 17) (3, 12) (25, 24) (25, 2) (24, 23) (24, 0) (24, 25) (24, 2) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 1) (12, 26) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) (20, 13) (20, 19) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 27) (4, 21) (4, 23) (4, 29) (27, 23) (27, 28) (27, 11) (2, 21) (2, 25) (2, 24) 

Response:
Based on the given edge list, we can list out the 3-stars in the graph:

<13, (22, 21, 6)>
<22, (13, 18, 15)>
<6, (13, 1, 1)>
<18, (22, 19, 17)>
<21, (13, 7, 28)>
<26, (9, 12, 3)>
<7, (21, 16, 14)>
<28, (21, 18, 27)>
<4, (23, 29, 21)>
<24, (23, 25, 2)>
<0, (14, 16, 11)>
<10, (8, 14, 5)>
<12, (26, 8, 3)>
<20, (13, 19, 20)>
<11, (18, 0, 27)>
<5, (7, 10, 10)>
<19, (18, 20, 19)>
<15, (22, 16, 16)>
<17, (18, 3, 17)>
<3, (17, 12, 12)>
<25, (24, 2, 24)>

There are 21 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the answer is [21].
