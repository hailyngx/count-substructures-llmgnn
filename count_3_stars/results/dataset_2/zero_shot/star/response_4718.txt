Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 2) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 10) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 12) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (7, 8, 0)>
<1, (3, 14, 8)>
