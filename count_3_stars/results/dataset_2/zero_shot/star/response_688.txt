Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 15) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 1) (15, 13) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 15) (19, 10) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 12) (4, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 10) (11, 18) (11, 6) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 14) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 10) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 16) (16, 9) (16, 10) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<8, (13, 14, 1)>
<13, (8, 10, 15)>
<2, (18, 15, 0)>
<18, (2, 9, 11)>
<5, (4, 3, 7)>
<6, (17, 3, 11)>
<9, (18, 16, 1)>
<15, (13, 2, 19)>
