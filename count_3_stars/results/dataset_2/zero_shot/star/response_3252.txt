Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 15) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 8) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 1) (12, 19) (15, 10) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 8) (19, 16) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 16) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 1) (13, 6) (13, 0) (17, 9) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
