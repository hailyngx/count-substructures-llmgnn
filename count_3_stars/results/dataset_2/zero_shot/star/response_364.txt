Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars found: 
<1, (4, 8, 6)>
<3, (8, 0, 14)>
<5, (13, 6, 10)>
<9, (13, 11, 10)>
