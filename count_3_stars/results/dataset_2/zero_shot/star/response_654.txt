Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 13) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures with central nodes being nodes 0, 4, and 14:

- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (2, 9, 13)>
- <14, (1, 10, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
