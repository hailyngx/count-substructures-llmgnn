Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 21) (11, 15) (11, 29) (16, 0) (16, 3) (14, 18) (14, 27) (14, 2) (17, 6) (17, 24) (17, 21) (23, 8) (23, 6) (23, 27) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 20) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 15) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 25) (12, 3) (12, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 17) (6, 23) (6, 7) (6, 5) (29, 11) (29, 27) (29, 0) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 29) (0, 2) (2, 14) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 24) (9, 12) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 1) (4, 3) (18, 14) (18, 4) (18, 1) (26, 3) (26, 27) (25, 12) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 19) (27, 14) (27, 23) (27, 29) (27, 26) (27, 25) (13, 2) (13, 25) (21, 11) (21, 17) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 18) (1, 20) (1, 19) (20, 10) (20, 1) (20, 3) (24, 17) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 4) (15, 11) (15, 8) (19, 4) (19, 25) (19, 1) (3, 16) (3, 12) (3, 4) (3, 26) (3, 20)
