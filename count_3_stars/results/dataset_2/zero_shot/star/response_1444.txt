Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 12) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 11) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations present in this graph:
[<1, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 9, 12)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (3, 9, 12)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <12, (4, 8, 11)>, <5, (7, 0, 14)>, <0, (3, 5, 10)>, <14, (4, 5, 7)>]
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
