Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 19) (15, 0) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 1) (8, 0) (8, 12) (11, 13) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 16) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 12) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 16) (16, 5) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 6) (7, 17) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 9) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 18) (1, 16) (1, 7) (1, 14) (6, 16) (6, 7) (4, 10) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 12) 

Response:
There are 13 unique 3-stars in the graph. The answer is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (2, 12, 9)>
<10, (17, 4, 5)>
<17, (10, 19, 7)>
<2, (3, 12, 16)>
<12, (2, 18, 9)>
<5, (10, 13, 19)>
<13, (11, 7, 5)>
<19, (15, 17, 12)>
<0, (15, 8, 16)>
<16, (5, 7, 1)>
<7, (17, 13, 6)>
<4, (10, 5, 0)>
<9, (3, 17, 12)>
