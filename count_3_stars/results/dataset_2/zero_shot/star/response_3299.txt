Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (9, 5, 3)>
<7, (0, 6, 1)>
<6, (7, 5, 2)>
<9, (4, 8, 3)>
<5, (4, 7, 6)>
