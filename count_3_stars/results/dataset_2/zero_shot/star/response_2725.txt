Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 9) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 10) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are <4, (7, 1, 3)>, <9, (8, 13, 12)>, <2, (1, 13, 12)>, and <6, (8, 14, 2)>.
