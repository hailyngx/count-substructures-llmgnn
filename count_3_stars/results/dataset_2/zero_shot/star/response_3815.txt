Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 7) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 0) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 13) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 12) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 12) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars <central node, (leaf 1, leaf 2, leaf 3)> found in the graph:
<0, (3, 11, 8)>
<1, (11, 13, 12)>
<2, (4, 13, 0)>
<4, (5, 8, 6)>
<5, (6, 12, 4)>
<8, (3, 10, 14)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
