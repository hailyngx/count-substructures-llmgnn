Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (6, 9, 3)>
<1, (5, 4, 0)>
<2, (9, 4, 8)>
<3, (9, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 1)>
<5, (9, 1, 7)>
<6, (4, 6, 0)>
<7, (5, 3, 4)>
