Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 15) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 3) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 17) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (15, 13) (15, 0) (15, 10) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 15) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 12) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 18) (17, 4) (17, 0) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 16) (19, 2) (19, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 11) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 14) 

Response:
There are 6 total 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (8, 17, 18)>
<5, (8, 10, 12)>
<9, (10, 12, 15)>
<10, (2, 15, 5)>
<12, (11, 9, 13)>
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
