Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
