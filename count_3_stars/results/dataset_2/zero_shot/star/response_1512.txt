Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 17) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 13) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 19) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 17) (0, 16) (0, 2) (8, 19) (8, 18) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 14) (16, 0) (16, 1) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 18) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 15) (17, 5) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 12) (14, 19) (14, 15) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 16) (1, 2) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 2) (15, 14) (10, 2) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 12) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 3) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

<1, (4, 7, 16)>
<2, (0, 1, 15)>
<3, (11, 13, 19)>
<6, (5, 13, 15)>
<7, (4, 9, 15)>
