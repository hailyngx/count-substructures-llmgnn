Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 7) (15, 9) (4, 14) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 13) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 18) (5, 10) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 16) (1, 14) (1, 13) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 2) (13, 7) (13, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 18) (16, 9) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 11) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 19) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 11) (12, 3) (12, 0) (11, 18) (11, 9) 

Response:
There are 8 3-stars in the given graph. Below are the unique 3-stars found: 
<3, (0, 2, 12)>
<15, (7, 9, 15)>
<4, (8, 14, 1)>
<7, (15, 13, 19)>
<10, (17, 5, 2)>
<8, (14, 0, 18)>
<5, (10, 17, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 16)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8].
