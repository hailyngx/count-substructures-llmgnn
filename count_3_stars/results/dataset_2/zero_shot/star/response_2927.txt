Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 15) (16, 0) (16, 14) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 16) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 10) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 13) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 5) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 18) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 19) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 19) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 5) (18, 9) (18, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 10) (19, 7) (19, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<12, (11, 15, 5)>
<10, (17, 12, 7)>
<0, (16, 3, 18)>
<4, (3, 9, 10)>
<8, (15, 6, 1)>
<7, (10, 5, 19)>
<1, (2, 8, 19)>
<13, (9, 5, 11)>
