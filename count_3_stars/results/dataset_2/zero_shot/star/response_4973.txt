Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 23) (0, 6) (27, 22) (27, 10) (27, 16) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 14) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 20) (8, 21) (28, 11) (28, 25) (28, 20) (29, 9) (29, 19) (2, 8) (2, 10) (11, 28) (11, 17) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 21) (9, 3) (9, 7) (17, 11) (17, 6) (7, 9) (7, 24) (16, 27) (16, 24) (16, 18) (19, 29) (22, 27) (22, 25) (22, 1) (10, 27) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 18) (26, 10) (26, 12) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 23) (24, 4) (24, 7) (24, 16) (6, 0) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 18) (25, 28) (25, 9) (25, 22) (25, 1) (25, 15) (15, 0) (15, 25) (15, 14) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 15) (1, 13) (1, 22) (1, 25) (20, 8) (20, 28) (23, 0) (23, 3) (23, 21) (12, 5) (12, 26) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 6) (21, 4) (21, 8) (21, 9) (21, 23) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 15)>
<2, (8, 10, 21)>
<9, (3, 7, 25)>
<10, (8, 18, 27)>
<14, (4, 6, 15)>
<22, (1, 25, 28)>
<24, (4, 7, 16)>
<29, (9, 19, 25)>
