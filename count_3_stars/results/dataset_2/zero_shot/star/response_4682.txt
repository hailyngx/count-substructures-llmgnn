Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 9) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 12) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 10) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 0) 

Response:
The central nodes for 3-stars in this graph are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Now, let's find the neighbors for each central node to form the 3-stars:

- For central node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 4, 13), (0, 5, 10), (0, 9, 12)
- For central node 1: (1, 0, 7), (1, 3, 11)
- For central node 2: (2, 0, 4), (2, 5, 8), (2, 10, 14)
- For central node 3: (3, 1, 11), (3, 5, 13), (3, 6, 9)
- For central node 4: (4, 0, 2), (4, 7, 14)
- For central node 5: (5, 0, 10), (5, 2, 13), (5, 7, 10)
- For central node 6: (6, 3, 9), (6, 8, 11)
- For central node 7: (7, 0, 5), (7, 4, 8)
- For central node 8: (8, 2, 14), (8, 6, 7)
- For central node 9: (9, 0, 12), (9, 3, 6)
- For central node 10: (10, 0, 5), (10, 2, 14)
- For central node 11: (11, 1, 3), (11, 6, 8)
- For central node 12: (12, 0, 9), (12, 13, 0)
- For central node 13: (13, 0, 5), (13, 3, 14), (13, 12, 0)
- For central node 14: (14, 2, 8), (14, 4, 10), (14, 8, 13)

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [34]:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (4, 13, 0)>, <0, (5, 10, 0)>, <0, (9, 12, 0)>, 
<1, (0, 7, 1)>, <1, (3, 11, 1)>, 
<2, (0, 4, 2)>, <2, (5, 8, 2)>, <2, (10, 14, 2)>, 
<3, (1, 11, 3)>, <3, (5, 13, 3)>, <3, (6, 9, 3)>, 
<4, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (7, 14, 4)>, 
<5, (0, 10, 5)>, <5, (2, 13, 5)>, <5, (7, 10, 5)>, 
<6, (3, 9, 6)>, <6, (8, 11, 6)>,

<10, (0, 5, 10)>, <10, (2, 14, 10)>, 
<11, (1, 3, 11)>, <11, (6, 8, 11)>, 
<12, (0, 9, 12)>, <12, (13, 0, 12)>, 
<13, (0, 5, 13)>, <13, (3, 14, 13)>, <13, (12, 0, 13)>, 
<14, (2, 8, 14)>, <14, (4, 10, 14)>, <14, (8, 13, 14)>
