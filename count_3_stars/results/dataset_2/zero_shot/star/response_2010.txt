Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 20) (3, 13) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 10) (25, 2) (22, 6) (23, 18) (23, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 24) (12, 21) (27, 25) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 18) (27, 5) (4, 23) (4, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 29) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 19) (21, 12) (21, 27) (21, 28) (21, 9) (28, 21) (28, 17) (28, 7) (13, 3) (13, 16) (16, 13) (16, 29) (16, 20) (16, 15) (26, 5) (26, 15) (5, 27) (5, 26) (5, 29) (20, 3) (20, 16) (20, 29) (20, 9) (29, 0) (29, 16) (29, 5) (29, 20) (11, 7) (11, 15) (17, 28) (17, 24) (6, 22) (6, 14) (6, 19) (18, 23) (18, 27) (19, 14) (19, 6) (9, 21) (9, 20) (7, 8) (7, 28) (7, 11) (7, 10) (15, 16) (15, 26) (15, 11) (2, 25) (24, 12) (24, 17) (10, 25) (10, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<3, (1, 8, 13)>, <25, (2, 10, 27)>, <27, (5, 12, 18)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
