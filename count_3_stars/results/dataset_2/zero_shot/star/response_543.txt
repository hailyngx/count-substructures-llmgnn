Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 4) (0, 3) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 2, 4)>, <5, (8, 9, 7)>, <9, (5, 8, 3)>, <9, (4, 8, 1)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>, <4, (8, 1, 0)>, <8, (5, 4, 6)>, <8, (9, 2, 6)>, <2, (5, 8, 6)>, <1, (9, 4, 7)>, <6, (8, 2, 7)>, <3, (9, 8, 0)>, <7, (5, 2, 1)>, <0, (4, 3)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
