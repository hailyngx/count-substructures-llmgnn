Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (1, 0, 3)>
<9, (8, 4, 2)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (9, 4, 7)>
<6, (5, 4, 3)>
<0, (5, 4, 3)>
<1, (5, 2, 7)>
<3, (5, 4, 6)>
<2, (9, 7, 1)>
