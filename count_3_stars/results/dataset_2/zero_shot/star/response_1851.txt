Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 14) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 11) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 7) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 10) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 1) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) 

Response:
There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

[9] 

The unique 3-stars are:
<9, (2, 1, 7)>
<13, (8, 14, 3)>
<4, (0, 10, 5)>
<5, (6, 12, 4)>
<2, (9, 12, 11)>
<0, (4, 14, 10)>
<14, (13, 0, 7)>
<7, (9, 14, 1)>
<1, (8, 5, 7)>
