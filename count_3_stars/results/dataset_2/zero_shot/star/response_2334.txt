Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 9) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 3) (19, 2) (19, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (12, 16) (12, 3) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 10) (3, 18) (3, 12) (17, 5) (17, 0) (17, 8) (14, 18) (14, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 1) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 14) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 13) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 15) (13, 4) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 4) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 10) 

Response:
There are 12 unique 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are:

<11, (16, 7, 13)>
<16, (11, 0, 12)>
<5, (6, 18, 4)>
<6, (5, 7, 2)>
<0, (16, 15, 17)>
<18, (5, 9, 14)>
<7, (11, 6, 0)>
<12, (16, 3, 0)>
<9, (0, 18, 10)>
<3, (18, 12, 13)>
<17, (5, 0, 8)>
<14, (18, 8, 17)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
