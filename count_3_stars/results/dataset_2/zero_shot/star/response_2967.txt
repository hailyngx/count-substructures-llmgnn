Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 12) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 27) (26, 7) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 24) (3, 11) (3, 27) (3, 22) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 21) (11, 15) (6, 21) (6, 27) (21, 11) (21, 6) (21, 27) (21, 12) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 19) (28, 1) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 23) (19, 22) (23, 19) (23, 7) (23, 10) (17, 9) (17, 25) (17, 27) (17, 15) (25, 26) (25, 17) (25, 15) (25, 18) (22, 3) (22, 19) (18, 25) (18, 20) (18, 12) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 24) (8, 29) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 10) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 0) (4, 29) (0, 4) (0, 2) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 25) (15, 14) (27, 26) (27, 3) (27, 6) (27, 21) (27, 17) (10, 23) (10, 14) (10, 1) (1, 28) (1, 14) (1, 10) (7, 26) (7, 23) (24, 13) (24, 5) (20, 18) (2, 16) (2, 0) (29, 8) (29, 4) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 18) 

Response:
Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph:

[<4, (9, 17, 12)>, <13, (26, 16, 24)>, <3, (11, 27, 22)>, <11, (19, 5, 21)>, <6, (21, 27, 12)>, <19, (16, 23, 22)>, <7, (26, 23, 27)>, <15, (17, 25, 14)>, <1, (28, 10, 14)>, <24, (13, 5, -)>, <2, (16, 0, -)>, <8, (29, -, -)>]

So, there are [12] unique 3-stars in total.
