Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed in unique form:

<5, (8, 7, 14)>
<9, (6, 11, 3)>
<6, (9, 10, 3)>
<3, (1, 9, 2)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
