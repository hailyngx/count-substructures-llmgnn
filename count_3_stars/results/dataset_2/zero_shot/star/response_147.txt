Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 24) (11, 27) (11, 12) (16, 20) (0, 27) (0, 3) (0, 23) (27, 11) (27, 0) (27, 7) (27, 19) (7, 27) (7, 28) (21, 26) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 12) (23, 0) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 29) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 17) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 17) (18, 29) (26, 21) (26, 22) (26, 10) (9, 22) (9, 4) (9, 19) (4, 9) (4, 20) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 15) (20, 16) (20, 4) (10, 26) (10, 3) (12, 11) (12, 22) (12, 24) (12, 29) (24, 11) (24, 8) (24, 12) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 19) (29, 23) (29, 18) (29, 12) (1, 2) (1, 25) (1, 13) (14, 19) (14, 25) (14, 5) (15, 23) (15, 17) (15, 5) (15, 28) (25, 1) (25, 14) (25, 5) (25, 28) (6, 2) (6, 13) (5, 14) (5, 15) (5, 25) (28, 7) (28, 15) (28, 25) (19, 27) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 14) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 10, 23)>
<1, (2, 13, 25)>
<2, (1, 6, 18)>
<3, (0, 10, 19)>
<8, (17, 24, 8)>
<12, (11, 22, 29)>
<15, (5, 15, 28)>
<27, (0, 7, 19)>
