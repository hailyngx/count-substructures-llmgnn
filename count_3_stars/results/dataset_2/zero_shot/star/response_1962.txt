Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 15) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 16) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 19) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 15) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 2) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 15) (4, 3) (4, 6) (1, 17) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 7) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 13) (16, 9) (16, 2) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 14) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 4) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (12, 10) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 6) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 5, 17)>
<2, (11, 16, 9)>
<10, (8, 12, 19)>
<1, (0, 7, 13)>
<8, (10, 7, 12)>
<11, (2, 14, 9)>
<7, (1, 19, 13)>
<14, (6, 15, 11)>
<15, (5, 17, 14)>
