Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 11) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 14) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 12) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<1, (7, 11, 13)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (8, 12, 14)>
<7, (1, 9, 14)>
<8, (6, 9, 10)>
<9, (3, 6, 14)>
<10, (1, 8, 3)>
<11, (1, 5, 12)>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
