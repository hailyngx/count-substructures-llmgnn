Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 [3-star] structures in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars found: 
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<9, (5, 3, 0)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (8, 4, 0)>
<8, (6, 2, 7)>
<0, (9, 2, 7)>
