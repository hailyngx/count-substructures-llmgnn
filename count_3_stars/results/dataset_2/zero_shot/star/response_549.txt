Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (5, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 14) 

Response:
There are 3-star formations in the given graph. 

There are [6] unique 3-stars: 
<6, (9, 14, 8)>
<9, (6, 2, 11)>
<1, (9, 3, 10)>
<3, (1, 0, 12)>
<10, (1, 4, 11)>
<11, (9, 3, 10)>
