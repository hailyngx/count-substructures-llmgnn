Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 7) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 11) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 14) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 10) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of occurrences of each node as the center node and then multiplying by the number of ways to choose 3 leaf nodes from the remaining 14 nodes.

Starting with the first node and working through to the last, here are the counts for each 3-star configuration:

- Node 0: (0, 4, 5), (0, 4, 11) => 2 stars
- Node 1: (1, 4, 11), (1, 2, 12) => 2 stars
- Node 2: (2, 6, 11), (2, 7, 14) => 2 stars
- Node 3: (3, 4, 8), (3, 7, 11) => 2 stars
- Node 4: (4, 0, 3), (4, 6, 8), (4, 8, 10), (4, 10, 1) => 4 stars
- Node 6: (6, 2, 4), (6, 4, 9) => 2 stars
- Node 7: (7, 2, 10), (7, 3, 13) => 2 stars
- Node 8: (8, 4, 10), (8, 9, 14) => 2 stars
- Node 9: (9, 6, 14) => 1 star
- Node 10: (10, 4, 8), (10, 7, 14) => 2 stars
- Node 11: (11, 0, 3), (11, 1, 12), (11, 2, 7) => 3 stars
- Node 12: (12, 1, 2), (12, 11, 13) => 2 stars
- Node 13: (13, 7, 14), (13, 12, 14) => 2 stars
- Node 14: (14, 8, 9), (14, 10, 13), (14, 13, 2) => 3 stars

Adding up the counts for each node gives a total of 31 3-stars. Hence, the final answer is:  
[31]  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (4, 5, 11)>
<1, (2, 12, 4)>
<2, (6, 14, 11)>
<3, (7, 11, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 10, 14)>
<8, (4, 10, 9)>
<9, (6, 14, 4)>
<10, (4, 8, 7)>
<11, (0, 3, 4)>
<12, (1, 2, 11)>
<13, (7, 14, 10)>
<14, (8, 13, 9)>
