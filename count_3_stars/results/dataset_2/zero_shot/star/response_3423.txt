Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 9) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 0) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 10) (14, 5) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 6) 

Response:
There are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.

<4, (7, 2, 0)>
<7, (4, 0, 1)>
<8, (2, 9, 3)>
<13, (5, 11, 3)>
<2, (4, 8, 12)>
<5, (13, 12, 11)>
<3, (4, 13, 10)>
<11, (4, 13, 5)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<10, (2, 5, 3)>
