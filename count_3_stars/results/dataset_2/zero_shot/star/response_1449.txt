Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 4) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (12, 8) (12, 3) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 4) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 4, 7)>
<9, (5, 4, 11)>
<13, (8, 3, 1)>
<10, (13, 11, 6)>
<3, (8, 13, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 11)>
