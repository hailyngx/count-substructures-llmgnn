Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (7, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
