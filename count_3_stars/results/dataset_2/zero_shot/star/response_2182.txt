Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 19) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 7) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 15) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 15) (4, 10) (4, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 2) (15, 9) (15, 13) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 7) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 0) (0, 6) (0, 19) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 7) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 19) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 18) (18, 11) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 7) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 10) 

Response:
