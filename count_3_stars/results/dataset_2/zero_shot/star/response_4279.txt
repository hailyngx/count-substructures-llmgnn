Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 12) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 12) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
The central nodes of the 3-stars can be inferred from the number of edges connected to each node. Since each 3-star has one central node and three leaves, it is necessary to find the node with exactly three edges connected to it.

In the given graph, the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them are: 1, 5, and 0.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- For node 1: (1, 7), (1, 2), (1, 11) forms a 3-star with node 1 as the central node.
- For node 5: (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 12) forms a 3-star with node 5 as the central node.
- For node 0: (0, 13), (0, 9), (0, 14) forms a 3-star with node 0 as the central node.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (7, 2, 11)>, <5, (7, 6, 12)>, and <0, (13, 9, 14)>.
