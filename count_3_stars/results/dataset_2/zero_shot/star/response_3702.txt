Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 15) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 3) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 1) (17, 14) (17, 18) (6, 18) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 1) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 10) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 19) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 2) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 10) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 12) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 6) (19, 11) (19, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<11, (7, 16, 19)>
<4, (5, 9, 12)>
<0, (7, 10, 16)>
<3, (12, 13, 14)>
