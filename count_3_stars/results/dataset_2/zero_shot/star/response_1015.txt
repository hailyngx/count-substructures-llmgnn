Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 three-stars in this graph. 

[4]

The unique three-stars are:
<7, (3, 10, 11)>
<1, (6, 8, 13)>
<13, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 10, 13)>
