Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 0) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 1) 

Response:
The center node in a 3-star must have exactly 3 edges connected to it. 
Any node with 3 edges connected to it is a potential center for a 3-star.

After examining the given edges, we find that nodes 5, 9, 1, 3, 4, 0, 13, and 6 are potential center nodes for a 3-star. Let's now count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<5, (9, 13, 3)>
<9, (1, 13, 5)>
<1, (10, 14, 12)>
<3, (7, 14, 5)>
<4, (11, 0, 6)>
<0, (8, 2, 13)>
