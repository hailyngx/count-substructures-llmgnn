Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 3) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 5) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 1) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 10) (16, 17) (16, 0) (16, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 12) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 8) (11, 18) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 17) (2, 4) (2, 10) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 6) (3, 14) (3, 18) (9, 14) (9, 12) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 12) (10, 18) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 9) (12, 15) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in this graph. 
So, the answer is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<14, (17, 8, 3)>
<16, (17, 0, 6)>
<5, (4, 13, 10)>
<7, (0, 15, 19)>
