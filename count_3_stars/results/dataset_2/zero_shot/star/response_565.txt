Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 0)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
