Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 11) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 0) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 5) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 11) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

<6, (9, 14, 10)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
<1, (11, 14, 10)>
<3, (0, 14, 2)>
<4, (9, 3, 7)>
<7, (4, 12, 2)>
<12, (4, 7, 5)>
<0, (3, 14, 10)>
