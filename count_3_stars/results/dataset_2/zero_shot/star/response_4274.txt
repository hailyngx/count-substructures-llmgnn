Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

These are the unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 8, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<4, (9, 7, 0)>
<7, (6, 8, 4)>
<1, (7, 3, 2)>
<2, (1, 8, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
