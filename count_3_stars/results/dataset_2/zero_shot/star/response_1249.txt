Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 6) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 2) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 9) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 12) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

List of unique 3-stars: 
<1, (3, 5, 11)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 11)>
<13, (5, 6, 7)>
