Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 0) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 3) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 6) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 5) (9, 13) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The number of 3-stars is denoted by [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (12, 6, 14)>
<2, (8, 5, 11)>
<8, (2, 10, 14)>
<5, (2, 11, 10)>
<13, (5, 3, 1)>
