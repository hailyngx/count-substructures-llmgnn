Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 18) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 13) (13, 2) (13, 15) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 4) (4, 10) (4, 17) (12, 5) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 14) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 3) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 6) (19, 3) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 0) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 8) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 0) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the graph.

<11, (10, 14, 17)>
<16, (7, 1, 18)>
<5, (9, 12, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 18)>
<10, (11, 15, 7)>
<2, (8, 13, 6)>
<8, (9, 2, 1)>
<15, (10, 18, 13)>
