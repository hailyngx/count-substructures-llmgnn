Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 11) (6, 10) (6, 3) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 19) (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 0) (17, 1) (17, 4) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 19) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 11) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 4) (13, 16) (13, 9) (2, 15) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 16) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 3) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 4) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 19) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 0) (19, 4) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 11) (11, 5) (11, 15) (11, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 16) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars found: <0, (1, 4, 18)>, <4, (0, 10, 14)>, <7, (8, 12, 19)>, <8, (7, 12, 16)>, <10, (4, 6, 15)>
