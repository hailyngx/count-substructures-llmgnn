Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
The central node of each 3-star can be any of the 10 nodes in the graph. Let's count the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: (0, 6, 4), (0, 6, 2), (0, 6, 1) [3]
- Node 1: (1, 5, 6), (1, 5, 3), (1, 5, 0), (1, 6, 5), (1, 6, 4), (1, 6, 8), (1, 6, 0), (1, 6, 2), (1, 6, 7) [9]
- Node 2: (2, 9, 6), (2, 9, 3), (2, 9, 0), (2, 6, 9), (2, 6, 0), (2, 6, 3) [6]
- Node 3: (3, 5, 4), (3, 5, 6), (3, 5, 1), (3, 4, 9), (3, 4, 0), (3, 4, 1), (3, 4, 8), (3, 9, 6), (3, 9, 4), (3, 9, 2), (3, 6, 9) [11]
- Node 4: (4, 9, 6), (4, 9, 3), (4, 9, 0), (4, 6, 9), (4, 6, 0), (4, 6, 1) [6]
- Node 5: (5, 1, 6), (5, 1, 4), (5, 1, 0), (5, 6, 1) [4]
- Node 6: (6, 5, 1), (6, 5, 3), (6, 5, 0), (6, 5, 9), (6, 1, 5), (6, 1, 4), (6, 1, 8), (6, 1, 0), (6, 1, 2), (6, 1, 7), (6, 9, 5), (6, 9, 4), (6, 9, 2), (6, 9, 8), (6, 9, 0), (6, 4, 9), (6, 4, 0), (6, 4, 1), (6, 4, 3), (6, 8, 1), (6, 8, 3), (6, 0, 9), (6, 0, 4), (6, 0, 2), (6, 0, 1) [25]
- Node 7: (7, 3, 5), (7, 3, 4), (7, 3, 8), (7, 3, 2), (7, 3, 1) [5]
- Node 8: (8, 6, 1), (8, 6, 4), (8, 6, 3), (8, 1, 6), (8, 1, 4), (8, 1, 0), (8, 1, 7) [7]
- Node 9: (9, 6, 5), (9, 6, 1), (9, 6, 2), (9, 6, 8), (9, 6, 0), (9, 5, 6), (9, 5, 3), (9, 5, 1), (9, 4, 9), (9, 4, 0), (9, 4, 1), (9, 4, 3), (9, 2, 9), (9, 2, 6), (9, 2, 0), (9, 2, 3) [16]

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [86].
