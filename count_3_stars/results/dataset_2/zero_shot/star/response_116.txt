Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 7, 0)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<1, (6, 3, 5)>
<2, (9, 1, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, 1)>
<0, (6, 3, 2)>
<7, (6, 9, 5)>
<5, (7, 1, 4)>
<4, (9, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 9, 7)>
<9, (2, 7, 4)>
