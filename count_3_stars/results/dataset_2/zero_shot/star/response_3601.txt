Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 11) (9, 1) (26, 19) (26, 24) (15, 20) (15, 21) (27, 21) (27, 22) (27, 6) (27, 8) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 20) (29, 4) (4, 29) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 25) (7, 16) (7, 22) (8, 27) (8, 16) (8, 3) (23, 17) (23, 25) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 21) (0, 1) (20, 15) (20, 2) (20, 24) (20, 5) (17, 23) (17, 28) (17, 12) (17, 11) (19, 26) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 12) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 5) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 25) (24, 26) (24, 20) (3, 8) (3, 28) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 17) (25, 7) (25, 23) (25, 18) (28, 17) (28, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 27) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 12) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 12) (16, 22) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 16) (5, 20) (5, 14) (5, 3) (21, 15) (21, 27) (21, 0) (22, 27) (22, 7) (22, 16) (10, 4) (13, 19) (13, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by identifying nodes which have exactly 3 neighbors each. We need to check which nodes meet this condition.

Let's list the nodes and their corresponding neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 14, 21
- Node 1: 0, 6, 9
- Node 2: 6, 19, 20
- Node 3: 5, 8, 28
- Node 4: 0, 10, 18, 29
- Node 5: 3, 14, 20
- Node 6: 1, 2, 12, 27
- Node 7: 16, 22, 25
- Node 8: 3, 8, 16, 27
- Node 9: 1, 11
- Node 10: 4
- Node 11: 9, 17
- Node 12: 6, 12, 14, 16, 17
- Node 13: 14, 19
- Node 14: 0, 5, 12, 13
- Node 15: 20, 21
- Node 16: 7, 8, 12, 16, 18, 22
- Node 17: 11, 12, 19, 23, 28
- Node 18: 4, 16, 25
- Node 19: 2, 12, 13, 19, 26
- Node 20: 2, 5, 15, 20, 24
- Node 21: 0, 15, 21, 27
- Node 22: 7, 16, 22, 25, 27
- Node 23: 17, 25
- Node 24: 20, 26
- Node 25: 7, 18, 22, 23
- Node 26: 19, 24
- Node 27: 6, 8, 21, 22, 27
- Node 28: 3, 17, 28
- Node 29: 4

From the above list, we can see that the nodes which form 3-stars are:
- Node 6: 1, 2, 12
- Node 12: 6, 14, 16
- Node 16: 7, 8, 18, 22

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <6, (1, 2, 12)>, <12, (6, 14, 16)>, and <16, (7, 8, 18, 22)>.
