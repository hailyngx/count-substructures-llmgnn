Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 4) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 12)>
<8, (5, 6, 14)>
<13, (4, 10, 11)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
