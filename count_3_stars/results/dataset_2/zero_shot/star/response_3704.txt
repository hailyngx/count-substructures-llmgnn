Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 0) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (7, 15) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 1) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 17) (10, 15) (10, 12) (13, 17) (13, 0) (17, 19) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 18) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 18) (0, 16) (0, 13) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 8) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 17) (2, 9) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 18) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<11, (6, 14, 16)>
<15, (3, 7, 10)>
<12, (4, 7, 18)>
<5, (1, 6, 19)>
<0, (13, 16, 8)>
<2, (9, 17, 19)>
