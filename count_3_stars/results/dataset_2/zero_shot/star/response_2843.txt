Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 21) (16, 7) (16, 24) (16, 17) (16, 8) (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 18) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 27) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 17) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 10) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 14) (1, 10) (22, 6) (22, 5) (23, 7) (23, 29) (12, 2) (12, 10) (27, 9) (27, 25) (27, 4) (27, 17) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 8) (20, 1) (20, 0) (20, 18) (14, 1) (14, 0) (19, 26) (19, 2) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 8) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 7) (4, 27) (4, 15) (15, 4) (15, 13) (7, 16) (7, 23) (7, 28) (7, 24) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 21) (24, 16) (24, 7) (17, 16) (17, 3) (17, 27) (13, 25) (13, 15) (13, 29) (5, 22) (5, 18) (5, 21) (18, 6) (18, 20) (18, 5) (18, 10) (10, 25) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 18) (29, 23) (29, 0) (29, 13) (29, 21) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 26) (21, 11) (21, 2) (21, 5) (21, 29) 

Response:
There are 11 unique 3-stars in the graph. Here they are listed within brackets:

[<5, (22, 18, 21)>, <6, (9, 22, 18)>, <7, (23, 24, 28)>, <10, (25, 1, 12)>, <13, (25, 15, 29)>, <16, (8, 6, 24)>, <17, (27, 3, 17)>, <18, (18, 6, 5)>, <20, (0, 14, 20)>, <21, (2, 21, 29)>, <29, (13, 0, 29)>]
