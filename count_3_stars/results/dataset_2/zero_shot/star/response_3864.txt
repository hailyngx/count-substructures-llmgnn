Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 2, 7)>
<4, (3, 1, 6)>
<7, (5, 9, 0)>
<1, (5, 4, 2)>
<3, (4, 0, 2)>
<8, (5, 7, 6)>
<0, (9, 7, 8)>
