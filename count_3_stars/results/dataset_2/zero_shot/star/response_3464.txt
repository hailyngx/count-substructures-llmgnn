Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 18) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 1) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 2) (16, 15) (16, 9) (17, 4) (17, 13) (17, 5) (19, 10) (19, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 18) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 16) (10, 19) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 1) (2, 15) (2, 6) (18, 8) (18, 3) (5, 17) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [16] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:

<6, (2, 4, 15)>
<9, (15, 16, 7)>
<10, (1, 12, 19)>
<2, (6, 15, 2)>
<18, (8, 3, 18)>
<5, (3, 11, 14)>
<11, (0, 5, 14)>
