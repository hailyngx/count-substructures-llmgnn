Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) 

Response:
