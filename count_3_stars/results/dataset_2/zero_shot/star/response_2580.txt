Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 6) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 4) 

Response:
