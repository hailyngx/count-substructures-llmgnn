Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] unique 3-stars in the provided graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (5, 1, 2)>
<6, (5, 1, 4)>
<6, (5, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (8, 7, 3)>
<9, (8, 7, 4)>
<9, (8, 3, 4)>
<9, (7, 3, 4)>
<4, (6, 9, 5)>
<4, (6, 9, 3)>
