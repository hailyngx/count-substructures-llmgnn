Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 20) (0, 10) (0, 23) (27, 2) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 29) (13, 8) (13, 3) (23, 0) (23, 8) (23, 20) (23, 12) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 23) (20, 29) (20, 12) (14, 11) (14, 5) (4, 24) (4, 29) (18, 21) (18, 1) (18, 3) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 18) (26, 28) (26, 5) (26, 25) (28, 26) (28, 17) (28, 9) (28, 22) (5, 14) (5, 26) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 6) (1, 18) (1, 22) (15, 5) (15, 12) (29, 8) (29, 20) (29, 4) (29, 25) (6, 19) (6, 21) (6, 16) (21, 18) (21, 6) (21, 22) (2, 27) (2, 22) (2, 25) (22, 28) (22, 1) (22, 21) (22, 2) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 6) (16, 24) (24, 4) (24, 16) (24, 25) (9, 28) (9, 25) (25, 26) (25, 29) (25, 2) (25, 24) (25, 9) (12, 23) (12, 20) (12, 15) (7, 5) (7, 17) (17, 28) (17, 7) 

Response:
The central nodes of the 3-stars must have a degree of 3. Checking the degrees of all nodes:

Node 0: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 3  
Node 2: degree 4  
Node 3: degree 4  
Node 4: degree 3  
Node 5: degree 5  
Node 6: degree 3  
Node 7: degree 2  
Node 8: degree 4  
Node 9: degree 3  
Node 10: degree 2  
Node 11: degree 3  
Node 12: degree 3  
Node 13: degree 2  
Node 14: degree 2  
Node 15: degree 2  
Node 16: degree 4  
Node 17: degree 2  
Node 18: degree 4  
Node 19: degree 3  
Node 20: degree 4  
Node 21: degree 3  
Node 22: degree 4  
Node 23: degree 4  
Node 24: degree 3  
Node 25: degree 4  
Node 26: degree 3  
Node 27: degree 2  
Node 28: degree 5  
Node 29: degree 4  

By observing the degrees, we can see the only nodes that can be central nodes of a 3-star are: 1, 4, 6, 12, 19, 21, 27, so we will consider only these nodes. 

The 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (18, 21, 22)>
<4, (24, 25, 29)>
<6, (16, 19, 21)>
<6, (21, 18, 1)>
<12, (15, 20, 23)>
<19, (5, 16, 6)>
<19, (16, 10, 0)>
<21, (18, 1, 22)>
<21, (22, 2, 25)>
<27, (2, 25, 26)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
