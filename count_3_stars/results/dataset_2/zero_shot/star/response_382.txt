Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 7) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 5) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 16) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (19, 11) (19, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 9) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 16) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 18) (7, 13) (7, 10) (7, 5) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 18) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 11) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 18) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 0) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<8, (13, 4, 12)>
<13, (15, 7, 8)>
<10, (17, 2, 7)>
<4, (5, 16, 8)>
<5, (17, 2, 4)>
<1, (15, 6, 9)>
