Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 17) (16, 4) (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 19) (10, 11) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 17) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 18) (13, 14) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 6) (2, 15) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (15, 11) (15, 14) (15, 2) (6, 19) (6, 12) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
