Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars present in the given graph. The count is as follows:

[7]

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 1, 8)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
<1, (6, 3, 2)>
<3, (1, 0, 4)>
<0, (9, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 0, 4)>
<7, (9, 0, 8)>
