Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<5, (9, 4, 6)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>
<4, (5, 0, 3)>
<7, (9, 8, _)>
<1, (3, 2, 8)>
<2, (4, 1, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
