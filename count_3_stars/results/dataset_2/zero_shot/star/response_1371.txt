Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 15) (22, 13) (22, 2) (22, 11) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 26) (15, 13) (15, 3) (15, 11) (8, 24) (8, 10) (8, 17) (23, 11) (23, 21) (23, 12) (0, 3) (0, 20) (0, 11) (20, 0) (20, 14) (20, 6) (7, 12) (7, 26) (7, 5) (12, 23) (12, 7) (12, 16) (6, 20) (6, 28) (28, 6) (28, 18) (28, 10) (19, 1) (19, 16) (26, 3) (26, 7) (26, 24) (24, 8) (24, 26) (24, 10) (24, 29) (4, 27) (4, 2) (27, 4) (27, 18) (27, 1) (16, 12) (16, 19) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 29) (9, 25) (29, 24) (29, 9) (29, 10) (11, 22) (11, 15) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 1) (2, 13) (2, 22) (2, 4) (2, 14) (18, 28) (18, 27) (18, 21) (25, 9) (25, 10) (14, 20) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 21) (1, 19) (1, 27) (1, 11) (21, 23) (21, 18) (21, 14) (21, 17) (17, 8) (17, 21) (10, 8) (10, 28) (10, 24) (10, 29) (10, 25) 

Response:
There are multiple 3-stars in this graph. Let's identify each unique 3-star and then count the total number of 3-stars.

The 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (3, 11, 20)>
<1, (19, 11, 27)>
<2, (4, 13, 14)>
<5, (7, 14, 21)>
<6, (20, 28, 6)>
<8, (10, 24, 8)>
<9, (25, 10, 29)>
<12, (7, 16, 23)>
<15, (11, 13, 15)>
<17, (8, 21, 17)>
<18, (27, 18, 21)>
<19, (1, 16, 19)>
<22, (2, 11, 22)>
<23, (11, 12, 23)>
<26, (3, 7, 26)>
<27, (1, 18, 27)>
<28, (10, 18, 28)>
<29, (9, 10, 29)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get:
[18]
