Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (17, 19) (17, 5) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 16) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 16) (18, 7) (18, 6) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 0) (11, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 15) (14, 5) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 15) (9, 1) (9, 13) (15, 12) (15, 14) (15, 16) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 19) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 18) (19, 17) (19, 14) (19, 16) (19, 0) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows, with their respective central nodes and leaf nodes:
[<10, (3, 4, 8)> <12, (1, 3, 6)> <7, (2, 13, 18)> <2, (7, 8, 16)> <8, (2, 6, 10)> <4, (5, 10, 16)> <1, (0, 9, 12)> <3, (5, 10, 12)> <14, (3, 5, 15)> <16, (2, 4, 15)> <9, (1, 13, 9)> <15, (12, 14, 16)> <5, (3, 4, 17)> <0, (1, 19, 0)> <13, (7, 9, 11)> <6, (8, 12, 18)> <17, (5, 19, 17)> <11, (13, 11, 19)>]
[<1, (0, 9, 12)> <14, (3, 5, 15)> <7, (2, 13, 18)>] 

There are 18 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [18].
