Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 1) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 11) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 10) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 3) (13, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by checking the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes step by step:

1. Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8) <5, (9, 6, 8)>, (5, 12), (5, 10) <5, (9, 12, 10)>
2. Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 2) <9, (5, 4, 2)>, (9, 14) <9, (5, 4, 14)>, (9, 1) <9, (5, 14, 1)>, (9, 12) <9, (5, 1, 12)>
3. Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 7) <4, (9, 7, 11)>, (4, 11) <4, (7, 11, 9)>
4. Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 12) <7, (4, 12, 11)>, (7, 11) <7, (4, 12, 11)>, (7, 10) <7, (10, 11, 12)>
5. Node 1: (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 14) <1, (9, 3, 14)>, (1, 12) <1, (9, 3, 12)>
6. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 14) <3, (1, 14, 6)>, (3, 6) <3, (1, 6, 11)>, (3, 13) <3, (6, 2, 13)>, (3, 8) <3, (6, 8, 5)>
7. Node 12: (12, 5), (12, 9) <12, (5, 7, 1)>, (12, 7) <12, (7, 11, 1)>, (12, 1) <12, (9, 14, 1)>
8. Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 3) <6, (5, 3, 11)>, (6, 11) <6, (3, 11, 7)>
9. Node 0: (0, 10), (0, 8) <0, (10, 8, 2)>, (0, 2) <0, (10, 8, 2)>
10. Node 10: (10, 5), (10, 7) <10, (5, 7, 8)>, (10, 0) <10, (5, 7, 0)>, (10, 8) <10, (5, 7, 0)>
11. Node 11: (11, 4), (11, 7) <11, (4, 7, 6)>, (11, 6) <11, (4, 6, 3)>, (11, 14) <11, (6, 14, 4)>
12. Node 14: (14, 9), (14, 1), (14, 3) <14, (9, 1, 3)>, (14, 11) <14, (9, 1, 3)>, (14, 2) <14, (1, 2, 3)>
13. Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 3) <8, (5, 3, 10)>, (8, 0) <8, (5, 10, 0)>, (8, 10) <8, (5, 10, 0)>
14. Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 0) <2, (9, 0, 13)>, (2, 14) <2, (9, 0, 13)>, (2, 13) <2, (9, 0, 13)>
15. Node 13: (13, 3), (13, 2)

Based on the analysis above, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars are <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (9, 12, 10)>, and <14, (9, 1, 3)>.
