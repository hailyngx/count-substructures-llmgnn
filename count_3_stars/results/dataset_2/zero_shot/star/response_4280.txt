Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 0) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated only from the number of edges. Since each 3-star consists of a center connected to three other nodes, we can count each 3-star by looking at the number of edges incident to each node.

Let's calculate it:
- Node 5 has 3 edges incident to it: (5,9), (5,12), (5,10)
- Node 9 has 5 edges incident to it: (9,5), (9,2), (9,11), (9,14), (9,12)
- Node 10 has 4 edges incident to it: (10,5), (10,11), (10,1), (10,14)
- Node 11 has 6 edges incident to it: (11,9), (11,10), (11,3), (11,14), (11,13), (11,2)
- Node 4 has 2 edges incident to it: (4,13), (4,14)
- Node 8 has 3 edges incident to it: (8,14), (8,0), (8,1)
- Node 6 has 2 edges incident to it: (6,1), (6,7)
- Node 2 has 4 edges incident to it: (2,9), (2,11), (2,1), (2,7)
- Node 7 has 6 edges incident to it: (7,6), (7,2), (7,12), (7,3), (7,13), (7,1)
- Node 12 has 5 edges incident to it: (12,5), (12,9), (12,7), (12,14), (12,0)
- Node 3 has 2 edges incident to it: (3,11), (3,7)
- Node 1 has 6 edges incident to it: (1,10), (1,8), (1,6), (1,2), (1,7), (1,0)
- Node 0 has 3 edges incident to it: (0,8), (0,12), (0,1)
- Node 14 has 6 edges incident to it: (14,9), (14,10), (14,11), (14,4), (14,8), (14,12)
- Node 13 has 3 edges incident to it: (13,11), (13,4), (13,7)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by looking at each node's incident edges:

- Node 5 and its incident nodes: <5, (9, 12, 10)>
- Node 9 and its incident nodes: <9, (5, 2, 11)>, <9, (10, 11, 14)>, <9, (11, 2, 14)>, <9, (9, 12, 14)>, <9, (9, 11, 14)>
- Node 10 and its incident nodes: <10, (5, 11, 14)>, <10, (11, 1, 14)>
- Node 11 and its incident nodes: <11, (9, 10, 14)>, <11, (10, 13, 11)>, <11, (10, 2, 11)>, <11, (9, 14, 11)>, <11, (14, 4, 13)>, <11, (14, 7, 13)>
- Node 7 and its incident nodes: <7, (6, 2, 1)>, <7, (2, 12, 7)>, <7, (12, 3, 7)>, <7, (7, 13, 1)>, <7, (13, 11, 7)>, <7, (13, 4, 7)>
- Node 14 and its incident nodes: <14, (9, 10, 11)>, <14, (10, 4, 14)>, <14, (11, 13, 14)>, <14, (4, 8, 14)>, <14, (8, 12, 14)>, <14, (12, 0, 14)>, <14, (9, 12, 14)>
- Node 1 and its incident nodes: <1, (10, 8, 0)>, <1, (8, 6, 1)>, <1, (6, 7, 1)>, <1, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 1)>, <1, (7, 0, 1)>
- Node 12 and its incident nodes: <12, (5, 7, 0)>, <12, (9, 7, 14)>, <12, (7, 14, 0)>
- Node 13 and its incident nodes: <13, (11, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
