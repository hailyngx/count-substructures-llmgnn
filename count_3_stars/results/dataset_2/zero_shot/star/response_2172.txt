Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 16) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 10) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 5) (17, 2) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 19) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 11) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 15) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 12) (11, 14) (11, 13) (12, 19) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 17) (5, 17) (5, 15) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 5) (10, 9) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 0)
