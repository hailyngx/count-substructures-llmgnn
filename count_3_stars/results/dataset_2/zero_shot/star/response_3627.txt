Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
There are 9 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are listed below:

<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<4, (5, 1, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 3)>
<6, (9, 1, 3)>
<1, (6, 2, 4)>
<3, (9, 6, 0)>
<7, (4, 9, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
