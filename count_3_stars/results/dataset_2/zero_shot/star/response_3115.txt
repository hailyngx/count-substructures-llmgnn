Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 14) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

Unique 3-stars: 
<4, (3, 7, 11)>
<7, (2, 8, 10)>
<11, (4, 9, 14)>
<8, (1, 5, 13)>
<12, (1, 2, 6)>
