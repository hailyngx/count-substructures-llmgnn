Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 19) (11, 17) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 16) (18, 13) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 3) (1, 7) (1, 19) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 7) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 5) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 0) (14, 2) (14, 4) (14, 13) (12, 8) (12, 16) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 12) (0, 15) (0, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (7, 1) (7, 17) (13, 18) (13, 4) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (8, 13, 14)>
<5, (8, 10, 16)>
<7, (1, 11, 17)>
<9, (6, 10, 17)>
<15, (0, 8, 10)>
