Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 4) (10, 17) (10, 9) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 12) (4, 13) (4, 15) (18, 9) (18, 3) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (5, 15) (5, 14) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 16) (19, 6) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 11) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 1) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 9) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 12) (9, 11) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 19) (14, 7) (14, 5) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 9) 

Response:
