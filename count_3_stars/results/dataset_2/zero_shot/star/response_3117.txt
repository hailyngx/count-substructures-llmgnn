Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 19) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 15) (13, 16) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (8, 16) (8, 17) (9, 18) (9, 14) (9, 1) (12, 16) (12, 11) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 19) (18, 14) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 10) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 12) (16, 17) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 11) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 6) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 3) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 10) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 10) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (14, 9) (14, 18) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 15) (11, 6) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars found: 
<4, (2, 10, 1)>
