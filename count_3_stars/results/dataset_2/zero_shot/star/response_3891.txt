Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 23) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 28) (9, 24) (20, 25) (20, 13) (25, 20) (25, 26) (25, 15) (25, 11) (28, 9) (28, 29) (28, 4) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 13) (4, 28) (4, 18) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 27) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 10) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 7) (22, 21) (1, 2) (17, 5) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 15) (3, 21) (3, 23) (11, 25) (11, 26) (11, 21) (11, 12) (21, 22) (21, 3) (21, 11) (26, 25) (26, 11) (26, 2) (26, 16) (10, 14) (10, 23) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 26) (2, 27) (2, 15) (7, 22) (7, 16) (7, 27) (16, 26) (16, 7) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 24) (24, 9) (24, 6) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 3) (23, 10) (13, 20) (13, 29) (13, 15) (12, 11) (8, 15) (19, 29) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 17) (27, 18) (27, 2) (27, 7) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<9, (5, 22, 28)>
<28, (9, 4, 29)>
<4, (18, 28, 6)>
<18, (9, 4, 27)>
<0, (14, 19, 10)>
<25, (20, 11, 15)>
<2, (22, 26, 27)>
