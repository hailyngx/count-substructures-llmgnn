Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 14) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 6) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) 

Response:
There is one unique 3-star in the given graph:

<5, (9, 13, 10)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
