Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in this graph:

<5, (2, 1, 3)>
<6, (7, 2, 4)>
<0, (2, 7, 3)>
<2, (5, 6, 4)>
<7, (6, 5, 1)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 0, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
