Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 21) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 24) (27, 22) (27, 10) (27, 2) (27, 1) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 23) (7, 22) (3, 26) (3, 25) (3, 21) (25, 3) (25, 5) (25, 0) (20, 19) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 29) (13, 8) (13, 18) (13, 6) (2, 9) (2, 27) (2, 8) (17, 29) (17, 23) (29, 8) (29, 17) (29, 22) (29, 12) (22, 26) (22, 27) (22, 7) (22, 29) (22, 14) (11, 28) (11, 6) (28, 8) (28, 11) (28, 10) (24, 26) (24, 15) (24, 16) (6, 15) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 12) (21, 9) (21, 3) (21, 10) (5, 25) (5, 23) (5, 0) (23, 7) (23, 17) (23, 5) (10, 27) (10, 28) (10, 21) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 13) (16, 4) (16, 24) (14, 22) (1, 27) (1, 4) (0, 25) (0, 5) (0, 19) (19, 20) (19, 0) (19, 12) (12, 29) (12, 6) (12, 19) 

Response:
The central node and its connected leaves form a 3-star. Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

[15]

The unique 3-stars are:
<9, (26, 18, 2)>
<26, (22, 24, 3)>
<15, (18, 6, 24)>
<27, (22, 10, 1)>
<4, (7, 1, 16)>
<3, (25, 21, 26)>
<25, (5, 0, 3)>
<8, (13, 28, 2)>
<13, (18, 6, 8)>
<2, (27, 8, 9)>
<17, (29, 23, 22)>
<29, (17, 22, 8)>
<22, (27, 7, 26)>
<11, (28, 6, 8)>
<5, (23, 0, 25)>
