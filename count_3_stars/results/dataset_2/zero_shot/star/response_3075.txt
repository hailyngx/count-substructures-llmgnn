Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) 

Response:
There are [32] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 4, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 1)>
<7, (5, 4, 0)>
<0, (9, 4, 2)>
<2, (9, 4, 8)>
<8, (9, 2, 1)>
<1, (9, 2, 8)>
<6, (3, 2, 0)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
