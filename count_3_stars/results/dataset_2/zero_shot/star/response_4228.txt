Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. The final answer is [5].

The 3-stars are:
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
