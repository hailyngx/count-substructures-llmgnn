Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 8, 14)>
<1, (4, 6, 14)>
<2, (3, 6, 10)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 11, 14)>
<5, (13, 14, 9)>
<7, (11, 12, 13)>
<9, (5, 8, 14)>
<10, (2, 11, 12)>
