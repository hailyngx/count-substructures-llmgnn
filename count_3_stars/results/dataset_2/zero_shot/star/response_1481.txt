Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 24) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 3) (3, 22) (3, 21) (3, 0) (6, 25) (6, 19) (9, 26) (9, 25) (9, 16) (18, 22) (18, 27) (18, 17) (26, 9) (26, 28) (26, 11) (26, 8) (2, 29) (2, 1) (2, 20) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 23) (29, 24) (29, 11) (23, 22) (23, 29) (23, 28) (7, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 28) (12, 14) (28, 26) (28, 23) (28, 12) (28, 17) (21, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (24, 13) (24, 2) (24, 29) (24, 4) (11, 26) (11, 29) (11, 14) (11, 19) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 8) (5, 25) (5, 16) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 20) (25, 6) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 4) (17, 18) (17, 28) (17, 0) (17, 4) (8, 26) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 25) (16, 9) (16, 5) (27, 18) (4, 24) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 17) (20, 2) (20, 19) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<2, (29, 24, 11)>
<4, (24, 29, 4)>
<5, (25, 6, 16)>
<6, (25, 9, 19)>
<7, (12, 28, 8)>
<10, (1, 19, 8)>
<13, (24, 29, 13)>
<14, (11, 12, 14)>
<17, (4, 0, 17)>
<18, (22, 18, 27)>
<20, (2, 20, 19)>
<21, (3, 22, 21)>
<26, (9, 26, 8)>
<28, (26, 23, 28)>

Therefore, there are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
