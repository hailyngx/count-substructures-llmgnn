Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 0) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 4) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 13) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (9, 1, 13)>
<10, (8, 2, 14)>
<7, (11, 12, 0)>
<12, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (8, 10, 12)>
<8, (9, 10, 5)>
<0, (7, 14, 1)>
