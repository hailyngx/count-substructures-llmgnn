Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 5) 

Response:
There are <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, and <3, (0, 4, 5)> 3-stars in this graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
