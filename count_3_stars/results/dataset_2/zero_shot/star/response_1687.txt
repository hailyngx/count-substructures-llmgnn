Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 14) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 9) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 10, 11)>
<13, (5, 10, 12)>
<5, (0, 10, 14)>
<6, (3, 8, 14)>
<12, (0, 7, 13)>
