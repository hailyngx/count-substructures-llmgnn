Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 3) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 5) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 10) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 10) (11, 1) (11, 7) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 9) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 4, 12)>
<6, (2, 13, 14)>
<1, (0, 13, 6)>
<3, (4, 8, 12)>
<13, (0, 6, 14)>
<4, (3, 5, 12)>
<0, (1, 13, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 12)>
<2, (1, 6, 14)>
<10, (2, 7, 9)>
