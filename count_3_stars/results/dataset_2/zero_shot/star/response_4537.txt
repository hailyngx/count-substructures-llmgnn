Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 12) (13, 24) (22, 28) (0, 27) (0, 25) (0, 18) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 7) (27, 19) (2, 19) (2, 20) (2, 14) (8, 25) (17, 29) (17, 9) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 21) (26, 25) (26, 6) (26, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (18, 0) (6, 26) (6, 21) (6, 20) (21, 13) (21, 29) (21, 6) (21, 16) (21, 23) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 16) (19, 27) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 5) (19, 7) (15, 25) (16, 21) (16, 5) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 10) (28, 22) (28, 24) (28, 23) (7, 27) (7, 19) (7, 11) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 9) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 12) (14, 2) (14, 12) (12, 13) (12, 26) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 20) (20, 2) (20, 6) (20, 12) (20, 24) (9, 17) (9, 11) (9, 23) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 23) (24, 13) (24, 27) (24, 28) (24, 20) (23, 21) (23, 28) (23, 9) (23, 10) (25, 0) (25, 8) (25, 26) (25, 15) 

Response:
