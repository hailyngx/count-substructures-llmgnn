Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 11) (18, 14) (18, 22) (18, 20) (18, 0) (18, 3) (22, 18) (22, 4) (22, 5) (20, 18) (20, 21) (25, 19) (25, 15) (25, 0) (25, 12) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 27) (13, 5) (1, 26) (1, 12) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 7) (28, 26) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 12) (5, 14) (5, 22) (5, 13) (6, 16) (6, 27) (21, 20) (19, 14) (19, 25) (19, 23) (23, 19) (0, 18) (0, 25) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 24) (10, 26) (10, 0) (10, 3) (4, 22) (4, 24) (4, 16) (7, 14) (7, 26) (7, 11) (7, 15) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 24) (24, 0) (24, 4) (24, 16) (24, 9) (27, 8) (27, 29) (27, 6) (3, 18) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 25) (15, 7) (15, 11) (2, 11) (9, 11) (9, 24) (12, 25) (12, 1) (12, 29) (12, 3)
