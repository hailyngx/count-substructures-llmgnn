Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 4) (15, 11) (8, 2) (8, 17) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 18) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 15) (11, 7) (0, 10) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 16) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (5, 13) (5, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 17) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 16) (19, 13) (19, 1) (19, 12) (16, 14) (16, 6) (16, 18) (17, 8) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 4) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 17) (9, 10) (9, 17) (18, 13) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 12) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 18) 

Response:
There are [(15)] 3-star(s) in the given graph.
