Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 13) (16, 8) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 16) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (18, 7) (18, 17) (18, 13) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 18) (7, 14) (7, 2) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 14) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (6, 8) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 18) (17, 6) (17, 12) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 14) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 12) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 12) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 9) (12, 5) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 19) (13, 16) (13, 18) (13, 10) (19, 14) 

Response:
There are 10 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed:

1. <0, (2, 5, 11)>
2. <1, (2, 14, 15)>
3. <2, (0, 7, 14)>
4. <4, (2, 8, 8)>
5. <5, (0, 3, 12)>
6. <7, (2, 14, 18)>
7. <8, (4, 10, 16)>
8. <9, (11, 12, 15)>
9. <10, (8, 12, 13)>
10. <13, (10, 16, 18)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
