Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 15) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 5) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 13) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 15) (0, 18) (0, 13) (14, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (3, 11) (3, 10) (1, 16) (1, 14) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 13) (13, 18) (13, 0) (13, 9) (13, 17) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (10, 18) (10, 3) (10, 4) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 4) (19, 16)
