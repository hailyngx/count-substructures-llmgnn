Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 5) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 7) (10, 15) (10, 6) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 6) (12, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 5) (16, 3) (16, 18) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 15) (5, 14) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 13) (9, 0) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 7) (0, 2) (0, 19) (0, 9) (0, 13) (8, 17) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 13) (7, 18) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is as follows: [7]

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (15, 17, 10)>
<4, (6, 14, 9)>
<6, (1, 11, 10)>
<9, (4, 19, 13)>
<10, (15, 6, 1)>
<13, (9, 7, 0)>
<15, (1, 10, 18)>
