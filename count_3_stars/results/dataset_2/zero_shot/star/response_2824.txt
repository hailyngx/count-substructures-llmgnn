Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 7) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 19) (4, 13) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 14) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 16) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (11, 14) (11, 18) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 2) (12, 14) (12, 8) (10, 13) (10, 7) (7, 17) (7, 5) (7, 10) (19, 13) (19, 0) (6, 17) (6, 4) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 16) (1, 5) 

Response:
There are [10] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<15, (3, 9, 5)>
<14, (17, 11, 18)>
<17, (14, 6, 5)>
<8, (13, 9, 12)>
<13, (8, 5, 4)>
<4, (13, 18, 6)>
<18, (14, 4, 16)>
<5, (15, 17, 13)>
<9, (15, 8, 0)>
<0, (9, 16, 19)>
