Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 14) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (12, 3) (12, 0) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Thus, the number of 3-stars is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<6, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (3, 11, 13)>
<3, (1, 11, 7)>
<0, (9, 11, 8)>
