Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Here they are listed inside <>:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
