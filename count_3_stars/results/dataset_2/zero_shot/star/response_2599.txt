Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
