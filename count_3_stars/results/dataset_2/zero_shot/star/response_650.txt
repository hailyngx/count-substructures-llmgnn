Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 9) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (5, 19) (5, 16) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 6) (8, 17) (8, 6) (0, 7) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 9) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 12) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 13) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 1) (3, 4) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 18) (13, 16) (13, 9) (13, 12) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 15) (18, 1) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs present in the given graph are as follows:
<4, (7, 12, 15)>
<9, (14, 19, 13)>
<11, (14, 1, 2)>
<12, (4, 15, 1)>
<13, (16, 9, 12)>
<15, (4, 10, 18)>
<18, (10, 6, 1)>
<19, (14, 5, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
