Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 5) (12, 11) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 11, 7)>
<10, (5, 11, 13)>
<11, (9, 10, 12)>
<2, (1, 14, 7)>
<8, (9, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 0)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
<12, (5, 11, 11)>
<1, (2, 14, 13)>
