Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 8, 2)>
<1, (5, 6, 2)>
<2, (4, 8, 1)>
<3, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (8, 2, 6)>
<5, (6, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
