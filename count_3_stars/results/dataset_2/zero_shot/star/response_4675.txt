Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
