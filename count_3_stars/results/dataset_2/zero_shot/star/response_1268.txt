Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 8, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
