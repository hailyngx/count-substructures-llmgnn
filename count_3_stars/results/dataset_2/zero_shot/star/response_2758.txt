Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 6, 2)>
<1, (5, 8, 6)>
<3, (9, 4, 6)>
<3, (9, 1, 8)>
<4, (9, 3, 7)>
<5, (6, 8, 2)>
