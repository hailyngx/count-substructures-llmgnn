Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (2, 9) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 8) (8, 18) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 5) (1, 0) (1, 16) (1, 5) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 4) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 13) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 19) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 17) (4, 12) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 15) (7, 16) (7, 5) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 15) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 16) (15, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 16) (5, 14) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 15) (19, 14) (19, 13) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

1. <2, (9, 18, 15)>
2. <4, (9, 14, 17)>
3. <5, (14, 1, 15)>
4. <6, (9, 10, 3)>
5. <7, (5, 16, 1)>
6. <8, (18, 11, 15)>
7. <9, (6, 4, 2)>
8. <10, (6, 3, 16)>
9. <11, (8, 3, 13)>
10. <12, (4, 17, 15)>
11. <13, (17, 11, 19)>
12. <14, (9, 0, 5)>
13. <15, (18, 12, 5)>
14. <16, (1, 10, 7)>
15. <17, (13, 4, 12)>
16. <18, (15, 2, 8)>
17. <19, (14, 13, 9)>

There are a total of [17] 3-stars in the given graph.
