Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (7, 9, 6)>
<4, (5, 3, 2)>
<1, (3, 0, 8)>
<3, (1, 9, 4)>
<6, (9, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 3)>
<5, (8, 2, 0)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 5)>
<2, (7, 9, 5)>
