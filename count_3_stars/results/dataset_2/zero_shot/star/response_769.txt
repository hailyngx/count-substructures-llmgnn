Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 13) (11, 5) (11, 9) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 10) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 1) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (8, 2, 1)>, <2, (4, 0, 3)>, <4, (9, 13, 14)>, and <5, (6, 11, 12)>.
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
