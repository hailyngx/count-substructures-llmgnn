Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 10) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 1) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 14) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) 

Response:
