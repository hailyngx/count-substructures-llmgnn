Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 2) (15, 8) (15, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 17) (2, 4) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (17, 2) (17, 4) (17, 7) (10, 5) (10, 19) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (7, 17) (7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 18) (16, 7) (12, 15) (12, 13) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 18) (19, 1) (19, 10) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 4) (14, 18) (14, 4) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 14) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 17) (4, 13) (4, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 6, 11)>
<1, (5, 13, 19)>
<2, (4, 13, 17)>
<4, (0, 13, 17)>
<5, (1, 10, 11)>
<7, (9, 16, 18)>
<8, (6, 9, 15)>
<9, (7, 11, 13)>
