Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 2) (2, 17) (2, 1) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 0) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 8) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 11) (5, 15) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 19) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 10) (0, 18) (0, 16) (0, 13) (8, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (19, 6) (19, 3) (16, 0) (16, 13) (11, 18) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 19) (9, 11) (9, 15) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 9) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 8) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 16) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here they are listed inside angle brackets <>:
<3, (14, 17, 19)>
<4, (14, 18, 13)>
<10, (12, 8, 6)>
<11, (18, 4, 9)>
<12, (1, 8, 10)>
<15, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
