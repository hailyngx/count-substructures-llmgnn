Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 27) (22, 17) (23, 26) (23, 14) (23, 28) (23, 19) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 25) (1, 26) (1, 25) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 10) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 10) (21, 19) (21, 24) (28, 23) (28, 9) (28, 14) (28, 25) (27, 22) (27, 11) (7, 0) (7, 6) (25, 18) (25, 1) (25, 28) (25, 14) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 16) (17, 22) (17, 18) (17, 20) (20, 17) (20, 6) (0, 7) (0, 29) (0, 9) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 24) (11, 2) (11, 27) (11, 14) (14, 23) (14, 28) (14, 25) (14, 11) (14, 5) (12, 16) (12, 29) (12, 8) (10, 26) (10, 4) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 28) (9, 0) (9, 13) (6, 7) (6, 20) (24, 4) (24, 21) (24, 16) (24, 5) (24, 19) (29, 0) (29, 12) (29, 3) (19, 23) (19, 4) (19, 21) (19, 15) (19, 24) (3, 29) (8, 12) (5, 14) (5, 24) (13, 15) (13, 9) 

Response:
There are 14 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:
<2, (18, 4, 9)>
<4, (18, 10, 24)>
<9, (2, 18, 0)>
<18, (2, 4, 17)>
<16, (15, 12, 24)>
<26, (23, 1, 10)>
<14, (23, 11, 25)>
<12, (16, 29, 8)>
<29, (0, 3, 12)>
<0, (7, 9, 29)>
<6, (7, 20, 6)>
<24, (4, 5, 19)>
<15, (19, 16, 13)>
<28, (23, 14, 25)>

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
