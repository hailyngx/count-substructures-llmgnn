Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 3) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 12) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 7) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 4) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 3) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 2) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 5) (16, 17) (16, 7) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 18) (18, 19) (18, 12) (18, 14) (11, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (14, 6) (14, 15) (14, 18) (4, 17) (4, 0) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 4) (5, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (9, 8, 6)>
<1, (0, 7, 15)>
<7, (5, 16, 13)>
<13, (11, 17, 19)>
<12, (2, 8, 10)>
<18, (14, 12, 19)>
<17, (4, 16, 13)>
<14, (18, 15, 6)>
