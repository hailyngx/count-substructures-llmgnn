Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 6) (15, 2) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 19) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 19) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 9) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 5) (16, 0) (16, 2) (12, 4) (12, 18) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 5) (9, 18) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 7) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 17) (6, 15) (6, 7) (6, 17) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 6) (2, 15) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 13) (13, 3) (13, 18) (13, 2) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 14) (10, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by identifying nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, the nodes that form 3-stars are:
- Node 3: (0, 7, 8), (13, 3, 18)
- Node 4: (12, 18, 19)
- Node 7: (3, 6, 10)
- Node 9: (14, 18, 19)
- Node 18: (4, 13, 5)
- Node 19: (4, 8, 9)

Hence, there are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (13, 3, 18)>, <4, (12, 18, 19)>, <7, (3, 6, 10)>, <9, (14, 18, 19)>, <18, (4, 13, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
