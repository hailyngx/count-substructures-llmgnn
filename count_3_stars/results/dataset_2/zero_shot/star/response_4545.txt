Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 8) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 14) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
The 3-star structures found in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (9, 11, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 0)>
<3, (4, 11, 13)>
<4, (9, 6, 12)>
<5, (9, 2, 0)>
<6, (4, 10, 13)>
<7, (9, 0, 5)>
<8, (10, 11, 1)>
<9, (4, 1, 5)>
<10, (6, 11, 8)>
<11, (10, 3, 1)>
<12, (4, 13, 14)>
<13, (6, 10, 12)>
<14, (12, 2, 13)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [15]
