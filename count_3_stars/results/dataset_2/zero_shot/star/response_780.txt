Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in this graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <5, (9, 6, 8)> and <7, (9, 1, 3)>.
Therefore, the final answer is [2].
