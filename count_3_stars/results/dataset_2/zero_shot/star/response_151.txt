Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which can be represented as follows:

<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<9, (5, 8, 1)>
<7, (5, 4, 6)>
<1, (9, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
