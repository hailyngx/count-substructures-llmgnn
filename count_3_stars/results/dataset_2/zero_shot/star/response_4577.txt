Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 13) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
Here are the unique 3-stars:
<5, (6, 13, 3)>
<9, (8, 2, 14)>
<1, (6, 14, 4)>
<0, (12, 11, 1)>
<4, (1, 8, 10)>
<10, (3, 8, 12)>
