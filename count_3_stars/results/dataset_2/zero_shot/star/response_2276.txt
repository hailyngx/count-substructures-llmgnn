Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count of 3-stars is [8].
  
The unique 3-stars are:
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 1)>
<4, (7, 8, 2)>
<7, (9, 4, 6)>
<6, (9, 7, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 2)>
<2, (9, 4, 8)>
<0, (6, 8, 2)>
