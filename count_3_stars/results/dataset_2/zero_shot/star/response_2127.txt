Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 8) (5, 8) (5, 4) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 4) (0, 15) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 1) (16, 14) (16, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 8) (18, 15) (19, 13) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 12) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 7) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 10) (2, 3) (2, 15) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 13) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 8) (13, 19) (13, 4) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13)
