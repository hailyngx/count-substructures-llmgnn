Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 3) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 13) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].

Unique 3-stars:
<9, (5, 14, 0)>
<7, (12, 2, 8)>
<0, (9, 10, 4)>
<14, (9, 11, 6)>
<2, (7, 1, 13)>
<13, (14, 3, 1)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
