Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 11) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, and the count of 3-stars is [4].

<3, (1, 13, 12)>
<14, (10, 11, 2)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 9, 11)>
