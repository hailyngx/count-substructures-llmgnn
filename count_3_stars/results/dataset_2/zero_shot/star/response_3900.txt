Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 12) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 11) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 14) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

<1, (3, 12, 14)>
<3, (1, 0, 9)>
<4, (1, 10, 13)>
<6, (2, 5, 14)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<13, (2, 11, 12)>
