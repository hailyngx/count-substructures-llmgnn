Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 17) (12, 14) (12, 11) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 9) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 5) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 0) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 13) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 19) (0, 2) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (18, 9) (18, 5) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 10) (17, 7) (17, 3) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 16) (5, 14) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 16) (13, 15) (16, 5) (16, 14) (6, 4) (6, 15) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 14) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:

<4, (8, 6, 0)>
<8, (4, 0, 7)>
<7, (8, 10, 1)>
<12, (14, 11, 1)>
<3, (11, 9, 17)>
<11, (12, 3, 19)>
<1, (7, 14, 0)>
<15, (9, 6, 13)>
<9, (3, 15, 18)>
<0, (8, 1, 10)>
<10, (7, 0, 19)>
<18, (9, 5, 5)>
<19, (11, 0, 10)>
<17, (7, 3, 3)>
<5, (11, 18, 16)>
<14, (12, 1, 16)>
<13, (15, 15, 15)>
<16, (5, 14, 5)>
<6, (4, 15, 15)>
<2, (0, 10, 14)>

There are [20] 3-stars in total.
