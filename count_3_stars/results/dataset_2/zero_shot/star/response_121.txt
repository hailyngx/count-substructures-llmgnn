Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 10) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of 4, 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <> brackets:
<0, (8, 13, 4)>
<1, (5, 9, 14)>
<2, (1, 12, 10)>
<6, (3, 11, 7)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
