Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 19) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 15) (13, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (17, 19) (17, 4) (17, 7) (2, 10) (2, 16) (2, 7) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 1) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 0) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 19) (4, 17) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 11) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 10) (14, 7) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 19) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (19, 9) (19, 17) (19, 15) (19, 16) (19, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 19) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. The answer is [4].
The 3-stars found are: 
<15, (9, 13, 19)>
<7, (2, 14, 17)>
<1, (10, 18, 0)>
<13, (5, 6, 11)>
