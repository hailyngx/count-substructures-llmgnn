Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
