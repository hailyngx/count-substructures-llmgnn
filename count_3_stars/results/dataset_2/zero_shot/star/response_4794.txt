Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 11) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 19) (7, 4) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 19) (11, 15) (11, 10) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 19) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 18) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 13) (18, 0) (18, 16) (18, 1) (5, 3) (5, 15) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 1) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 13) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 16)
