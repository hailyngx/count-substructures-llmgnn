Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 20) (13, 24) (22, 9) (22, 5) (22, 25) (3, 15) (3, 20) (15, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (21, 28) (21, 27) (21, 20) (21, 14) (0, 14) (0, 23) (0, 19) (14, 21) (14, 0) (14, 16) (19, 0) (19, 26) (19, 24) (26, 19) (26, 16) (26, 6) (28, 21) (28, 1) (28, 4) (28, 23) (9, 22) (9, 7) (9, 17) (5, 22) (5, 1) (5, 27) (17, 9) (17, 18) (20, 13) (20, 3) (20, 21) (8, 27) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 25) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 11) (27, 21) (27, 5) (27, 8) (27, 29) (29, 27) (29, 16) (1, 28) (1, 5) (1, 25) (1, 4) (25, 22) (25, 11) (25, 1) (25, 23) (25, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 10) (6, 26) (6, 2) (6, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 16) (16, 14) (16, 26) (16, 29) (16, 10) (12, 18) (12, 23) (18, 17) (18, 10) (18, 12) (23, 0) (23, 28) (23, 25) (23, 12) (4, 28) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 25)
