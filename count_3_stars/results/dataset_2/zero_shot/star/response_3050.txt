Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 11) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 6) 

Response:
There are [10] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<4, (7, 10, 6)>
<3, (1, 10, 2)>
<1, (7, 8, 0)>
<1, (3, 0, 12)>
<5, (9, 13, 2)>
<5, (9, 14, 7)>
<5, (9, 11, 2)>
<5, (9, 12, 7)>
<9, (11, 2, 0)>
<11, (2, 11, 6)>
