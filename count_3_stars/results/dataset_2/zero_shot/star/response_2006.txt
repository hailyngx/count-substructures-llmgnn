Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) 

Response:
There are <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
