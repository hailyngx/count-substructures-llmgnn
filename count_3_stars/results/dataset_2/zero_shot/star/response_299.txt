Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 15) (8, 14) (8, 7) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 3) (5, 19) (5, 16) (5, 14) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 17) (9, 18) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 13) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 11) (0, 1) (16, 5) (16, 17) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 6) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 11) (3, 18) (3, 14) (3, 13) (17, 19) (17, 16) (17, 12) (6, 2) (6, 7) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 17) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 3) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the output is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (18, 9, 12)>
<5, (19, 16, 17)>
<9, (18, 2, 3)>
<10, (15, 1, 13)>
<11, (14, 1, 12)>
