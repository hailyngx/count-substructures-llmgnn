Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 14) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 9) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (9, 11) (9, 13) 

Response:
There are <4, (7, 8, 10)>, <7, (4, 12, 3)>, <10, (4, 0, 8)>, <11, (1, 9, 2)>, <8, (4, 10, 0)>, <12, (7, 5, 14)>, <2, (11, 5, 1)>, <5, (12, 2, 6)>, <6, (4, 8, 5)>, <0, (4, 10, 8)>, <14, (7, 12, 6)>, <3, (7, 8, 12)>, <1, (11, 13, 2)>, and <9, (11, 13, 9)>.

Therefore, there are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
