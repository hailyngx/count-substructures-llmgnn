Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 19) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 1) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 15) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 16) (2, 16) (2, 3) (18, 12) (18, 19) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 15) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 16) (15, 12) (15, 13) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 19) (16, 0) (16, 6) (16, 2) (16, 1) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 9) (10, 4) (10, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [4]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (12, 0, 1)>
<1, (4, 1, 8)>
<6, (14, 6, 16)>
<9, (8, 9, 14)>
