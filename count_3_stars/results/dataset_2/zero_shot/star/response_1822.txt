Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<6, (9, 3, 2)>
<9, (6, 8, 3)>
<1, (3, 5, 4)>
<8, (9, 1, 5)>
