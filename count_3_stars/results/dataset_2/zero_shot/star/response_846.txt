Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 4) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 12) 

Response:
There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 8, 12)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 0, 12)>
<5, (3, 8, 11)>
<7, (0, 4, 10)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<10, (3, 7, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
