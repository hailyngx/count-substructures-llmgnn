Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (9, 7, 8)>

<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 4, 6)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 2)>
<7, (5, 6, 2)>
