Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 11) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are in total [4] 3-stars present in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars found:
<6, (5, 7, 14)>
<9, (4, 11, 10)>
<1, (3, 7, 5)>
<11, (0, 1, 3)>
