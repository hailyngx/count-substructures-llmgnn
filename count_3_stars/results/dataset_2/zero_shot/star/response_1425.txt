Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars identified are:
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
