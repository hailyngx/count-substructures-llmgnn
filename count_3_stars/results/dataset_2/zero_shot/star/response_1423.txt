Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 7) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 13) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 12) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 18) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (17, 18) (17, 16) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 19) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 15) (7, 11) (7, 19) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 12) (16, 8) (16, 17) (4, 1) (4, 19) (4, 15) (9, 15) (9, 19) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 4) (19, 9) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 12) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 15) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.

<18, (2, 12, 13)>
<8, (2, 12, 6)>
<1, (18, 6, 14)>
<17, (18, 16, 1)>
<13, (10, 18, 19)>
<6, (8, 1, 14)>
<0, (10, 3, 15)>
<7, (11, 19, 7)>
<14, (10, 6, 12)>
<16, (8, 17, 16)>
<4, (1, 15, 4)>
