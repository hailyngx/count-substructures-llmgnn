Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 20) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 16) (2, 23) (2, 27) (29, 17) (29, 7) (20, 3) (20, 25) (20, 23) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 12) (25, 0) (25, 28) (25, 24) (28, 20) (28, 25) (28, 4) (17, 29) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 26) (7, 29) (12, 25) (12, 14) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 8) (26, 17) (26, 18) (26, 11) (26, 0) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 18) (8, 5) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 11) (5, 18) (5, 8) (5, 11) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (11, 26) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 1) (14, 12) (14, 24) (27, 2) (27, 23) (22, 16) (0, 25) (0, 17) (0, 26) (0, 4) (9, 10) (9, 16) (10, 18) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 23) (16, 15) (16, 22) (16, 9) (16, 4) (23, 2) (23, 20) (23, 27) (23, 13) (4, 28) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 16) (24, 25) (24, 14)
