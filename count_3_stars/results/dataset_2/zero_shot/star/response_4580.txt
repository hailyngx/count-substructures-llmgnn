Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 8) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 15) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 13) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 3) (2, 6) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 0) (0, 18) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 13) (5, 18) (5, 19) (5, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 1) (19, 5) (19, 1) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 8) (12, 16) (12, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 15) (3, 16) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 9) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 15) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Here they are: 
<4, (7, 10, 17)>
<5, (8, 13, 18)>
<6, (2, 7, 15)>
<11, (1, 8, 14)>
<15, (6, 9, 15)>
<16, (3, 8, 12)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
