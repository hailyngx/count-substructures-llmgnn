Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 28) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 28) (9, 26) (9, 17) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 2) (26, 8) (3, 25) (3, 29) (3, 19) (25, 3) (25, 20) (7, 21) (7, 15) (21, 7) (21, 11) (21, 24) (20, 25) (20, 16) (28, 13) (28, 22) (28, 29) (28, 24) (29, 3) (29, 28) (29, 12) (1, 6) (1, 0) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 23) (15, 17) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 5) (4, 10) (4, 23) (4, 14) (4, 17) (12, 29) (12, 18) (16, 20) (16, 6) (6, 1) (6, 16) (6, 2) (6, 0) (23, 15) (23, 4) (23, 18) (19, 22) (19, 3) (19, 11) (2, 26) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 24) (2, 11) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 14) (11, 21) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 27) (18, 12) (18, 23) (18, 17) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 24) (0, 8) (24, 9) (24, 21) (24, 28) (24, 2) (24, 0) (14, 4) (14, 5) (27, 11) (17, 9) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 18) (8, 26) (8, 0)
