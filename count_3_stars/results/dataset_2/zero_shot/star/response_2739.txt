Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 26) (11, 21) (23, 5) (23, 17) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 27) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 25) (16, 0) (16, 14) (28, 9) (18, 26) (18, 20) (18, 24) (18, 21) (21, 10) (21, 11) (21, 18) (21, 0) (21, 19) (0, 16) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (3, 4) (24, 18) (24, 17) (24, 15) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (29, 27) (29, 19) (5, 23) (5, 2) (5, 15) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (20, 18) (27, 22) (27, 29) (27, 17) (14, 22) (14, 16) (14, 1) (12, 0) (12, 25) (12, 9) (19, 21) (19, 0) (19, 29) (19, 25) (15, 24) (15, 5) (15, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 4) (9, 28) (9, 7) (9, 12) (25, 26) (25, 12) (25, 19) (17, 23) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 4) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 17) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
