Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
[There are 4 unique 3-stars in the graph.]

<5, (9, 4, 8)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<1, (6, 3, 2)>
