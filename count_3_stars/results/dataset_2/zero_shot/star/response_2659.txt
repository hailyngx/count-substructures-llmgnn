Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<5, (9, 2, 12)>
<9, (5, 4, 11)>
<4, (9, 7, 13)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<0, (6, 5, 7)>
