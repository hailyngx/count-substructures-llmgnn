Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
The center node of a 3-star graph is connected to exactly three other nodes. To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them.

From the provided list of edges, we identify the nodes with 3 incident edges as potential center nodes:

Node 5 has 3 incident edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 4)
Node 9 has 3 incident edges: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8)
Node 4 has 3 incident edges: (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 6)
Node 6 has 3 incident edges: (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 4)
Node 8 has 3 incident edges: (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 7)
Node 0 has 3 incident edges: (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 2)
Node 3 has 3 incident edges: (3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 2)
Node 1 has 3 incident edges: (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 2)

Only nodes 5, 9, 4, 8, 1 meet the criterion for being central nodes of 3-star graphs. Let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

For Node 5: There is 1 3-star with center node 5: <5, (9, 6, 4)>
For Node 9: There is 1 3-star with center node 9: <9, (5, 6, 8)>
For Node 4: There are 2 3-stars with center node 4: <4, (5, 8, 6)>, <4, (5, 8, 1)>
For Node 8: There is 1 3-star with center node 8: <8, (9, 4, 7)>
For Node 1: There is 1 3-star with center node 1: <1, (4, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
