Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 1) (26, 18) (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 24) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 22) (6, 27) (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 19) (25, 12) (25, 24) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 23) (1, 18) (2, 12) (2, 7) (18, 26) (18, 1) (18, 29) (15, 17) (15, 28) (20, 27) (20, 4) (0, 29) (0, 19) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 16) (19, 25) (19, 0) (19, 22) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 23) (21, 8) (28, 15) (28, 21) (13, 16) (13, 29) (13, 23) (13, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 27) (10, 21) (10, 8) (24, 5) (24, 25) (22, 6) (22, 19) (22, 12) (12, 25) (12, 2) (12, 22) (12, 17) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 29) (29, 18) (29, 0) (29, 13) (29, 7) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 10) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 13) (17, 15) (17, 12) (27, 6) (27, 20) (27, 11) (4, 20) (4, 14) (23, 3) (23, 1) (23, 21) (23, 13) 

Response:

<3, (25, 1, 23)>
<5, (9, 8, 24)>
<6, (9, 7, 27)>
<7, (6, 2, 13)>
<8, (5, 21, 10)>
<9, (5, 6, 16)>
<11, (3, 14, 27)>
<12, (25, 2, 17)>
<13, (16, 29, 7)>
<14, (16, 4, 13)>
<15, (17, 28, 15)>
<18, (26, 1, 29)>
<19, (25, 0, 22)>
<21, (28, 10, 8)>
<22, (6, 19, 12)>
