Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (9, 15) (9, 12) (4, 18) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 15) (1, 15) (1, 12) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 1) (19, 18) (19, 7) (19, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 16) (6, 19) (6, 17) (3, 8) (3, 7) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 13) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 17) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has 5 unique 3-stars based on the edges provided. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<4, (18, 13, 2)>
<10, (0, 2, 18)>
<17, (6, 16, 19)>
<16, (17, 14, 10)>
<12, (1, 14, 9)>
