Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<5, (1, 0, 3)>, <9, (4, 2, 3)>, <4, (9, 8, 2)>, <7, (0, 6, 1)>, <6, (7, 2, 0)>, <8, (5, 9, 4)>, <2, (9, 1, 6)>]

Therefore, there are [7] 3-stars in the graph.
