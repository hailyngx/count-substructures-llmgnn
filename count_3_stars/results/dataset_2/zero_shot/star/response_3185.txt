Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 17) (7, 8) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 16) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 0) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 0) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 9) (15, 12) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 5) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (16, 2) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 10) (18, 5) (18, 16) (13, 10) (13, 6) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 9) (6, 13)
