Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 13) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 18) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (8, 14) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (6, 5) (6, 15) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 19) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 16) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (2, 8) (2, 19) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 10) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 16) (19, 0) (19, 2) (12, 18) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 7) (7, 1) (7, 18) (7, 11) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 10) 

Response:
There are 11 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (11, 13, 19)>
<1, (4, 7, 15)>
<2, (8, 19, 2)>
<3, (0, 13, 4)>
<5, (6, 10, 15)>
<6, (5, 10, 15)>
<9, (5, 13, 16)>
<11, (0, 7, 14)>
<14, (8, 11, 17)>
<15, (1, 6, 10)>
<18, (4, 7, 12)>
