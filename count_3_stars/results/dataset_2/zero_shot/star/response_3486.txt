Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in this graph. 

The possible 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 8, 5)>
<6, (7, 5, 2)>
<9, (7, 3, 1)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 0)>
<5, (4, 6, 2)>
<3, (4, 9, 8)>
<2, (6, 5, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
