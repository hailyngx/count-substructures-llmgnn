Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 2)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 8, 0)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (4, 8, 2)>
