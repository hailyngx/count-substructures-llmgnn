Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations found in this graph. Let's count them.

1. Node 5: (9, 6, 2)
2. Node 9: (5, 2, 3)
3. Node 4: (7, 6, 1)
4. Node 7: (9, 4, 6)
5. Node 1: (4, 7, 3)
6. Node 3: (9, 4, 1)
7. Node 6: (5, 4, 7)
8. Node 8: (1, 3, 2)
9. Node 2: (9, 5, 1)
10. Node 0: (5, 6, 0)

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
