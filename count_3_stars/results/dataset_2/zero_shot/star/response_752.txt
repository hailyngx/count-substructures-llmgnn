Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 20) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 17) (20, 9) (20, 25) (20, 19) (20, 23) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 12) (25, 10) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 12) (23, 20) (23, 8) (23, 27) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 28) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 24) (18, 28) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 17) (26, 18) (26, 2) (13, 21) (13, 6) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 27) (17, 15) (17, 22) (17, 1) (17, 6) (24, 18) (24, 0) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 20) (10, 25) (10, 21) (10, 14) (21, 13) (21, 10) (21, 29) (27, 5) (27, 25) (27, 23) (27, 1) (2, 5) (2, 22) (2, 26) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 12) (7, 3) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 10) (29, 1) (29, 21) (29, 6) (6, 11) (6, 15) (6, 13) (6, 17) (6, 29) (12, 25) (12, 8) (12, 0) (28, 4) (28, 18) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star structures in the given graph is 6.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (2, 19, 27)>
<9, (14, 20, 25)>
<17, (1, 6, 22)>
<18, (4, 26, 28)>
<21, (10, 13, 29)>
<25, (12, 20, 27)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
