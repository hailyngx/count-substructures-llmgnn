Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
[<2, (6, 9, 0)>, <0, (6, 9, 2)>, <6, (2, 9, 0)>]

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the graph.
