Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 3) (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 17) (2, 8) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 16) (1, 7) (1, 12) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 15) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 12) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 19) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 12) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 18) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 15) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 2) (16, 9) (16, 18) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (9, 13, 6)>
<8, (9, 7, 15)>
<11, (10, 12, 17)>
<12, (11, 1, 15)>
<15, (8, 17, 12)>
<17, (11, 6, 19)>
<18, (14, 16, 19)>
<19, (4, 17, 6)>
