Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (3, 1) (3, 4) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 12) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 19) (8, 5) (8, 15) (13, 17) (13, 0) (6, 7) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 19) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 9) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 9) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 5) (14, 19) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 15) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (12, 18) (12, 14) (12, 15) (9, 7) (9, 16) (9, 11) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 12) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 11, 19)>, <2, (4, 5, 18)>, <5, (2, 8, 11)>, <7, (6, 9, 17)>, <9, (11, 16, 7)>, and <11, (1, 14, 0)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
