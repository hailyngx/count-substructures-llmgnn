Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7)
