Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 15) (0, 29) (27, 4) (27, 18) (27, 2) (7, 21) (7, 19) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 9) (18, 27) (18, 9) (18, 20) (22, 19) (22, 6) (22, 3) (1, 26) (1, 29) (1, 5) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 17) (2, 27) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 17) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 23) (24, 26) (24, 3) (24, 12) (24, 13) (4, 27) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 3) (10, 8) (10, 13) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 14) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 23) (19, 7) (19, 22) (19, 15) (19, 5) (9, 21) (9, 18) (9, 8) (9, 20) (6, 21) (6, 22) (6, 29) (6, 23) (17, 26) (17, 8) (17, 16) (29, 0) (29, 1) (29, 6) (23, 28) (23, 5) (23, 6) (23, 25) (23, 12) (3, 22) (3, 24) (3, 4) (14, 2) (14, 15) (14, 20) (16, 4) (16, 17) (20, 18) (20, 9) (20, 14) (12, 28) (12, 24) (12, 23) (13, 24) (13, 10) (25, 23) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (15, 19, 29)>
<2, (4, 8, 27)>
<3, (4, 12, 24)>
<5, (1, 19, 23)>
<6, (21, 22, 29)>
<9, (8, 18, 20)>
<10, (8, 13, 17)>
<14, (2, 15, 20)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
