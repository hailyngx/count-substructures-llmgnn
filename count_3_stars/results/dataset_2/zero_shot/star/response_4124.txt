Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 7) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: <5, (9, 8, 10)>, <9, (5, 14, 3)>, <10, (6, 5, 11)>, <11, (10, 8, 12)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (5, 11, 14)>, <2, (6, 4, 3)>, <0, (6, 4, 12)>
