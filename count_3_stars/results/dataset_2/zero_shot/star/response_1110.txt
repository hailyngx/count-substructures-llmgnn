Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 0, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, N)>
<6, (5, 2, 8)>
where N represents a node that is not connected to the other leaves in the 3-star.
