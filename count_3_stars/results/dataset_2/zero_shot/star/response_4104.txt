Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 7) (14, 11) (17, 10) (17, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 6) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 5) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 15) (4, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 15) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 15) (1, 12) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 15) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 19) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 19) (12, 4) (12, 1) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (16, 19) (19, 10) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 16) (5, 10) (5, 11) (3, 4) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<6, (9, 10, 11)>
<9, (6, 18, 7)>
<10, (6, 17, 19)>
<4, (18, 12, 15)>
<2, (8, 1, 7)>
<18, (9, 4, 15)>
<1, (17, 2, 15)>
<0, (13, 7, 3)>
<7, (9, 2, 19)>
<15, (4, 18, 1)>
