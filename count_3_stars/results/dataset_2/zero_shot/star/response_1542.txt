Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 12) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 7) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 12) (17, 7) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 6) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 9) (4, 3) (4, 16) (18, 10) (18, 0) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 9) (8, 15) (8, 14) (8, 19) (9, 12) (9, 19) (9, 11) (16, 4) (16, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (11, 0) (11, 19) (11, 9) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<3, (1, 4, 12)>
<15, (10, 8, 5)>
<7, (1, 17, 6)>
<0, (18, 14, 16)>
