Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 0)>
<0, (5, 6, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
