Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 18) (15, 2) (15, 16) (6, 17) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 13) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 8) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 11) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 10) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 11) (4, 2) (12, 4) (12, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 12) (18, 15) (18, 0) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 7) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (16, 15) (16, 14) (16, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 13) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 10, 18)>
<2, (1, 4, 15)>
<3, (5, 8, 17)>
<4, (2, 11, 16)>
<7, (9, 13, 17)>
<9, (2, 7, 10)>
<11, (4, 12, 14)>
<13, (1, 7, 14)>
