Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 4) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 19) (2, 3) (2, 12) (13, 16) (13, 7) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 13) (19, 17) (19, 0) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 5) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 18) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 15) (8, 1) (8, 15) (8, 18) (15, 14) (15, 8) (15, 4) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 8) (4, 11) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 15) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<5, (9, 3, 16)>
<9, (5, 12, 11)>
<1, (3, 14, 8)>
<3, (5, 1, 16)>
<10, (11, 17, 7)>
<11, (10, 12, 4)>
<17, (10, 19, 4)>
<16, (5, 3, 13)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
