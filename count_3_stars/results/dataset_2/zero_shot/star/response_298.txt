Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 0, 5)>
<7, (4, 9, 1)>
<1, (7, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 6, 5)>
<6, (4, 3, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 2)>
<5, (4, 1, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
