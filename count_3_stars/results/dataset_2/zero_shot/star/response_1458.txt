Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
