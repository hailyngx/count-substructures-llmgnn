Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 29) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 19) (9, 22) (9, 16) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 21) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 16) (21, 2) (20, 25) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 17) (25, 10) (25, 11) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 15) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 13) (4, 8) (4, 29) (4, 2) (12, 24) (0, 2) (2, 21) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (19, 9) (19, 20) (19, 28) (19, 14) (26, 23) (26, 13) (26, 28) (13, 23) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 27) (5, 13) (5, 16) (16, 9) (16, 21) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 17) (28, 19) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 3) (28, 18) (29, 6) (29, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 10) (15, 8) (18, 28) (27, 13) (27, 22) (27, 24) (27, 14) (10, 25) (10, 1) (3, 28) (3, 17) (17, 25) (17, 23) (17, 16) (17, 3) (22, 9) (22, 27) (24, 12) (24, 27) (14, 2) (14, 19) (14, 27) (11, 6) (11, 25) (11, 2) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<6, (1, 11, 29)>
<9, (7, 16, 19)>
<16, (5, 17, 28)>
<21, (2, 7, 16)>
<25, (10, 11, 20)>
<2, (0, 4, 21)>
<28, (3, 18, 19)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
