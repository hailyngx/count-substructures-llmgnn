Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

<5, (6, 8, 1)>
<9, (6, 8, 1)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (7, 0, 3)>
<7, (5, 6, 4)>
<8, (5, 9, 0)>
<0, (9, 8, 3)>
<3, (4, 0, 8)>
