Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 17) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 18) (10, 4) (11, 8) (11, 12) (17, 7) (17, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 16) (1, 0) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 16) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 0) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 18) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 15) (16, 18) (16, 14) (14, 16) (14, 3) (9, 2) (9, 18) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 14) (12, 11) (12, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (7, 10, 15)>
<7, (4, 16, 19)>
<8, (2, 11, 13)>
<18, (0, 9, 19)>
