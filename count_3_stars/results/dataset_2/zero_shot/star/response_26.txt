Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 14) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 12) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (2, 7) (2, 4) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 0) 

Response:
There are multiple 3-stars in the given graph. Let's identify and count the number of unique 3-stars:

1. <0, (1, 10, 12)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 10)>
3. <2, (4, 7, 12)>
4. <3, (4, 6, 8)>
5. <4, (2, 7, 10)>
6. <5, (7, 9, 11)>
7. <6, (1, 3, 9)>
8. <7, (0, 4, 5)>
9. <8, (3, 12, 14)>
10. <9, (5, 6, 4)>
11. <10, (0, 1, 4)>
12. <11, (5, 13, 0)>
13. <12, (0, 2, 8)>
14. <13, (1, 4, 11)>
15. <14, (8, 10, 14)>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
