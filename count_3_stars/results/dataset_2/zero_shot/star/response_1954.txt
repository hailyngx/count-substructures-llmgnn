Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 8) (14, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 11) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 11) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 1) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 10) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 13) (4, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) 

Response:
