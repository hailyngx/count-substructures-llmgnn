Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated using the given information. Since each 3-star has one central node and three leaf nodes, we need to find the nodes that can serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 5, and 9 are the only nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Therefore, we can create 3-stars with these nodes as central nodes.

Counting the 3-stars for each central node:
- For node 0: (0, 4, 5, 7) [4 3-star(s)]
- For node 1: (1, 3, 4, 9) [4 3-star(s)]
- For node 5: (5, 0, 4, 7) [4 3-star(s)]
- For node 9: (9, 1, 6, 8) [4 3-star(s)]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, and <9, (1, 6, 8)>.
