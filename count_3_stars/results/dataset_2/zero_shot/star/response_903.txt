Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9 and their connections are given by the edges. Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By analyzing the connections, we can find the following unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
