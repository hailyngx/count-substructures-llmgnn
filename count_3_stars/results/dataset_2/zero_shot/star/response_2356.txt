Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 4) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 10) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 10) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 13) (12, 1) (12, 6) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 9) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars found: 
<1, (3, 9, 12)>
<3, (1, 7, 2)>
<7, (3, 0, 14)>
<14, (0, 11, 8)>
