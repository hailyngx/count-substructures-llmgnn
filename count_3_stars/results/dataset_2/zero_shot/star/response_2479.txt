Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 17) (14, 10) (17, 7) (17, 3) (10, 14) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 13) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 12) (18, 9) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 9) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 9) (5, 19) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 13) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 13) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 12) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 12) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 15) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
