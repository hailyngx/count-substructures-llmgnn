Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by observing the connections around each node. 

Let's count the number of 3-stars:
1. Node 5: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) -> <5, (9, 6, 4)>
2. Node 9: (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) -> <9, (5, 2, 3)>
3. Node 4: (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) -> <4, (5, 7, 8)>
4. Node 7: (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) -> <7, (4, 0, 3)>
5. Node 1: (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) -> <1, (9, 4, 7)>
6. Node 3: (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) -> <3, (9, 7, 1)>
7. Node 8: (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) -> <8, (4, 1, 3)>
8. Node 6: (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) -> <6, (5, 8, 2)>
9. Node 2: (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) -> <2, (9, 3, 8)>
10. Node 0: (0, 7) (0, 6) -> <0, (7, 6, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
