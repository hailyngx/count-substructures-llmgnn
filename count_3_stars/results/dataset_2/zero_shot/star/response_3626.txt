Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are 7 total 3-star graphs in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<5, (2, 1, 4)>
<5, (8, 9, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 2)>
<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<3, (1, 0, 4)>
<4, (5, 6, 1)>
<8, (5, 9, 2)>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
