Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 13) (8, 11) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 14) (0, 10) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 2) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

- <4, (7, 9, 10)>
- <4, (7, 10, 14)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <7, (4, 10, 11)>
- <7, (4, 10, 1)>
- <10, (4, 7, 11)>
- <10, (4, 7, 0)>
- <11, (7, 10, 1)>
- <11, (9, 8, 1)>
- <9, (4, 11, 2)>
- <9, (4, 3, 14)>
- <12, (7, 5, 6)>
- <12, (7, 5, 2)>
- <12, (5, 6, 13)>

- <2, (12, 9, 1)>
- <2, (12, 1, 14)>
- <0, (10, 7, 4)>
- <3, (4, 9, 13)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (11, 2, 8)>
- <14, (4, 6, 2)>
- <14, (9, 2, 13)>
- <6, (5, 12, 13)>
- <13, (6, 12, 14)>

There are a total of [26] 3-stars in the graph.
