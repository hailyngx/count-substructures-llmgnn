Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 8) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 5) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 2) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (9, 10, 11)>
<6, (4, 0, 12)>
<1, (3, 5, 13)>
<3, (1, 0, 11)>
<11, (6, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
