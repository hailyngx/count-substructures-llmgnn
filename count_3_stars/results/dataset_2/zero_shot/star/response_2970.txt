Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 8) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 9) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 14) (6, 2) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 18) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 14) (0, 16) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 3) (2, 17) (19, 2) (19, 17) (19, 13) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 17) (1, 5) (1, 13) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 16) (18, 15) (18, 3) (17, 4) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 9) (17, 8) (3, 2) (3, 18) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 1) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 17) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated as follows:

1. Identify the nodes connected to each node by an edge:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 10, 14, and 17
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 13, and 8
   - Node 10 is connected to nodes 4, 11, 13, and 9
   - Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 5, and 8
   - Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 2, and 9
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 11, 1, and 14
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2
   - Node 15 is connected to nodes 16, 9, and 18
   - Node 16 is connected to nodes 15, 0, and 14
   - Node 0 is connected to node 16
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 12, 6, 19, 3, and 17
   - Node 19 is connected to nodes 2, 17, and 13
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 10, 12, 15, 17
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 13
   - Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 16
   - Node 18 is connected to nodes 15 and 3
   - Node 17 is connected to nodes 4, 2, 19, 9, and 8
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 18
   - Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 10, 19, and 1
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 11, and 17

2. Count the number of 3-stars for each node that is the center of a 3-star:
   - Node 4 can form 1 3-star: <4, (10, 14, 17)>
   - Node 7 can form 1 3-star: <7, (12, 13, 8)>
   - Node 10 can form 3 3-stars: <10, (4, 14, 17)>, <10, (11, 13, 9)>, <10, (13, 7, 1)>
   - Node 11 can form 1 3-star: <11, (10, 5, 8)>
   - Node 12 can form 1 3-star: <12, (7, 13, 9)>
   - Node 15 can form 1 3-star: <15, (16, 0, 14)>
   - Node 16 can form 1 3-star: <16, (15, 0, 14)>
   - Node 2 can form 1 3-star: <2, (12, 6, 19)>
   - Node 9 can form 1 3-star: <9, (10, 12, 15)>
   - Node 13 can form 2 3-stars: <13, (7, 19, 1)>, <13, (10, 19, 1)>
   - Node 17 can form 1 3-star: <17, (2, 19, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12]. These 3-stars are <4, (10, 14, 17)>, <7, (12, 13, 8)>, <10, (4, 14, 17)>, <10, (11, 13, 9)>, <10, (13, 7, 1)>, <11, (10, 5, 8)>, <12, (7, 13, 9)>, <15, (16, 0, 14)>, <16, (15, 0, 14)>, <2, (12, 6, 19)>, <9, (10, 12, 15)>, and <13, (7, 19, 1)>.
