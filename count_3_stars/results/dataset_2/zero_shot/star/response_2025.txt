Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (16, 12) (16, 29) (5, 21) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 20) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 18) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 28) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 22) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 1) (2, 6) (2, 18) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 8) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 26) (1, 17) (1, 27) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 0) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 19) (21, 5) (21, 28) (21, 23) (28, 4) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 19) (15, 10) (15, 20) (20, 9) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 27) (0, 26) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 29) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 24) (17, 22) (25, 9) (22, 7) (22, 17) (23, 26) (23, 21) (8, 18) (8, 28) (8, 0) (8, 3) (19, 12) (19, 28) (19, 14) (19, 24) (29, 16) (29, 26) (29, 14) (13, 4) (13, 20) (13, 27) (24, 17) (24, 19) (27, 1) (27, 20) (27, 13) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars are <1, (6, 10, 26)>, <4, (7, 12, 19)>, <8, (0, 3, 28)>, <14, (0, 19, 29)>, and <20, (9, 13, 27)>.
