Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 19) (1, 9) (21, 26) (21, 22) (21, 14) (15, 29) (15, 12) (27, 18) (27, 19) (27, 23) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 18) (5, 23) (5, 10) (5, 16) (6, 20) (6, 0) (17, 24) (17, 2) (17, 26) (29, 15) (29, 16) (29, 14) (11, 28) (11, 4) (28, 11) (28, 25) (28, 23) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 3) (26, 0) (0, 6) (0, 26) (0, 10) (0, 25) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 24) (9, 1) (9, 23) (9, 19) (18, 27) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 3) (23, 27) (23, 5) (23, 28) (23, 9) (4, 11) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 16) (19, 1) (19, 27) (19, 9) (7, 14) (24, 17) (24, 10) (24, 25) (22, 21) (22, 16) (22, 12) (22, 3) (16, 5) (16, 29) (16, 2) (16, 22) (20, 6) (25, 28) (25, 0) (25, 24) (25, 14) (14, 21) (14, 29) (14, 7) (14, 25) (14, 12) (12, 15) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 3) (3, 26) (3, 18) (3, 22) (3, 12) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding all nodes with exactly three edges and listing them along with their connected nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (6, 0, 10)
2. Node 2: (10, 2, 16)
3. Node 9: (1, 9, 19)
4. Node 12: (15, 12, 22)
5. Node 14: (7, 14, 25)
6. Node 16: (5, 16, 29)
7. Node 17: (2, 17, 24)
8. Node 18: (3, 18, 27)
9. Node 21: (14, 21, 29)
10. Node 23: (5, 9, 23)
11. Node 25: (0, 24, 25)
12. Node 26: (0, 21, 26)
13. Node 28: (11, 25, 28)

Count of 3-stars: [13]  
Unique 3-stars:  
<0, (6, 0, 10)>
<2, (10, 2, 16)>
<9, (1, 9, 19)>
<12, (15, 12, 22)>
<14, (7, 14, 25)>
<16, (5, 16, 29)>
<17, (2, 17, 24)>
<18, (3, 18, 27)>
<21, (14, 21, 29)>
<23, (5, 9, 23)>
<25, (0, 24, 25)>
<26, (0, 21, 26)>
<28, (11, 25, 28)>
