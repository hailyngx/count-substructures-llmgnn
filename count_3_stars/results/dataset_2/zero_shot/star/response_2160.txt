Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 13) (2, 15) (2, 3) (29, 2) (29, 27) (29, 12) (7, 21) (7, 15) (7, 10) (7, 9) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 4) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 17) (6, 9) (6, 25) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 28) (9, 14) (5, 22) (5, 0) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 23) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 20) (14, 13) (28, 21) (28, 9) (28, 26) (28, 25) (19, 26) (19, 15) (26, 28) (26, 19) (4, 21) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (12, 29) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 24) (22, 2) (22, 5) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 17) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 27) (25, 6) (25, 9) (25, 28) (27, 29) (27, 1) (27, 16) (16, 27) (16, 17) (16, 8) (17, 11) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 18) (20, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (24, 12) (18, 0) (18, 17) (18, 8) (8, 0) (8, 16) (8, 18) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 1) (23, 0) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below:

<2, (29, 13, 15)>
<7, (21, 15, 10)>
<9, (11, 6, 25)>
<0, (5, 14, 18)>
<4, (12, 3, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
