Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 11) (2, 5) (8, 5) (8, 7) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 13) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 14) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (3, 4, 12)>
<3, (1, 7, 13)>
<10, (11, 6, 14)>
<14, (1, 10, 0)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the graph.
