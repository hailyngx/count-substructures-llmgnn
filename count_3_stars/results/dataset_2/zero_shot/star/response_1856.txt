Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 0) (1, 21) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 15) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 27) (29, 5) (29, 18) (7, 21) (7, 19) (7, 18) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 15) (23, 4) (0, 22) (0, 1) (20, 27) (20, 4) (24, 26) (24, 12) (11, 1) (11, 23) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 19) (26, 24) (17, 8) (17, 27) (25, 2) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 15) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 3) (3, 9) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 10) (27, 29) (27, 20) (27, 17) (27, 19) (27, 6) (14, 13) (14, 22) (14, 15) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 28) (19, 27) (15, 13) (15, 21) (15, 23) (15, 8) (15, 14) (6, 13) (6, 27) (6, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (16, 9) (16, 4) (12, 1) (12, 24) (12, 10) (18, 29) (18, 7) (4, 23) (4, 20) (4, 16) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<13, (15, 14, 6)>
<22, (23, 14, 5)>
<1, (11, 12, 8)>
<21, (15, 7, 1)>
<2, (19, 9, 25)>
<29, (27, 5, 18)>
<7, (19, 18, 21)>
<23, (15, 4, 22)>
<8, (17, 15, 1)>
<9, (16, 3, 2)>
<5, (29, 10, 22)>
<27, (20, 17, 6)>
