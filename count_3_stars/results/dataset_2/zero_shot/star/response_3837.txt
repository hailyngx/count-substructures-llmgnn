Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are: 
<5, (9, 7, 8)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
