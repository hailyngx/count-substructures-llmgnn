Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 15) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 16) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 7) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 16) (9, 11) (9, 18) (9, 15) (18, 9) (18, 13) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 1) (7, 3) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 5) (5, 14) (5, 2) (19, 10) (19, 16) (15, 14) (15, 4) (15, 9) (12, 10) (12, 3) (13, 18) (0, 17) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 19) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the graph, which can be listed as follows:

<14, (1, 5, 7)>
<17, (0, 7, 14)>
<10, (8, 12, 19)>
<11, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 15)>
<6, (1, 3, 16)>
<9, (11, 15, 18)>
<18, (9, 13, 18)>
<3, (6, 7, 12)>
<16, (6, 8, 19)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
