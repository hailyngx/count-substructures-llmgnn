Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 29) (1, 0) (21, 27) (21, 20) (21, 22) (6, 1) (6, 12) (9, 13) (9, 12) (22, 21) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 17) (23, 22) (23, 4) (2, 19) (2, 20) (2, 15) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 12) (15, 2) (15, 20) (15, 10) (20, 21) (20, 2) (20, 15) (20, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 28) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 0) (16, 29) (16, 25) (28, 5) (28, 24) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 29) (17, 22) (17, 13) (17, 25) (26, 18) (26, 8) (25, 16) (25, 17) (25, 27) (27, 21) (27, 25) (27, 11) (19, 2) (19, 18) (11, 27) (11, 7) (14, 22) (14, 10) (3, 29) (7, 13) (7, 11) (29, 1) (29, 16) (29, 10) (29, 3) (29, 8) (8, 26) (8, 29) (8, 24) (8, 0) (24, 28) (24, 8) (24, 0) (4, 23) (4, 20) (4, 0) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 8) (0, 24) (0, 4)
