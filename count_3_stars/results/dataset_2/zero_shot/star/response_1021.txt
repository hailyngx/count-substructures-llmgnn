Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 8) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 10)>
<2, (1, 3, 14)>
<5, (6, 8, 12)>
<9, (6, 4, 3)>
<13, (11, 0, 14)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
