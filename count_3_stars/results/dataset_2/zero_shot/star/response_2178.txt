Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 5) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 19) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 1) (5, 14) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 13) (13, 3) (13, 5) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 16) (19, 11) (19, 18) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 19) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 15) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 12) 

Response:
There are 10 unique 3-stars found in the given graph. The count of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
