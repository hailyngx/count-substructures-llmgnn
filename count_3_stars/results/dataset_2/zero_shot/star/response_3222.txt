Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 14) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 12) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
The central nodes with exactly three connected nodes form 3-stars in the graph. 

There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<4, (7, 8, 13)>
<6, (7, 11, 14)>
<13, (4, 5, 10)>

There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the graph.
