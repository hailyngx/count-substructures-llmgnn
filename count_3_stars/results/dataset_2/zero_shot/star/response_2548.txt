Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 11) (11, 4) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 10) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 10)
