Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
