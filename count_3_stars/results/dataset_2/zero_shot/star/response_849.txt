Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 3) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
There are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
<6, (9, 5, 2)>
<9, (6, 8, 13)>
<8, (9, 2, 14)>
<13, (9, 8, 4)>
<5, (6, 11, 10)>
<2, (6, 8, 13)>
<4, (13, 12, 10)>
