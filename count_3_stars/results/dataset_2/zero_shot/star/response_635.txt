Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 6) (15, 0) (15, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 2) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 2) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 7) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (17, 1) (17, 7) (5, 13) (5, 16) (19, 4) (19, 16) (16, 0) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 9) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 10) (18, 9) (18, 6) (7, 11) (7, 17) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 1) (12, 15) (12, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 18) (6, 12) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<8, (11, 4, 10)>
<4, (8, 19, 2)>
<0, (15, 14, 6)>
<16, (5, 19, 9)>
