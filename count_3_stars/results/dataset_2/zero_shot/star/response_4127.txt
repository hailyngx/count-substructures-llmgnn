Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 8) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 1) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 13) (15, 3) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 2) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 8) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 12) (13, 3) (19, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (17, 16) (17, 0) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 8) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 14) (14, 9) (14, 18) (14, 1) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 18) (8, 12) (7, 10) 

Response:
There are 5 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (11, 8, 10)>
<2, (9, 4, 12)>
<3, (11, 15, 13)>
<6, (9, 18, 8)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
Thus, the final answer is [5].
