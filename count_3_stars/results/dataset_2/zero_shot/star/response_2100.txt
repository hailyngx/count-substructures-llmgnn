Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 15) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 11) (3, 13) (3, 26) (3, 4) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 21) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 29) (11, 10) (11, 27) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 16) (21, 25) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 13) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 23) (14, 13) (17, 25) (17, 20) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 24) (28, 21) (15, 2) (15, 20) (20, 29) (20, 17) (20, 15) (20, 19) (19, 20) (19, 22) (26, 3) (26, 1) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 26) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 16) (5, 10) (5, 23) (8, 14) (8, 24) (8, 4) (9, 25) (9, 10) (9, 18) (0, 7) (6, 10) (6, 24) (24, 18) (24, 8) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 4) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 23) (16, 4) (23, 14) (23, 5) (23, 16) (22, 19) (22, 27) (13, 3) (13, 21) (13, 14) (27, 11) (27, 24) (27, 22) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 16)
