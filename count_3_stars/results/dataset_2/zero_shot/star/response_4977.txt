Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 4, 1)>
