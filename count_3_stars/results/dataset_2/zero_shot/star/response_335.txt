Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 3) (9, 27) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 29) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 8) (0, 7) (0, 20) (0, 19) (20, 9) (20, 0) (20, 28) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 24) (8, 21) (28, 20) (28, 11) (28, 16) (29, 4) (29, 16) (29, 18) (21, 8) (21, 26) (21, 18) (11, 28) (11, 12) (11, 15) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 22) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 19) (16, 27) (13, 15) (17, 25) (17, 6) (17, 24) (17, 27) (25, 17) (25, 23) (23, 25) (23, 10) (26, 21) (26, 2) (26, 15) (26, 27) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 22) (19, 1) (22, 3) (22, 19) (22, 24) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 2) (14, 3) (14, 18) (2, 26) (2, 6) (15, 11) (15, 13) (15, 26) (15, 6) (24, 8) (24, 17) (24, 22) (10, 23) (18, 29) (18, 21) (18, 14) (12, 5) (12, 11) (27, 9) (27, 16) (27, 17) (27, 26) (1, 5) (1, 19) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <>:

<5, (9, 1, 12)>
<9, (5, 3, 20)>
<4, (7, 8, 29)>
<7, (4, 0, 19)>
<20, (9, 0, 28)>
<8, (4, 7, 24)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
