Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 18) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 18) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 15) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 17) (8, 7) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 2) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 12) (6, 13) (17, 9) (17, 8) (17, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 18) (13, 6) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 14) (18, 12) (4, 17) (4, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 19) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 19) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (0, 1, 15)>
<9, (12, 17, 5)>
<10, (8, 18, 11)>
<11, (14, 18, 16)>
<15, (2, 5, 9)>
<17, (4, 8, 9)>
<18, (10, 12, 14)>
<19, (1, 7, 12)>
