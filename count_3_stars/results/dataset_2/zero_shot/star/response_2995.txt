Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are 8 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 6, 5)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (9, 4, 3)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 0)>
<5, (0, 6, 3)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the answer is [8].
