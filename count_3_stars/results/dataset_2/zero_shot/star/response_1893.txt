Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 7) 

Response:
There are [8] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
<6, (9, 5, 3)>
<9, (6, 8, 2)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (6, 1, 5)>
<4, (8, 0, 5)>
<7, (9, 1, 0)>
<8, (6, 9, 1)>
<5, (6, 1, 3)>
