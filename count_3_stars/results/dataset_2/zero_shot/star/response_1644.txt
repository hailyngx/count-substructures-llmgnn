Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 2) (5, 19) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 19) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 18) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 16) (14, 13) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 16) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 17) (12, 7) (12, 9) (13, 14) (13, 11) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 11) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 11) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 14) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 2) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 8) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 19) (11, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-star structures in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 18)>
<1, (0, 3, 10)>
<3, (1, 0, 17)>
<7, (4, 10, 18)>
<9, (4, 8, 12)>
<14, (6, 16, 18)>
