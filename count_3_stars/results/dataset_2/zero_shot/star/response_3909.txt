Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<6, (1, 9, 7)>
<1, (6, 9, 3)>
<3, (1, 9, 2)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (6, 4, 2)>
<8, (4, 2, 0)>
<2, (9, 3, 8)>
