Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (5, 6) (5, 11) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 11) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 10) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 2) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 13) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (0, 14, 13)>
<7, (6, 9, 11)>
<0, (2, 4, 14)>
<6, (5, 7, 10)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 11, 5)>
<1, (13, 14, 1)>
<14, (0, 8, 13)>
<2, (0, 11, 12)>
<8, (1, 12, 14)>
<13, (1, 12, 14)>
<3, (9, 10, 2)>
<11, (2, 5, 7)>
<10, (13, 14, 10)>
<12, (8, 13, 2)>
<11, (5, 6, 11)>
