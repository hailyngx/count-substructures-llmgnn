Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 9) (15, 19) (15, 0) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 12) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 10) (18, 9) (18, 4) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 1) (12, 17) (11, 3) (11, 19) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 10) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 13) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 16) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 8) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 16) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<3, (11, 19, 9)>
<14, (17, 0, 19)>
<14, (17, 2, 13)>
<17, (14, 16, 12)>
<5, (9, 4, 18)>
<6, (1, 8, 19)>
<18, (9, 4, 10)>
<1, (9, 6, 13)>
