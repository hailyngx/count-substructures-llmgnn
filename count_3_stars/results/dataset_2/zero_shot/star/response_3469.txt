Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 5) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (1, 17) (1, 2) (10, 4) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 0) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 17) (12, 16) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 17) (8, 15) (8, 14) (17, 1) (17, 7) (17, 4) (5, 15) (5, 2) (19, 9) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 13) (0, 16) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 14) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 16) 

Response:
There are [7] total 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (6, 11, 13)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<15, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (6, 14, 17)>
<16, (0, 10, 12)>
<14, (8, 13, 16)>
<0, (2, 13, 18)>
