Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<6, (1, 4, 2)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (9, 3, 2)>
<2, (6, 8, 7)>
<8, (9, 5, 2)>
<7, (1, 3, 2)>
