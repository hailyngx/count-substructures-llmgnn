Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: <5, (3, 8, 7)>, <9, (5, 8, 0)>, <6, (7, 4, ---)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (9, 8, 7)>
