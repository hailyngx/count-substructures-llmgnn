Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 12) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 19) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 18) (2, 18) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 13) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 15) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 18) (13, 1) (17, 11) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 0) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (15, 2) (15, 5) 

Response:
There are [15] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars: <1, (10, 13, 8)>, <7, (16, 18, 19)>, <12, (3, 4, 16)>, <5, (1, 6, 15)>, <14, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (8, 14, 19)>, <18, (2, 7, 13)>, <0, (10, 11, 19)>, <16, (0, 11, 12)>, <2, (3, 15, 18)>, <13, (1, 18, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 10)>, <10, (0, 1, 6)>, <11, (0, 16, 17)>, <15, (2, 5, 6)>
