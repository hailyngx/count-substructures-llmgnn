Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 14) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 10) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 11) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 5) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (3, 8) (3, 10) (4, 9) (4, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars found:
<6, (9, 2, 8)>
