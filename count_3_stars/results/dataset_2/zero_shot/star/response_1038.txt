Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 10) (9, 1) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 28) (26, 8) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 0) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 25) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 15) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 13) (4, 18) (4, 10) (4, 25) (22, 9) (22, 14) (22, 0) (24, 26) (24, 23) (24, 29) (11, 3) (11, 1) (28, 26) (28, 19) (6, 21) (21, 6) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 17) (17, 18) (17, 21) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 27) (20, 17) (20, 1) (20, 23) (20, 16) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 21) (10, 16) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 20) (23, 24) (23, 20) (12, 2) (12, 21) (12, 25) (16, 17) (16, 20) (16, 10) (0, 3) (0, 22) (19, 28) (19, 14) (14, 22) (14, 19) (14, 27) (27, 17) (27, 14) (27, 29) (27, 13) (29, 24) (29, 27) (29, 8) (13, 18) (13, 27) (5, 25) (25, 15) (25, 4) (25, 12) (25, 5) (25, 8) (8, 26) (8, 15) (8, 29) (8, 25) 

Response:
There are [9] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<9, (26, 22, 10)>
<26, (9, 24, 28)>
<3, (15, 11, 0)>
<15, (3, 18, 8)>
<2, (18, 12, 4)>
<4, (18, 10, 25)>
<22, (9, 14, 0)>
<24, (26, 23, 29)>
<11, (3, 1, 0)>
