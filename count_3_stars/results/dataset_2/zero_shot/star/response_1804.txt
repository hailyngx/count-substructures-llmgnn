Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 13) (11, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 10) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 4) 

Response:
There are <9, (1, 6, 12)>, <6, (7, 2, 8)>, and <2, (0, 3, 14)> 3-stars in the graph, so the total number of 3-stars is [3].
