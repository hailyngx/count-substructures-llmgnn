Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 16) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 6) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 4) (17, 3) (17, 16) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 19) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 0) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 1) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 6) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 14) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 19) 

Response:
There are total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 16)>
<2, (11, 12, 14)>
<4, (8, 13, 0)>
<11, (2, 6, 15)>
<15, (6, 18, 19)>
