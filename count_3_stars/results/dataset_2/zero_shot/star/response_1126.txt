Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 7) (5, 10) (5, 7) (13, 3) (0, 19) (0, 9) (16, 17) (16, 6) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 2) (6, 17) (6, 16) (6, 7) (6, 15) (1, 2) (1, 19) (19, 0) (19, 11) (19, 1) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 12) (7, 17) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 18) (4, 15) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 18) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 12) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 3) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 3) (18, 17) (18, 7) (18, 15) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<14, (17, 11, 8)>
<10, (14, 5, 3)>
<7, (17, 6, 5)>
<15, (8, 6, 4)>
<19, (11, 1, 0)>
<2, (11, 1, 9)>
