Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (9, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (9, 1, 4)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
