Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 14) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (3, 5, 11)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 10)>
<8, (0, 11, 12)>
<0, (7, 8, 14)>
<5, (13, 14, 6)>
<14, (2, 5, 13)>
<2, (7, 9, 14)>
