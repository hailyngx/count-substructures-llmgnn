Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
