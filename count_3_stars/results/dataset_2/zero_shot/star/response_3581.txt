Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
<0, (9, 2, 1)>
<3, (7, 9, 8)>
<4, (7, 1, 5)>
