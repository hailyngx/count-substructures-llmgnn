Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 15) (0, 24) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 14) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 17) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 23) (18, 22) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 20) (18, 17) (22, 18) (22, 5) (22, 29) (23, 8) (23, 13) (23, 17) (23, 9) (21, 16) (21, 29) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 20) (15, 14) (20, 18) (20, 15) (20, 3) (20, 19) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 3) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 29) (28, 6) (28, 16) (26, 13) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 1) (16, 4) (16, 21) (16, 28) (16, 14) (29, 22) (29, 21) (29, 6) (24, 0) (19, 0) (19, 20) (25, 7) (25, 2) (1, 6) (1, 11) (12, 4) (12, 9) (9, 23) (9, 12) (9, 17) (2, 25) (2, 17) (14, 27) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 16) (3, 4) (3, 20) (3, 5) (17, 7) (17, 18) (17, 23) (17, 9) (17, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (15, 19, 24)>
<4, (3, 12, 16)>
<7, (14, 17, 25)>
<8, (11, 13, 23)>
<13, (5, 11, 23)>
<16, (14, 21, 28)>
<18, (15, 17, 20)>
<22, (5, 18, 29)>
<29, (6, 21, 22)>
<9, (12, 17, 23)>
<25, (2, 7, 17)>
<1, (6, 11, 13)>
