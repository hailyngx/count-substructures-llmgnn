Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 18) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 15) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (14, 6) (14, 17) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 1) (4, 6) (4, 13) (18, 11) (18, 19) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (1, 16) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 19) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 1) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 9) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 12) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (15, 16) (15, 14) (10, 6) (10, 5) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<6, (9, 14, 19)>
<6, (4, 9, 14)>
<6, (10, 5, 19)>
<6, (4, 6, 14)>
<9, (0, 3, 12)>
<9, (6, 7, 16)>
