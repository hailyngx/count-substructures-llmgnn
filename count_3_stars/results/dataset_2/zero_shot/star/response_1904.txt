Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 10) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 11) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) 

Response:
There are [11] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 8, 12)>
<2, (3, 9, 11)>
<3, (1, 5, 4)>
<4, (3, 6, 0)>
<5, (9, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 6, 4)>
<7, (5, 7, 14)>
<8, (1, 10, 11)>
<9, (12, 1, 8)>
<10, (13, 8, 10)>
<11, (2, 13, 9)>
