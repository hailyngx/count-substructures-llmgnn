Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (14, 11) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 12) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 12) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<6, (9, 7, 12)>
<9, (6, 2, 11)>
<4, (0, 10, 5)>
<7, (6, 3, 11)>
<8, (6, 10, 0)>
<12, (6, 3, 1)>
