Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 25) (14, 1) (17, 3) (17, 19) (4, 16) (4, 20) (4, 15) (4, 21) (7, 29) (7, 22) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 25) (6, 20) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 19) (11, 29) (18, 22) (18, 28) (18, 29) (22, 26) (22, 7) (22, 18) (8, 10) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 21) (23, 28) (16, 4) (16, 21) (16, 3) (21, 4) (21, 23) (21, 16) (21, 12) (21, 29) (2, 23) (2, 12) (2, 24) (12, 21) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 13) (3, 17) (3, 16) (1, 14) (1, 29) (1, 13) (29, 7) (29, 11) (29, 18) (29, 21) (29, 1) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 15) (5, 15) (25, 26) (25, 6) (25, 15) (15, 4) (15, 24) (15, 5) (15, 25) (20, 4) (20, 6) (20, 27) (20, 28) (27, 9) (27, 20) (19, 17) (19, 10) (28, 18) (28, 23) (28, 20) (28, 13) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 28) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<9, (6, 26, 27)>
<26, (9, 22, 25)>
<4, (15, 16, 21)>
<21, (16, 23, 29)>
<2, (12, 23, 24)>
<0, (12, 13, 8)>
<3, (16, 17, 19)>
<1, (13, 14, 29)>
