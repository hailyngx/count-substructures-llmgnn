This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
