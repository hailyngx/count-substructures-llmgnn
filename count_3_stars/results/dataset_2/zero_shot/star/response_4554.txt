Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 0) (15, 3) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 12) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 7) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 1) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 12) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 19) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (14, 19) (4, 15) (4, 10) (4, 5) 

Response:
