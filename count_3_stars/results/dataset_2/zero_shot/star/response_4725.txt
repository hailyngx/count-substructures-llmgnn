Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (0, 3, 10)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 11, 14)>
<7, (1, 6, 13)>
<1, (3, 12, 14)>
<3, (2, 5, 10)>
<10, (11, 12, 14)>
<11, (8, 13, 4)>
<8, (2, 9, 11)>
<0, (5, 13, 6)>
<14, (6, 11, 1)>
<2, (3, 9, 8)>
<12, (10, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 7, 13)>
<13, (0, 6, 11)>
