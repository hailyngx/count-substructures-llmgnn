Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 19) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 15) (18, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 3) (19, 5) (19, 11) (1, 6) (1, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 16) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 4) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 17) (4, 16) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 8) (7, 15) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 7) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 0) (16, 3) (16, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) 

Response:
[<5, (9, 13, 19)>, <9, (5, 15, 2)>, <10, (11, 12, 13)>, <11, (10, 14, 19)>, <2, (9, 7, 15)>, <13, (5, 10, 12)>, <19, (5, 11, 14)>, <1, (6, 8, 0)>, <6, (1, 3, 12)>, <14, (11, 3, 19)>, <3, (13, 6, 14)>, <17, (3, 12, 8)>, <8, (1, 17, 7)>, <4, (17, 16)>, <7, (2, 18, 8)>, <15, (9, 2, 7)>, <12, (10, 13, 6)>, <16, (3, 4)>, <0, (8, 12)>]
