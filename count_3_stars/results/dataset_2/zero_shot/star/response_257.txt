Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.

<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 1, 3)>
<5, (8, 5, 1)>
<6, (7, 6, 5)>
<7, (6, 5, 2)>
<8, (8, 2, 9)>
<9, (9, 1, 0)>
