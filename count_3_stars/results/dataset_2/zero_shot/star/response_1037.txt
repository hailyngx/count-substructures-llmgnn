Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 7) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 4) 

Response:
The center node and the leaves for the 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (1, 10, 6)>
- <10, (3, 4, 5)>
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 6, 5)>
- <11, (14, 13, 6)>
- <8, (11, 7, 9)>
- <9, (1, 0, 8)>
- <2, (3, 12, 13)>
- <12, (3, 2, 14)>
- <14, (11, 12, 4)>
- <5, (1, 10, 7)>
- <6, (3, 11, 0)>
- <4, (10, 0, 9)>
- <13, (11, 7, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
