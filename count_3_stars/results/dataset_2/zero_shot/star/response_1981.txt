Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 29) (22, 1) (4, 19) (4, 26) (7, 11) (7, 24) (7, 28) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 23) (27, 21) (27, 9) (27, 5) (23, 22) (23, 0) (23, 26) (23, 29) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 18) (6, 26) (9, 27) (9, 6) (9, 29) (8, 2) (15, 25) (15, 16) (20, 3) (20, 24) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 12) (28, 7) (28, 6) (28, 1) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 24) (18, 21) (3, 20) (3, 11) (3, 21) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 17) (14, 0) (14, 5) (5, 27) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 19) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 25) (19, 16) (21, 27) (21, 18) (21, 3) (17, 13) (17, 11) (17, 12) (29, 22) (29, 23) (29, 9) (29, 25) (12, 2) (12, 17) (26, 4) (26, 23) (26, 6) (26, 10) (10, 26) (10, 16) (16, 15) (16, 19) (16, 10) (24, 7) (24, 20) (24, 18) (25, 0) (25, 15) (25, 19) (25, 29) (1, 22) (1, 28) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (22, 28, 23)>
<2, (8, 18, 12)>
<3, (20, 11, 21)>
<6, (9, 27, 26)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
