Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 3) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 0) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 13) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (9, 13, 14)>
<2, (6, 11, 13)>
<3, (7, 10, 12)>
<4, (0, 8, 14)>
<5, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 10, 13)>
<7, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 14)>
<9, (1, 13, 14)>
<10, (3, 7, 10)>
<11, (2, 6, 13)>
<12, (3, 7, 12)>
