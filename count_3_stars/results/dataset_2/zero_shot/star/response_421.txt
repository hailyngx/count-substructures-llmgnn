<27, (0, 22, 20)>
<1, (17, 10, 24)>
<6, (9, 24, 15)>
<8, (9, 23, 29)>
<23, (9, 6, 29)>
<7, (12, 25, 3)>
<12, (5, 7, 1)>
<17, (1, 11, 24)>
<2, (5, 3, 25)>
<22, (27, 28, 10)>
<16, (5, 21, 13)>
<21, (16, 19, 18)>
<10, (0, 22, 1)>
<24, (5, 27, 1)>
<4, (14, 25, 5)>
<15, (6, 25, 13)>
<26, (25, 29, 2)>
<20, (27, 22, 0)>
<29, (0, 23, 26)>
<13, (7, 16, 15)>
<18, (1, 16, 21)>
<28, (22, 19, 28)>
<19, (1, 21, 28)>

There are 26 unique 3-stars in this graph. This gives a total count of [26].
