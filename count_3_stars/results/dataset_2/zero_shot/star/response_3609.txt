Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 0) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 4) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 5) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 7) (18, 16) (18, 9) (8, 19) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 6) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 10) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 6) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 13) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 7) (5, 17) (5, 4) (12, 14) (12, 10) (1, 16) (1, 13) (10, 19) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 4) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 4) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 13) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

<15, (3, 6, 2)>

<7, (3, 14, 2)>
<16, (1, 18, 4)>
<6, (15, 8, 19)>
<14, (17, 7, 12)>
<0, (11, 13, 3)>
<4, (16, 5, 10)>
