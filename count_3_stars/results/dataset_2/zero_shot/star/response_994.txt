Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 11) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 7) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 7) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 12) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 13) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 7) (14, 9) (14, 3) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 1) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 10) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (1, 8, 13)>
<9, (4, 6, 12)>
<6, (0, 9, 12)>
<4, (3, 8, 11)>
<8, (2, 4, 10)>
<2, (1, 7, 13)>
<13, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (4, 10, 14)>
<11, (4, 12, 14)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (6, 13, 9)>
<10, (3, 7, 8)>
