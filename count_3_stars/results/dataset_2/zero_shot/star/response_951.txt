Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (9, 3, 1)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (9, 7, 1)>
<3, (9, 4, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 1, 4)>
<7, (6, 4, 5)>
<8, (6, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
