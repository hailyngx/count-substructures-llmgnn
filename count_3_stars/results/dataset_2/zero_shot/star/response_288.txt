Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) 

Response:
Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

[<3, (5, 9, 6)>]
