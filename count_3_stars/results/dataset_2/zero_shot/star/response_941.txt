Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 11) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 7) (0, 14) (0, 16) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 11) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 17) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 0) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (11, 15) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 17) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 6) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 18) (17, 8) (17, 19) (17, 2) (18, 13) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 16, 3)>
<11, (1, 19, 15)>
<15, (8, 14, 11)>
<1, (16, 0, 7)>
<8, (15, 10, 19)>
<4, (3, 6, 10)>
<10, (8, 6, 2)>
<13, (9, 2, 18)>
