Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (6, 9, 2)>
<3, (0, 5, 4)>
<8, (9, 7, 5)>
