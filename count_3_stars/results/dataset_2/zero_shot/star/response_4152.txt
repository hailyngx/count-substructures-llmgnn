Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 2) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 17) (1, 10) (1, 15) (1, 16) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 12) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 9) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 18) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 12) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 14) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 9) (12, 15) (12, 3) (18, 10) (18, 11) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 16) 

Response:
The number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<10, (1, 4, 5)>
<15, (1, 5, 14)>
<3, (17, 5, 16)>
