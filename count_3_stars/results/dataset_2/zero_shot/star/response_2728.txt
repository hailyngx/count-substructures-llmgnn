Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (3, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 12) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 12) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 10) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 5) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-star structures:

<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<2, (8, 10, 13)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<11, (1, 6, 13)>
<0, (7, 9, 13)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 11)>
<10, (4, 7, 9)>
<14, (1, 12, 13)>
<5, (2, 7, 12)>
<9, (0, 4, 10)>
<12, (5, 6, 14)>
<13, (2, 6, 11)>

Total number of 3-stars: [14]
