Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are <5, (9, 3, 0)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (9, 1, 7)>, and <1, (6, 7, 3)>.
