Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 12) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (7, 0, 6)>
<7, (4, 1, 14)>
<10, (6, 13, 5)>
