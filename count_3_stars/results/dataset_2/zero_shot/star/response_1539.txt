Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 17) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 8) (9, 14) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 19) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 7) (18, 1) (18, 8) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 19) (7, 17) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 18) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 14) (6, 3) (6, 13) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 11) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 13) (19, 15) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 19) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 12) (14, 9) (14, 16) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is [8].

<0, (3, 7, 16)>
<1, (3, 10, 18)>
<2, (12, 13, 11)>
<3, (15, 1, 6)>
<8, (5, 9, 18)>
<10, (15, 1, 13)>
<12, (3, 17, 2)>
<19, (15, 10, 11)>
