Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 19) (10, 15) (10, 19) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 0) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 13) (13, 0) (13, 15) (18, 14) (18, 11) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 16) (6, 15) (6, 14) (6, 7) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 6) (14, 11) (7, 8) (7, 6) (16, 5) (16, 19) (12, 1) (12, 17) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<3, (1, 9, 17)>
<5, (2, 14, 16)>
<10, (15, 19, 6)>
<4, (0, 8, 11)>
<18, (11, 14, 18)>
