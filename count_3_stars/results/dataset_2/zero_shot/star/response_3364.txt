Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 12) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 15) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 15) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 10) (4, 0) (4, 15) (12, 16) (12, 1) (12, 17) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 18) (7, 11) (7, 2) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 2) (15, 4) (18, 6) (18, 10) (18, 17) (10, 19) (10, 18) (17, 5) (17, 12) (17, 18) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<11, (16, 7, 6)>
<5, (19, 17, 0)>
<9, (8, 15, 13)>
<1, (3, 6, 12)>
