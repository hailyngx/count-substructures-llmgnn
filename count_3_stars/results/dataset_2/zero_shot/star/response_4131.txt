Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are [10] nodes and [40] edges in the given graph.

The 3-star graphs are:
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 8, 2)>
