Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 2) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 12) (8, 18) (4, 1) (4, 15) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 7) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 9) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 13) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 1) (1, 4) (1, 19) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 0) (13, 7) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 12) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 12) (10, 9) (10, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 15, 19)>
<7, (0, 13, 18)>
<9, (5, 7, 12)>
<12, (3, 6, 9)>
<15, (0, 4, 5)>
<16, (2, 11, 17)>
