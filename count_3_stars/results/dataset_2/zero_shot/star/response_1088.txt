Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 13) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 1) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) 

Response:
The central nodes in all the 3-stars will be the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. Given the information about the graph, we can determine the central nodes to be: 6, 1, and 10.

Let's now identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- For central node 6, the leaf nodes connected are 1, 7, and 4. (<6, (1, 7, 4)>)
- For central node 1, the leaf nodes connected are 8, 11, and 13. (<1, (8, 11, 13)>)
- For central node 10, the leaf nodes connected are 9, 13, and 14. (<10, (9, 13, 14)>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
