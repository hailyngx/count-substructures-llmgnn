Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<6, (9, 1, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<0, (5, 1, 8)>
