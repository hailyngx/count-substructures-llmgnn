Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 2) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 14) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as follows:

<0, (3, 13, 14)>
<1, (12, 13, 2)>
<4, (6, 10, 12)>
<7, (2, 5, 14)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
