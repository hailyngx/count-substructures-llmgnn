Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph can be found by first identifying the central nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. Let's list the 3-stars with their central node first:

<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<6, (5, 7, 3)>
<4, (9, 6, 7)>
<7, (6, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 4, 2)>
<3, (5, 6, 2)>
<8, (6, 4, 7)>
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<2, (7, 1, 3)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [9].
