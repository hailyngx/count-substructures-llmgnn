Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 4) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 11) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 4) (10, 5) (10, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 13) 

Response:
There are 9 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 10, 14)>
<9, (5, 10, 1)>
<6, (11, 12, 8)>
<1, (9, 3, 2)>
<3, (1, 7, 13)>
<7, (9, 3, 14)>
<12, (6, 1, 2)>
<0, (6, 13, 2)>
<2, (1, 12, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
