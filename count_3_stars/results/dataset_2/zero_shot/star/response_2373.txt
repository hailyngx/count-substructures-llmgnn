Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<2, (5, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 2, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 6)>
