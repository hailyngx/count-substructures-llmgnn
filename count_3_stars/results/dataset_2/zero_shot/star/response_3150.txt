Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 14) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (1, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

<5, (9, 6, 12)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
<4, (7, 2, 10)>
<7, (4, 0, 6)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<10, (4, 13, 14)>
