Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 0) (5, 12) (5, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<6, (1, 7, 12)>
<4, (3, 10, 13)>
<7, (6, 0, 11)>
<10, (4, 8, 13)>
<11, (9, 7, 10)>
<13, (0, 3, 10)>
