Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 4) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 9) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 7) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 11) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 8) (19, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (16, 13) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 0) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 2) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 6) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 14) (18, 1) (1, 18) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 13, 11)>
<2, (14, 17, 4)>
<4, (3, 19, 2)>
<5, (15, 9, 10)>
<8, (15, 19, 14)>
<10, (0, 5, 11)>
<12, (13, 14, 6)>
<18, (15, 17, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
