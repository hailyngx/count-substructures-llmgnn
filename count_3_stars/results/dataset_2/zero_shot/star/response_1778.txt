Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 0) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are 10 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed:

<5, (6, 8, 1)>
<9, (11, 3, 7)>
<8, (5, 4, 10)>
<13, (1, 10, 11)>
<10, (8, 13, 11)>
<11, (9, 10, 6)>
<4, (8, 10, 0)>
<7, (9, 0, 14)>
<12, (9, 8, 11)>
<0, (4, 7, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
