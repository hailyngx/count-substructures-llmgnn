Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 4) (16, 13) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 9) (10, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 19) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 15) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 6) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 5) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 0) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 15) (12, 10) (12, 14) (6, 11) (6, 17) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 9) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 7) (7, 2) (7, 14) (5, 10) (5, 15) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<11, (10, 19, 6)>
<1, (17, 15, 8)>
<13, (16, 2, 8)>
<2, (13, 7, 0)>
