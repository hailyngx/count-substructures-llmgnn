Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
