Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 8) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 6) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. The answer is [6].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (12, 14, 0)>
<1, (2, 4, 1)>
<3, (10, 11, 3)>
<5, (9, 13, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (11, 14, 7)>
