Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 4) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 7) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 12) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 10) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 10) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 11, 13)>
<1, (2, 8, 10)>
<3, (6, 11, 14)>
<4, (2, 6, 10)>
<5, (0, 9, 13)>
