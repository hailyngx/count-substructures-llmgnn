Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 24) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 15) (26, 16) (26, 3) (5, 29) (5, 10) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 28) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 28) (17, 24) (17, 22) (4, 23) (4, 20) (18, 25) (18, 8) (13, 26) (13, 16) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 8) (7, 0) (7, 16) (16, 26) (16, 13) (16, 7) (16, 29) (1, 14) (1, 25) (1, 23) (6, 10) (11, 2) (8, 18) (8, 0) (8, 28) (8, 24) (28, 14) (28, 17) (28, 8) (15, 26) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 22) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 10) (3, 26) (3, 17) (3, 27) (3, 23) (29, 5) (29, 16) (29, 12) (24, 9) (24, 17) (24, 8) (24, 12) (24, 21) (25, 18) (25, 1) (25, 23) (25, 2) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 19) (22, 17) (22, 15) (22, 21) (12, 29) (12, 24) (12, 21) (2, 11) (2, 25) (2, 20) (23, 4) (23, 1) (23, 3) (23, 25) (20, 4) (20, 2) (27, 3) (21, 24) (21, 22) (21, 12) 

Response:
There are 16 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is: [16]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<9, (26, 19, 24)>
<26, (9, 13, 15)>
<5, (29, 10, 19)>
<14, (17, 1, 28)>
<17, (14, 3, 28)>
<4, (23, 20, 25)>
<18, (25, 8, 8)>
<13, (26, 16, 16)>
<0, (7, 15, 8)>
<19, (9, 15, 10)>
<3, (17, 26, 23)>
<8, (18, 28, 24)>
<28, (14, 17, 8)>
<15, (26, 0, 19)>
<10, (5, 6, 19)>
<22, (17, 15, 21)>
