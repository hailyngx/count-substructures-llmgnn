Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 15) (17, 10) (17, 11) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 0) (4, 13) (4, 19) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 14) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 0) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 19) (16, 4) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 15) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 3) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 9) (15, 11) (15, 6) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 5) 

Response:
The total number of possible 3-stars can be calculated using the given graph as follows:

1. Identify all nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes: 13, 10, 11, 17, 7, 12, 4, 19, 1, 5, 0, 6 and 14.

2. For each of these nodes, count the number of distinct trios that can be formed with the connected nodes.

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars by summing up the counts obtained in the previous step.

Let's go ahead and calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

In this graph, the number of 3-stars is: [10]

Unique 3-stars:
<13, (8, 4, 14)>
<10, (11, 7, 17)>
<11, (1, 15, 17)>
<17, (10, 11, 7)>
<7, (10, 12, 3)>
<12, (7, 14, 6)>
<4, (13, 19, 16)>
<19, (2, 5, 0)>
<1, (11, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 14, 19)>
