Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>
<7, (4, 1, 0)>
<1, (4, 3, 6)>
<3, (5, 1, 0)>
<0, (5, 7, 3)>
