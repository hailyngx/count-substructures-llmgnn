Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
Unique 3-stars found: <4, (9, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 8, 1)>, <1, (7, 6, 5)>, <3, (4, 1, 9)>, <6, (4, 1, 5)>, <9, (4, 3, 8)>, <5, (4, 1, 3)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (7, 9, 5)>, <0, (7, 1, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 5)>.
