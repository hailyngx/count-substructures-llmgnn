Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (12, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 20 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 14, 1)>
<1, (0, 9, 6)>
<2, (6, 11, 10)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 13)>
<5, (3, 4, 14)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 10, 11)>
<8, (3, 6, 13)>
<9, (1, 7, 10)>
<10, (2, 7, 8)>
<11, (2, 11, 5)>
<12, (7, 1, 3)>
<13, (4, 8, 9)>
<14, (0, 5, 6)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
