Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 22) (16, 8) (16, 9) (4, 11) (4, 5) (7, 16) (7, 21) (7, 10) (7, 27) (21, 7) (21, 13) (21, 9) (21, 12) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 3) (13, 21) (13, 8) (13, 29) (20, 25) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 14) (18, 15) (22, 16) (22, 28) (3, 8) (3, 26) (26, 3) (26, 28) (26, 10) (28, 8) (28, 22) (28, 26) (28, 0) (27, 7) (27, 25) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 6) (2, 12) (12, 21) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 17) (10, 7) (10, 26) (10, 27) (10, 12) (1, 11) (1, 29) (29, 13) (29, 1) (29, 0) (29, 14) (6, 27) (6, 14) (17, 11) (17, 12) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 24) (14, 25) (14, 29) (14, 6) (14, 15) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 24) (9, 16) (9, 21) (24, 27) (24, 0) (24, 15) (24, 5) (5, 4) (5, 25) (5, 24) (19, 20) (19, 25) 

Response:
