Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 3) (2, 25) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 26) (18, 23) (18, 10) (18, 24) (18, 21) (22, 26) (22, 10) (12, 27) (12, 28) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 20) (27, 8) (1, 12) (1, 26) (1, 5) (26, 29) (26, 22) (26, 1) (26, 13) (26, 23) (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 14) (16, 3) (16, 15) (28, 12) (28, 4) (28, 23) (3, 2) (3, 16) (3, 21) (3, 9) (21, 18) (21, 3) (21, 15) (8, 12) (8, 27) (8, 19) (8, 20) (8, 6) (19, 29) (19, 8) (19, 9) (19, 0) (23, 18) (23, 26) (23, 28) (6, 8) (7, 5) (14, 13) (14, 24) (14, 25) (14, 10) (15, 16) (15, 21) (9, 3) (9, 19) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 14) (10, 5) (20, 27) (20, 8) (20, 4) (0, 2) (0, 19) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 10) (4, 28) (4, 20) (4, 24) (24, 18) (24, 14) (24, 4) (24, 25) (25, 2) (25, 14) (25, 24) (11, 12) (11, 13) 

Response:
There are 9 unique 3-stars in this graph.  
The 3-stars are:  
<2, (0, 25, 29)>  
<12, (1, 8, 27)>  
<3, (2, 9, 16)>  
<21, (3, 15, 18)>  
<8, (6, 19, 27)>  
<19, (0, 8, 29)>  
<23, (18, 26, 28)>  
<14, (10, 24, 25)>  
<5, (1, 7, 10)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
