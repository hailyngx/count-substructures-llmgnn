Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (9, 8, 7)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (6, 0, 1)>
<7, (5, 8, 1)>
<1, (9, 6, 4)>
