Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by counting all the instances where a node has exactly three neighbors.

The nodes with three neighbors are:
- Node 4: [6, 7, 9]
- Node 6: [0, 3, 4]
- Node 7: [0, 2, 4]
- Node 9: [1, 2, 4]

So there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
