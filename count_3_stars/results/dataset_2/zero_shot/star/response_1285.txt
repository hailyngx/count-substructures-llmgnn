Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (12, 6) (12, 3) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 14) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 13) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

<0, (7, 9, 10)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 14)>
<3, (9, 10, 11)>
<5, (10, 11, 14)>
<8, (1, 5, 14)>
