Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are 5 total 3-stars in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (9, 1, 3)>
<4, (5, 7, 0)>
<6, (7, 2, 1)>
<1, (5, 9, 2)>
<0, (4, 7, 3)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
