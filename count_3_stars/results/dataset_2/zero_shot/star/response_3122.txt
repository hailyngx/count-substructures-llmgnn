Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<4, (7, 9, 0)>
<7, (4, 3, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 6)>
<1, (9, 3, 5)>
<3, (7, 1, 2)>
<5, (7, 6, 1)>
