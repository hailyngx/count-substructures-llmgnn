Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 17) (7, 29) (7, 27) (7, 1) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 26) (27, 7) (27, 2) (27, 9) (27, 26) (8, 4) (8, 28) (6, 28) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 20) (6, 13) (28, 8) (28, 6) (28, 3) (28, 18) (28, 20) (9, 27) (9, 11) (22, 11) (1, 4) (1, 7) (17, 4) (17, 19) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 10) (11, 9) (11, 22) (11, 18) (23, 21) (23, 29) (14, 26) (14, 20) (14, 2) (14, 10) (26, 0) (26, 27) (26, 14) (26, 15) (3, 6) (3, 28) (29, 7) (29, 23) (15, 26) (15, 16) (21, 0) (21, 23) (21, 18) (21, 25) (12, 0) (12, 18) (13, 6) (13, 24) (13, 10) (10, 19) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 25) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 25) (16, 20) (20, 6) (20, 28) (20, 14) (20, 16) (25, 21) (25, 10) (25, 16) (24, 13) (18, 28) (18, 11) (18, 21) (18, 12) (2, 27) (2, 6) (2, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graph structures can be calculated by examining the nodes with their respective edges. In a 3-star, a central node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's list down the 3-star graphs found in the given graph:

- <4, (8, 5, 1)>
- <7, (29, 27, 1)>
- <0, (21, 12, 26)>
- <27, (2, 9, 26)>
- <8, (28, 4, 6)>
- <6, (3, 2, 28)>
- <28, (3, 6, 18)>
- <9, (11, 27, 22)>
- <1, (7, 4, 17)>
- <17, (19, 4, 17)>
- <5, (19, 16, 4)>
- <19, (5, 17, 10)>
- <11, (18, 9, 22)>
- <21, (23, 18, 0)>
- <13, (10, 24, 6)>
- <26, (14, 27, 0)>
- <3, (6, 28, 2)>
- <29, (23, 7, 27)>
- <15, (26, 16, 15)>
- <20, (14, 16, 6)>
- <25, (16, 10, 21)>
- <10, (25, 19, 14)>
- <16, (25, 15, 20)>
- <12, (18, 0, 12)>
- <2, (27, 14, 6)>
- <24, (13, 24, 13)>

There are a total of 25 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].
