Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 14) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 9) (12, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (1, 2, 11)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<10, (0, 5, 11)>
<11, (4, 5, 10)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<13, (5, 8, 12)>
<0, (2, 8, 10)>
<14, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (8, 10, 13)>
<9, (1, 3, 12)>
<12, (2, 3, 13)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 14)>
