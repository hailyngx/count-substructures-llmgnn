Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 13) (0, 12) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 1) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 2) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 9) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 9) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 3) (4, 5) (4, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of 11 unique 3-stars in this graph. The final answer is [11].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (12, 3, 9)>
<1, (7, 9, 13)>
<2, (11, 6, 3)>
<4, (5, 14, 4)>
<5, (13, 8, 3)>
<6, (10, 2, 13)>
<7, (12, 1, 8)>
<8, (10, 5, 9)>
<9, (10, 1, 12)>
<10, (11, 6, 8)>
<13, (7, 1, 5)>
