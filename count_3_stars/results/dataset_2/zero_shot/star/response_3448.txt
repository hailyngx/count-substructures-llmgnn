Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (10, 17) (10, 7) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 13) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 13) (12, 14) (4, 2) (18, 7) (18, 16) (18, 8) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 15) (19, 5) (8, 18) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 6) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 2) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 15) (15, 5) (15, 16) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated as follows:
Since each 3-star consists of a central node and 3 leaf nodes, we can observe that for a single 3-star, there are 4 nodes involved. So, to form a 3-star, we need to choose 4 nodes out of the given 20 nodes. This can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of nodes and r is the number of nodes needed for a 3-star (which is 4 in this case).

C(20, 4) = 20! / (4!(20-4)!) = 4845.

So, there are 4845 possible 3-stars in the given graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (3, 9, 17)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 14)>
<5, (3, 11, 15)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (10, 13, 18)>
<8, (6, 9, 18)>
<9, (1, 13, 17)>
<10, (7, 13, 17)>
<11, (2, 5, 13)>
<12, (3, 14, 5)>
<13, (6, 7, 11)>
<14, (3, 5, 12)>
<15, (5, 16, 11)>
<16, (0, 15, 18)>
<17, (1, 10, 13)>
<18, (7, 8, 16)>
<19, (5, 11, 15)>
<1, (0, 17, 3)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [19].
