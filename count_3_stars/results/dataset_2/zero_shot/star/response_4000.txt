Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the graph are:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 0)>
<7, (9, 4, 2)>
<1, (4, 3, 0)>
<3, (1, 8, -)>
<6, (9, 2, 0)>
<2, (5, 9, 4)>
<8, (5, 7, 1)>
<0, (5, 4, 1)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
