Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 0) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 12) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (6, 12, 14)>
<9, (1, 12, 13)>
<10, (3, 8, 13)>
<11, (6, 3, 13)>
