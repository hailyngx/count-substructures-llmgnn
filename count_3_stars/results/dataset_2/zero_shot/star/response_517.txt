Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
<1, (3, 5, 0)>
<3, (1, 7, 2)>
