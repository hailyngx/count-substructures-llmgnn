Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 2) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 26) (2, 11) (2, 24) (2, 17) (29, 27) (29, 8) (29, 25) (3, 16) (3, 28) (3, 26) (25, 11) (25, 29) (8, 29) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 24) (13, 9) (13, 7) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 4) (23, 0) (4, 8) (4, 23) (4, 0) (4, 5) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 12) (20, 12) (20, 28) (0, 23) (0, 4) (0, 15) (14, 8) (14, 21) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 26) (9, 13) (9, 22) (9, 17) (21, 14) (21, 6) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 17) (10, 15) (10, 5) (28, 3) (28, 20) (28, 19) (18, 16) (18, 6) (1, 19) (17, 2) (17, 9) (17, 7) (19, 28) (19, 1) (27, 29) (27, 26) (12, 22) (12, 15) (12, 20) (12, 26) (24, 2) (24, 13) (26, 16) (26, 3) (26, 6) (26, 27) (26, 12)
