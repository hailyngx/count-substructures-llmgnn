Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 0, 3)>
<9, (5, 2, 1)>
<4, (5, 7, 3)>
<7, (5, 2, 0)>
