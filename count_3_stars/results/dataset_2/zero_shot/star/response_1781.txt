Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 29) (1, 28) (1, 8) (21, 20) (21, 23) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 17) (3, 4) (3, 24) (3, 16) (3, 2) (14, 25) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 11) (2, 3) (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 15) (29, 1) (29, 2) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 26) (27, 25) (27, 22) (27, 19) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 23) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 26) (8, 18) (23, 21) (23, 9) (24, 3) (24, 25) (22, 2) (22, 27) (22, 26) (26, 12) (26, 8) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 15) (5, 0) (5, 28) (5, 10) (13, 10) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 25) (20, 21) (10, 26) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 15) (15, 2) (15, 12) (15, 26) (15, 10) (16, 3) (16, 28) (16, 18) (28, 1) (28, 5) (28, 16) (11, 17) (11, 12) (11, 25) (25, 14) (25, 27) (25, 24) (25, 0) (25, 11) (19, 2) (19, 27) (18, 8) (18, 16) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (8, 28, 29)>
<2, (15, 22, 26)>
<3, (2, 16, 24)>
<4, (7, 17, 9)>
<10, (5, 10, 13)>
<11, (12, 17, 25)>
<12, (6, 11, 15)>
<25, (0, 11, 25)>
