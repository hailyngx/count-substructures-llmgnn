Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The given graph contains 5 unique 3-stars. The count is shown below within brackets:

[5]

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 9, 0)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
