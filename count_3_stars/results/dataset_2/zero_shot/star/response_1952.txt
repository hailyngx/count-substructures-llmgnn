Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count is [8]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
