Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 19) (9, 17) (9, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (18, 16) (5, 4) (5, 16) (13, 7) (3, 11) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 15) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 16) (12, 2) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 19) (1, 11) (1, 8) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 17) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 16) (14, 8) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 13) (7, 8) (7, 17) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 8) (0, 8) (17, 9) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 7) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 15) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (15, 19, 2)>
<11, (1, 15, 3)>
<4, (16, 12, 10)>
<12, (2, 19, 17)>
<1, (11, 8, 15)>
<8, (1, 7, 14)>
<7, (13, 8, 17)>
<16, (18, 5, 15)>
