Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 5) (12, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 5) (14, 0) (14, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 10) (17, 0) (17, 3) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 16) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 1) (16, 18) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 10) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 18) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 10) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 3) (18, 0) (18, 16) (18, 11) (15, 4) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are <1, (9, 2, 16)>, <3, (17, 10, 14)>, <4, (9, 12, 15)>, <5, (6, 7, 2)>, <7, (9, 16, 5)>, and <8, (19, 2, 11)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
