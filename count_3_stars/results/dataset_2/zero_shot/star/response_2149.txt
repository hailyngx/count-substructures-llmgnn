Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
