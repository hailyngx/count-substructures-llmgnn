Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 2) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 7) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (11, 0) (11, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 7) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) 

Response:
There are 12 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (13, 4, 14)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 9, 12)>
<4, (13, 0, 14)>
<5, (2, 1, 10)>
<7, (13, 7, 14)>
<9, (8, 2, 11)>
<10, (5, 0, 12)>
<11, (9, 0, 3)>
<12, (8, 4, 2)>
<13, (8, 7, 4)>
<14, (8, 13, 0)>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
