Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 6) (8, 3) (8, 11) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 17) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 17) (5, 19) (5, 17) (13, 18) (13, 9) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 9) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 14) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 9) (17, 0) (17, 4) (17, 5) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 4) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 16) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (15, 16, 17)>
<1, (3, 14, 19)>
<2, (6, 11, 18)>
<7, (10, 12, 14)>
<9, (13, 14, 19)>
<10, (12, 16, 18)>
