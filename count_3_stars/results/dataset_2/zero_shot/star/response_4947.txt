Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 5) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 24) (15, 7) (15, 23) (15, 16) (27, 29) (27, 26) (27, 6) (3, 25) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 4) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 7) (23, 0) (7, 15) (7, 23) (7, 19) (21, 20) (21, 8) (0, 23) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 10) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 26) (26, 27) (26, 19) (26, 8) (26, 4) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 20) (16, 15) (16, 5) (16, 2) (28, 0) (2, 22) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 6) (9, 18) (9, 10) (18, 9) (18, 20) (18, 8) (1, 29) (29, 27) (29, 1) (29, 8) (20, 21) (20, 5) (20, 18) (20, 24) (12, 14) (12, 11) (8, 21) (8, 26) (8, 18) (8, 29) (8, 10) (10, 14) (10, 9) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 17) (17, 11) (17, 24) (24, 22) (24, 20) (24, 17) (4, 25) (4, 26) (6, 13) (6, 27) (6, 0) (6, 2)
