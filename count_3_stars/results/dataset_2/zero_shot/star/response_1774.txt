Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 5) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 28) (16, 1) (2, 29) (2, 1) (29, 11) (29, 2) (29, 9) (29, 15) (12, 22) (12, 26) (27, 18) (27, 10) (10, 27) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 13) (17, 10) (17, 6) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 8) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 24) (20, 0) (20, 23) (22, 12) (22, 26) (22, 21) (26, 12) (26, 22) (26, 21) (24, 11) (24, 0) (24, 23) (24, 25) (28, 16) (28, 0) (9, 29) (9, 15) (9, 3) (21, 10) (21, 22) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 14) (23, 11) (23, 20) (23, 24) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 7) (14, 21) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 15) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 13) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 18) (19, 4) (15, 29) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 25) (18, 27) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 11) (5, 18) (25, 24) (25, 21) (25, 15) (13, 10) (13, 1)
