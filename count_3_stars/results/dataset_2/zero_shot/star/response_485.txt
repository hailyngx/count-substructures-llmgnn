Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 15) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 13) (17, 1) (17, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 18) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 1) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 12) (7, 14) (16, 13) (16, 6) (16, 14) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 18) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 3) (19, 18) (19, 2) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 7) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 12) (6, 16) (12, 9) (12, 14) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (10, 5, 18)>
<1, (11, 17, 13)>
<2, (5, 4, 19)>
<3, (8, 18, 14)>
<4, (2, 11, 4)>
<5, (0, 8, 13)>
<7, (14, 16, 3)>
<9, (17, 8, 12)>
<10, (15, 11, 4)>
<12, (14, 9, 12)>
<13, (1, 5, 18)>
<16, (13, 16, 14)>
