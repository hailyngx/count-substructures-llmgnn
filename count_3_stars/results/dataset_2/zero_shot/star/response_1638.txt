Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 1) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 18) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 2) (10, 15) (10, 16) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 15) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 17) (3, 14) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 16) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (19, 17) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 18) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 0) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<5, (9, 6, 13)>, <9, (5, 7, 7)>, <4, (7, 12, 14)>, <7, (9, 4, 8)>, <6, (5, 4, 8)>, <13, (5, 1, 1)>, <1, (13, 11, 18)>, <15, (10, 18, 2)>, <10, (15, 16, 16)>, <12, (4, 2, 3)>, <2, (15, 12, 3)>, <11, (5, 1, 2)>, <3, (12, 2, 17)>, <17, (3, 16, 19)>, <14, (4, 3, 16)>, <16, (10, 17, 14)>, <8, (7, 6, 6)>, <19, (17, 0, 0)>, <0, (1, 17, 18)>, <18, (15, 1, 0)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
