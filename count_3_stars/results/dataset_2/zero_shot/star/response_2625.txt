Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-star graphs that can be found in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<5, (2, 8, 1)>
<9, (6, 2, 7)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<4, (5, 3, 0)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 9, 3)>
<0, (6, 2, 7)>
<7, (9, 6, 3)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 4, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
