Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 12) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 11) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 12) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 14) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (1, 7, 11)>
<7, (4, 10, 11)>
<1, (4, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 13)>
<10, (7, 11, 12)>
