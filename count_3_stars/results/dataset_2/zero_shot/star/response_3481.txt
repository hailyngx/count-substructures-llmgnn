Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 24) (11, 28) (11, 13) (11, 20) (28, 11) (28, 8) (28, 20) (8, 28) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 1) (19, 7) (19, 22) (19, 4) (19, 27) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 21) (4, 29) (16, 9) (16, 20) (21, 4) (21, 18) (21, 22) (21, 15) (5, 4) (5, 26) (5, 23) (5, 27) (26, 5) (26, 2) (1, 8) (1, 20) (1, 22) (6, 8) (10, 2) (10, 25) (10, 29) (22, 19) (22, 21) (22, 1) (22, 14) (3, 17) (3, 27) (3, 13) (17, 7) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 18) (23, 5) (23, 25) (15, 21) (14, 22) (14, 18) (20, 11) (20, 28) (20, 16) (20, 1) (2, 26) (2, 10) (2, 27) (18, 21) (18, 17) (18, 14) (24, 12) (24, 13) (24, 25) (27, 19) (27, 5) (27, 3) (27, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 24) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 29) (0, 9) (29, 4) (29, 10) (29, 0) (25, 10) (25, 23) (25, 24) (9, 16) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 12 total 3-stars in the given graph. Below are the unique 3-stars found:
<7, (12, 19, 17)>
<12, (7, 24, 13)>
<11, (28, 13, 20)>
<28, (11, 8, 20)>
<8, (28, 17, 6)>
<19, (7, 22, 4)>
<4, (19, 5, 21)>
<16, (9, 20, 16)>
<21, (4, 22, 18)>
<5, (4, 26, 23)>
<26, (5, 2, 27)>
<1, (8, 20, 22)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
