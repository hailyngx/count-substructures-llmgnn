Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 16) (18, 5) (18, 17) (18, 1) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 15) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 0) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 19) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 14) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 9) (12, 0) (11, 19) (14, 1) (14, 10) (3, 9) (16, 2) (16, 17) (16, 9) (17, 18) (17, 16) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 3) (9, 16) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 12) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (13, 7, 2)>
<8, (10, 0, 2)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (16, 19, 3)>
