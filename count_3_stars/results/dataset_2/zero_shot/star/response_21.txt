Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 27) (3, 5) (25, 3) (25, 5) (25, 15) (25, 28) (25, 14) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 8) (7, 24) (7, 19) (12, 15) (12, 23) (12, 9) (2, 9) (8, 1) (22, 0) (22, 29) (26, 15) (26, 27) (26, 4) (9, 12) (9, 2) (13, 21) (13, 6) (17, 23) (17, 4) (20, 23) (20, 10) (15, 25) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 26) (15, 11) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 27) (16, 24) (16, 10) (24, 7) (24, 16) (24, 28) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 5) (0, 22) (0, 21) (0, 28) (0, 4) (28, 25) (28, 24) (28, 0) (28, 18) (14, 25) (14, 29) (14, 5) (19, 7) (5, 3) (5, 25) (5, 21) (5, 14) (29, 22) (29, 14) (10, 20) (10, 16) (10, 27) (10, 4) (27, 3) (27, 26) (27, 6) (27, 10) (27, 11) (11, 15) (11, 27) (11, 18) (23, 12) (23, 17) (23, 20) (4, 26) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 10) (18, 28) (18, 11) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 17, 26)>
<5, (3, 14, 21)>
<6, (1, 3, 13)>
<10, (4, 16, 27)>
<14, (5, 25, 29)>
<15, (1, 12, 26)>
<24, (7, 16, 28)>
<25, (3, 14, 28)>
<27, (3, 10, 26)>

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in the graph.
