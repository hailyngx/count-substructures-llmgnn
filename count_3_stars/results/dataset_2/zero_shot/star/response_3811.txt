Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 29) (7, 1) (21, 3) (21, 10) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 27) (10, 21) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 2) (20, 5) (28, 29) (28, 22) (28, 14) (28, 24) (29, 7) (29, 28) (29, 16) (22, 28) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 6) (22, 24) (26, 22) (26, 2) (26, 3) (3, 21) (3, 13) (3, 26) (3, 12) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 27) (19, 12) (4, 22) (4, 12) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 4) (12, 25) (16, 29) (16, 2) (16, 6) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 18) (9, 14) (25, 12) (25, 6) (25, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 5) (2, 17) (2, 26) (2, 16) (2, 25) (24, 28) (24, 22) (24, 0) (24, 5) (0, 13) (0, 24) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 6) (14, 28) (14, 9) (27, 13) (27, 19) (5, 10) (5, 20) (5, 1) (5, 24) (6, 22) (6, 16) (6, 25) (6, 18) (6, 23) (23, 6)
