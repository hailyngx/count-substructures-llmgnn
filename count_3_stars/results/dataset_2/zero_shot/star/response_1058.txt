Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 11) (14, 7) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 10) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (9, 3, 10)>
<3, (7, 2, 11)>
<4, (1, 7, 13)>
<5, (1, 10, 13)>
<6, (0, 3, 13)>
<7, (4, 3, 14)>
<10, (0, 10, 13)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
