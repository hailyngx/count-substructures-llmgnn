Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 13) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 12) (5, 15) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 19) (3, 18) (3, 6) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 9) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 12) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 16) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 15) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 12) (14, 2) (14, 15) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 9) (11, 0) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 6) 

Response:
There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<4, (17, 18, 13)>
<7, (10, 18, 19)>
<13, (4, 6, 19)>
<15, (5, 14, 16)>
<16, (1, 8, 15)>
<18, (4, 7, 12)>
<0, (11, 7, 13)>
<1, (2, 9, 16)>
<8, (2, 10, 12)>
<6, (3, 10, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
