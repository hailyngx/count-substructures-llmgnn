Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 7) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 12) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, 12, and 14.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, 11, and 14.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 11.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 8, 10.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, 12, 14.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 13.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 10, 11, 14.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 11, 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 12, 14.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 9, 2.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 9, 10.
- Node 13 is connected to node 7.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 8, 10.

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- The possible 3-stars can have central nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 14.
- For each central node, we count the number of 3-stars it forms.

[<0, (2, 6, 14)>]
[<2, (0, 6, 14)>]
[<6, (0, 2, 14)>]
[<14, (0, 2, 6)>]

Count of 3-stars: [4]
