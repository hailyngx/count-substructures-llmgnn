Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in this graph.
  
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 8, 2)>
<1, (5, 4, 2)>
<4, (9, 1, 6)>
<6, (4, 8, 7)>
<8, (2, 6, 0)>
