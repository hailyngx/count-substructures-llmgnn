Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 6) (15, 2) (15, 11) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 16) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 13) (17, 10) (17, 7) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 9) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 16) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 12) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 5) (19, 10) (19, 7) (19, 13) (2, 15) (2, 16) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 18) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 19) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 9) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 1) (13, 6) (6, 3) (6, 13) (5, 16) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. Thus, the final answer is [4].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 12, 14)>
<2, (5, 15, 16)>
<3, (6, 7, 13)>
<4, (8, 9, 18)>
