Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

[6]

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (6, 8, 0)>
<7, (5, 9, 0)>
<1, (3, 2, 4)>
<4, (6, 2, 9)>
<8, (6, 1, 0)>
<0, (9, 2, 8)>
