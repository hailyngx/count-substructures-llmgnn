Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (17, 1) (17, 9) (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 17) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (0, 14) (0, 19) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 16) (18, 15) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 16) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 10) (7, 14) (1, 17) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 11) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 19) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 6) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 16) (8, 15) (8, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (6, 2, 13)>
<6, (3, 2, 6)>
<9, (17, 5, 10)>
<10, (9, 1, 13)>
<12, (15, 4, 11)>
<13, (3, 10, 5)>
<14, (0, 2, 7)>
<15, (8, 12, 18)>
<16, (3, 4, 16)>
<17, (1, 9, 17)>
<18, (15, 4, 19)>
<19, (0, 16, 18)>
<2, (3, 6, 14)>
