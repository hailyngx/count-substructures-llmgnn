Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 12) (15, 0) (15, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (2, 10) (2, 13) (18, 8) (18, 5) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 16) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 19) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 9) (16, 13) (16, 17) (16, 19) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 19) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 9) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 14) (19, 1) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (1, 19) (1, 12) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 18) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 1) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 12, 17)>
<10, (2, 6, 11)>
<11, (10, 13, 14)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 12, 18)>
<16, (13, 17, 19)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
