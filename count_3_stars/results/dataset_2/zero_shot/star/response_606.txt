Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 1) 

Response:
There are <6, (9, 10, 0)>, <9, (6, 8, 12)>, <10, (6, 7, 4)>, <11, (13, 8, 12)>, <7, (10, 12, 5)>, <12, (9, 11, 7)>, <0, (6, 8, 4)>, <14, (1, 2, 13)>, <5, (7, 12, 13)>, <13, (11, 12, 14)>, <8, (9, 11, 0)>, <4, (6, 10, 12)>, <3, (4, 2)>, and <1, (7, 8, 14)> 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
