Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 13) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 14) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 10) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 1) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
[<0, (5, 7, 10)>, <1, (8, 4, 11)>, <6, (9, 13, 14)>, <2, (4, 10, 12)>]
