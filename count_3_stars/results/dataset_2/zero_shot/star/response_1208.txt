Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 14) (14, 1) (14, 12) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5 [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (7, 9, 12)>
<9, (4, 6, 10)>
<1, (3, 7, 13)>
<10, (0, 1, 11)>
<12, (8, 11, 14)>
