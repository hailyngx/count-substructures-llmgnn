Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 22) (15, 25) (15, 24) (6, 9) (6, 26) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 20) (7, 21) (7, 25) (21, 7) (21, 26) (21, 11) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 29) (11, 21) (11, 10) (11, 5) (12, 10) (12, 27) (12, 18) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 17) (19, 8) (19, 20) (26, 6) (26, 21) (26, 5) (26, 2) (1, 17) (1, 28) (1, 24) (1, 4) (17, 27) (17, 1) (17, 0) (4, 27) (4, 1) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 0) (25, 15) (25, 7) (16, 29) (16, 23) (28, 1) (28, 8) (28, 14) (8, 19) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 24) (22, 3) (22, 4) (5, 11) (5, 26) (5, 2) (2, 26) (2, 5) (2, 20) (2, 14) (2, 0) (24, 15) (24, 1) (24, 8) (14, 28) (14, 8) (14, 2) (29, 10) (29, 16) (13, 4) (13, 23) (13, 0) (13, 18) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) (18, 12) (18, 13) (20, 9) (20, 19) (20, 2) (20, 23) (23, 16) (23, 13) (23, 20) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

<3, (9, 6, 20)>
<9, (6, 3, 20)>
<15, (25, 24, 0)>
<25, (15, 7, 0)>
<27, (12, 4, 17)>
<10, (11, 29, 16)>
<12, (10, 27, 18)>
<21, (7, 26, 11)>
<17, (27, 0, 1)>
<1, (17, 28, 24)>
<4, (27, 22, 13)>
<8, (28, 14, 24)>
