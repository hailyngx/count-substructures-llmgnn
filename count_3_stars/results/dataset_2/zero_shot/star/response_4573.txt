Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 9) (10, 0) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 1) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 1) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 15) (13, 2) (13, 15) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 7) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 15) (7, 5) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 5) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

<11, (1, 8, 19)>
<16, (2, 4, 11)>
<6, (2, 7, 18)>
<9, (10, 11, 9)>
<10, (0, 9, 11)>
<2, (13, 16, 6)>
<18, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 16, 19)>
