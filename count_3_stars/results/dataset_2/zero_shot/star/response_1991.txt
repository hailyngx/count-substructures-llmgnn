Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 11) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 10) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 9) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by determining the number of times a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

After analyzing the given edges, we find that the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 1, 7, and 11. These nodes are the centers of unique 3-stars as follows:
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<11, (2, 12, 14)>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
