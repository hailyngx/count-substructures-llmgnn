Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 16) (6, 14) (6, 13) (9, 16) (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 1) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 16) (10, 14) (11, 10) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 8) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 1) (8, 15) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 19) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 12) (17, 13) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 12) (12, 1) (12, 17) (0, 10) (0, 17) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 8) (19, 13) (19, 14) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 19) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the answer is [5].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<15, (3, 7, 10)>
<7, (4, 8, 15)>
<10, (14, 15, 16)>
<2, (3, 8, 18)>
<1, (5, 7, 17)>
