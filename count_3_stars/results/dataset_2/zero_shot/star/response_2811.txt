Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 24) (14, 15) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 9) (17, 19) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 23) (0, 9) (27, 25) (27, 5) (2, 18) (2, 23) (2, 24) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 29) (1, 12) (26, 8) (26, 4) (5, 27) (6, 7) (6, 22) (4, 18) (4, 26) (4, 8) (4, 25) (4, 29) (8, 26) (8, 4) (8, 24) (11, 28) (11, 22) (11, 25) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 13) (29, 0) (29, 18) (29, 4) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 20) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 9) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 22) (15, 13) (3, 10) (3, 21) (3, 12) (21, 3) (21, 24) (22, 6) (22, 11) (22, 15) (22, 20) (25, 27) (25, 4) (25, 11) (25, 19) (20, 16) (20, 22) (24, 14) (24, 0) (24, 2) (24, 8) (24, 21) (7, 6) (7, 28) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 10) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 23) (23, 0) (23, 2) (23, 12) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 25) (13, 28) (13, 10) (13, 15) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star can be any node with at least 3 edges incident to it. Let's identify the central nodes first: 

Central nodes: 14, 17, 0, 18, 4, 8, 11, 28, 29, 16, 10, 15, 3, 22, 25, 24, 9, 12, 23, 19, 13

Next, we find the 3-stars in the given graph by checking each central node and its adjacent nodes: 

- Central node: 14
  3-stars: <14, (17, 15, 16)>, <14, (17, 24, 15)>

- Central node: 17
  3-stars: <17, (14, 24, 19)>, <17, (14, 9, 0)>

- Central node: 0
  3-stars: <0, (24, 29, 23)>, <0, (24, 2, 23)>

- Central node: 18
  3-stars: <18, (4, 29, 2)>

- Central node: 4
  3-stars: <4, (26, 25, 8)>, <4, (26, 29, 8)>, <4, (26, 8, 24)>

- Central node: 8
  3-stars: <8, (26, 4, 24)>

- Central node: 11
  3-stars: <11, (28, 22, 25)>, <11, (28, 7, 13)>

- Central node: 28
  3-stars: <28, (11, 7, 13)>

- Central node: 29
  3-stars: <29, (0, 18, 4)>

- Central node: 16
  3-stars: <16, (14, 19, 20)>

- Central node: 10
  3-stars: <10, (15, 13, 9)>, <10, (15, 13, 22)>

- Central node: 15
  3-stars: <15, (14, 10, 22)>, <15, (14, 13, 10)>

- Central node: 3
  3-stars: <3, (10, 12, 21)>

- Central node: 22
  3-stars: <22, (20, 15, 6)>, <22, (20, 11, 15)>

- Central node: 25
  3-stars: <25, (19, 27, 11)>, <25, (19, 4, 27)>

- Central node: 24
  3-stars: <24, (14, 21, 8)>

- Central node: 9
  3-stars: <9, (17, 0, 10)>

- Central node: 12
  3-stars: <12, (1, 23, 3)>

- Central node: 23
  3-stars: <23, (0, 12, 2)>

- Central node: 19
  3-stars: <19, (17, 25, 16)>

- Central node: 13
  3-stars: <13, (28, 15, 10)>

Count of 3-stars: 19
Result: [19]
