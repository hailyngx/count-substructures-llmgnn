Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 19) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 16) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 15) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 2) (3, 0) (3, 16) (15, 17) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 19) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 4) (4, 8) (4, 13) (1, 17) (1, 12) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 16) (18, 6) (18, 19) (0, 5) (0, 17) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 12) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 0) (16, 6) (16, 3) (16, 19) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 19) (7, 6) (7, 10) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (0, 13, 17)>
<6, (7, 9, 18)>
<11, (2, 8, 14)>
<19, (8, 16, 18)>
