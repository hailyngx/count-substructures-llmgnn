Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 12) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 27) (21, 7) (21, 13) (21, 12) (21, 14) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 28) (25, 23) (25, 10) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 11) (23, 25) (23, 29) (23, 10) (2, 18) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 9) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 12) (12, 15) (12, 7) (12, 21) (12, 18) (28, 3) (28, 20) (28, 26) (26, 20) (26, 28) (26, 4) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 16) (13, 21) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 9) (17, 20) (17, 13) (17, 6) (22, 2) (22, 16) (0, 9) (10, 25) (10, 8) (10, 23) (6, 17) (6, 24) (6, 19) (24, 7) (24, 6) (24, 1) (14, 15) (14, 21) (14, 1) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 27) (19, 6) (19, 29) (29, 8) (29, 23) (29, 19) (1, 24) (1, 14) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 22) (16, 4) (27, 7) (27, 9) (11, 8) (4, 3) (4, 26) (4, 16) 

Response:
There are **10** 3-star structures in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (15, 28, 4)>
<7, (21, 12, 24)>
<20, (17, 26, 28)>
<25, (23, 10, 29)>
<2, (18, 5, 9)>
<12, (15, 7, 21)>
<5, (18, 13, 16)>
<13, (21, 5, 17)>
<6, (17, 24, 19)>
<1, (24, 14, 1)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars is **[10]**.
