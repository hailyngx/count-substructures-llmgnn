Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 13)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 11)>
<9, (8, 10, 13)>
<13, (1, 4, 5)>
