Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 0) (4, 15) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 13) (10, 9) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 12) (8, 9) (8, 14) (1, 17) (1, 0) (1, 18) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 15) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 12) (9, 10) (9, 8) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 1) (0, 19) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 15) (3, 5) (3, 6) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 13) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 1) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<11, (16, 10, 7)>
<4, (15, 17, 1)>
<5, (19, 2, 3)>
<6, (3, 15, 18)>
<9, (10, 8, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
