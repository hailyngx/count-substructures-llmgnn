Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 0) (15, 8) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 16) (19, 0) (19, 12) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 12) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 18) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 1) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 17) (9, 15) (9, 13) (12, 19) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 11) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (0, 2) (0, 19) (1, 7) (1, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 1) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

<2, (0, 10, 14)>
<6, (8, 12, 18)>
<7, (3, 10, 11)>
<8, (2, 6, 15)>
<10, (2, 7, 1)>
<12, (6, 11, 17)>
<13, (3, 9, 14)>
<15, (8, 9, 16)>
