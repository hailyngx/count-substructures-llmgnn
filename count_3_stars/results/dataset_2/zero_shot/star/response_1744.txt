This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) 

Response:
