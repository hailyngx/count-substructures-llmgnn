Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 13) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 8) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 16) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 5) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 5) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 17) (2, 10) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 1) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 18) (18, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 10) (5, 1) (12, 19) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph can be found by identifying each central node and its corresponding three leaves. To simplify the counting process, we can start by listing all unique 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (15, 9, 5)>
<6, (9, 10, 0)>
<13, (9, 17, 8)>
<4, (8, 0, 16)>
<10, (6, 0, 2)>
<19, (14, 0, 11)>
<17, (9, 13, 16)>
<2, (17, 10, 16)>
<16, (17, 4, 1)>
<7, (15, 8, 19)>
<5, (3, 14, 10)>
<0, (8, 4, 10)>
<1, (11, 5, 16)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars, which is [13].
