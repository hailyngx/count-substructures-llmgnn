Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 9) (1, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 14) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found using the formula:  

\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{v \in V} d(v) (d(v)-1) - \text{Number of triangles} \]

where \( d(v) \) is the degree of node \( v \) and the sum is over all nodes \( v \) in the graph.  
Given that the graph has 15 nodes, we will first calculate the degree of each node and then count the number of triangles.  

### Degree of Each Node:  
- Node 0: 4  
- Node 1: 2  
- Node 2: 6  
- Node 3: 3  
- Node 4: 6  
- Node 5: 5  
- Node 6: 3  
- Node 7: 3  
- Node 8: 5  
- Node 9: 4  
- Node 10: 3  
- Node 11: 4  
- Node 12: 3  
- Node 13: 3  
- Node 14: 4  

### Counting Triangles:  
From the given edges, we can find the triangles with the following combinations:  
- (2, 8, 4)  
- (5, 11, 8)  

### Calculating Number of 3-Stars:  
Using the formula above, with the given values of degree and number of triangles, we get:  
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( 4 \times 3 + 2 \times 1 + 6 \times 5 + 3 \times 2 + 6 \times 5 + 5 \times 4 + 3 \times 2 + 3 \times 2 + 5 \times 4 + 4 \times 3 + 3 \times 2 + 4 \times 3 + 3 \times 2 + 3 \times 2 + 4 \times 3 \right) - 2 = 92 - 2 = 90 \]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [90].  

### Unique 3-Stars Found:  
<0, (5, 8, 11)>  
<2, (4, 8, 11)>
