Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 4) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 13) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 10) (1, 9) (1, 13) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (6, 8, 11)>
<6, (5, 7, 10)>
<7, (6, 12, 14)>
