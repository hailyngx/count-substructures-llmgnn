Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are 8 total 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 4, 0)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<7, (4, 6, 2)>
<6, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (5, 7, 1)>
<8, (5, 0, 1)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
