Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 4) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 13) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 5) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given input are:

1. <6, (9, 10, 12)>
2. <9, (6, 8, 14)>
3. <10, (6, 8, 1)>
4. <11, (14, 1, 5)>
5. <7, (9, 12, 2)>
6. <12, (6, 7, 4)>
7. <0, (9, 12, 2)>
8. <2, (7, 0, 13)>
9. <8, (9, 10, 12)>
10. <4, (11, 12, 0)>
11. <1, (10, 11, 13)>
12. <14, (9, 11, 5)>
13. <5, (11, 0, 4)>
14. <3, (2, 4, 13)>

There are 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus the answer is [14].
