Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the 3-stars with their respective central node and leaf nodes:

[<0, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (7, 9, 3)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>]
