Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (0, 7) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 4) (8, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 1)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (13, 6, 14)>
<3, (7, 9, 12)>
<4, (1, 9, 11)>
<5, (0, 7, 10)>
<6, (1, 10, 11)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<13, (2, 10, 14)>
