Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 1) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 13) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 14) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 1) 

Response:
There are 14 unique 3-stars in this graph.
[<5, (9, 2, 8)>, <4, (7, 12, 13)>, <7, (4, 6, 14)>, <2, (5, 8, 6)>, <8, (5, 2, 0)>, <3, (2, 10, 12)>, <11, (4, 0, 12)>, <13, (5, 4, 12)>, <12, (4, 3, 13)>, <0, (9, 8, 10)>, <10, (8, 3, 0)>, <6, (7, 2, 14)>, <1, (4, 8, 10)>, <14, (7, 2, 1)>]
