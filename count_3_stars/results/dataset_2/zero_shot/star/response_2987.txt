Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as follows:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 4, 1)>
<1, (9, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (9, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 1, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 0)>
Therefore, there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
