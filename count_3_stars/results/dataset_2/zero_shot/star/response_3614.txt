Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

[<5, (9, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 4, 3)>, <1, (9, 6, 0)>, <3, (5, 9, 2)>]
