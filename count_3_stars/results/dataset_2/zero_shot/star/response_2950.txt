Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 18) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 6) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 16) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 3) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 3) (2, 6) (2, 15) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 18) (3, 9) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 10) (8, 5) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 9) (16, 10) (16, 5) (16, 1) (4, 17) (4, 11) (4, 1) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 1) (15, 5) (15, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of degree-3 nodes in the graph. Each degree-3 node can be the center of a 3-star.

The nodes with degree-3 are 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, and 18. Hence, there are 13 unique 3-stars in the graph based on the given edges.

So, the answer is: [13]
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (11, 6, 19)>, <1, (4, 12, 16)>, <2, (6, 15, 5)>, <3, (9, 17, 18)>, <4, (1, 11, 17)>, <5, (8, 15, 16)>, <6, (0, 14, 2)>, <7, (11, 12, 18)>, <9, (3, 1, 17)>, <10, (12, 16, 8)>, <11, (0, 4, 7)>, <15, (2, 5, 8)>, <16, (1, 10, 5)>
