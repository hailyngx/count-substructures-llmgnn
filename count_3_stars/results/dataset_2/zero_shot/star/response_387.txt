Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 10) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 10) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

<5, (9, 1, 7)>
<9, (5, 4, 13)>
<1, (5, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 0, 13)>
<13, (9, 1, 8)>
<4, (9, 12, 10)>
<6, (5, 4, 12)>
<12, (4, 2, 14)>
<2, (13, 12, 11)>
<11, (12, 2, 14)>
<14, (12, 11, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<10, (3, 4, 14)>
<7, (5, 1, 14)>

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
