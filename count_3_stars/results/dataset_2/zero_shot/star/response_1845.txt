Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 8) (14, 17) (14, 2) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 4) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 2) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 17) (12, 7) (12, 5) (8, 3) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 0) (0, 6) (0, 19) (0, 15) (0, 18) (16, 17) (16, 7) (16, 19) (15, 0) (15, 13) (18, 0) (18, 5) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 4) (11, 2) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 15) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 5) (2, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (14, 12, 18)>
<7, (1, 12, 16)>
<10, (17, 2, 11)>
<13, (9, 19, 15)>
