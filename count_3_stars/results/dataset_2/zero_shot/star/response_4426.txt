Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 5) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph: <6, (1, 2, 11)>, <9, (1, 13, 14)>, <10, (0, 11, 8)>, and <12, (1, 8, 14)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
