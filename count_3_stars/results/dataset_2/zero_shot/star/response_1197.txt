Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 11) (1, 5) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 8) (21, 17) (15, 5) (15, 4) (27, 10) (27, 17) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 19) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 23) (8, 21) (8, 16) (8, 22) (13, 3) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 24) (2, 16) (2, 20) (18, 19) (18, 20) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 23) (14, 4) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 28) (26, 13) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 16) (26, 12) (7, 28) (17, 21) (17, 27) (17, 13) (17, 20) (20, 2) (20, 18) (20, 17) (20, 10) (29, 5) (29, 11) (10, 21) (10, 27) (10, 3) (10, 20) (10, 6) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 9) (12, 26) (12, 24) (23, 25) (23, 14) (23, 26) (22, 8) (11, 1) (11, 29) (11, 24) (24, 13) (24, 12) (24, 11) (24, 5) (9, 25) (9, 4) (28, 19) (28, 7) (6, 0) (6, 10) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 29) (5, 24) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 26)
