Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
