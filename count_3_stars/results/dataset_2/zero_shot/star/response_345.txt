Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (4, 0, 3)>
<9, (6, 2, 3)>
<6, (9, 4, 2)>
<4, (5, 6, 3)>
<8, (4, 2, 1)>
<2, (9, 6, 1)>
