Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 18) (12, 4) (12, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 5) (17, 1) (17, 0) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 14) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 11) (13, 7) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (18, 8) (18, 10) (18, 6) (0, 17) (0, 3) (0, 11) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 3) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 10) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 9) (11, 19) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 0) (16, 8) (16, 1) (6, 12) (6, 18) (14, 19) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.

<7, (4, 15, 13)>
<8, (16, 15, 18)>
<12, (4, 6, 18)>
<1, (17, 15, 16)>
<17, (1, 0, 5)>
<5, (1, 19, 2)>
<19, (5, 11, 2)>
<15, (7, 8, 1)>
<13, (7, 15, 11)>
<18, (8, 10, 6)>
<0, (17, 3, 11)>
