Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 4, 9)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<8, (4, 2, 3)>
<3, (9, 4, 7)>
