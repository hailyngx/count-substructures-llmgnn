Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) 

Response:
