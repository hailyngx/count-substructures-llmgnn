Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-star configurations in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 1, 6)>
<9, (4, 3, 8)>
<8, (4, 1, 6)>
