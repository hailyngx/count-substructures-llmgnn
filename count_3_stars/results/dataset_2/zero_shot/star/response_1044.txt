Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 8) (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 10) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 0) (5, 14) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 19) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 19) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 19) (12, 17) (19, 1) (19, 0) (19, 13) (10, 7) (10, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph, leading to a total count of [5].

<3, (2, 6, 15)>
<7, (0, 9, 14)>
<14, (5, 7, 9)>
<15, (3, 4, 18)>
<17, (1, 12, 14)>
