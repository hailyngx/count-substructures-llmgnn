Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 13) (5, 11) (5, 7) (13, 14) (13, 16) (13, 3) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 18) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 19) (11, 17) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 1) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 19) (1, 12) (4, 6) (4, 15) (4, 17) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 10) (7, 17) (15, 4) (15, 7) (12, 1) (12, 6) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 18) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 16) (16, 13) (16, 10) (18, 14) (18, 3) (18, 6) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 7)
