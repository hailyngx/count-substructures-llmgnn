Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are four 3-stars in the given graph. Below are the unique 3-stars found:

<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<6, (9, 4, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 1)>
<2, (7, 8, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
