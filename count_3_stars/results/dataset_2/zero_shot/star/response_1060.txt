Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 5) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 0) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 1) (18, 13) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 9) (5, 17) (5, 14) (19, 18) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 16) (16, 17) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 15) (14, 5) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 2) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 3) (2, 15) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 1) (15, 16) (15, 2) (15, 13) (13, 18) (13, 1) (13, 15) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<10, (11, 9, 17)>
<17, (16, 6, 5)>
<18, (19, 7, 1)>
