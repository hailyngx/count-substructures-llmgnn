Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 0) (15, 23) (15, 21) (27, 22) (27, 28) (27, 26) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 9) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 1) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 29) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 6) (20, 0) (20, 3) (1, 17) (1, 26) (1, 25) (1, 5) (26, 27) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 21) (26, 16) (5, 1) (5, 26) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 11) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 29) (28, 27) (28, 24) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 25) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 23) (21, 15) (21, 26) (21, 9) (21, 22) (3, 20) (3, 22) (14, 8) (16, 4) (16, 26) (16, 8) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 24) (24, 28) (24, 8) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 25) (25, 1) (25, 12) (25, 19) (25, 23) (23, 15) (23, 13) (23, 25) (22, 27) (22, 21) (22, 3) (29, 18) (29, 11) (29, 19) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 21) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-star structures in the given graph. Here they are:
<0, (15, 20, 6)>
<26, (27, 1, 5)>
<2, (10, 18, 12)>
<4, (7, 13, 16)>
<8, (10, 14, 16)>
<9, (7, 11, 13)>
Therefore, the final count of 3-star structures in the graph is [6].
