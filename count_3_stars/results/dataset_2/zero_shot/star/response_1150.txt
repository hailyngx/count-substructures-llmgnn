Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 13) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 12) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (9, 0) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 13) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 9) (13, 12) 

Response:
There are [15] total nodes.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 9, 13)>
<1, (0, 11, 2)>
<2, (4, 5, 11)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 8, 10)>
<5, (2, 3, 14)>
<6, (3, 5, 13)>
<7, (13, 8, 6)>
<8, (4, 12, 13)>
<9, (0, 7, 13)>
<10, (4, 3, 6)>
<11, (1, 5, 12)>
<12, (8, 11, 13)>
<13, (7, 9, 12)>
<14, (3, 5, 12)>

There are [15] 3-stars in total.
