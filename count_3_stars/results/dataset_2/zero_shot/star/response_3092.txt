Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (14, 8) (14, 6) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (1, 11) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 12) 

Response:
The given graph has 5 unique 3-stars. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
<1, (11, 9, 12)>
<2, (7, 8, 0)>
<3, (7, 6, 13)>
<4, (7, 5, 8)>
<6, (7, 6, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
