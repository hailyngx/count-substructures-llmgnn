Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 3) (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 17) (18, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 15) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 4) (8, 19) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 1) (3, 16) (3, 18) (3, 17) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 10) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 14) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 13) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 1) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 15) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 3) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 19) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars found: 
<6, (18, 0, 13)>
<12, (2, 15, 14)>
<14, (7, 12, 15)>
