Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 26) (27, 0) (27, 14) (27, 1) (27, 6) (27, 8) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 15) (17, 7) (29, 19) (29, 5) (29, 14) (29, 24) (11, 21) (11, 20) (28, 16) (28, 5) (1, 27) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 22) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 23) (8, 27) (8, 24) (8, 25) (8, 12) (9, 20) (9, 12) (16, 28) (16, 22) (16, 18) (16, 23) (22, 1) (22, 16) (22, 10) (18, 16) (18, 7) (19, 29) (19, 20) (5, 29) (5, 28) (5, 26) (5, 21) (5, 3) (26, 0) (26, 5) (21, 11) (21, 5) (10, 0) (10, 22) (10, 13) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 3) (6, 27) (6, 17) (24, 29) (24, 8) (24, 13) (23, 15) (23, 16) (23, 25) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 24) (13, 12) (14, 27) (14, 29) (14, 20) (14, 25) (4, 1) (25, 8) (25, 23) (25, 14) (20, 11) (20, 9) (20, 19) (20, 14)
