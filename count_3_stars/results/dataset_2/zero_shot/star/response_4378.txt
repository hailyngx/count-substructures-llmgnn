Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (8, 5) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 10) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
Unique 3-stars found: 
<5, (4, 8, 3)>
<9, (1, 11, 0)>
<10, (6, 12, 3)>
