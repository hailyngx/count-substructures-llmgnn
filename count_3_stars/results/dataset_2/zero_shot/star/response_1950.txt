Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 5 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:

<5, (2, 0, 3)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 2)>
<6, (7, 3, 2)>
<6, (8, 2, 0)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
