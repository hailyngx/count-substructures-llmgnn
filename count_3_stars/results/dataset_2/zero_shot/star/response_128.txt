Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-star graphs in the given graph can be found by counting the occurrences of the central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

There are a total of 16 3-stars in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 8, 4)>
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, 0)>
<3, (5, 6, 1)>
<4, (5, 6, 1)>
<4, (6, 2, 1)>
<8, (5, 9, 3)>
<8, (5, 3, 2)>
<2, (6, 1, 4)>
<2, (6, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 4)>
<0, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 2, 0)>
<6, (3, 2, 4)>
<6, (5, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
