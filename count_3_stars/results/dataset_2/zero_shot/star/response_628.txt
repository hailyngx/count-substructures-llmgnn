Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 1, 3)>
<4, (7, 6, 0)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
