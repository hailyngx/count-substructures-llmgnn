Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 9) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 14) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (13, 9, 5)>
<4, (9, 13, 14)>
