Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 17) (5, 17) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 16) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (12, 3) (12, 7) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 17) (18, 16) (18, 1) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 13) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 16) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 6) (17, 15) (17, 5) (17, 8) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
