Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs can be calculated by examining all possible combinations of a central node connected to three other nodes. 

In this specific graph, there are 16 unique 3-stars <0, (3, 5, 1)>, <1, (4, 7, 2)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (3, 9, 5)>, <7, (4, 1, 5)>, <8, (5, 7, 4)>, <9, (3, 6, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (5, 4, 0)>, <3, (1, 0, 6)>, <6, (9, 3, 5)>, <7, (8, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [16].
