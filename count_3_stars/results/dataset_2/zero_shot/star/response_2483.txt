Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 9) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated as follows:

1. Identify nodes with degree 3, as they can be central nodes of 3-stars.
2. For each node with degree 3, count the number of edges between its neighbors to determine how many 3-stars it forms.

From the given graph, nodes with degree 3 are: 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, 13, 10, 11, and 12.
Now, let's count the 3-stars:

- Node 4: Forms 3-stars with (7, 2, 6), (6, 0, 8), (2, 5, 8), and (2, 5, 6). <4, (7, 2, 6)>, <4, (6, 0, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 7: Forms 3-stars with (4, 10, 1), (10, 13, 1), and (10, 3, 11). <7, (4, 10, 1)>, <7, (10, 13, 1)>, <7, (10, 3, 11)>
- Node 1: Forms 3-stars with (7, 10, 0) and (7, 10, 3). <1, (7, 10, 0)>, <1, (7, 10, 3)>
- Node 3: No 3-stars due to no set of 3 nodes connected to node 3.
- Node 8: Forms 3-stars with (4, 6, 0) and (4, 6, 2). <8, (4, 6, 0)>, <8, (4, 6, 2)>
- Node 13: Forms a 3-star with (7, 0, 12). <13, (7, 0, 12)>
- Node 10: Forms a 3-star with (7, 1, 0). <10, (7, 1, 0)>
- Node 11: Forms a 3-star with (3, 12, 14). <11, (3, 12, 14)>
- Node 12: Forms a 3-star with (1, 3, 11). <12, (1, 3, 11)>

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 9
Therefore, the answer is [9].
