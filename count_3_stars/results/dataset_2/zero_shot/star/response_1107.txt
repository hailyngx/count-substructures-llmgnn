Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are [7] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (1, 2, 0)>
<5, (9, 3, 1)>
<9, (8, 7, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 2)>
<4, (0, 8, 2)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 4, 2)>
