Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 1) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 16) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 19) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 0) (15, 10) (0, 9) (0, 16) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 0) (18, 9) (18, 17) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 18) (17, 19) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 12) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 19) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 19) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
<1, (7, 10, 11)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (8, 11, 13)>
<4, (16, 17, 0)>
<5, (1, 14, 12)>
<6, (8, 14, 6)>
<7, (1, 10, 11)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
