Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (5, 13) (5, 2) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 0) (13, 18) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 8) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 9) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 16) (17, 0) (17, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (16, 0) (16, 15) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 3) (2, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (6, 17) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (18, 13) (18, 10) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 6) (19, 13) (19, 2) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 0) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 14) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in this graph. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (7, 13, 17)>
<2, (5, 12, 19)>
<8, (0, 11, 15)>
