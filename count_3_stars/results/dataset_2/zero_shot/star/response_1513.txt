Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 13) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 13) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 11)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 14)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
