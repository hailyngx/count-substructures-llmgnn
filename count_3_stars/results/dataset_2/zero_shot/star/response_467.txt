Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are [10] nodes and [40] edges in the graph.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<5, (9, 1, 7)>
<9, (5, 1, 7)>
<4, (7, 2, 0)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (4, 6, 3)>
<8, (5, 7, 3)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<6, (2, 1, 3)>
<0, (4, 2, 6)>
<3, (4, 8, 6)>

There are [10] 3-stars in total.
