Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 0, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 9, 0)>
<3, (4, 0, 2)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 1, 3)>
