Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 5) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 10) (17, 3) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 18) (2, 11) (2, 7) (18, 10) (18, 12) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 7) (5, 16) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 15) (19, 14) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 15) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 19) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 13) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 13) (3, 17) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) 

Response:
After analyzing the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<11, (16, 0, 6)>
<16, (11, 15, 5)>
<14, (19, 5, 0)>
<17, (10, 3, 10)>
<10, (17, 12, 18)>
<2, (11, 7, 7)>
<18, (10, 12, 12)>
<7, (2, 12, 19)>
<12, (11, 10, 18)>
<5, (16, 14, 19)>
<19, (14, 7, 15)>
<15, (16, 5, 19)>
<1, (5, 6, 4)>
<6, (11, 1, 13)>
<9, (1, 3, 13)>
<3, (17, 9, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 0)>
<0, (11, 4, 13)>
<13, (6, 9, 0)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
