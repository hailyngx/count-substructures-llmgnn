Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
