Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 16) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 8) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 3) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 18) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 10) (19, 5) (19, 12) (16, 15) (16, 5) (16, 12) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 13) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 13) (11, 0) (11, 13) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 9) (9, 10) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 4) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (18, 15) (18, 8) 

Response:
There are 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (7, 11, 3)>
<1, (4, 9, 6)>
<2, (6, 8, 1)>
<3, (15, 7, 4)>
<4, (9, 1, 6)>
<5, (7, 16, 19)>
<6, (13, 1, 4)>
<7, (15, 3, 0)>
<8, (18, 17, 2)>
<9, (4, 1, 9)>
<10, (19, 9, 10)>
<11, (13, 6, 0)>
<12, (13, 16, 17)>
<13, (12, 11, 6)>
<15, (3, 16, 18)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
