Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 10 nodes and 40 edges. To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

In this graph, the 3-star structures are as follows:
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 0)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
