Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 12) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 12) (0, 10) (0, 9) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 9) (12, 14) (1, 4) (1, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

<4, (1, 6, 11)>
<5, (8, 12, 14)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 12)>
<10, (0, 1, 13)>
<12, (5, 9, 14)>
<13, (8, 10, 12)>
