Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in this graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (6, 1, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (8, 3, 9)>
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
