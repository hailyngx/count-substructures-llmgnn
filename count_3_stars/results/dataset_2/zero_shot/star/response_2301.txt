Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 12) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 2) (14, 12) (14, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (6, 9, 7)>
<7, (10, 11, 4)>
<3, (8, 10, 14)>
