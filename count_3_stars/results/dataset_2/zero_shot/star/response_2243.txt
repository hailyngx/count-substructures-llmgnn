Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (13, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 14) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 4) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<9, (6, 8, 14)>
<10, (11, 8, 1)>
<11, (6, 10, 7)>
<7, (6, 11, 3)>
<12, (11, 3, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
