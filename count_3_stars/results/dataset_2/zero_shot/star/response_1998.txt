Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 14) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 11) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 1) (4, 5) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (11, 2) (11, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (9, 3, 13)>
<9, (6, 8, 10)>
<7, (12, 2, 5)>
<12, (7, 2, 14)>
<2, (7, 1, 11)>
<8, (9, 5, 14)>
<0, (9, 3, 13)>
<3, (6, 9, 0)>
<5, (7, 8, 11)>
<14, (12, 8, 1)>
