Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 5) (17, 7) (4, 3) (4, 19) (8, 12) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 16) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 14) (18, 2) (5, 1) (5, 17) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 15) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 2) (15, 9) (15, 19) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 2) (16, 14) (16, 2)
