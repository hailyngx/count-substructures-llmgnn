Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 11) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 8, 12)>
<5, (6, 11, 13)>
<6, (5, 10, 4)>
<13, (4, 9, 14)>
