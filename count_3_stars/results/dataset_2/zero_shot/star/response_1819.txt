Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 6) (14, 0) (14, 19) (17, 11) (17, 18) (17, 7) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 3) (13, 8) (2, 16) (2, 4) (2, 19) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 19) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 15) (12, 15) (12, 9) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 19) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 6) (5, 3) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 7) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 9) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (14, 10, 19)>
<3, (1, 13, 8)>
<6, (16, 1, 18)>
<7, (17, 10, 9)>
<19, (14, 2, 6)>
