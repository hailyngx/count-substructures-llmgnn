Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 4) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 2) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<6, (9, 5, 8)>
<9, (6, 2, 10)>
<10, (9, 11, 8)>
<11, (10, 3, 14)>
<8, (6, 10, 0)>
<13, (10, 5, 12)>
<5, (6, 13, 2)>
<7, (9, 3, 14)>
<12, (13, 5, 2)>
<3, (11, 7, 0)>
<2, (9, 13, 5)>
<14, (10, 11, 7)>
<0, (10, 8, 12)>
<1, (11, 7, 0)>
<4, (5, 2, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the graph.
