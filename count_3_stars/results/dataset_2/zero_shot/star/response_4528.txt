Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 13) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 17) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 18) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 3) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 12) (0, 16) (0, 13) (16, 0) (16, 10) (16, 15) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 13) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 18) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 1) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 5) (17, 3) (3, 5) (3, 17) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 7) (15, 9) (15, 8) (15, 16) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 14) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 18) (7, 9) (7, 1) 

Response:
There are 8 3-stars in the given graph. 
These 3-stars are: 
<2, (8, 18, 12)>
<6, (17, 13, 0)>
<9, (1, 7, 15)>
<0, (16, 13, 6)>
<8, (15, 18, 10)>
<5, (17, 3, 11)>
<19, (18, 12, 14)>
<10, (16, 14, 18)>
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
