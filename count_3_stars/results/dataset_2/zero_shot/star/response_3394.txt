Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 2)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 9, 8)>
<4, (1, 9, 5)>
<5, (1, 0, 4)>
<6, (3, 9, 8)>
<9, (3, 6, 1)>
