Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 4) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 15) (1, 11) (1, 12) (15, 11) (15, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 7) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 7) (18, 14) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 13) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 5) (2, 9) (2, 16) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 4) (13, 15) (13, 12) (13, 18) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 2) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<14, (17, 0, 8)>
<11, (7, 1, 19)>
<3, (0, 8, 19)>
<4, (17, 12, 6)>
<12, (1, 4, 13)>
<9, (18, 16, 7)>
