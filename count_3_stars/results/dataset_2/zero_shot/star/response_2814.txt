Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 6, 4)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 1, 3)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (9, 7, 2)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<(6, 4, 8), 0>
<(5, 3, 9), 1>
<(9, 2, 7), 5>
<(4, 8, 6), 2>
<(1, 7, 0), 8>
<(3, 5, 4), 9>
