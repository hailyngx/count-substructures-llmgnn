Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 10) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 19) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 18) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 13) (17, 19) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 2) (4, 11) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 2) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 0) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 9) (13, 10) (13, 7) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 2) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 2) (8, 7) (9, 15) 

Response:
There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<11, (16, 5, 4)>
<16, (1, 10, 15)>
<1, (16, 5, 19)>
<3, (10, 6, 18)>
<10, (16, 3, 13)>
<5, (11, 16, 1)>
<6, (3, 5, 15)>
<18, (3, 19, 14)>
<14, (7, 2, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
