Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 6) (11, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (14, 4) (14, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 2) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by first determining the possible combinations of 3 leaves (nodes connected to the center node). Since each center node must be connected to exactly 3 leaves, the 3-stars in the given graph can be determined based on the combinations of nodes that are connected to each center node.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: (1, 4, 10), (2, 5, 9)
Node 1: (0, 4, 10), (2, 12, 14)
Node 2: (0, 1, 10), (3, 6, 14)
Node 3: (2, 6, 10), (8, 13, 12)
Node 4: (0, 1, 14)
Node 5: (2, 9, 11)
Node 6: (2, 3, 11), (5, 9, 13)
Node 7: (8, 12, 13)
Node 8: (3, 12, 13)
Node 9: (0, 5, 10), (6, 11, 13)
Node 10: (0, 1, 2), (3, 9, 10)
Node 11: (5, 6, 14), (9, 10, 12)
Node 12: (1, 8, 13), (3, 7, 11)
Node 13: (3, 7, 12), (6, 9, 11)
Node 14: (1, 4, 11)

Therefore, there are a total of 28 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [28].
