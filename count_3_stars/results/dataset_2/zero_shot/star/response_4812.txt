Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. The final answer is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<6, (5, 9, 1)>
<4, (6, 8, 0)>
<8, (4, 2, 3)>
