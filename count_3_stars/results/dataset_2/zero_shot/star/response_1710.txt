Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 14) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (3, 10, 12)>
<7, (1, 5, 3)>
<10, (4, 5, 8)>
<11, (2, 6, 14)>
<8, (9, 10, 13)>
<12, (0, 1, 4)>
