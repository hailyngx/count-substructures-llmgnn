Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 1) (3, 28) (3, 29) (3, 19) (15, 4) (28, 3) (28, 29) (28, 0) (29, 3) (29, 28) (29, 17) (17, 9) (17, 29) (24, 26) (24, 16) (24, 4) (24, 22) (26, 24) (26, 10) (26, 0) (6, 21) (6, 13) (21, 6) (21, 13) (21, 23) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 27) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 8) (25, 7) (25, 13) (25, 0) (25, 18) (25, 2) (4, 15) (4, 24) (4, 12) (4, 16) (12, 4) (12, 20) (12, 11) (22, 24) (22, 8) (10, 26) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 19) (11, 8) (16, 24) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 23) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 20) (13, 6) (13, 21) (13, 25) (13, 0) (0, 28) (0, 26) (0, 25) (0, 13) (0, 23) (20, 12) (20, 19) (27, 1) (18, 5) (18, 25) (2, 7) (2, 25) (2, 16) (2, 23) (23, 21) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 2) (14, 7) (14, 19) (8, 7) (8, 22) (8, 11) 

Response:
There are 12 unique 3-stars in this graph.

The 3-stars are:
<0, (28, 26, 25)>
<1, (9, 17, 11)>
<2, (7, 25, 16)>
<3, (28, 29, 19)>
<4, (15, 24, 12)>
<6, (21, 13, 25)>
<7, (2, 25, 8)>
<9, (5, 17, 1)>
<11, (1, 12, 19)>
<13, (6, 21, 25)>
<16, (4, 24, 23)>
<18, (5, 25, 18)>

Therefore, there are a total of [12] unique 3-stars in the graph.
