Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 10) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 14) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 7) (9, 10) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 14)>
<2, (3, 8, 14)>
<5, (11, 8, 14)>
<6, (1, 10, 14)>
<7, (4, 9, 10)>
<13, (1, 11, 12)>
