Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 6) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 12) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 6) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 8) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 3) 

Response:
There are [10] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (10, 13, 0)>
<3, (9, 13, 3)>
<6, (11, 4, 6)>
<7, (5, 10, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (5, 2, 9)>
<11, (1, 6, 11)>
<12, (3, 4, 12)>
<13 , (7, 8, 13)>
<14, (0, 2, 14)>
