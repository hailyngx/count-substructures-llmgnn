Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 19) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 17) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (5, 19) (5, 14) (19, 9) (19, 5) (19, 3) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 18) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 2) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 15) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (3, 19) (3, 0) (3, 18) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 0) (16, 17) (16, 10) (1, 4) (1, 2) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 1) (15, 9) (15, 4) (14, 7) (14, 5) (18, 13) (18, 3) (10, 7) (10, 16) (10, 8) (8, 6) (8, 10) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. The final answer is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 11, 12)>
<9, (6, 15, 19)>
<7, (12, 10, 14)>
<12, (6, 7, 4)>
<17, (13, 16, 2)>
