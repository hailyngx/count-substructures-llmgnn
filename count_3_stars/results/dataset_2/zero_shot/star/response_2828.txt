Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 6) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 5) (10, 2) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 12) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<4, (7, 12, 1)>
<7, (4, 10, 14)>
<1, (4, 3, 2)>
<3, (1, 11, 14)>
<8, (9, 5, 0)>
<13, (7, 12, 6)>
<0, (8, 10, 11)>
<14, (7, 3, 11)>
<5, (3, 8, 10)>
<11, (3, 0, 14)>
<9, (8, 0, 14)>
<12, (4, 8, 13)>
<2, (1, 9, 10)>
<10, (7, 0, 5)>
<6, (4, 3, 13)>

There are 15 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final answer is [15].
