Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 27) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 18) (6, 24) (9, 14) (9, 13) (2, 5) (2, 26) (2, 1) (2, 28) (29, 17) (29, 11) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 21) (0, 5) (20, 0) (4, 27) (4, 22) (4, 26) (18, 15) (17, 29) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 21) (22, 4) (22, 26) (22, 1) (26, 2) (26, 4) (26, 22) (26, 13) (26, 11) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 26) (13, 10) (13, 27) (27, 3) (27, 4) (27, 13) (28, 2) (28, 10) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 17) (21, 19) (21, 25) (11, 29) (11, 26) (11, 23) (11, 1) (23, 17) (23, 11) (23, 7) (23, 12) (8, 19) (8, 12) (19, 17) (19, 21) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 1) (7, 23) (7, 19) (7, 25) (7, 14) (25, 21) (25, 7) (24, 6) (24, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 17) (1, 2) (1, 22) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 24) (14, 9) (14, 7) (10, 13) (10, 28) (12, 23) (12, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (15, 18, 20)>
<1, (2, 22, 26)>
<3, (13, 15, 21)>
<19, (1, 7, 17)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
