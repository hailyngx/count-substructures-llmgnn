Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 2) (9, 14) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (12, 4) (12, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 2) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (8, 3, 10)>
<4, (5, 1, 11)>
