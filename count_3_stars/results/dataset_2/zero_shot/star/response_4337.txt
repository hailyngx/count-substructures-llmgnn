Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9)
