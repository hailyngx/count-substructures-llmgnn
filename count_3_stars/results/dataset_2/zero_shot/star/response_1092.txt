Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <1, (5, 8, 0)>, <2, (9, 7, 0)>, <3, (9, 4, 1)>, <4, (9, 7, 3)>, <5, (8, 1, 0)>, <7, (4, 8, 0)>, <8, (5, 4, 7)>, <9, (4, 2, 1)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
