Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) 

Response:
There are <6, (9, 0, 5)>, <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <1, (9, 2, 0)>, <3, (7, 0, 4)>, and <7, (9, 5, 8)>. 
Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
