Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 3) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 4) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 0) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 7) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 14) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 13) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 4) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<0, (8, 3, 4)>
<1, (5, 12, 13)>
<2, (11, 5, 14)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 0, 14)>
<5, (11, 2, 1)>
<6, (11, 7, 3)>
<7, (14, 1, 9)>
<8, (14, 0, 7)>
<9, (12, 3, 1)>
<10, (13, 11, 9)>
<11, (10, 5, 2)>
<12, (2, 9, 1)>
<13, (14, 1, 10)>
<14, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
