Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 16) (17, 18) (17, 4) (3, 7) (11, 15) (0, 18) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 6) (13, 16) (13, 2) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 14) (19, 15) (19, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 16) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 15) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 16) (16, 10) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 1) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 12) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (9, 4, 13)>
<6, (10, 14, 15)>
