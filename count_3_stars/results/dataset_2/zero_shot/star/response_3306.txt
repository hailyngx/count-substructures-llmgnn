Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 1) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 0) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 14) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
