This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
[<1, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>]
