Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 0) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 5) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 5) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations present in the given graph. The list of unique 3-stars is as follows:
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<10, (0, 11, 5)>
<4, (3, 8, 13)>
<8, (11, 4, 12)>
<11, (3, 10, 9)>
<0, (10, 4, 12)>
<7, (6, 2, 14)>
<14, (7, 13, 5)> 

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
