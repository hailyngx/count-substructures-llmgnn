Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 23) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 6) (0, 27) (0, 1) (0, 19) (27, 0) (20, 25) (20, 21) (25, 7) (25, 20) (25, 8) (25, 12) (25, 2) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 24) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 10) (22, 3) (2, 4) (2, 25) (2, 18) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 16) (29, 28) (29, 14) (29, 10) (26, 22) (11, 28) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 6) (16, 28) (16, 5) (16, 19) (8, 25) (8, 19) (9, 3) (9, 12) (10, 22) (10, 29) (10, 15) (10, 6) (15, 10) (15, 23) (15, 21) (3, 22) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 21) (21, 20) (21, 15) (21, 3) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 1) (14, 29) (14, 11) (14, 6) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 19) (23, 4) (23, 15) (23, 24) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 14) (17, 5) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 9) (24, 18) (24, 23) 

Response:
There are 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 19, 27)>
<4, (2, 7, 23)>
<7, (4, 6, 25)>
<10, (6, 22, 29)>
<11, (1, 12, 28)>
<13, (3, 5, 6)>
<15, (10, 21, 23)>
<16, (5, 19, 28)>
<18, (2, 6, 22)>
<20, (21, 25, 27)>
<25, (2, 7, 8)>
<29, (10, 14, 28)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
