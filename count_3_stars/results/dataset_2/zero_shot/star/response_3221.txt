Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found inside <> are:
<4, (1, 9, 7)>
<11, (0, 13, 5)>
<6, (8, 12, 1)>
<2, (7, 14, 4)>
