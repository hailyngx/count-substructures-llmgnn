Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are [9] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
