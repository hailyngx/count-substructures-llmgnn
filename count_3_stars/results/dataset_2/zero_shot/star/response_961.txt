Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (8, 10) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
The central node in a 3-star graph has degree 3. Let's go through the nodes step by step:

- Node 0 has a degree of 3: (0, 5), (0, 3), (0, 11)
- Node 1 has a degree of 5: (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 11), (1, 2), (1, 14)
- Node 2 has a degree of 6: (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 1), (2, 13)
- Node 3 has a degree of 4: (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 0), (3, 14)
- Node 4 has a degree of 3: (4, 7), (4, 3), (4, 2)
- Node 5 has a degree of 6: (5, 9), (5, 12), (5, 1), (5, 11), (5, 0), (5, 10)
- Node 6 has a degree of 4: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 11), (6, 13)
- Node 7 has a degree of 5: (7, 4), (7, 12), (7, 11), (7, 2), (7, 13)
- Node 8 has a degree of 1: (8, 10)
- Node 9 has a degree of 4: (9, 5), (9, 2), (9, 10), (9, 3)
- Node 10 has a degree of 3: (10, 5), (10, 9), (10, 8)
- Node 11 has a degree of 5: (11, 5), (11, 7), (11, 6), (11, 0), (11, 1)
- Node 12 has a degree of 3: (12, 5), (12, 7), (12, 13)
- Node 13 has a degree of 5: (13, 7), (13, 6), (13, 12), (13, 14), (13, 2)
- Node 14 has a degree of 3: (14, 1), (14, 3), (14, 13)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (5, 11, 3)>
<1, (5, 11, 6)>
<2, (9, 7, 13)>
<3, (9, 4, 0)>
<4, (7, 4, 2)>
<5, (9, 1, 0)>
<6, (1, 13, 11)>
<7, (4, 2, 13)>
<8, (10, 9, 8)>
<9, (10, 5, 3)>
<10, (8, 5, 9)>
<11, (7, 6, 11)>
<12, (5, 7, 12)>
<13, (2, 6, 13)>
<14, (3, 13, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
