Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 10) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 27) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 29) (21, 7) (21, 11) (10, 9) (10, 4) (11, 21) (11, 28) (20, 0) (20, 1) (20, 6) (25, 8) (25, 12) (25, 24) (25, 2) (8, 25) (13, 23) (13, 27) (13, 6) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 1) (12, 7) (12, 25) (14, 0) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 20) (6, 13) (6, 5) (22, 15) (22, 24) (22, 17) (22, 3) (28, 11) (28, 19) (28, 18) (1, 20) (1, 0) (1, 15) (1, 23) (15, 26) (15, 22) (15, 1) (15, 4) (18, 28) (29, 9) (29, 7) (29, 4) (4, 10) (4, 15) (4, 29) (16, 17) (16, 23) (16, 19) (19, 28) (19, 16) (19, 17) (2, 25) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 24) (3, 5) (3, 22) (3, 2) (3, 27) (17, 22) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 27) (24, 25) (24, 22) (24, 2) (24, 27) (27, 26) (27, 13) (27, 3) (27, 17) (27, 24) (23, 13) (23, 1) (23, 16)
