Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 16) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 14) (14, 7) (14, 17) (14, 3) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 0) (10, 17) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 8) (11, 15) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (19, 11) (19, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (1, 9) (1, 19) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (15, 11) (15, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 16) (0, 4) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph: <5, (4, 16, 0)>, <4, (5, 7, 0)>, <7, (4, 14, 6)>, <14, (7, 17, 3)>, <17, (14, 10, 0)>, <10, (17, 11, 8)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
