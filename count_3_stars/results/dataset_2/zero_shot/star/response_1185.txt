Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 16) (2, 11) (2, 15) (2, 4) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 17) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 15) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 16) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 17) (3, 4) (11, 2) (11, 19) (11, 15) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 12) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 1) (12, 4) (5, 18) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 3) (17, 19) (19, 11) (19, 17) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 10) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 16) 

Response:
There are [20] total 3-stars in the given graph.

Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
<0, (8, 0, 14)>
<1, (7, 1, 12)>
<2, (11, 2, 15)>
<3, (9, 3, 17)>
<4, (6, 4, 12)>
<5, (18, 5, 17)>
<6, (10, 6, 18)>
<7, (1, 7, 10)>
<8, (13, 8, 3)>
<9, (17, 9, 3)>
<11, (19, 11, 15)>
<13, (8, 13, 16)>
<14, (16, 14, 10)>
