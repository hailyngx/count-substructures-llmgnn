Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (9, 0, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (9, 1, 3)>
<7, (9, 0, 3)>
<1, (4, 2, 8)>
<3, (5, 4, 7)>
<6, (9, 3, 2)>
<8, (9, 1, 6)>
