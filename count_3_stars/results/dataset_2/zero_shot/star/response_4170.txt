Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 27) (13, 18) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 21) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 28) (2, 15) (29, 2) (29, 16) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 25) (7, 11) (7, 9) (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 20) (23, 0) (8, 1) (18, 13) (18, 22) (18, 3) (15, 2) (15, 26) (15, 14) (20, 11) (20, 19) (20, 16) (0, 23) (0, 14) (0, 26) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 5) (19, 20) (19, 26) (19, 27) (26, 15) (26, 0) (26, 19) (26, 5) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 26) (5, 24) (6, 13) (28, 2) (28, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 25) (1, 12) (3, 18) (3, 21) (21, 22) (21, 10) (21, 3) (21, 27) (17, 16) (17, 27) (25, 4) (25, 1) (25, 12) (16, 29) (16, 10) (16, 20) (16, 17) (24, 5) (24, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 24) (27, 13) (27, 19) (27, 21) (27, 17) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 25) 

Response:
There are 14 unique 3-stars in this graph. The answer is [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
<11, (20, 10, 12)>
<10, (21, 1, 16)>
<1, (12, 25, 8)>
<27, (17, 19, 21)>
<26, (19, 5, 0)>
<22, (21, 13, 18)>
<13, (18, 6, 12)>
<5, (24, 26, 14)>
<0, (26, 23, 14)>
<2, (15, 5, 28)>
<4, (25, 9, 28)>
<9, (24, 4, 7)>
<29, (2, 16, 28)>
<15, (14, 26, 2)>
