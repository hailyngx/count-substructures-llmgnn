Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 11) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 8) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 14) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 8) (3, 10) (13, 11) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 12, 10)>
<1, (9, 2, 7)>
<2,(5, 1, 11)>
<3, (10, 14, -)>
<4, (9, 0, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 11)>
<6, (5, 8, 11)>
<7, (4, 2, 1)>
<8, (5, 6, 12)>
