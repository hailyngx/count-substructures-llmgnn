Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 5) (15, 7) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 26) (4, 20) (7, 15) (7, 28) (7, 9) (7, 2) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 29) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 25) (1, 3) (1, 16) (10, 0) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 0) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 21) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 22) (5, 11) (6, 21) (6, 24) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 24) (21, 16) (21, 29) (24, 6) (24, 21) (24, 16) (24, 13) (26, 27) (26, 28) (26, 29) (28, 7) (28, 26) (28, 14) (20, 4) (20, 9) (29, 22) (29, 21) (29, 26) (18, 14) (18, 11) (19, 2) (19, 16) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 19) (2, 7) (2, 23) (2, 19) (2, 25) (14, 22) (14, 8) (14, 28) (14, 18) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 24) (13, 12) (25, 23) (25, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 20) (11, 5) (11, 18) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars found are:
<0, (17, 12, 13)>
<7, (2, 28, 9)>
<22, (5, 29, 23)>
<17, (16, 10, 21)>
<16, (1, 24, 19)>
<2, (25, 7, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
