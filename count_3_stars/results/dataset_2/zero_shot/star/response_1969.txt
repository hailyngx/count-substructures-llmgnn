Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 18) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 19) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 17) (6, 5) (6, 16) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 10) (14, 8) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 8) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 11) (15, 19) (15, 8) (8, 14) (8, 18) (8, 15) (8, 19) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 13) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 13) (2, 3) (2, 19) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 16) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<11, (10, 17, 13)>
