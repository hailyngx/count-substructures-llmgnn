Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<6, (9, 1, 2)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<0, (6, 8, 2)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<2, (6, 1, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 7)>
<9, (6, 3, 7)>
