Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 0) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 10) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<6, (1, 12, 9)>
<9, (2, 11, 6)>
<4, (5, 13, 7)>
<7, (4, 0, 14)>
<8, (3, 12, 4)>
<13, (1, 14, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
