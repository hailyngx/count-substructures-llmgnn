Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 4) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 19) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (7, 3) (7, 16) (7, 2) (15, 4) (15, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 6) (8, 1) (8, 11) (19, 1) (19, 3) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 15) (16, 12) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 10) (12, 14) (12, 16) (12, 10) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 18) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 18) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 15) (18, 10) (18, 11) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (6, 9, 11)>
<9, (4, 5, 11)>
<17, (4, 6, 13)>
