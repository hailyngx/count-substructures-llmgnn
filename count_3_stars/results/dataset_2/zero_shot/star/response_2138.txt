Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 9) (3, 14) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 2)
