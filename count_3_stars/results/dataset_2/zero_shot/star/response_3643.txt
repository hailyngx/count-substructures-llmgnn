Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are 8 different 3-stars in the given graph. 

Thus, the final answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<1, (6, 0, 7)>
<6, (4, 1, 8)>
<5, (9, 2, 3)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
<0, (6, 7, 1)>
<7, (9, 0, 1)>
<2, (8, 3, 5)>
