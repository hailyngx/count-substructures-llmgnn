Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 14) (0, 27) (0, 12) (27, 0) (27, 10) (27, 13) (4, 28) (4, 16) (4, 2) (7, 20) (7, 14) (7, 2) (17, 18) (17, 28) (17, 23) (17, 5) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 23) (18, 21) (18, 1) (8, 13) (8, 20) (8, 16) (13, 27) (13, 8) (13, 11) (1, 18) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 6) (26, 12) (9, 18) (9, 19) (22, 3) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 11) (19, 9) (19, 25) (19, 23) (16, 4) (16, 8) (20, 7) (20, 8) (20, 28) (23, 17) (23, 18) (23, 19) (28, 4) (28, 17) (28, 20) (28, 5) (24, 14) (24, 10) (6, 3) (6, 26) (6, 10) (10, 27) (10, 24) (10, 6) (10, 12) (12, 0) (12, 26) (12, 10) (12, 21) (5, 17) (5, 28) (5, 25) (5, 29) (25, 19) (25, 5) (25, 21) (29, 15) (29, 5) (21, 18) (21, 12) (21, 25) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 24) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars:

<3, (15, 11, 6)>
<13, (27, 8, 11)>
<18, (17, 23, 1)>
<28, (4, 20, 17)>
<5, (17, 25, 29)>
<25, (19, 5, 21)>

Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
