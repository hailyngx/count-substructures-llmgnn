Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 12) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 11) (11, 0) (11, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 14) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 13, 14)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 13)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 10)>
<5, (12, 13, 14)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
