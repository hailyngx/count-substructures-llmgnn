Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 10) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 19) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (5, 3) (5, 18) (6, 17) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 9) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 18) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 4) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 9) (12, 8) (12, 0) (18, 5) (18, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 16) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 19) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 9) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:

[<3, (10, 2, 5)>, <15, (1, 10, 11)>, <14, (17, 11, 7)>, <17, (14, 6, 19)>, <10, (3, 15, 11)>, <11, (14, 10, 9)>, <5, (3, 18, N/A)>, <6, (17, N/A, N/A)>, <2, (3, 7, N/A)>, <8, (14, 12, 7)>, <13, (10, 1, 9)>, <0, (7, 16, 19)>, <1, (15, 13, 4)>, <16, (0, 4, 9)>, <12, (8, 0, N/A)>, <18, (5, 7, N/A)>, <4, (14, 1, 16)>, <9, (11, 13, 16)>, <19, (17, 0, 9)>]

There are a total of [19] 3-stars in this graph.
