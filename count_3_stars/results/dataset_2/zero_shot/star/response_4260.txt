Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
[6]
<2, (9, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 8, 2)>
<6, (8, 0, 7)>
<7, (8, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 0, 3)>
<9, (4, 8, 7)>
