Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 13) (6, 16) (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 8) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 7) (1, 17) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 12) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 14) (7, 13) (7, 11) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 0) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 19) (8, 18) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 16) (19, 2) (19, 3) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (9, 6, 13)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<6, (9, 13, 16)>
<10, (17, 16, 18)>
<17, (10, 1, 3)>
<2, (18, 19, 13)>
<18, (2, 4, 16)>
<4, (9, 17, 18)>
<13, (5, 6, 2)>
<1, (17, 15, 11)>
<15, (1, 12, 14)>
<3, (17, 0, 19)>
