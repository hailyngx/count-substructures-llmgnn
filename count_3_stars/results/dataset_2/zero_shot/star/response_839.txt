Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in this graph.

<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (6, 7, 2)>
<3, (5, 9, 7)>
<8, (4, 7, 0)>
