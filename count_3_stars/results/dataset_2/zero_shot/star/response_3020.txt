Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
