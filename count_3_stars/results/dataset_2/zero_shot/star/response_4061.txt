Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 2) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 2) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 1) (13, 9) (13, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding all nodes with exactly three edges and considering them as the centers of the 3-stars. 

In the given graph, the nodes with three edges are: 5, 7, 14

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is 3.

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<5, (8, 10, 12)>
<7, (1, 3, 14)>
<14, (7, 10, 3)>

So, the final answer is [3].
