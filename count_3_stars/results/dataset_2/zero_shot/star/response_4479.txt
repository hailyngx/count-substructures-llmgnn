Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
