Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 5, 4)>
<9, (6, 3, 7)>
<1, (3, 2, 0)>
<4, (6, 8, 0)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (6, 3, 7)>
<7, (9, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
