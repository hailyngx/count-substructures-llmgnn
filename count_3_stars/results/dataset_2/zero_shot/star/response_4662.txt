Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 24) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 13) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 27) (21, 17) (6, 8) (6, 27) (9, 25) (9, 2) (9, 20) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (20, 9) (20, 13) (20, 10) (25, 9) (25, 17) (25, 19) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 24) (12, 23) (27, 21) (27, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 19) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 10) (28, 29) (28, 19) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 0) (10, 21) (10, 20) (10, 26) (10, 13) (10, 14) (0, 16) (0, 21) (0, 29) (19, 25) (19, 18) (19, 28) (23, 12) (23, 26) (23, 14) (17, 21) (17, 25) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (24, 16) (24, 12) (24, 8) (24, 4) (7, 29) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 22) (7, 13) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 24) (14, 10) (14, 23) (15, 7) (15, 22) (15, 4) (13, 1) (13, 20) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 7) (22, 7) (22, 15) (4, 24) (4, 15) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by examining the nodes that are connected in the manner of 3-stars. In a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's calculate this.

Number of 3-stars: [12]

Unique 3-stars:
<16, (11, 0, 24)>
<21, (10, 0, 27)>
<2, (9, 3, 18)>
<26, (1, 23, 10)>
<29, (28, 0, 7)>
<10, (21, 20, 26)>
<0, (16, 29, 21)>
<23, (12, 26, 14)>
<25, (9, 17, 19)>
<7, (29, 15, 13)>
<15, (7, 22, 4)>
<4, (24, 15, 5)>
