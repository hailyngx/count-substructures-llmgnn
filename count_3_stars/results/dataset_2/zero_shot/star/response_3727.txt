Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star configurations in this given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<5, (9, 13, 12)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<13, (8, 12, 1)>
<0, (4, 8, 3)>
