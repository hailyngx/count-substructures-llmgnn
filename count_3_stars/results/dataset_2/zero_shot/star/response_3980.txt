Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 11) (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 16) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 14) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 18) (6, 10) (6, 0) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 19) (16, 5) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 13) (2, 9) (2, 4) (11, 15) (11, 1) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 7) (18, 3) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 13) (19, 18) (1, 10) (1, 11) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (13, 15, 18)>
<15, (0, 11, 17)>
<5, (9, 16, 17)>
<9, (2, 14, 16)>
<4, (2, 8, 8)>
<7, (12, 14, 18)>
<10, (1, 8, 17)>
<17, (8, 10, 13)>
<8, (0, 4, 10)>
<12, (7, 16, 18)>
<6, (0, 10, 16)>
<13, (3, 16, 19)>
<16, (5, 9, 13)>
<2, (4, 9, 2)>
<11, (1, 15, 11)>
<14, (3, 7, 9)>
<18, (3, 12, 19)>
