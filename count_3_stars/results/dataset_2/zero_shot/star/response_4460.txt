Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 11) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 3) (10, 8) (10, 18) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 2) (7, 11) (7, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 3) (4, 12) (4, 18) (4, 15) (4, 2) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 15) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 19) (13, 5) (13, 19) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 19) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 8) (19, 15) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 19) (1, 5) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 14, 19)>
<2, (1, 4, 11)>
<4, (2, 12, 18)>
<5, (1, 9, 13)>
