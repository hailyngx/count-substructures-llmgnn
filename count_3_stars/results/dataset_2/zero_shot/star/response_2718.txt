Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 12) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 11) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
The center nodes of 3-stars must have exactly 3 neighbors. Therefore, we need to find all nodes in the graph that have exactly 3 neighbors. Let's identify such nodes and construct the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 3, 7, 11, 14 (not a center node)
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 3, 10 (not a center node)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 8, 10, 13
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 10, 14 (not a center node)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 7, 8, 13
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 0, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14 (not a center node)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 8, 9, 10, 12 (not a center node)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 8, 14 (not a center node)
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 12, 13 (not a center node)
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 6, 11, 12
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6 (a potential center node)
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 9, 13 (not a center node)
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 8, 11 (not a center node)
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 7 (not a center node)

Therefore, the only potential center node is Node 10. Let's construct the 3-stars with Node 10 as the center by identifying the leaves:

- 3-star with central node 10: <10, (1, 2, 6)>
- 3-star with central node 10: <10, (2, 8, 13)>
- 3-star with central node 10: <10, (3, 0, 6)>

There are a total of 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [3].
