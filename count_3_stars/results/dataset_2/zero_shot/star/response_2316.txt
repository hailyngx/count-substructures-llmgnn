Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 5) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 14) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 14) 

Response:
There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<10, (0, 2, 5)>
<11, (8, 9, 14)>
<8, (1, 6, 13)>
<13, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (3, 9, 11)>
<12, (0, 1, 10)>
<5, (0, 3, 13)>
<6, (8, 13, 6)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 9, 13)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
