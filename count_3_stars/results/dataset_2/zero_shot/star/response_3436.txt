Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 2) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 7)
