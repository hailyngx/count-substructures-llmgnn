Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 12) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 14) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
