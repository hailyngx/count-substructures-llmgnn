Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 2) (18, 27) (18, 28) (18, 8) (22, 16) (22, 29) (22, 12) (8, 18) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 7) (23, 24) (23, 28) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 27) (14, 25) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 6) (26, 13) (28, 18) (28, 23) (3, 21) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 24) (17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 24) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 9) (12, 22) (12, 16) (12, 25) (16, 22) (16, 12) (16, 29) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 9) (9, 11) (9, 19) (9, 25) (9, 20) (9, 27) (25, 14) (25, 12) (25, 9) (25, 4) (7, 8) (7, 24) (20, 9) (20, 4) (20, 10) (24, 23) (24, 15) (24, 17) (24, 7) (6, 0) (6, 13) (6, 29) (6, 2) (6, 4) (29, 22) (29, 16) (29, 6) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 9) (10, 20) (10, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 21) (2, 6) (2, 10) (4, 25) (4, 20) (4, 6) 

Response:

<1, (15, 19, 24)>
<3, (5, 19, 15)>
<8, (15, 1, 21)>
<9, (19, 11, 25)>
<11, (9, 14, 27)>
<12, (16, 25, 22)>
<13, (26, 6, 17)>
<16, (12, 22, 29)>
<18, (8, 28, 18)>
<20, (10, 4, 20)>
<21, (2, 3, 21)>
<27, (14, 9, 27)>
