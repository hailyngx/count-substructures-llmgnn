Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 8 total 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 4, 2)>
<1, (5, 3, 2)>
<2, (3, 6, 1)>
<3, (5, 6, 1)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<6, (9, 3, 2)>
<7, (5, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
