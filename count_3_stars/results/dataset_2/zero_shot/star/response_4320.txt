Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 14) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 0) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 14) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 3)>
<1, (9, 4, 3)>
