Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 2, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, 1)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<7, (9, 4, 3)>
<8, (9, 4, 0)>
<6, (8, 3, 0)>
