Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
