Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 7) (26, 22) (26, 2) (26, 29) (26, 11) (3, 14) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 6) (1, 12) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 26) (11, 7) (11, 21) (12, 1) (12, 29) (27, 23) (27, 6) (28, 19) (28, 2) (29, 26) (29, 12) (29, 6) (0, 15) (0, 25) (14, 3) (14, 24) (14, 4) (14, 20) (22, 9) (22, 26) (22, 19) (22, 5) (22, 17) (8, 21) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 24) (7, 13) (25, 0) (25, 17) (25, 16) (19, 15) (19, 28) (19, 22) (19, 23) (17, 22) (17, 25) (17, 18) (17, 4) (2, 26) (2, 28) (2, 13) (5, 10) (5, 22) (5, 23) (23, 27) (23, 19) (23, 5) (6, 15) (6, 27) (6, 29) (6, 16) (20, 14) (20, 4) (20, 16) (21, 11) (21, 8) (21, 24) (24, 14) (24, 7) (24, 21) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 20) (4, 13) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 18) (16, 10) (16, 25) (16, 6) (16, 20) (16, 18) (18, 17) (18, 13) (18, 16) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by examining each node to see how many 3-stars centered at that node exist in the graph.

- Node 0: (0, 15, 25)
- Node 1: (1, 12, 29)
- Node 2: (2, 13, 26)
- Node 3: (3, 14, 24)
- Node 4: (4, 13, 14)
- Node 5: (5, 10, 22)
- Node 6: (6, 15, 27)
- Node 7: (7, 9, 11)
- Node 8: Not part of any 3-star
- Node 9: (9, 7, 22)
- Node 10: (10, 5, 16)
- Node 11: (11, 7, 26)
- Node 12: (12, 1, 29)
- Node 13: (13, 2, 4)
- Node 14: (14, 3, 20)
- Node 15: (15, 0, 6)
- Node 16: (16, 10, 20)
- Node 17: (17, 4, 25)
- Node 18: (18, 13, 16)
- Node 19: (19, 15, 28)
- Node 20: (20, 14, 16)
- Node 21: (21, 8, 24)
- Node 22: (22, 5, 26)
- Node 23: (23, 5, 27)
- Node 24: (24, 7, 21)
- Node 25: (25, 0, 16)
- Node 26: (26, 2, 29)
- Node 27: (27, 6, 23)
- Node 28: (28, 19, 2)
- Node 29: (29, 12, 26)

Counting the unique 3-stars we found, we get:
<0, (15, 25, 0)>, <1, (29, 12, 1)>, <2, (26, 13, 2)>, <3, (24, 14, 3)>, <4, (13, 14, 4)>, <5, (10, 22, 5)>, <6, (27, 6, 15)>, <7, (9, 11, 7)>, <10, (16, 5, 10)>, <11, (26, 7, 11)>, <12, (1, 29, 12)>, <13, (2, 4, 13)>, <14, (3, 20, 14)>, <16, (20, 16, 10)>, <17, (4, 25, 17)>, <18, (16, 13, 18)>, <19, (28, 15, 19 )>, <21, (24, 8, 21)>, <22, (26, 5, 22)>, <23, (5, 27, 23)>, <24, (21, 7, 24)>, <25, (0, 16, 25)>, <26, (2, 29, 26)>, <27, (6, 23, 27)>, <28, (2, 19, 28)>, <29, (12, 26, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
