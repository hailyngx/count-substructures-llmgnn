Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 21) (9, 3) (8, 28) (8, 10) (8, 25) (13, 23) (13, 14) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 29) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 28) (15, 6) (15, 20) (15, 28) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 27) (12, 7) (12, 29) (11, 2) (28, 8) (28, 20) (28, 15) (28, 18) (25, 8) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 19) (25, 22) (1, 6) (1, 14) (3, 9) (3, 21) (3, 29) (21, 9) (21, 3) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 10) (2, 6) (2, 11) (23, 13) (23, 5) (23, 18) (26, 0) (26, 25) (26, 29) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 1) (5, 23) (5, 4) (19, 25) (19, 4) (19, 17) (17, 19) (17, 22) (18, 28) (18, 23) (24, 29) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 19) (29, 0) (29, 12) (29, 3) (29, 26) (29, 24) (27, 20) (27, 7) (27, 10) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 27) (10, 22) (22, 25) (22, 16) (22, 17) (22, 10) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (16, 20, 26)>, <2, (6, 11, -)>, <3, (9, 21, 29)>, <4, (5, 9, 19)>, <6, (1, 9, 15)>, <7, (12, 14, 25)>, <8, (10, 25, 28)>, <10, (8, 16, 27)>, <12, (7, 29, -)>, <13, (14, 23, -)>, <15, (6, 20, 28)>, <17, (19, 22, -)>, <18, (23, 28, -)>, <19, (4, 17, 25)>, <20, (0, 15, 28)>, <21, (3, 9, -)>, <22, (10, 17, 25)>, <23, (13, 18, 28)>, <25, (7, 19, 22)>, <26, (0, 25, 29)>, <27, (10, 20, -)>, <28, (8, 15, 18)>, <29, (3, 26, 24)>]
[<1, (6, 14, -)>, <5, (4, 23, -)>, <9, (3, 4, 21)>, <11, (2, 6, -)>, <14, (1, 7, -)>, <16, (0, 10, 22)>, <24, (29, - , -)>, <8, (28, - , -)>, <15, (6, - , -)>, <12, (7, 29, -)>]

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27].
