Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 12) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 7) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (12, 14) (12, 9) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:

<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 9, 14)>
<4, (2, 8, 14)>
<5, (1, 6, 13)>
<6, (1, 5, 13)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
