Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in this graph.
