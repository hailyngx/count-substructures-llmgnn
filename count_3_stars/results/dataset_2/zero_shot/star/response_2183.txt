Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 10) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 7) (1, 11) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 1) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

[6]

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 3, 12)>
<9, (6, 10, 1)>
<4, (6, 0, 5)>
<8, (6, 2, 11)>
<0, (4, 14, 10)>
<14, (0, 7, 13)>
