Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (2, 18) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 13) (18, 8) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 9) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 16) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 8) (8, 18) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 15) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 13) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 1) (19, 17) (19, 15) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 8) (13, 14) (13, 18) (13, 10) (13, 15) (11, 5) 

Response:
There are 3-star graphs in this network that form the following unique configurations:

<0, (14, 4, 10)>
<1, (17, 16, 10)>
<3, (12, 6, 8)>
<4, (18, 0, 16)>
<5, (17, 6, 11)>
<6, (5, 3, 12)>
<8, (18, 3, 1)>
<9, (14, 12, 15)>
<10, (0, 1, 13)>
<13, (14, 18, 15)>
<14, (17, 0, 13)>
<15, (9, 19, 13)>
<16, (2, 12, 4)>
<17, (14, 1, 19)>
<18, (2, 4, 13)>
<19, (17, 15, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given network is [16].
