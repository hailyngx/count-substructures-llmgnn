Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 26) (16, 11) (16, 24) (2, 29) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 5) (1, 26) (1, 25) (1, 19) (1, 22) (26, 11) (26, 1) (26, 0) (17, 29) (17, 7) (5, 29) (5, 24) (6, 24) (6, 19) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 21) (21, 3) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 12) (21, 18) (10, 21) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (8, 11) (8, 27) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 23) (25, 1) (25, 27) (25, 4) (25, 22) (25, 14) (27, 21) (27, 8) (27, 25) (24, 16) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 22) (24, 20) (4, 2) (4, 25) (4, 22) (22, 1) (22, 25) (22, 24) (22, 4) (7, 17) (7, 20) (7, 18) (20, 24) (20, 7) (9, 2) (9, 28) (9, 12) (28, 9) (28, 14) (0, 26) (0, 15) (0, 12) (18, 21) (18, 7) (18, 12) (13, 11) (23, 19) (12, 21) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 18) (14, 15) (14, 25) (14, 28) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

Unique 3-stars: <11, (16, 3, 13)>, <11, (8, 26, 1)>, <2, (29, 9, 4)>, <1, (26, 25, 19)>, <29, (17, 5, 2)>, <21, (3, 10, 27)>, <15, (10, 0, 14)>, <24, (16, 5, 6)>, <25, (1, 27, 4)>
