Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 27) (20, 22) (20, 6) (20, 10) (25, 20) (25, 23) (25, 0) (25, 22) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 3) (13, 1) (26, 13) (26, 21) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 9) (15, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 21) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 27) (11, 19) (11, 27) (11, 18) (23, 25) (23, 18) (7, 16) (7, 24) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 19) (3, 13) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 29) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 12) (12, 16) (12, 28) (17, 28) (17, 4) (21, 13) (21, 26) (21, 8) (21, 2) (21, 24) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 4) (5, 8) (5, 10) (14, 9) (14, 22) (14, 2) (22, 20) (22, 25) (22, 14) (18, 11) (18, 23) (27, 20) (27, 9) (27, 11) (29, 3) (24, 7) (24, 3) (24, 21) (24, 10) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 10) (0, 25) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 21) (2, 14) (10, 20) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 24) (10, 4) (6, 20) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<13, (1, 26, 21)>
<21, (2, 8, 24)>
<4, (9, 17, 19)>
<10, (1, 5, 24)>
