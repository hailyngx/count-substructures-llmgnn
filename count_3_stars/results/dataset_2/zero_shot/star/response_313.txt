Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
<5, (2, 8, 0)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<7, (8, 1, 4)>
<1, (3, 0, 8)>
<3, (9, 1, 0)>
