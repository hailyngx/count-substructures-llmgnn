Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 9) (12, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 11) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 10) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 14) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<4, (7, 6, 3)>
<7, (4, 0, 11)>
<1, (14, 9, 8)>
<3, (4, 13, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 2)>
<5, (8, 0, 10)>
<13, (3, 11, 10)>
<0, (7, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 12)>
<12, (4, 9, 14)>
<6, (4, 13, 0)>
<11, (7, 8, 13)>
<14, (1, 12, 10)>
<10, (2, 5, 13)>

There are a total of [15] unique 3-stars in the graph.
