Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 2) (12, 4) (12, 13) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 

<4, (7, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 11, 10)>
<1, (3, 2, 9)>
<3, (0, 13, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
