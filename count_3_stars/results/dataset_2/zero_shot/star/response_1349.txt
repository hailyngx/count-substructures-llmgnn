Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 10) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 7) (5, 6) (5, 16) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 16) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 19) (15, 13) (15, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 2) (10, 6) (4, 2) (4, 15) (12, 9) (12, 14) (0, 18) (0, 6) (0, 9) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 6) (16, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 14) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 3) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 13) (3, 8) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 14) (13, 15) (13, 19) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 19) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (9, 18, 6)>
<3, (17, 16, 14)>
<5, (16, 6, 7)>
<9, (8, 1, 11)>
