Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 20) (16, 21) (16, 29) (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 4) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 26) (27, 23) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (20, 11) (20, 12) (20, 8) (20, 23) (25, 6) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 12) (23, 27) (23, 20) (23, 22) (12, 15) (12, 27) (12, 20) (12, 22) (4, 15) (4, 22) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 20) (8, 19) (8, 29) (29, 16) (29, 8) (29, 9) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 24) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 7) (21, 16) (21, 6) (21, 26) (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 18) (6, 25) (6, 4) (6, 21) (6, 26) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 24) (2, 22) (2, 24) (5, 11) (5, 26) (5, 24) (26, 27) (26, 21) (26, 6) (26, 5) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 7) (0, 15) (0, 13) (14, 19) (14, 18) (24, 10) (24, 19) (24, 2) (24, 5) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 13) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 7) 

Response:
The center of a 3-star graph must have exactly 3 neighbors. Therefore, we need to find nodes in the given graph that have 3 neighbors.

By analyzing the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<8, (20, 4, 29)>
<12, (20, 22, 27)>
<4, (6, 22, 15)>
<20, (11, 12, 8)>
<27, (15, 12, 26)>
<22, (4, 12, 2)>
<26, (5, 6, 27)>
<18, (7, 14, 9)>
<24, (10, 5, 19)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars observed, we have found a total of [9] unique 3-stars in this graph.
