Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 13) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 13) (5, 7) (5, 10) (1, 11) (1, 4) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <6, (9, 3, 2)>, <7, (9, 12, 5)>, <12, (7, 14, 11)>, <14, (9, 0, 13)>.
So, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
