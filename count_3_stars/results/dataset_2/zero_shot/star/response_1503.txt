Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 0) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 12) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 8) (0, 12) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the final count is [4].
The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (5, 4, 2)>
<1, (3, 7, 14)>
<3, (1, 4, 12)>
<11, (9, 0, 13)>
