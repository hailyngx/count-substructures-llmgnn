Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 8) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 4) (6, 15) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 7) (4, 15) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 8) (11, 3) (11, 19) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 0) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 12) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 18) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 10) (18, 16) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 17) (2, 17) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 17) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 8) (1, 19) (1, 14) (13, 12) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented by the following:

<15, (16, 4, 6)>
<16, (15, 0, 12)>
<4, (15, 0, 10)>
<12, (19, 13, 16)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
