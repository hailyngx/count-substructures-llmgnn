Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 12) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:
- <5, (6, 12, 4)>
- <9, (1, 7, 13)>
- <10, (11, 2, 14)>
- <11, (10, 7, 13)>
- <4, (5, 8, 2)>
- <8, (11, 4, 7)>
- <6, (5, 11, 8)>
- <0, (14, 1, 2)>
- <14, (10, 6, 0)>
- <3, (4, 8, 12)>
- <7, (9, 11, 8)>
- <2, (10, 4, 0)>
- <1, (9, 0, 2)>
- <12 , (5, 6, 3)>
- <13, (9, 11, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: [15]
