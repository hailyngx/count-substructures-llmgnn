Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 25) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 23) (15, 21) (15, 12) (21, 15) (21, 17) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 24) (13, 28) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 17) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 22) (20, 4) (25, 9) (25, 20) (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 29) (3, 18) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 5) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 27) (28, 13) (28, 16) (28, 18) (28, 23) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 4) (19, 10) (19, 6) (19, 0) (6, 19) (6, 14) (6, 4) (24, 8) (24, 13) (24, 29) (23, 26) (23, 28) (23, 29) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 6) (14, 2) (7, 20) (7, 1) (7, 17) (29, 3) (29, 16) (29, 24) (29, 23) (29, 4) (22, 20) (22, 27) (27, 9) (27, 16) (27, 22) (17, 21) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 20) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 29) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 28) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is [6].
The unique 3-stars are:
<9, (25, 26, 27)>
<26, (1, 20, 23)>
<19, (0, 10, 6)>
<20, (1, 7, 22)>
<28, (13, 16, 18)>
<29, (3, 23, 24)>
