Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 14) (16, 10) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 12) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 18) (7, 8) (7, 15) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 12) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 1) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 8) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 17) (3, 10) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (10, 16) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 1) (18, 6) (18, 17) (18, 15) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 10)>
<1, (0, 10, 12)>
<2, (4, 5, 11)>
<3, (4, 9, 10)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 9, 13)>
<6, (3, 12, 17)>
<7, (8, 15, 18)>
<8, (0, 4, 14)>
<9, (3, 5, 13)>
<10, (1, 3, 14)>
<11, (2, 14, 15)>
<12, (1, 6, 17)>
<13, (5, 9, 13)>
<14, (8, 10, 16)>
<15, (7, 11, 18)>
<16, (10, 14, 16)>
<17, (6, 12, 18)>
<18, (7, 15, 17)>

There are 18 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the answer is [18].
