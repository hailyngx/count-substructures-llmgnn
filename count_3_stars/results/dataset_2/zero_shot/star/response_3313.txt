Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 9) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 13) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 11) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 0) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (9, 12, 14)>
<5, (6, 8, 10)>
<6, (2, 5, 13)>
<2, (6, 9, 13)>
