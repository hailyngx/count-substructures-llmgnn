Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 6) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 1) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 10, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 12)>
<3, (4, 8, 13)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 8, 13)>
<6, (0, 1, 12)>
<7, (10, 12, 14)>
<8, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 11, 13)>
<10, (0, 9, 11)>
<11, (9, 10, 13)>
<12, (2, 6, 14)>
<13, (3, 5, 9)>
<14, (7, 12, 13)>
