Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 2) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated as follows: 

1. First, we identify nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can act as the center of a 3-star.

2. Next, we check for each of these central nodes, if the other three nodes connected to it form a 3-star. 

Let's go ahead and count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

There are two nodes connected to exactly three other nodes: nodes 8 and 13. These nodes can act as the centers of 3-stars.

For node 8, the 3-star is <8, (4, 9, 10)>.
For node 13, the 3-star is <13, (8, 11, 9)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars:
<8, (4, 9, 10)>
<13, (8, 11, 9)>
