Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 1) (11, 5) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 12) (10, 12) (10, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 12) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 10) 

Response:
There are <8, (4, 14, 0)>, <13, (5, 3, 9)>, and <12, (5, 6, 14)> 3-star graphs in the given graph.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
