Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<9, (6, 8, 7)>
<1, (5, 2, 0)>
<3, (5, 7, 4)>
<2, (5, 1, 3)>
<0, (6, 1, 8)>
<7, (9, 6, 8)>
<4, (9, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 2)>
<8, (9, 0, 7)>
<6, (9, 0, 4)>
<10, (11, 12, 13)>
<11, (12, 13, 14)>
