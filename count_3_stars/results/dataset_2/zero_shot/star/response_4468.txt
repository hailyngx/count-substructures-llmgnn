Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (2, 8, 0)>
<9, (6, 7, 4)>
<6, (3, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 3)>
