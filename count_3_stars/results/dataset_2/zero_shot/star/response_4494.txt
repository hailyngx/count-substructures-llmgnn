Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. This can be calculated by counting the number of nodes with degree 3, as each such node represents the center of a 3-star. Here are the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (6, 9, 7)>
<1, (9, 4, 8)>
<2, (9, 6, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (6, 1, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (9, 6, 5)>
<9, (1, 0, 7)> 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
