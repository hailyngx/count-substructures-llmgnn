Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 25) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 27) (17, 7) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 18) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 22) (27, 17) (27, 12) (5, 19) (5, 10) (6, 3) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 29) (22, 12) (22, 26) (26, 22) (26, 29) (26, 3) (26, 4) (0, 17) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 24) (24, 19) (24, 2) (11, 12) (11, 19) (11, 23) (11, 4) (23, 11) (23, 1) (23, 29) (23, 10) (9, 29) (9, 2) (9, 28) (29, 7) (29, 26) (29, 23) (29, 9) (3, 6) (3, 26) (3, 28) (28, 9) (28, 3) (28, 15) (1, 23) (1, 16) (1, 10) (20, 2) (21, 14) (21, 18) (2, 24) (2, 9) (2, 20) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 15) (10, 5) (10, 23) (10, 1) (10, 16) (25, 14) (25, 12) (25, 18) (4, 26) (4, 11) (4, 15) (15, 13) (15, 28) (15, 16) (15, 4) (18, 13) (18, 21) (18, 25) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by first identifying the central node for each 3-star. 
Then, we check if each central node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming the 3-star pattern.

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

There are no 3-stars in this graph. 
Thus, the answer is [0].
