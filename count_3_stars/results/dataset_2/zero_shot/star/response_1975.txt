Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 2) (22, 19) (22, 27) (22, 15) (22, 29) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 23) (21, 5) (10, 3) (10, 4) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 7) (15, 22) (15, 14) (20, 27) (6, 16) (6, 11) (0, 25) (0, 26) (14, 15) (14, 27) (14, 9) (14, 12) (24, 7) (24, 4) (24, 5) (26, 0) (26, 2) (26, 16) (29, 22) (29, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (19, 22) (19, 4) (19, 7) (16, 6) (16, 26) (16, 5) (23, 21) (23, 18) (23, 9) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 8) (5, 21) (5, 24) (5, 8) (5, 16) (2, 13) (2, 26) (2, 4) (18, 23) (18, 27) (18, 25) (4, 10) (4, 24) (4, 19) (4, 2) (4, 25) (27, 22) (27, 21) (27, 20) (27, 14) (27, 18) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 11) (7, 17) (7, 24) (7, 19) (7, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 25) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 23) (9, 7) (25, 0) (25, 18) (25, 4) (25, 11) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<1, (21, 27, 29)>
<3, (10, 17, 8)>
<4, (10, 19, 24)>
<5, (8, 16, 24)>
<7, (17, 19, 24)>
<9, (14, 17, 23)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
