Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 14) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (9, 2, 12)>
<6, (2, 10, 0)>
<7, (3, 10, 11)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
