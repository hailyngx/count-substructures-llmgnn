Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (9, 6, 3)>
<1, (14, 13, 4)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>
<6, (5, 10, 2)>
<4, (1, 8, 7)>
<7, (1, 11, 14)>
