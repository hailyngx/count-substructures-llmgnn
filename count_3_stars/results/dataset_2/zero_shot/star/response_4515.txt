Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 27) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 29) (16, 20) (1, 11) (21, 7) (21, 10) (7, 21) (7, 29) (18, 22) (18, 6) (18, 17) (22, 18) (22, 15) (3, 25) (3, 12) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 2) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 24) (13, 23) (6, 18) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 0) (28, 6) (28, 2) (0, 6) (0, 23) (14, 9) (14, 10) (19, 26) (19, 10) (19, 24) (26, 19) (26, 24) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 26) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 5) (10, 21) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 9) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 17) (2, 25) (2, 28) (2, 5) (2, 20) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 20) (29, 11) (29, 16) (29, 7) (29, 27) (9, 14) (9, 10) (15, 22) (15, 23) (23, 25) (23, 13) (23, 0) (23, 15) (27, 11) (27, 29) (4, 5) (4, 20) (20, 16) (20, 2) (20, 5) (20, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star structures in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<11, (16, 1, 29)>
<16, (11, 12, 20)>
<25, (3, 23, 2)>
<6, (18, 28, 10)>
