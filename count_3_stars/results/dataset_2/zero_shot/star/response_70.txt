Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 14) (27, 15) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 13) (20, 9) (25, 20) (25, 18) (25, 11) (10, 16) (10, 14) (11, 25) (11, 21) (8, 20) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 0) (23, 13) (23, 28) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 25) (18, 21) (2, 8) (2, 5) (22, 3) (26, 24) (26, 16) (28, 23) (28, 14) (28, 19) (28, 13) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 24) (17, 19) (24, 26) (24, 17) (24, 7) (24, 9) (24, 5) (0, 8) (0, 23) (7, 24) (7, 3) (9, 20) (9, 8) (9, 24) (9, 21) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (16, 10) (16, 26) (16, 29) (16, 3) (3, 22) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 16) (3, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 24) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 28) (19, 28) (19, 17) (6, 3) (6, 29) (29, 15) (29, 16) (29, 6) (29, 21) (21, 11) (21, 18) (21, 9) (21, 29) (13, 20) (13, 23) (13, 4) (13, 28) 

Response:
There are 3-star graphs found in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:

<3, (7, 16, 29)>
<4, (12, 17, 24)>
<5, (2, 5, 24)>
<8, (0, 9, 23)>
<10, (14, 16, 28)>
<11, (21, 25, 29)>
<13, (4, 20, 23)>
<15, (14, 27, 29)>
<20, (9, 13, 25)>
<21, (11, 18, 29)>
<23, (0, 8, 13)>
<24, (4, 17, 10)>
<25, (11, 18, 21)>
<26, (16, 24, 29)>
<28, (13, 14, 19)>
<29, (6, 15, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
