Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 10) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 0) (7, 0) (7, 11) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 10) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 12) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 9) 

Response:
There are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 13, 4)>
<1, (0, 9, 13)>
<1, (9, 8, 4)>
<3, (1, 8, 6)>
<8, (3, 12, 14)>
<13, (1, 5, 10)>
<4, (1, 8, 14)>
<5, (13, 11, 10)>
<0, (1, 14, 10)>
