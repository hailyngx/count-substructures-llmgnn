Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
[<0, (9, 1, 8)>, <1, (7, 6, 0)>, <2, (6, 8, 0)>, <3, (7, 6, 8)>]
