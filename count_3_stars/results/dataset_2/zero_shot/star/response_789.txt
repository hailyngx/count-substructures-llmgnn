Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (9, 1, 10)>
<9, (6, 8, 12)>
<4, (9, 12, 2)>
