Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs can be determined by counting the number of nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Since each 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, the center node in each 3-star must be connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

By examining the list of edges, we can identify the unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (5, 4, 2)>
<1, (5, 3, 2)>
<3, (5, 6, 1)>
<8, (7, 1, 3)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 2, 0)>
<2, (9, 7, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [10].
