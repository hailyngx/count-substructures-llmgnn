Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 13) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 7) (14, 9) (14, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 6, 11)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 13)>
<4, (3, 9, 13)>
<5, (2, 5, 12)>
<6, (1, 7, 10)>
<7, (0, 9, 14)>
<8, (2, 8, 12)>
<9, (4, 8, 9)>
<10, (6, 7, 10)>
<11, (1, 3, 13)>
<12, (0, 2, 12)>
