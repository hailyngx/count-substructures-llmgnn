Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in this graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <5, (9, 6, 2)> and <3, (7, 4, 8)>.
