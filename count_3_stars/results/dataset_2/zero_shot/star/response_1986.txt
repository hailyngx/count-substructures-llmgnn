Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 18) (9, 2) (9, 12) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 18) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 18) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 16) (1, 16) (1, 14) (15, 19) (15, 7) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 17) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 4) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 18) (7, 10) (7, 15) (7, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 12) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 17) (13, 0) (13, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (9, 3, 8)>
<3, (11, 16, 2)>
<4, (0, 6, 13)>
<5, (12, 18, 8)>
<6, (19, 0, 4)>
<7, (10, 15, 13)>
<8, (2, 17, 16)>
<9, (2, 12, 14)>
<10, (7, 18, 14)>
<11, (3, 18, 16)>
<12, (5, 9, 14)>
<13, (0, 7, 6)>
<14, (1, 10, 12)>
<15, (7, 19, 10)>
<16, (8, 3, 17)>
<17, (8, 18, 16)>
<18, (10, 11, 17)>
<19, (2, 15, 6)>

Therefore, there are [19] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
