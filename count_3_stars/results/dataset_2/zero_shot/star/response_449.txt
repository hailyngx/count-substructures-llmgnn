Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 13) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 18) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (4, 12) (4, 17) (18, 6) (18, 17) (19, 8) (19, 15) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 14) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 2) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 15) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 18) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 14) (14, 16) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10)
