Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 11) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 2) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 2) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 

<5, (9, 8, 6)>
<13, (8, 4, 2)>
<6, (5, 1, 14)>
<1, (8, 6, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
