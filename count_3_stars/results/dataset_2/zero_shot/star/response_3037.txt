Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 8) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 12) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 9) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 8) (8, 15) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 9) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 12) (4, 9) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 11) (6, 0) (6, 16) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 16) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 13) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 14) (16, 9) (5, 10) (11, 17) (11, 12) (11, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 9, 16)>
<4, (9, 11, 12)>
<8, (7, 14, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
