Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 7) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 13) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 18) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 15) (8, 5) (8, 2) (4, 13) (4, 1) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 7) (1, 17) (1, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 19) (0, 16) (0, 3) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 13) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 19) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 15) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 16) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 10, 16)>
<1, (4, 13, 17)>
<2, (8, 14, 19)>
<5, (6, 18, 16)>
<9, (11, 13, 14)>
<19, (2, 12, 15)>
