Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
