Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of nodes that have exactly three adjacent nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

The nodes with exactly three adjacent nodes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 14.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<1, (3, 8, 13)>
<2, (9, 10, 11)>
<3, (1, 0, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 12)>
<5, (9, 10, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (5, 1, 2)>
<10, (5, 9, 11)>
<11, (10, 2, 12)>
<12, (5, 11, 13)>
<14, (1, 0, 4)>

In total, there are [11] 3-stars in the given graph.
