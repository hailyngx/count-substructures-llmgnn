Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 18) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 12) (3, 18) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 2) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 15) (0, 8) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 4) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 12) (16, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 19) (17, 11) (15, 5) (19, 3) (19, 2) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 4) (18, 13) (18, 3) (18, 14) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 14) (1, 12) 

Response:
There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [10].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<6, (9, 14, 11)>
<9, (6, 10, 16)>
<13, (8, 5, 12)>
<3, (11, 19, 12)>
<11, (6, 3, 7)>
<5, (13, 2, 15)>
<0, (8, 10, 4)>
<12, (13, 3, 16)>
<16, (9, 8, 12)>
<18, (13, 3, 14)>
