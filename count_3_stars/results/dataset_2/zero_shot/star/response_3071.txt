Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 18) (3, 4) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 9) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 19) (8, 2) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 2) (14, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 18) (4, 13) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 12) (16, 1) (16, 13) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 17) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 19) (7, 11) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 17) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 9) (17, 7) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (10, 14, 17)>
<1, (4, 13, 16)>
<2, (10, 14, 18)>
