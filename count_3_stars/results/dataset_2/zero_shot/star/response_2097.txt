Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<9, (6, 4, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>
<3, (5, 6, 1)>
<8, (5, 3, 4)>
<4, (9, 6, 1)>
<2, (1, 5, 3)>
<0, (9, 6, 7)>
