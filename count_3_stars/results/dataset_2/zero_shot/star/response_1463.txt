Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 19) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (19, 0) (19, 5) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 15) (10, 8) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 18) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 6) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 13) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 9) (7, 18) (12, 16) (12, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 13) (17, 4) (2, 16) (2, 4) (4, 11) (4, 17) (4, 2) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 13) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 12) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 18) 

Response:
There are a total of [32] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
