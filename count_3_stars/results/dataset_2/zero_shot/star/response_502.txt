Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is inside brackets [].

<5, (9, 1, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>
<4, (8, 6, 1)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
