Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 14) (8, 10) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 18) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 17) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 17) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 14) (19, 2) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 16) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (16, 7) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 18) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 15) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 7) (2, 3) (2, 19) (15, 0) (15, 7) (15, 17) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 9) (9, 17) (9, 10) (18, 13) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 17) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<1, (3, 5, 13)>
<3, (1, 5, 12)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (0, 15, 17)>
<8, (10, 13, 14)>
<10, (8, 13, 4)>
<12, (3, 4, 16)>
<13, (1, 10, 18)>
