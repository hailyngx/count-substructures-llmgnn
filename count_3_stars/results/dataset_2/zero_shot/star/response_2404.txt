Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (11, 14) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 11) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 10) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-star configurations are:
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
<6, (9, 10, 8)>
<1, (3, 14, 10)>
<3, (1, 7, 13)>
<8, (5, 6, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
