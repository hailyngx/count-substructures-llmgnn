Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 1) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 11) (2, 6) (2, 18) (2, 11) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 3) (5, 8) (5, 14) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 19) (15, 9) (15, 12) (4, 13) (4, 16) (12, 17) (12, 15) (12, 8) (19, 14) (19, 16) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 1) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (3, 18) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 18) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
