Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (9, 4, 7)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 1)>
<3, (9, 8, 0)>
<4, (6, 0, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (5, 2, 1)>
<8, (9, 8, 7)>
<9, (0, 8, 9)>
<10, (4, 6, 0)>
<11, (0, 4, 3)>
