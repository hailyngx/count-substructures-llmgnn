Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 6) (8, 18) (13, 2) (13, 0) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 14) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 17) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 1) (15, 10) (15, 14) (7, 16) (7, 1) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 2) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 12) (6, 4) (17, 19) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 9) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 19) (11, 1) (11, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 2) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 3) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 3) (14, 5) (14, 15) (14, 1) (18, 8) (18, 6) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 4) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [5].
The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (4, 6, 14)>
<10, (1, 12, 15)>
<16, (2, 3, 17)>
<6, (8, 18, 12)>
<17, (6, 9, 19)>
