Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
