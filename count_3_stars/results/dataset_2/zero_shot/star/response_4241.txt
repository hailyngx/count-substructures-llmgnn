Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 16) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 9) (17, 2) (17, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 13) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 5) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 5) (10, 0) (10, 18) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 19) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 7) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 16) (8, 15) (8, 12) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 5) (18, 3) (18, 10) (18, 16) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 16) (4, 6) (4, 17) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (3, 1, 16)>
<0, (3, 10, 13)>
<12, (8, 14, 0)>
<9, (6, 17, 16)>
<1, (15, 2, 5)>
<13, (11, 0, 16)>
<17, (2, 9, 4)>
<18, (3, 10, 16)>
<16, (13, 9, 18)>
<6, (4, 9, 16)>
<14, (8, 12, 19)>
<15, (5, 1, 8)>
