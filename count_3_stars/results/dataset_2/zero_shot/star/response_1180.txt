Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 12) (15, 24) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 26) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 25) (7, 4) (7, 20) (7, 28) (7, 23) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 28) (22, 2) (3, 24) (3, 16) (12, 15) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 26) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 25) (21, 15) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 25) (28, 7) (28, 18) (28, 21) (28, 20) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 19) (26, 27) (26, 12) (9, 25) (10, 21) (10, 13) (8, 14) (8, 1) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 29) (16, 18) (16, 3) (16, 21) (17, 0) (17, 23) (25, 4) (25, 14) (25, 21) (25, 9) (2, 22) (2, 14) (2, 11) (6, 12) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 23) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 1) (5, 23) (5, 29) (23, 7) (23, 17) (23, 1) (23, 5) (23, 29) (29, 19) (29, 5) (29, 23) (20, 7) (20, 28) (20, 24) (24, 15) (24, 3) (24, 20) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding the number of nodes that can be the center of a 3-star. In this case, any node with exactly 3 neighbors can be the center of a 3-star.

There are 30 nodes in the graph, and the degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 1
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 5
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 2
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 3
- Node 20: degree 3
- Node 21: degree 5
- Node 22: degree 1
- Node 23: degree 5
- Node 24: degree 3
- Node 25: degree 4
- Node 26: degree 2
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 4
- Node 29: degree 3

Therefore, the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star are: 4, 7, 11, 12, 13, 21, 23, and 28. Each of these nodes can be paired with 3 of its neighbors to form a unique 3-star.

So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [32], and the unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 18, 25)>
<7, (4, 20, 28)>
<11, (1, 2, 19)>
<12, (15, 27, 6)>
<13, (1, 10, 19)>
<21, (15, 28, 10)>
<23, (7, 17, 5)>
<28, (7, 18, 20)>
