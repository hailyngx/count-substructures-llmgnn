Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 17) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 15) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 12) (6, 9) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (5, 10) (5, 14) (18, 15) (18, 16) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 16) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 19) (17, 11) (17, 9) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 15) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 19) (0, 1) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 13)>
<8, (11, 13, 14)>
<10, (5, 7, 13)>
<13, (1, 10, 8)>
<14, (5, 8, 9)>
<15, (6, 8, 18)>
