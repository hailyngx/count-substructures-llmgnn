Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 18) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 10) (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 15) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 16) (11, 6) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 12) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 7) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 10) (7, 2) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 16) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 18) (4, 9) (4, 17) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (12, 19) (12, 10) (12, 18) (18, 8) (18, 17) (18, 16) (18, 12) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is as follows:

[<1, (8, 13, 15)>, <2, (0, 7, 17)>, <3, (8, 14, 16)>, <4, (9, 14, 17)>, <5, (14, 15, 19)>, <6, (9, 11, 13)>, <7, (2, 10, 16)>, <8, (1, 3, 18)>, <9, (4, 6, 10)>, <13, (1, 6, 10)>, <16, (3, 7, 18)>, <17, (2, 4, 7)>, <18, (8, 12, 16)>, <19, (5, 12, 15)>]

There are [14] 3-stars in total.
