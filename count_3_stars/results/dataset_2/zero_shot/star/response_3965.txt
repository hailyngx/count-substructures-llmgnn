Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 16) (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 0) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 18) (5, 3) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 19) (2, 9) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 6) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 2) (13, 17) (13, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 9) (18, 8) (16, 15) (16, 17) (16, 12) (7, 15) (7, 14) (7, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 12) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars are <3, (15, 6, 19)>, <15, (3, 10, 7)>, <7, (15, 14, 13)>, <9, (14, 10, 2)>, <4, (8, 12, 19)>, and <8, (4, 1, 18)>.
