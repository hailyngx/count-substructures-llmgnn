Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (5, 7, 3)>
<4, (1, 8, 3)>
<8, (0, 7, 4)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
