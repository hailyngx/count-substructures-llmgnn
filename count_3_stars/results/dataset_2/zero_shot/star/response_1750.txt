Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (3, 2) (15, 9) (15, 5) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 0) (4, 13) (8, 11) (8, 18) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 13) (18, 8) (18, 11) (19, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 1) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 11) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 9) (0, 17) (0, 1) (9, 15) (9, 16) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 1) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
