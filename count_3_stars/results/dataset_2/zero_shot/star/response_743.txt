Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 13) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 6) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 14) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 8, 3)>
<3, (1, 4, 13)>
<7, (0, 9, 13)>
<9, (11, 7, 8)>
<10, (6, 13, 12)>
<13, (3, 0, 12)>
