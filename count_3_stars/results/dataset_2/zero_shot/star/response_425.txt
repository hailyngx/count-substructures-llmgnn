Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 15) (17, 11) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 14) (0, 6) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 9) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 19) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 9) (16, 2) (1, 5) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (11, 17) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 2) (9, 19) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 3) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 7) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 1) (18, 15) (13, 19) (13, 4) (2, 16) (2, 11) (15, 17) (15, 18) 

Response:
[4]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (6, 14, 17)>, <5, (1, 8, 18)>, <7, (3, 10, 11)>, <9, (3, 12, 19)>
