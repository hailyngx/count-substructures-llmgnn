Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 11) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 12) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 10) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<0, (6, 9, 8)>
<1, (14, 7, 1)>
<2, (6, 5, 2)>
<4, (8, 10, 4)>
<5, (6, 2, 5)>
<7, (6, 9, 7)>
<8, (10, 12, 8)>
<9, (6, 11, 9)>
<10, (9, 4, 10)>
<11, (9, 5, 11)>
<12, (5, 10, 12)>
<14, (6, 11, 14)>

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
