Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations in this graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 8)>
