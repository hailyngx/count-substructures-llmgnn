Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 9) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 9) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 11) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 15) (2, 4) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 12) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 18) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 8) (12, 4) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 6) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 15) (18, 9) (18, 15) (15, 2) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 17) (19, 15) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 15) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (3, 11, 13)>
<10, (17, 4, 9)>
<17, (10, 19, 11)>
<4, (2, 12, 6)>
