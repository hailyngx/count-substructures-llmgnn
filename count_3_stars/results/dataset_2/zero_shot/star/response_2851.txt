Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<5, (6, 1, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 0)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<7, (9, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 0)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (9, 0, 3)>
<1, (5, 6, 0)>
