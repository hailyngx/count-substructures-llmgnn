Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
<5, (6, 1, 7)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<6, (5, 9, 8)>
<1, (5, 3, 2)>
<3, (1, 0, 4)>
<4, (9, 6, 3)>
<8, (6, 1, 7)>
<0, (6, 3, 4)>
<2, (9, 1, 7)>
<7, (5, 1, 8)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the count of 3-stars is [10].
