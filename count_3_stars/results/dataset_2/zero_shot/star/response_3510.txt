Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (9, 17) (9, 19) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 15) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 18) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 6) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 15) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 6) (6, 14) (6, 11) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 15) (16, 3) (16, 17) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 2) (15, 17) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 19) (18, 8) (18, 12) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 10) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:

<4, (7, 13, 0)>
<1, (3, 13, 10)>
<3, (1, 14, 16)>
<7, (4, 12, 15)>
<12, (5, 7, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
