Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 12) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 13) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 13) (18, 22) (18, 28) (18, 29) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 7) (2, 11) (2, 4) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 9) (6, 28) (6, 17) (28, 18) (28, 6) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 26) (29, 18) (29, 23) (26, 22) (26, 17) (26, 13) (26, 5) (13, 25) (13, 20) (13, 26) (13, 19) (13, 27) (8, 21) (8, 12) (21, 8) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 24) (10, 15) (10, 21) (10, 9) (11, 2) (11, 23) (11, 4) (23, 29) (23, 11) (23, 4) (27, 25) (27, 13) (27, 5) (16, 17) (16, 21) (16, 14) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 23) (4, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 0) (5, 26) (5, 27) (7, 3) (7, 22) (7, 1) (19, 15) (19, 13) (14, 22) (14, 16) (14, 9) (24, 21) (24, 0) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 14) (1, 7) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 24) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star structures in the given graph is [11]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (7, 12, 8)>
<25, (20, 27, 13)>
<20, (25, 15, 13)>
<18, (22, 28, 29)>
<22, (18, 26, 14)>
<2, (11, 4, 12)>
<15, (20, 10, 19)>
<6, (28, 17, 0)>
<17, (6, 16, 0)>
<29, (18, 23, 0)>
<1, (7, 22, 0)>
