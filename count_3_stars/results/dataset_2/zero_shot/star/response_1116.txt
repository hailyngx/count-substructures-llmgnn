Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

<6, (5, 1, 8)>
<1, (9, 3, 6)>
<3, (9, 1, 7)>
<4, (9, 3, 7)>
<0, (6, 4, 7)>
