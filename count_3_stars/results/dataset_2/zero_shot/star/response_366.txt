Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (7, 6, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 0)>
