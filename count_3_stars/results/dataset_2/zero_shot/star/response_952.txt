Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 9) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:

<4, (7, 5, 1)>
<7, (4, 12, 0)>
<10, (11, 8, 1)>
<11, (4, 10, 9)>
<8, (10, 13, 2)>
<13, (8, 9, 14)>
<12, (7, 8, 6)>
<2, (10, 5, 0)>
<5, (4, 2, 6)>
<6, (7, 13, 12)>
<0, (7, 2, 14)>
<1, (4, 10, 9)>
<3, (7, 2, 14)>
<9, (4, 11, 13)>
<14, (4, 13, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
