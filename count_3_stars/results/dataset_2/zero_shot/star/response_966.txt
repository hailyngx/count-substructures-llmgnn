Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (9, 7, 2)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 1, 7)>
<7, (6, 9, 3)>
<2, (9, 8, 1)>
<8, (9, 3, 2)>
