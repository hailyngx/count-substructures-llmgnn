Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 19) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 12) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 11) (18, 12) (6, 2) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (10, 0) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 12) (19, 16) (19, 15) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 15) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 6) (1, 8) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 14) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 3) (13, 6) (13, 15) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (4, 7, 14)>
<6, (2, 13, 15)>
<9, (4, 12, 17)>
<15, (10, 13, 14)>
