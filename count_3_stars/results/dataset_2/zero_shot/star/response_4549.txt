Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 6) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<1, (3, 11, 14)>
