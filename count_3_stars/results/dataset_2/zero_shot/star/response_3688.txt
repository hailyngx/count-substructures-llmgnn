Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 10) (2, 0) (2, 10) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 17) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 17) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 7) (19, 4) (19, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 17) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 14) (6, 18) (16, 17) (4, 1) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 19) (9, 10) (9, 4) (7, 13) (7, 18) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 2, 10)>
<1, (17, 4, 19)>
<4, (1, 17, 9)>
<5, (13, 12, 17)>
<9, (1, 3, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
