Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (9, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (6, 3, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
