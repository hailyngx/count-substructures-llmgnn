Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<4, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (9, 4, 0)>
<2, (2, 7, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
