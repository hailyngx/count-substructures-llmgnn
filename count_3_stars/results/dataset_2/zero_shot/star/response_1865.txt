Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 0) 

Response:
[8]
Unique 3-stars: <<1, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (6, 10, 14)>, <4, (5, 11, 13)>, <5, (4, 10, 12)>, <8, (2, 9, 14)>, <9, (10, 14, 8)>, <12, (0, 4, 5)>, <13, (4, 11, 12)>>
