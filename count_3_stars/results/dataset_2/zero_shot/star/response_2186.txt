Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars: 
<9, (7, 4, 0)>
<4, (7, 9, 1)>
<7, (9, 4, 1)>
<1, (9, 7, 3)>
<3, (6, 9, 1)>
<0, (7, 4, 5)>
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
