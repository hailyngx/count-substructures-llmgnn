Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
