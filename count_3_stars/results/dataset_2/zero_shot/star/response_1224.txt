Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 0)>
<0, (4, 0, 7)>
<0, (4, 0, 5)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (6, 3, 4)>
<2, (6, 3, 0)>
<4, (8, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 5, 6)>
