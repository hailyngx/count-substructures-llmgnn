Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 28) (17, 18) (6, 9) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 2) (9, 16) (22, 11) (22, 0) (22, 29) (23, 19) (23, 15) (23, 29) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 21) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (1, 26) (1, 15) (1, 29) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 7) (2, 9) (2, 12) (21, 4) (21, 28) (21, 19) (28, 17) (28, 21) (28, 5) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 5) (20, 17) (20, 3) (15, 23) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 11) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 7) (19, 23) (19, 21) (18, 17) (18, 26) (7, 6) (7, 26) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 7) (12, 2) (12, 29) (11, 22) (11, 15) (11, 24) (24, 11) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 25) (29, 22) (29, 23) (29, 1) (29, 12) (25, 14) (25, 9) (25, 24) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 24) (0, 22) (0, 8) (0, 24) (27, 10) 

Response:
There are a total of [**10**] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (8, 13, 16)>
<9, (6, 2, 25)>
<15, (1, 10, 11)>
<17, (14, 18, 20)>
<21, (4, 19, 28)>
<22, (0, 11, 29)>
<23, (15, 19, 29)>
<26, (1, 7, 18)>
<28, (5, 17, 21)>
<29, (12, 1, 22)>
