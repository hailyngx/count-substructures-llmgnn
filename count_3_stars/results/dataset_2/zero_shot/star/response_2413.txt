Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<6, (9, 8, 5)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
<4, (9, 0, 1)>
<8, (9, 2, 7)>
<5, (6, 2, 1)>
<2, (8, 5, 7)>
<1, (6, 4, 5)>
<7, (6, 9, 3)>
