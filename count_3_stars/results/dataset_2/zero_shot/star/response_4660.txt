Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 2)>
<1, (5, 7, 3)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
