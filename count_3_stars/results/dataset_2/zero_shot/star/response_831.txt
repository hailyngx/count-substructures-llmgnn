Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 12) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 10) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 13) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 10) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of [15] unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 2, 11)>
<6, (3, 2, 4)>
<13, (6, 12, 4)>
<4, (5, 6, 13)>
<2, (9, 6, 8)>
<0, (8, 7, 11)>
<14, (4, 11, 10)>
<7, (9, 0, 11)>
<12, (13, 2, 10)>
<11, (9, 13, 0)>
<3, (5, 6, 13)>
<1, (12, 11, 10)>
<10, (5, 14, 12)>
