Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 2) (14, 3) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 14) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 5) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 19) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 5) (18, 14) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 0) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 10) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (2, 15) (2, 9) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 12) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by analyzing the connections each node has. 

Let's count the number of 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 16: <16, (11, 1, 15)>.
2. Node 11: <11, (16, 5, 1)>.
3. Node 3: <3, (15, 17, 14)>.
4. Node 15: <15, (3, 16, 2)>.
5. Node 14: <14, (3, 17, 18)>.
6. Node 17: <17, (3, 14, 18)>.
7. Node 6: <6, (9, 10, 19)>.
8. Node 9: <9, (6, 19, 2)>.
9. Node 1: <1, (16, 4, 8)>.
10. Node 8: <8, (1, 13, 6)>.
11. Node 13: <13, (8, 0, 0)>.
12. Node 4: <4, (1, 10, 5)>.
13. Node 0: <0, (13, 7, 19)>.
14. Node 7: <7, (14, 5, 0)>.
15. Node 18: <18, (14, 17, 0)>.
16. Node 19: <19, (6, 9, 0)>.
17. Node 12: <12, (16, 14, 10)>.
18. Node 5: <5, (11, 4, 7)>.
19. Node 2: <2, (15, 9, 0)>.
20. Node 10: <10, (16, 6, 4)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
