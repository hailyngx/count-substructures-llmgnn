Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is represented as [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 0)>
<1, (5, 4, 0)>
<3, (7, 2, 5)>
<5, (6, 1, 3)>
<8, (6, 3, 2)>
