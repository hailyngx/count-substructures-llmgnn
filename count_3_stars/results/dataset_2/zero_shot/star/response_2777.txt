Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 2) (11, 19) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 14) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 3) (16, 15) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (9, 0) (9, 19) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 13) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 16) (15, 19) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 13) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 12) (3, 18) (3, 13) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 18) (13, 4) (13, 16) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

<0, (8, 9, 19)>
<1, (5, 6, 2)>
<2, (10, 12, 1)>
<3, (7, 16, 12)>
<4, (8, 13, 14)>
<13, (4, 16, 18)>
<14, (6, 7, 4)>
<16, (17, 13, 15)>
