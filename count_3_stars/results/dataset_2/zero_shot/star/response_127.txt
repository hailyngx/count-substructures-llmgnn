Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 14) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 2) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 10) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (9, 3, 10)>
<9, (5, 6, 11)>
<6, (9, 2, 8)>
<13, (9, 2, 14)>
<12, (9, 7, 4)>
