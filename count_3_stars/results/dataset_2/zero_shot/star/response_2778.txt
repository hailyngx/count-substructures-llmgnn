Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 23) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 25) (15, 24) (15, 11) (14, 17) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 9) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 27) (10, 20) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 27) (2, 3) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 9) (29, 17) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 18) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 22) (27, 10) (27, 11) (27, 12) (27, 1) (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 26) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 26) (19, 21) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 20) (6, 12) (6, 20) (6, 13) (28, 9) (28, 23) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 24) (5, 21) (13, 6) (13, 5) (1, 17) (1, 27) (1, 0) (18, 29) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 25) (16, 8) (16, 0) (22, 12) (9, 17) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 28) (9, 25) (25, 15) (25, 14) (25, 0) (25, 9) (21, 19) (21, 5) (24, 15) (24, 7) (24, 5) (20, 10) (20, 26) (20, 6) (23, 3) (23, 28) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<2, (3, 9, 29)>, <5, (12, 13, 24)>, <7, (4, 8, 24)>, <10, (11, 20, 27)>, <15, (3, 11, 25)>, <17, (14, 1, 29)>
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
