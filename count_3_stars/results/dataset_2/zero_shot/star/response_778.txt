Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 4) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 8) (2, 14) (2, 9) (2, 4) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 3) (11, 8) (5, 4) (19, 4) (19, 1) (1, 19) (1, 6) (1, 18) (1, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 8) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (12, 17) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 13) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 18) (15, 0) (15, 9) (9, 2) (9, 15) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 19) (13, 10) (13, 16) (13, 18) (18, 0) (18, 1) (18, 7) (18, 13) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <8, (17, 4, 6)>, <4, (2, 17, 19)>
