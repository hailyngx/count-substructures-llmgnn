Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 18) (7, 9) (7, 0) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 8) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 7) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 6) (10, 16) (10, 14) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 13) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 16) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (12, 18) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 19) (16, 10) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 8) (3, 13) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 14) (8, 18) (8, 16) (19, 12) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 13, 4)>
<9, (5, 15, 17)>
<4, (5, 18, 1)>
<13, (5, 17, 2)>
<0, (7, 6, 1)>
<6, (1, 15, 2)>
<12, (18, 16, 19)>
<10, (16, 14, 6)>
<11, (14, 2, 11)>
<3, (13, 2, 3)>
