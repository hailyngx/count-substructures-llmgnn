Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<9, (8, 4, 1)>
<4, (6, 9, 7)>
<2, (8, 4, 5)>
