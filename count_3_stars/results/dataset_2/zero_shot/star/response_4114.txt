Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 12) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 0) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 0) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 12) 

Response:
[<0, (9, 13, 0)>, <1, (4, 1, 5)>, <2, (6, 2, 0)>, <3, (7, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 4, 11)>, <5, (6, 5, 1)>, <6, (12, 6, 11)>, <7, (14, 7, 13)>, <8, (9, 8, 3)>, <9, (0, 9, 13)>, <10, (0, 10, 5)>, <11, (12, 11, 4)>, <12, (8, 12, 6)>, <13, (0, 13, 7)>, <14, (10, 14, 7)>]
