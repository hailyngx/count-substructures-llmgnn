Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below:
<0, (1, 9, 4)>
<1, (0, 7, 6)>
<2, (9, 3, 7)>
<3, (9, 2, 1)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (6, 3, 0)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
