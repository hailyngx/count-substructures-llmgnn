Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 17) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (2, 18) (2, 0) (2, 15) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 8) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 19) (17, 8) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 19) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 13) (10, 15) (10, 8) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 10) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 17) (8, 10) (19, 17) (19, 3) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 6) (14, 5) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 14) (6, 18) (6, 16) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is shown below:
[4]

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (12, 1, 9)>
<18, (2, 8, 6)>
<0, (15, 1, 16)>
<11, (3, 9, 13)>
