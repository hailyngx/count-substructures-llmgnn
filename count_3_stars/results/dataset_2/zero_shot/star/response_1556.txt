Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 21) (0, 27) (0, 15) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 3) (27, 20) (27, 5) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 12) (9, 0) (9, 6) (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 23) (22, 5) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 23) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 25) (12, 6) (12, 20) (12, 13) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 29) (28, 3) (28, 8) (13, 12) (26, 18) (26, 25) (26, 8) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 2) (29, 4) (29, 1) (29, 8) (29, 23) (3, 27) (3, 17) (3, 28) (3, 21) (21, 16) (21, 25) (21, 3) (21, 19) (8, 11) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 29) (23, 18) (23, 10) (23, 29) (23, 15) (24, 11) (24, 5) (24, 15) (1, 25) (1, 29) (1, 19) (2, 25) (20, 27) (20, 12) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 23) (15, 24) (5, 27) (5, 22) (5, 24) (19, 21) (19, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding nodes with exactly three edges and then counting the number of ways these nodes can form 3-stars. 

Upon examining the edges in the graph, we find the following nodes with exactly three edges: 11, 16, 0, 27, 6, 9, 14, 17, 18, 22, 10, 7, 12, 4, 28, 13, 26, 1, 2, 19, and 20.

Counting the number of 3-stars starting from each of these nodes yields the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (27, 15, 9)>
<1, (25, 29, 19)>
<2, (25, 21, 5)>
<3, (27, 21, 28)>
<4, (18, 29, 14)>
<5, (24, 22, 5)>
<6, (15, 12, 9)>
<7, (25, 10, 11)>
<8, (29, 26, 8)>
<10, (23, 17, 10)>
<12, (13, 20, 6)>
<13, (12, 8, 28)>
<14, (18, 29, 4)>
<15, (23, 15, 24)>
<16, (11, 21, 16)>
<17, (14, 10, 3)>
<18, (4, 23, 18)>
<19, (1, 21, 19)>
<20, (27, 12, 20)>
<21, (25, 19, 3)>
<22, (5, 24, 22)>
<23, (18, 15, 23)>
<25, (21, 1, 25)>
<26, (29, 8, 26)>
<27, (20, 0, 27)>
<28, (8, 13, 28)>
<29, (4, 8, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27].
