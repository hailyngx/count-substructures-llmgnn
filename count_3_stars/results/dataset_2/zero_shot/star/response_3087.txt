Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 12) (7, 10) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 8) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. 

[3]

<5, (9, 13, 2)>
<9, (5, 6, 0)>
<12, (7, 2, 13)>
