Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 10) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 13, 6)>
<9, (5, 14, 10)>
<4, (8, 14, 11)>
<7, (5, 9, 13)>
<8, (4, 10, 11)>
<6, (5, 10, 13)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
