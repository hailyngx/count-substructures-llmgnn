Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 17) (10, 7) (10, 2) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 5) (2, 10) (18, 16) (18, 3) (18, 13) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 11) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 1) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 19) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 14) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 15) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 11) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 11) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 5) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 3) (3, 18) (3, 0) (14, 15) (14, 13) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 1) (13, 18) (13, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (0, 9, 17)>
<9, (4, 6, 17)>
<17, (5, 6, 9)>
<7, (8, 10, 19)>
<15, (0, 8, 19)>
