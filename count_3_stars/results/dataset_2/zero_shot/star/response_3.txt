Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 12) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 12) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (6, 11) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 14) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are <0, (5, 11, 2)> and <1, (3, 7, 12)>.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
