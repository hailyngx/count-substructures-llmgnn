Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
