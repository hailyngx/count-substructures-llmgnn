Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 8) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 4) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 6) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 6) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (6, 11, 14)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<10, (2, 11, 14)>
<11, (0, 4, 13)>
<13, (0, 6, 8)>
<14, (2, 10, 1)>
