Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 2) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 18) (1, 3) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 12) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 15) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 2) (7, 3) (12, 10) (12, 15) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 2) (4, 14) (4, 6) (15, 11) (15, 13) (15, 12) (19, 16) (19, 6) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 19)
