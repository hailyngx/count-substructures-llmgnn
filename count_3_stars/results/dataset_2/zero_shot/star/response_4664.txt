Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 10) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are 7 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed within <>:

<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 11)>
<7, (1, 6, 11)>
<1, (5, 6, 10)>
<3, (5, 10, 13)>
<8, (10, 11, 13)>
<2, (4, 9, 14)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
