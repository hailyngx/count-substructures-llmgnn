Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 3) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [11] 3-star configurations in the given graph.

Unique 3-star configurations:
<0, (8, 7, 11)>
<1, (5, 13, 14)>
<2, (5, 13, 10)>
<3, (0, 4, 14)>
<4, (12, 6, 10)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<6, (6, 5, 10)>
<7, (9, 0, 7)>
<8, (9, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 9, 14)>
<10, (5, 6, 10)>
