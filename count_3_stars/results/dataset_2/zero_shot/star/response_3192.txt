Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 18) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 8) (0, 4) (0, 18) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 10) (1, 17) (1, 7) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (17, 7) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 8) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 12) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 18) (8, 14) (8, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 2) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 10) (7, 1) (7, 17) (2, 10) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 13) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

<0, (4, 10, 18)>
<6, (9, 8, 12)>
<9, (3, 6, 16)>
<13, (4, 12, 17)>
