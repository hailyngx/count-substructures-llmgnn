Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is as follows:

[4]

<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
