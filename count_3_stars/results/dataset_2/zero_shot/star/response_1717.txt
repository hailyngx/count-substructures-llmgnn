Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (1, 4, 2)>
<9, (6, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 9, 3)>
<4, (9, 8, 2)>
