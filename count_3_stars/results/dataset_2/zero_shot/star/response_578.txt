Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 5) (16, 12) (16, 6) (16, 9) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 2) (4, 13) (4, 2) (18, 10) (18, 13) (17, 9) (17, 19) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 2) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 15) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 14) (14, 19) (14, 6) (12, 16) (12, 15) (12, 9) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 15) (6, 16) (6, 14) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 8) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 18) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (11, 5, 10)>
<5, (11, 15, 8)>
<9, (16, 12, 17)>
<10, (11, 3, 19)>
<12, (16, 15, 9)>
<13, (1, 4, 18)>
<14, (6, 16, 19)>
<15, (5, 12, 8)>
<16, (6, 12, 9)>
<17, (9, 16, 19)>
<18, (10, 13, 19)>
<19, (10, 7, 17)>
