Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations in this given graph. Let's find and count them:

1. <5, (9, 2, 1)>
2. <5, (9, 7, 8)>
3. <5, (6, 2, 8)>
4. <9, (5, 2, 3)>
5. <9, (7, 3, 7)>
6. <4, (7, 1, 6)>
7. <7, (5, 9, 4)>
8. <7, (4, 0, 6)>
9. <1, (5, 4, 8)>
10. <3, (9, 0, 6)>
11. <6, (5, 4, 8)>
12. <2, (5, 9, 8)>
13. <8, (5, 7, 1)>
14. <0, (7, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
