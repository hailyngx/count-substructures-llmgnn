Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 9, 1)>
<6, (4, 2, 1)>
<9, (6, 3, 1)>
<0, (6, 2, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 3)>
