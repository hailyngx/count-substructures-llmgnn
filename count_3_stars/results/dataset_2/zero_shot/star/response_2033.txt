Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which can be represented as:

<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (9, 1, 7)>
<7, (4, 0, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
