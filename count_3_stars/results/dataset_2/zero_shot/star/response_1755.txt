Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star structures in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (5, 8, 9)>
