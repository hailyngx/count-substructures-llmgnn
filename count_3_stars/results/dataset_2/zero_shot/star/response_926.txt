Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 6) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 13) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
The 3-star graph can be identified by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

There are 15 nodes in total, which can potentially be the central node of a 3-star.
Checking each node:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 3, and 14. It forms a 3-star: <5, (9, 8, 3)>.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 4, 11, and 10. It forms a 3-star: <9, (5, 8, 4)>.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 3. It forms a 3-star: <4, (9, 7, 3)>.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 1, and 0. It forms a 3-star: <7, (4, 8, 1)>.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 12, 13, and 2. It forms a 3-star: <0, (7, 12, 13)>.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, and 11. It forms a 3-star: <8, (5, 9, 7)>.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 6, 14, 10, and 13. It forms a 3-star: <1, (7, 6, 14)>.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 11, 1, 2, 12, and 13. It forms a 3-star: <6, (11, 1, 2)>.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 0, 6, and 14. It forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 0, 6)>.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 3, 0, and 6. It forms a 3-star: <12, (3, 0, 6)>.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 13. It forms a 3-star: <10, (9, 1, 13)>.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 1, and 2. It forms a 3-star: <14, (5, 3, 1)>.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 10. It forms a 3-star: <13, (0, 1, 6)>.

Therefore, there are 13 unique 3-stars in the graph, which can be represented as listed above.
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
