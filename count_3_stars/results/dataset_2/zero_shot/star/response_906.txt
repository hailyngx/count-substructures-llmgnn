Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 1) (0, 27) (0, 23) (0, 1) (27, 0) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 29) (3, 25) (3, 26) (3, 22) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 26) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 15) (6, 16) (9, 10) (9, 25) (9, 18) (22, 3) (23, 0) (23, 16) (23, 28) (23, 19) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 28) (21, 20) (21, 29) (28, 23) (28, 13) (28, 12) (28, 2) (15, 10) (15, 17) (15, 5) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 1) (26, 3) (26, 25) (26, 2) (2, 28) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 20) (24, 8) (24, 5) (24, 29) (29, 11) (29, 21) (29, 24) (12, 8) (12, 28) (12, 20) (12, 5) (12, 14) (20, 21) (20, 2) (20, 12) (20, 5) (19, 4) (19, 23) (19, 2) (5, 15) (5, 24) (5, 12) (5, 20) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 12) (16, 6) (16, 23) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 18) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
<0, (27, 23, 1)>
<1, (4, 7, 18)>
<2, (28, 19, 26)>
<3, (25, 22, 26)>
<4, (1, 7, 17)>
<5, (24, 20, 12)>
<6, (16, 23, 6)>
<8, (13, 12, 24)>
<9, (10, 25, 18)>
<10, (15, 17, 9)>
<11, (29, 21, 24)>
<13, (8, 28, 12)>
<14, (18, 7, 12)>
<15, (5, 17, 10)>
<16, (6, 23, 16)>
<19, (2, 23, 28)>
<20, (21, 2, 5)>
<21, (29, 20, 21)>
<22, (3, 25, 26)>
<24, (5, 29, 8)>
<25, (9, 26, 3)>
<26, (3, 25, 2)>
<27, (0, 23, 1)>
<28, (2, 13, 12)>
<29, (11, 24, 21)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].
