Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 22) (27, 18) (4, 7) (4, 25) (4, 11) (4, 29) (7, 4) (7, 29) (7, 10) (7, 22) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 29) (22, 27) (22, 7) (22, 18) (22, 23) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 5) (20, 25) (20, 10) (25, 4) (25, 20) (25, 8) (25, 0) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 6) (0, 25) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 14) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (1, 14) (1, 17) (1, 26) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 21) (3, 11) (3, 28) (3, 29) (11, 4) (11, 3) (16, 17) (16, 21) (28, 3) (8, 14) (8, 25) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) (19, 14) (21, 27) (21, 26) (21, 16) (21, 12) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 10) (29, 4) (29, 7) (29, 18) (29, 3) (29, 24) (24, 29) (24, 12) (12, 21) (12, 24) (13, 2) (13, 10) (6, 23) (6, 0) (10, 7) (10, 20) (10, 5) (10, 13) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the final answer is [4].
The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 11, 29)>
<7, (4, 22, 29)>
<22, (7, 18, 23)>
<29, (4, 7, 18)>
