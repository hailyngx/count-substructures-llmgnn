Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<5, (9, 1, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<6, (5, 1, 0)>
<4, (8, 2, 7)>
<7, (4, 3, 1)>
<8, (9, 4, 1)>
<2, (9, 4, 3)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (9, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
