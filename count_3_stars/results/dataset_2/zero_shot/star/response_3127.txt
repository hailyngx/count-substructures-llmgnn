Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 18) (15, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (10, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 2) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 8) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 12) (4, 15) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (9, 17) (9, 4) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 17) (12, 11) (19, 7) (19, 16) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 16) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 8) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 2) (14, 5) (14, 7) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 18) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (11, 12, 17)>
<1, (4, 8, 11)>
<2, (7, 13, 16)>
<3, (18, 0, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 14)>
<6, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 14, 18)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
