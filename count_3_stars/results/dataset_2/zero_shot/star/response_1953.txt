Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (8, 4, 3)>
<6, (9, 1, 2)>
