Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 14) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 4) (16, 20) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 20) (13, 22) (13, 2) (22, 13) (22, 14) (22, 15) (22, 12) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 27) (26, 29) (26, 21) (26, 3) (26, 27) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 17) (17, 1) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 18) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 28) (23, 11) (23, 5) (25, 11) (25, 21) (25, 15) (14, 11) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 29) (28, 8) (18, 9) (18, 0) (3, 26) (3, 0) (3, 27) (24, 2) (24, 29) (19, 4) (20, 16) (20, 9) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 10) (12, 22) (12, 20) (12, 15) (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 12) (4, 16) (4, 21) (4, 19) (4, 10) (29, 26) (29, 14) (29, 24) (10, 20) (10, 4) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 24) (2, 27) (27, 6) (27, 26) (27, 3) (27, 2) 

Response:
There are 8 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<11, (16, 23, 14)>
<16, (11, 1, 4)>
<5, (9, 6, 23)>
<9, (5, 18, 20)>
<13, (22, 2, 15)>
<22, (13, 14, 15)>
<6, (5, 14, 27)>
<26, (29, 21, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
