Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 2, 7)>
<5, (9, 2, 0)>
<5, (9, 7, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 3, 1)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
