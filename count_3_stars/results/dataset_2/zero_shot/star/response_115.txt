Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 1, 3)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (9, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 0, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
