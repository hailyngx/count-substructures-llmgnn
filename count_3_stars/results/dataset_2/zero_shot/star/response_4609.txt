Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count is presented below:

[6]

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 8, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (9, 4, 3)>
<8, (5, 4, 6)>
<0, (5, 4, 3)>
