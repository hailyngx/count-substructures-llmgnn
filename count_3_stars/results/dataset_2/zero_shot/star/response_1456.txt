Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 9) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 13) (4, 13) (4, 14) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

Unique 3-stars found: 
<12, (7, 9, 1)>
<2, (0, 9, 13)>
<6, (10, 11, 3)>
<9, (7, 12, 0)>
<3, (0, 6, 14)>
<13, (2, 4, 1)>
<8, (10, 5, 9)>
<5, (8, 6, 5)>
<1, (10, 11, 13)>
