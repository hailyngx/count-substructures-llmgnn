Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star must be connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the information provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<9, (5, 3, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (9, 4, 0)>
<8, (4, 7, -)>
<6, (5, 7, 1)>
<2, (7, 6, -)>
<1, (5, 6, 0)>
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<3, (9, 4, 0)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
