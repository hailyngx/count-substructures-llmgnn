Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 7)>
<2, (9, 8, 0)>
<8, (6, 2, 1)>
<3, (9, 2, 8)>
