Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 10) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 2) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 15) (2, 13) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 18) (12, 8) (16, 8) (16, 18) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 15) (11, 1) (11, 4) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 8) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 19) (19, 1) (19, 15) (18, 12) (18, 16) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 2) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:

<5, (9, 6, 12)>
<9, (5, 6, 10)>
<6, (5, 9, 17)>
<0, (14, 13, 3)>
<14, (0, 3, 13)>
<13, (0, 17, 2)>
<17, (6, 13, 8)>
<2, (13, 10, 2)>
<12, (5, 18, 8)>
<16, (8, 18, 16)>

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
