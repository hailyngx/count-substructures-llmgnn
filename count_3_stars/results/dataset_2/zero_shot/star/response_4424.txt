Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 17) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 15) (2, 8) (8, 16) (8, 2) (8, 19) (1, 17) (1, 14) (17, 9) (17, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 12) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 13) (18, 11) (18, 9) (18, 14) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (14, 1) (14, 18) (13, 0) (13, 19) (13, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is [5].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (11, 7, 13)>
<3, (5, 10, 13)>
<4, (7, 12, 15)>
<8, (16, 2, 19)>
<9, (5, 17, 18)>
