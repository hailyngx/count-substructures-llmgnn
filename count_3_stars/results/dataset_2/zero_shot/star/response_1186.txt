Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 2) (7, 13) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 1) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 10) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 1) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars are <4, (1, 2, 13)>, <5, (0, 3, 14)>, <9, (2, 11, 14)>, <12, (3, 6, 13)>.
