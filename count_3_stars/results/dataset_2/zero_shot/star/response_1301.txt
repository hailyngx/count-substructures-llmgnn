Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 3) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 12) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 3) (13, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<5, (6, 10, 4)>
<9, (6, 10, 1)>
<4, (5, 8, 7)>
<0, (9, 11, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
