Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following 3-stars:
[<3, (1, 7, 2)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is:
[2]
