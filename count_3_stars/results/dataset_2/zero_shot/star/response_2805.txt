Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 1) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

[4]

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (8, 12, 0)>
<9, (6, 4, 13)>
<6, (10, 14, 4)>
<4, (7, 3, 9)>
