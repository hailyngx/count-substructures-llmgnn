Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 21) (15, 11) (2, 29) (2, 12) (2, 20) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 8) (29, 22) (25, 3) (25, 10) (1, 12) (1, 27) (1, 8) (5, 9) (5, 21) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (28, 17) (28, 12) (28, 24) (28, 13) (22, 29) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 16) (22, 20) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 4) (26, 17) (6, 21) (6, 7) (6, 19) (21, 3) (21, 5) (21, 6) (21, 20) (21, 4) (13, 28) (13, 17) (13, 23) (17, 28) (17, 26) (17, 13) (0, 16) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 8) (18, 19) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 7) (12, 2) (12, 1) (12, 28) (23, 13) (23, 20) (11, 15) (24, 2) (24, 28) (24, 10) (14, 22) (14, 7) (14, 4) (20, 2) (20, 22) (20, 26) (20, 21) (20, 23) (4, 9) (4, 26) (4, 21) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 27) (8, 29) (8, 1) (8, 16) (8, 10) (10, 25) (10, 24) (10, 8) (27, 1) (27, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 12. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<2, (29, 12, 24)>
<7, (9, 19, 27)>
<8, (1, 10, 16)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<12, (1, 28, 2)>
<13, (28, 17, 23)>
<16, (22, 0, 8)>
<17, (28, 26, 13)>
<19, (6, 18, 7)>
<21, (3, 5, 6)>
<22, (29, 26, 20)>
<24, (2, 10, 28)>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
