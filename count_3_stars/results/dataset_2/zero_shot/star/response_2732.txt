Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 13) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 5) 

Response:
[6]
Unique 3-stars: <4, (3, 6, 10)>, <1, (3, 6, 12)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 10, 12)>, <11, (2, 6, 10)>, <13, (5, 9, 3)>
