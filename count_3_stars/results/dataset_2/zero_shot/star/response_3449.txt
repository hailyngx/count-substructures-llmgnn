Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 2) (18, 9) (18, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 17) (5, 13) (5, 16) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 9) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 9) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 14) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 12) (12, 10) (12, 19) (12, 16) (11, 19) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 9) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 6) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 12) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 11) (3, 18) (3, 13) (3, 17) (7, 11) (6, 14) (6, 17) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 6) 

Response:
The total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph can be found by examining the nodes one by one to see if they form any 3-stars. Since each 3-star consists of a center node and three leaves, we will look for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors to determine if they are the centers of any 3-stars.

The nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are: 4, 18, 1, 10, 12, and 7.

By examining these nodes, we find the following unique 3-stars:
<4, (19, 2, 8)>
<18, (9, 3, 17)>
<1, (13, 15, 9)>
<10, (15, 12, 14)>
<12, (10, 19, 16)>
<7, (11, 14, 6)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
