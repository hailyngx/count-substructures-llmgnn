Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<6, (9, 1, 2)>
