Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 1, 6)>
<9, (5, 2, 3)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<7, (9, 4, 3)>
<6, (5, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
