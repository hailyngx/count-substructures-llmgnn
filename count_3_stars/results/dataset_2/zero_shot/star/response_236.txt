Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 12) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 7) (2, 3) (18, 16) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 5) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 16) (5, 7) (5, 3) (19, 17) (19, 9) (10, 14) (10, 15) (10, 0) (15, 12) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 11) (15, 16) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 9) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 9) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (11, 15) (11, 13) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 16) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (13, 14) (13, 11) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<14, (12, 10, 9)>
<4, (9, 16, 1)>
<17, (6, 7, 19)>
<15, (10, 0, 11)>
