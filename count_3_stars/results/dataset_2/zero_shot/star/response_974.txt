Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 4) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 14) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 4) (14, 12) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. Thus, the answer is [8].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 9, 13)>
<5, (1, 12, 13)>
<6, (0, 8, 12)>
<7, (2, 8, 14)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 14)>
<14, (10, 12, 4)>
