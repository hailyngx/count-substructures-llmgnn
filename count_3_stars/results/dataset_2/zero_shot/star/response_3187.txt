Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 4) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 3) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 12) (2, 14) (2, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<10, (0, 6, 7)>
<11, (14, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 12, 1)>
<13, (12, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
