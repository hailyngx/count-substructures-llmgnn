Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 0) (6, 4) (6, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) 

Response:
[<0, (5, 4, 10)>, <1, (5, 3, 14)>, <2, (8, 2, 14)>, <4, (9, 4, 7)>, <7, (5, 9, 7)>, <14, (5, 1, 14)>]
