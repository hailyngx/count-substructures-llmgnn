Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 14) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 15) (13, 8) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 0) (7, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 17) (19, 5) (19, 0) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 17) (10, 16) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 18) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 10) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 15) 

Response:
There are no 3-star graphs with the given conditions. Hence, the answer is [0].
