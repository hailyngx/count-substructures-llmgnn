Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 16) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 11) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 15) (13, 18) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 0) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 3) (0, 18) (0, 16) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 10) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 15) (6, 2) (6, 15) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 0) (14, 5) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 6) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 12)
