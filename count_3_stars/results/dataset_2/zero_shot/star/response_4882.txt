Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the output is [6].
 
The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (2, 0, 5)>
<7, (0, 9, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 5)>
<3, (1, 0, 6)>
<2, (4, 8, 5)>
<8, (7, 1, 9)>
