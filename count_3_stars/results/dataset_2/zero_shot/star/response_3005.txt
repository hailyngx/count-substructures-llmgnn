Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 16) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (17, 1) (17, 4) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 18) (7, 5) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 19) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 14) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 4) (13, 9) (18, 6) (19, 12) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 1) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 16) (16, 15) (16, 4) 

Response:
There are 10 total 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:

<3, (4, 15, 16)>
<5, (6, 9, 11)>
<9, (2, 5, 11)>
<10, (0, 12, 14)>
<11, (5, 8, 9)>
<12, (7, 8, 14)>
<15, (3, 6, 8)>
<16, (4, 15, 17)>
<17, (1, 4, 16)>
<18, (6, 19, 12)>

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
