Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 5) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 12) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 12) (2, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 12) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The total number of 3-stars is [5]. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (9, 14, 4)>
<1, (10, 14, 4)>
<5, (10, 14, 3)>
<7, (11, 13, 2)>
<8, (10, 11, 12)>
