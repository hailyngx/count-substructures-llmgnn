Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 12) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 13) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (10, 12) (10, 9) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 11) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars found: 
<1, (3, 5, 14)>
<3, (1, 8, 11)>
<5, (1, 6, 14)>
<6, (0, 11, 13)>
