Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by first determining the number of occurrences of each node as the center of a 3-star.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

The <14, (17, 10, 26)> 3-star can be formed using the edges:
- (14, 17)
- (14, 26)
- (14, 10)

The <17, (14, 1, 20)> 3-star can be formed using the edges:
- (17, 14)
- (17, 1)
- (17, 20)

The <1, (17, 3, 16)> 3-star can be formed using the edges:
- (1, 17)
- (1, 3)
- (1, 16)

The <3, (1, 8, 21)> 3-star can be formed using the edges:
- (3, 1)
- (3, 8)
- (3, 21)

The <22, (19, 11, 23)> 3-star can be formed using the edges:
- (22, 19)
- (22, 11)
- (22, 23)

The <19, (22, 26, 16)> 3-star can be formed using the edges:
- (19, 22)

- (19, 16)

The <26, (14, 13, 19)> 3-star can be formed using the edges:
- (26, 14)
- (26, 13)
- (26, 19)

The <11, (22, 7, 24)> 3-star can be formed using the edges:
- (11, 22)
- (11, 7)
- (11, 24)

The <28, (5, 21, 15)> 3-star can be formed using the edges:
- (28, 5)

- (28, 15)

The <13, (17, 6, 7)> 3-star can be formed using the edges:
- (13, 17)
- (13, 6)
- (13, 7)

The <20, (17, 8, 10)> 3-star can be formed using the edges:
- (20, 17)
- (20, 8)
- (20, 10)

The <16, (1, 19, 15)> 3-star can be formed using the edges:

The <15, (16, 5, 10)> 3-star can be formed using the edges:
- (15, 16)
- (15, 5)
- (15, 10)

The <9, (23, 4, 27)> 3-star can be formed using the edges:
- (9, 23)
- (9, 4)
- (9, 27)

The <16, (19, 16, 15)> 3-star can be formed using the edges:
- (16, 19)
- (16, 15)
- (16, 19)

The <6, (13, 18, 21)> 3-star can be formed using the edges:
- (6, 13)
- (6, 18)
- (6, 21)

The <24, (11, 7, 10)> 3-star can be formed using the edges:

The <5, (28, 15, 21)> 3-star can be formed using the edges:
- (5, 28)
- (5, 15)
- (5, 21)

The <0, (3, 4, 11)> 3-star can be formed using the edges:
- (0, 3)
- (0, 4)
- (0, 11)

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<14, (17, 10, 26)>, <17, (14, 1, 20)>, <1, (17, 3, 16)>, <3, (1, 8, 21)>, <22, (19, 11, 23)>, <19, (22, 26, 16)>, <26, (14, 13, 19)>, <11, (22, 7, 24)>, <28, (5, 21, 15)>, <13, (17, 6, 7)>, <20, (17, 8, 10)>, <16, (1, 19, 15)>, <10, (14, 20, 15)>, <15, (16, 5, 10)>, <9, (23, 4, 27)>, <6, (13, 18, 21)>, <24, (11, 7, 10)>, <7, (11, 13, 29)>, <5, (28, 15, 21)>, <0, (3, 4, 11)>.
