Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (17, 9) (17, 1) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 14) (3, 1) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 13) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 8) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 15) (16, 7) (16, 6) (6, 1) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (19, 2) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 6) (8, 11) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 10) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

<1, (5, 17, 2)>
<8, (14, 7, 18)>
