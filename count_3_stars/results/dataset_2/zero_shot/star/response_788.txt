Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 22) (16, 20) (8, 23) (8, 19) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 13) (2, 22) (2, 12) (18, 17) (0, 28) (0, 24) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 20) (14, 29) (9, 22) (9, 4) (22, 16) (22, 2) (22, 9) (22, 5) (1, 15) (1, 28) (1, 13) (15, 23) (15, 1) (15, 10) (10, 15) (10, 6) (13, 23) (13, 1) (13, 12) (17, 18) (17, 3) (21, 27) (21, 5) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 28) (4, 3) (12, 16) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 3) (19, 8) (19, 29) (19, 27) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 25) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 29) (25, 6) (25, 29) (25, 28) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 4) (28, 25) (27, 21) (27, 19) (27, 20) (27, 26) (24, 23) (24, 0) (24, 20) (26, 27) (26, 29) (29, 14) (29, 19) (29, 3) (29, 25) (29, 26) (5, 0) (5, 22) (5, 21) (5, 20) (20, 16) (20, 14) (20, 27) (20, 24) (20, 5) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<0, (5, 24, 28)>, <1, (13, 15, 28)>, <2, (12, 16, 22)>, <3, (4, 12, 29)>, <4, (3, 12, 28)>, <5, (0, 20, 22)>, <6, (10, 14, 25)>, <8, (19, 23, 8)>, <9, (4, 9, 22)>, <10, (6, 15, 10)>, <13, (1, 12, 23)>, <14, (6, 20, 29)>, <15, (1, 23, 15)>, <16, (12, 20, 22)>, <17, (3, 18, 17)>, <19, (8, 27, 29)>, <20, (5, 14, 27)>, <21, (5, 26, 27)>, <23, (8, 13, 24)>, <25, (6, 28, 25)>, <26, (21, 27, 29)>]

Therefore, there are [22] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
