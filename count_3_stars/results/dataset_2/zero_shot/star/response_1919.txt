Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 6) (22, 7) (15, 27) (15, 7) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 23) (27, 16) (5, 20) (5, 6) (5, 24) (20, 5) (20, 10) (18, 22) (18, 14) (18, 21) (0, 24) (0, 25) (7, 22) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 28) (12, 9) (6, 22) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 17) (1, 26) (1, 17) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 17) (24, 5) (24, 0) (24, 28) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 26) (2, 15) (2, 25) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 23) (4, 3) (10, 20) (10, 29) (23, 27) (23, 26) (23, 4) (23, 28) (16, 27) (16, 12) (16, 29) (16, 3) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 4) (9, 14) (29, 10) (29, 16) (29, 21) (3, 4) (3, 16) (3, 14) (11, 19) (11, 25) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 21) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 3) (28, 12) (28, 24) (28, 23) (21, 18) (21, 29) (21, 19) (25, 0) (25, 2) (25, 11) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<7, (15, 27, 2)>
<12, (7, 4, 16)>
<9, (13, 12, 4)>
<28, (12, 24, 23)>
<17, (6, 1, 26)>
<21, (18, 29, 19)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
