Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 14) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of [15] unique 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (9, 13, 5)>
<7, (12, 11, 14)>
<1, (3, 14, 12)>
<3, (0, 12, 8)>
<10, (11, 5, 14)>
<11, (0, 5, 6)>
<12, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (9, 6, 14)>
<8, (7, 3, 11)>
<5, (4, 10, 11)>
<13, (4, 7, 5)>
<6, (4, 11, 2)>
<0, (3, 11, 9)>
<14, (7, 1, 10)>
<9, (4, 10, 2)>
