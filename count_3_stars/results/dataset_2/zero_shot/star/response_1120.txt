Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 12) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 14) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 13)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<12, (2, 5, 14)>
