Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 24) (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 4) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 16) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 22) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 21) (8, 26) (22, 17) (22, 6) (26, 8) (26, 28) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 27) (28, 26) (6, 22) (6, 21) (6, 4) (6, 20) (21, 14) (21, 8) (21, 6) (21, 0) (21, 4) (5, 1) (19, 3) (13, 17) (13, 29) (13, 20) (0, 2) (0, 21) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 16) (7, 2) (7, 11) (1, 5) (1, 20) (1, 12) (20, 6) (20, 13) (20, 1) (20, 18) (20, 9) (24, 3) (24, 27) (24, 9) (18, 0) (18, 20) (18, 12) (23, 16) (23, 9) (23, 27) (27, 11) (27, 24) (27, 23) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 18) (29, 13) (9, 14) (9, 20) (9, 24) (9, 23) (4, 15) (4, 6) (4, 21) (4, 10) (16, 14) (16, 10) (16, 23) 

Response:
The center of a 3-star must have exactly 3 neighbors, which can only be achieved by having a node with degree 3 in the graph. Let's first identify all nodes with degree 3:

- Node 3 has degree 4 (neighbors: 15, 24, 10, 19)
- Node 14 has degree 5 (neighbors: 15, 17, 9, 16, 21)
- Node 17 has degree 4 (neighbors: 14, 13, 22, 11)
- Node 21 has degree 5 (neighbors: 8, 14, 6, 0, 4)
- Node 10 has degree 5 (neighbors: 3, 0, 12, 4, 16)
- Node 11 has degree 4 (neighbors: 17, 7, 27, 27)
- Node 20 has degree 5 (neighbors: 6, 13, 1, 18, 9)
- Node 9 has degree 4 (neighbors: 14, 20, 24, 23)
- Node 16 has degree 3 (neighbors: 14, 10, 23)

Based on the nodes with degree 3, we can form the following unique 3-stars:
1. <3, (15, 24, 10)>
2. <16, (14, 10, 23)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
