Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
The center nodes possible for the given graph are 0, 2, 5, and 8. Let's count the number of 3-stars for each possible center node:

- For center node 0: 3-stars = 3 (as there are (0, 6, 4), (0, 6, 8), and (0, 6, 3))
- For center node 2: 3-stars = 1 (as there is (2, 5, 8))
- For center node 5: 3-stars = 2 (as there are (5, 8, 0) and (5, 8, 3))
- For center node 8: 3-stars = 2 (as there are (8, 0, 6) and (8, 0, 3))

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 4, 8)>
<0, (6, 8, 3)>
<0, (6, 4, 3)>
<2, (5, 8, 0)>
<5, (8, 0, 3)>
<5, (8, 0, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 3)>
<8, (0, 6, 5)>
