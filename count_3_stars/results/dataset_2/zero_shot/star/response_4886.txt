Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 13) (14, 17) (14, 15) (14, 10) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 8) (2, 15) (18, 15) (18, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 15) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 16) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 13) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 19) (8, 6) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (16, 1) (16, 19) (3, 12) (3, 10) (6, 8) (6, 11) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 19) (10, 14) (10, 3) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 15) (15, 14) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 4) (15, 11)
