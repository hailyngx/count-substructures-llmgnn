Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
<6, (5, 3, 8)>
<9, (8, 4, 7)>
<5, (6, 4, 1)>
<4, (9, 5, 3)>
<2, (4, 1, 0)>
<8, (6, 9, 7)>
<0, (5, 2, 1)>
<7, (8, 2, 3)>
