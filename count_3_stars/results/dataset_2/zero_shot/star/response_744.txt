Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (16, 1) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 3) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 17) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 0) (8, 2) (18, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 15) (3, 9) (3, 18) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 13) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 17) (17, 9) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 15) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 1) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 19) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
<1, (6, 11, 16)>
<2, (9, 12, 16)>
<3, (9, 13, 18)>
<4, (7, 12, 17)>
<5, (6, 9, 17)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 8)>
<10, (1, 6, 10)>
<11, (1, 9, 13)>
<12, (2, 7, 12)>
<14, (0, 1, 14)>
<15, (12, 15, 19)>
