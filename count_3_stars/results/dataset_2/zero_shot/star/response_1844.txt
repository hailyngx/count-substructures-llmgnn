Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 7, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
<4, (8, 6, 2)>
<7, (5, 9, 0)>
<6, (9, 4, 1)>
<8, (4, 6, 3)>
