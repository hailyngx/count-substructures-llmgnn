Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 12) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 14) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 12) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. Thus, the answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (3, 8, 10)>
<5, (2, 8, 12)>
<6, (1, 13, 2)>
<7, (0, 9, 14)>
<9, (10, 7, 14)>
<11, (0, 1, 3)>
<13, (6, 8, 12)>
<14, (1, 7, 9)>
