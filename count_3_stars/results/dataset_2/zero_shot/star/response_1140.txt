Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 different 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<6, (9, 14, 10)>
<9, (6, 2, 10)>
<1, (2, 13, 12)>
<3, (0, 14, 10)>
<4, (7, 12, 10)>
<7, (9, 4, 11)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
