Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 26) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 23) (16, 9) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 28) (5, 7) (5, 20) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 3) (4, 25) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 14) (15, 27) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 2) (27, 6) (0, 12) (0, 6) (20, 5) (20, 17) (2, 16) (2, 15) (2, 27) (2, 18) (2, 25) (18, 2) (18, 6) (12, 0) (12, 28) (12, 22) (28, 5) (28, 12) (26, 11) (26, 10) (26, 8) (17, 20) (17, 13) (1, 13) (1, 22) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 10) (23, 16) (13, 17) (13, 1) (10, 26) (10, 19) (10, 21) (10, 22) (21, 19) (21, 10) (21, 22) (21, 29) (24, 11) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 29) (3, 9) (3, 7) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 22) (22, 12) (22, 1) (22, 10) (22, 21) (22, 14) (8, 26) (8, 24) (8, 29) (6, 27) (6, 0) (6, 18) (6, 25) (29, 21) (29, 24) (29, 8) (25, 4) (25, 2) (25, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<5, (9, 7, 20)>
<11, (16, 24, 26)>
<9, (16, 5, 24)>
<16, (11, 2, 23)>
<2, (16, 15, 27)>
<22, (12, 1, 10)>
<24, (11, 9, 8)>
<26, (11, 10, 8)>
