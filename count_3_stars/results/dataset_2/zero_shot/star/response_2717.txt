Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:

<5, (9, 8, 7)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
<0, (9, 2, 8)>
<7, (5, 2, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
