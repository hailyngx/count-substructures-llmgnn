Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 3) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 17) (8, 7) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 14) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 5) (0, 7) (0, 17) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 10) (13, 18) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 19) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 1) (17, 16) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 19) (16, 1) (16, 17) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 18) (12, 6) (12, 19) (10, 18) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 5) (19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 12) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by checking each node to see if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

There are 6 possible 3-star configurations in the given graph:

<0, (7, 17, 5)>
<1, (11, 16, 14)>
<2, (6, 10, 11)>
<3, (9, 17, 14)>
<4, (18, 15, 13)>
<12, (6, 19, -)>

Since there is only one occurrence of the last 3-star and all other 3-stars have multiple occurrences, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
