Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (5, 3, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
