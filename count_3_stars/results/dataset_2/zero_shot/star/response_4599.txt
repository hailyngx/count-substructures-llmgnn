Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 14) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 0) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 1) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the graph.

<5, (9, 7, 14)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (9, 7, 2)>
<10, (11, 3, 8)>
<11, (10, 14, 13)>
