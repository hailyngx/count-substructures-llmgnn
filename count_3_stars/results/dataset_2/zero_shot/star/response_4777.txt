Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 23) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 2) (14, 28) (14, 16) (17, 20) (17, 23) (17, 11) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 27) (0, 27) (0, 29) (0, 19) (27, 1) (27, 0) (27, 19) (22, 23) (22, 26) (23, 3) (23, 17) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 10) (28, 14) (28, 8) (28, 12) (29, 0) (29, 5) (29, 10) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 21) (13, 1) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 6) (5, 29) (5, 13) (5, 11) (20, 17) (20, 9) (18, 26) (18, 9) (18, 8) (7, 25) (25, 7) (25, 21) (8, 3) (8, 28) (8, 18) (8, 19) (19, 0) (19, 27) (19, 8) (19, 10) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 4) (12, 1) (12, 28) (16, 14) (16, 9) (9, 20) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 2) (6, 15) (6, 13) (2, 15) (2, 9) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 11) (10, 23) (10, 29) (10, 13) (10, 19) (21, 26) (21, 25) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<15, (2, 4, 6)>
<14, (16, 28, 9)>
<17, (11, 20, 23)>
<1, (12, 13, 27)>
<0, (19, 27, 29)>
<22, (23, 26, 10)>
<5, (11, 13, 29)>
<18, (8, 9, 26)>
<25, (7, 21, 25)>
<16, (9, 14, 20)>
<6, (13, 15, 4)>
