Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<4, (7, 0, 6)>
<7, (4, 3, 2)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<6, (4, 3, 0)>
