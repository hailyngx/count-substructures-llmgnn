Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 1) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 6) (18, 17) (18, 29) (22, 27) (4, 13) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 3) (1, 0) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 14) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 3) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 15) (28, 20) (5, 8) (5, 19) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 12) (15, 28) (16, 20) (11, 23) (11, 21) (23, 11) (23, 6) (23, 13) (6, 27) (6, 1) (6, 23) (6, 14) (3, 8) (3, 26) (3, 28) (3, 12) (10, 26) (10, 12) (10, 20) (9, 25) (9, 2) (9, 7) (25, 8) (25, 9) (25, 29) (25, 14) (13, 4) (13, 23) (13, 21) (21, 11) (21, 13) (21, 24) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 25) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 14) (17, 27) (17, 18) (17, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 24) (24, 21) (24, 7) (24, 20) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 29) (29, 18) (29, 25) (29, 12) (20, 28) (20, 16) (20, 10) (20, 24) 

Response:
There are 9 unique 3-stars found in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 19, 27)>
<1, (0, 6, 14)>
<2, (4, 9, 14)>
<3, (8, 12, 26)>
<6, (1, 14, 27)>
<7, (9, 17, 24)>
<10, (12, 20, 26)>
<13, (4, 21, 23)>
<25, (8, 14, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
