Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 17) (8, 3) (8, 0) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 18) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 11) (18, 13) (18, 5) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 0) (17, 15) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 5) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 6) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 16) (11, 2) (11, 4) (19, 3) (19, 9) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 12) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 16) (10, 14) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 14) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 9) (9, 19) (9, 16) (14, 2) (14, 10) (14, 5) 

Response:
There are 2 three-star nodes in this graph. The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (8, 12, 17)>
<16, (6, 9, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
