Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 3) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 6) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 12) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<7, (9, 4, 1)>
<12, (7, 8, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
