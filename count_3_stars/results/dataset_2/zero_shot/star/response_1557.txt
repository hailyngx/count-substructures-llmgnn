Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 15) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 14) (4, 13) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 1) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 0) (3, 17) (3, 19) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 7) (1, 2) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 2) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 14) (12, 16) (12, 15) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 7) (18, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (14, 16) (14, 10) (14, 19) 

Response:
There are <11, (9, 15, 2)>, <16, (0, 12, 19)>, <0, (7, 6, 2)>, <10, (17, 15, 14)>, <17, (10, 3, 8)>, <8, (10, 17, 9)>, <5, (6, 19, 18)>, <3, (17, 19, 2)> 3-stars in the given graph.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
