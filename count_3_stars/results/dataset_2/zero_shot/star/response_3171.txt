Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (15, 3) (15, 2) (15, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 17) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 6) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 17) (1, 9) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (7, 0) (7, 17) (7, 6) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (9, 1) (9, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 4) (11, 15) (11, 12) (11, 9) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 13) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 16) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 4) (16, 13) (16, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs in this given graph can be counted by identifying all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following nodes that are part of 3-star configurations:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 0, and 10.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 2, and 11.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 19, 5, and 17.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 16, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 15, 18, and 12.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 8, 1, and 19.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 17, and 6.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 2, 10, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 11, and none else.

Putting it all together, we have counted all the unique 3-star graphs:
<3, (15, 0, 10)>
<15, (3, 2, 11)>
<8, (19, 5, 17)>
<13, (16, 4, 6)>
<2, (15, 18, 12)>
<17, (8, 1, 19)>
<7, (0, 17, 6)>
<12, (2, 10, 6)>
<9, (1, 11, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [9].
