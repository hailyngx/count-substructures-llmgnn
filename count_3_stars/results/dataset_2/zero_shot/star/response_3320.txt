Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 13) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 10) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are <0, (4, 3, 5)>, <1, (5, 11, 1)>, <2, (1, 13, 2)>, <3, (4, 7, 12)>, <4, (0, 11, 12)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 10, 14)>, <7, (3, 6, 12)>, <8, (5, 10, 12)>, <9, (6, 10, 12)>, <10, (6, 8, 14)>, <11, (9, 13, 1)>, <12, (7, 8, 9)>, <13, (2, 11, 14)>, <14, (2, 10, 13)>.

Thus, there are 15 unique 3-stars in total. The final answer is [15].
