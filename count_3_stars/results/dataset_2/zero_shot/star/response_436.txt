Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (5, 2, 1)>
