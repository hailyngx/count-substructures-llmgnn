Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 15) (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 6) (17, 18) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 4) (10, 11) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 4) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 5) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 1) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 15) (9, 18) (9, 1) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 19) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 6) (15, 16) (15, 12) (15, 6) (5, 11) (5, 18) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) 

Response:
There are [28] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 10, 18)>
<3, (0, 8, 12)>
<4, (1, 2, 13)>
<5, (11, 18, 19)>
<6, (0, 6, 17)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 13)>
<9, (1, 18, 9)>
<10, (2, 11, 4)>
<11, (5, 16, 19)>
<12, (3, 8, 15)>
<13, (4, 8, 14)>
<14, (13, 19, 6)>
<15, (6, 12, 16)>
<16, (5, 11, 15)>
<17, (6, 18, 17)>
