Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
