Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 2)
