Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 6) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (1, 12) (1, 2) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 14) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (10, 12, 3)>
<9, (0, 8, 2)>
<8, (0, 7, 4)>
<13, (6, 11, 12)>
<10, (0, 7, 11)>
<7, (11, 12, 14)>
<12, (1, 5, 13)>
