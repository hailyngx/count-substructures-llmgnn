Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 7) (17, 12) (17, 5) (17, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 11) (18, 5) (18, 11) (18, 12) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 13) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 6) (5, 17) (5, 18) (19, 16) (19, 6) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 12) (9, 3) (9, 11) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 16) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 16) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 13) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 9) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 15) (16, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 three-stars in the given graph.
