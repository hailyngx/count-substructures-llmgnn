Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are:

<5, (9, 4, 6)>
<9, (5, 1, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 2)>
<1, (9, 3, 8)>
