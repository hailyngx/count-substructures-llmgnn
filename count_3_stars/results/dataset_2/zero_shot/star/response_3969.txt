Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 8) (4, 16) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 6) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 7) (18, 2) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (19, 9) (19, 14) (15, 4) (15, 14) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 2) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 15)
