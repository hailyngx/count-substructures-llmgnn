Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 5) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 1) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are \[10\] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<9, (6, 7, 11)>
<4, (5, 11, 2)>
<8, (5, 14, 3)>
<7, (6, 9, 8)>
<12, (7, 0, 3)>
<2, (6, 4, -)>
<3, (6, 8, 12)>
<11, (9, 4, 1)>
<0, (7, 12, 3)>
