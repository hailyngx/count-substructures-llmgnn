Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 15) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (0, 6) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 10) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 11) (19, 0) (19, 5) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 16) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 18) (2, 12) (2, 11) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 17) (3, 7) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 4) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 1) (17, 8) (17, 18) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (0, 8, 1)>
<9, (6, 15, 18)>
<7, (10, 12, 11)>
<12, (2, 5, 11)>
<19, (0, 5, 6)>
<16, (1, 14, 15)>
