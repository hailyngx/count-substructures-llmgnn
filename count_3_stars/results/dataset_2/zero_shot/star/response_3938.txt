Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 16) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 17) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 5) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 19) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 1) (15, 7) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 12) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 18) (16, 4) (1, 2) (1, 19) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 1) (13, 14) (13, 9) (13, 18) (13, 6) (9, 13) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 6) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 18) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 13) (6, 12) (18, 16) (18, 13) (18, 17) (4, 16) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is [6].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (16, 4, 18)>
<2, (5, 1, 17)>
<8, (10, 6, 3)>
<11, (14, 7, 19)>
<13, (14, 9, 18)>
<15, (16, 6, 12)>
