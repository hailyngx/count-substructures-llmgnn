Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 2) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 19) (19, 5) (19, 11) (8, 9) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 18) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 16) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 7) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 0) (6, 15) (6, 14) (4, 15) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 1) (18, 10) (18, 13) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (2, 4, 1)>
<6, (5, 4, 14)>
<7, (11, 16, 17)>
<9, (13, 12, 0)>
