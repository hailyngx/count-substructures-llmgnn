Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 5) 

Response:
There are <6, (9, 5, 3)>, <9, (6, 8, 2)> 3-stars in the given graph.  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
