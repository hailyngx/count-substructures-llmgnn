Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 8) (12, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 5) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 5) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (7, 8, 12)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<10, (0, 5, 11)>
<11, (4, 9, 14)>
<7, (1, 13, 14)>
<12, (2, 7, 13)>
<14, (4, 8, 11)>
