Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 16) (9, 19) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 17) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 16) (17, 7) (17, 14) (17, 10) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 8) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 16) (8, 10) (8, 11) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 13) (0, 5) (0, 13) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 1) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 13) (15, 18) (15, 1) (15, 16) (15, 12) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 12) (6, 10) (6, 3) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 19) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 12) (13, 18) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars found: 
<9, (16, 19, 4)>
<18, (4, 13, 15)>
<19, (4, 2, 9)>
