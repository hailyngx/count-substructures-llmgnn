Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (5, 12) (5, 7) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 1) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 15) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 18) (3, 8) (3, 9) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 18) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (19, 17) (4, 1) (15, 13) (15, 0) (15, 16) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 4) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 17) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 17) (14, 16) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (7, 10, 12)>
<1, (4, 16, 18)>
<5, (7, 12, 15)>
<6, (7, 8, 13)>
<9, (3, 11, 17)>
<11, (0, 9, 18)>
<13, (6, 8, 15)>
<16, (1, 12, 17)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
