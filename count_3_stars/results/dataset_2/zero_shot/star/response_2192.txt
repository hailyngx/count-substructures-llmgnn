Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 2) (14, 5) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 4) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 15) (8, 2) (3, 12) (11, 19) (0, 10) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 17) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 4) (13, 17) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 16) (16, 17) (16, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 18) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 10) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 4) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 19) 

Response:
There are a total of [40] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (18, 7, 14)>
<9, (6, 18, 2)>
<14, (5, 17, 6)>
<17, (14, 13, 16)>
<6, (9, 14, 12)>
<2, (9, 8, 12)>
<8, (2, 3, 0)>
<3, (12, 11, 15)>
<11, (19, 3, 0)>
<0, (10, 11, 7)>
<7, (5, 17, 0)>
<1, (13, 19, 15)>
<15, (2, 19, 4)>
<13, (17, 6, 1)>
<16, (17, 13, 11)>
<10, (0, 12, 18)>
<12, (6, 2, 10)>
<18, (5, 9, 10)>
