Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (6, 10) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 3) (5, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 12) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12)
