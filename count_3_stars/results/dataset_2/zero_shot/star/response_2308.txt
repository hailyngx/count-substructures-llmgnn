Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 6) (14, 3) (14, 6)
