Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (6, 9, 1)>
<5, (2, 1, 3)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (5, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
