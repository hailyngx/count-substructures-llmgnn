Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 15) (6, 19) (9, 16) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 11) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 5) (4, 19) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 15) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 15) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 18) (18, 0) (18, 5) (18, 16) (13, 2) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 4) (5, 17) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 18) (16, 9) (16, 3) (16, 18) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 2) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars: <10, (11, 1, 14)>, <0, (10, 12, 18)>, <2, (7, 8, 15)>
