Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
