Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final count is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 7, 3)>
<4, (5, 0, 2)>
<7, (9, 6, 1)>
<0, (4, 8, 6)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
