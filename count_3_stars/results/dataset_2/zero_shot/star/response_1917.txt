Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (3, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 5)>
<0, (8, 7, 5)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<7, (6, 9, 5)>
<7, (1, 9, 5)>
<2, (6, 9, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
