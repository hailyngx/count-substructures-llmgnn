Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
There are 11 unique 3-stars in this graph. The answer is [11].
