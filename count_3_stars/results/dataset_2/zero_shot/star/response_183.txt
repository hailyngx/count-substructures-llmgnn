Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars found: 
<5, (8, 3, 9)>
