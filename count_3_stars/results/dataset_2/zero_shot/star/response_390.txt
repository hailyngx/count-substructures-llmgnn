Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 10) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 15) (2, 18) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 0) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 15) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 19) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 7) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 7) (15, 10) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 11) (17, 5) (4, 2) (4, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 4) (5, 17) (5, 1) (1, 12) (1, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
