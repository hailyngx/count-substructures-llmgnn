Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 9, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<3, (4, 9, 7)>
<8, (6, 4, 8)>
