Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (14, 19) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 1) (18, 13) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 9) (1, 0) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 11) (13, 18) (13, 12) (19, 3) (19, 14) (19, 5) (10, 15) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 7) (8, 9) (8, 16) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 16) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 12) (12, 3) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 16) (7, 11) (7, 9) (6, 2) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 11, 19)>
<11, (3, 5, 17)>
<16, (0, 8, 10)>
