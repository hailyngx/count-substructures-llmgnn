Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 total 3-star subgraphs in this graph. Here they are:

<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
