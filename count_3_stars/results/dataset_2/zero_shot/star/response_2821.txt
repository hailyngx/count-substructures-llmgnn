Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (29, 2) (29, 1) (29, 16) (29, 25) (29, 21) (18, 22) (18, 14) (18, 21) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 0) (23, 15) (23, 10) (23, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 17) (27, 6) (7, 12) (7, 26) (7, 17) (15, 23) (15, 20) (15, 8) (20, 15) (20, 21) (20, 3) (20, 16) (20, 28) (19, 26) (19, 6) (26, 7) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 21) (11, 22) (11, 13) (11, 4) (28, 20) (28, 0) (28, 25) (24, 26) (24, 14) (24, 5) (1, 29) (1, 5) (5, 12) (5, 24) (5, 1) (5, 8) (16, 29) (16, 20) (16, 21) (21, 29) (21, 18) (21, 20) (21, 26) (21, 16) (14, 18) (14, 24) (6, 27) (6, 19) (6, 17) (6, 8) (17, 12) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 3) (3, 20) (3, 17) (3, 13) (9, 23) (25, 29) (25, 28) (25, 13) (8, 15) (8, 5) (8, 6) (0, 22) (0, 28) (0, 13) (4, 11) (13, 18) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 25) (13, 0) (10, 23) 

Response:
There are 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<29, (2, 1, 16)>
<18, (22, 21, 13)>
<22, (18, 11, 0)>
<23, (15, 10, 9)>
<12, (7, 5, 17)>
<7, (12, 26, 17)>
<15, (23, 20, 8)>
<20, (15, 21, 16)>
<19, (26, 6, 24)>
<26, (7, 19, 21)>
<11, (22, 13, 4)>
<28, (20, 0, 25)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
