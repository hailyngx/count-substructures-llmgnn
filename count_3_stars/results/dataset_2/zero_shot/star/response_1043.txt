Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 18) (0, 21) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 25) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 9) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 3) (18, 21) (18, 11) (18, 16) (26, 0) (26, 20) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 3) (28, 26) (28, 4) (4, 28) (4, 9) (4, 10) (27, 17) (27, 6) (25, 0) (25, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 5) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 11) (9, 20) (9, 4) (9, 11) (29, 1) (29, 26) (29, 3) (8, 25) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 23) (16, 18) (16, 22) (6, 12) (6, 27) (6, 15) (17, 27) (17, 8) (17, 5) (13, 21) (13, 12) (13, 24) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 22) (24, 8) (24, 13) (22, 0) (22, 16) (22, 5) (11, 18) (11, 15) (11, 9) (3, 2) (3, 26) (3, 29) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 23) (23, 1) (23, 19) (23, 14)
