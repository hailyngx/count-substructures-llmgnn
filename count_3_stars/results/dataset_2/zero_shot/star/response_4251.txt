Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
The 3-stars are <5, (9, 1, 4)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>, and <8, (5, 9, 3)>.
Therefore, the final answer is [3].
