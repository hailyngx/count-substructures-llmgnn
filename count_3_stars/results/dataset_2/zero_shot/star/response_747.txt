Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 11) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 14) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 6) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 <4, (2, 6, 12)> and 2 <8, (3, 6, 14)> 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
