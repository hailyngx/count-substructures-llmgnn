Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 5) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (2, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 1) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 4) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 4) 

Response:
There are total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (9, 10, 12)>
<9, (6, 8, 11)>
<10, (6, 11, 12)>
<11, (9, 10, 3)>
<7, (12, 2, 5)>
<12, (6, 9, 10)>
<2, (7, 13, 4)>
<8, (9, 12, 1)>
<3, (10, 11, 0)>
<0, (3, 4, 1)>
<5, (10, 11, 7)>
<13, (2, 5, 1)>
<1, (7, 8, 0)>
