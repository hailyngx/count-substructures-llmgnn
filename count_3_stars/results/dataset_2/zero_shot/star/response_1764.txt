Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 3) (5, 8) (5, 12) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 14) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 three-star motifs in the given graph. Here they are:

<4, (7, 3, 6)>,
<7, (4, 11, 13)>,
<10, (0, 12, 13)>,
<13, (7, 8, 10)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
