Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are 5 total 3-stars in the given graph: 

[5]

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (6, 2, 9)>
<5, (3, 1, 8)>
