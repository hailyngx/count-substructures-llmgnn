Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
