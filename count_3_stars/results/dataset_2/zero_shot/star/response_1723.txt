Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (8, 3, 1)>
<8, (4, 2, 7)>
<5, (6, 2, 0)>
<6, (5, 2, 0)>
<2, (8, 5, 1)>
<1, (4, 2, 9)>
