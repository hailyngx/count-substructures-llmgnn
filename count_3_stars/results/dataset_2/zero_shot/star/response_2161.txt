Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 17) (14, 11) (14, 15) (17, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 13) (10, 19) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 18) (8, 19) (8, 0) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 11) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 4) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 18) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 12) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 13) (4, 0) (4, 13) (15, 9) (15, 14) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 4) (18, 7) (18, 6) (18, 16) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in this graph. 

These 3-stars are:
<11, (9, 14, 19)>
<2, (1, 7, 12)>
<9, (2, 11, 17)>
<13, (10, 11, 16)>
<0, (1, 8, 16)>
<3, (1, 6, 12)>
