Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 10) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 1) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (8, 12, 13)>
<6, (8, 7, 0)>
<0, (6, 12, 13)>
<14, (5, 4, 6)>
<3, (6, 11, 2)>
<11, (9, 4, 7)>
