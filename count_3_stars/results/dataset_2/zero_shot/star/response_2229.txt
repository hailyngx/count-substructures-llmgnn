Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<4, (7, 8, 2)>
<3, (7, 1, 6)>
<8, (4, 1, 0)>
<2, (6, 1, 3)>
<0, (8, 2, 5)>
