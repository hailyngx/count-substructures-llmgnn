Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 

<4, (7, 1, 3)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 1)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 9, 1)>
<8, (7, 9, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
