Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) 

Response:
The center node must have degree 3 to form a 3-star. Let's first identify the center node possibilities based on the degrees of nodes:
- Node 5 has degree 8
- Node 9 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 6
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 6
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 0 has degree 2

Hence, the only node that can serve as the center node in the given graph is node 4.

Now, let's find the 3-stars centered at node 4:
1. <4, (9, 7, 6)>
2. <4, (9, 3, 6)>
3. <4, (7, 1, 6)>

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
