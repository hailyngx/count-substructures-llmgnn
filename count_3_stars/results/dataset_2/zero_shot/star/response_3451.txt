Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (9, 15) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 10) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 3) (3, 17) (3, 8) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 12) (15, 9) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 16) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (0, 6) (0, 19) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 8) (19, 4) (19, 11) (19, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 16) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 14) (8, 3) (8, 10) (16, 15) (16, 14) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<4, (7, 12, 15)>
<6, (0, 12, 14)>
<7, (4, 9, 10)>
<12, (4, 6, 11)>
<14, (6, 16, 18)>
<18, (5, 15, 14)>
