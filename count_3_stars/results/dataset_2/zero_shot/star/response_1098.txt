Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 9) (3, 11) (3, 6) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 10) (7, 8) (7, 19) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 9) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 15) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 0) (0, 18) (2, 4) (2, 6) (5, 14) (5, 12) (16, 10) (16, 9) (16, 6) (19, 17) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 6) (9, 1) (9, 12) (9, 16) (9, 15) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (6, 19) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (8, 13, 19)>
<3, (6, 11, 16)>
<8, (1, 13, 17)>
<9, (6, 12, 15)>
<10, (1, 11, 16)>
<11, (3, 8, 10)>
<13, (1, 8, 19)>
<16, (6, 9, 10)>
