Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
