Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 1) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 8) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 3) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 9, 10)>
<1, (9, 11, 14)>
<3, (11, 12, 13)>
<4, (7, 11, 14)>
<6, (5, 8, 14)>
