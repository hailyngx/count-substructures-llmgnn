Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 17) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 16) (17, 10) (17, 15) (17, 18) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 14) (0, 15) (0, 13) (7, 18) (1, 11) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 3) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 19) (4, 19) (4, 3) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 4) (19, 3) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 0) (13, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 18) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 7) (18, 3) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

<11, (1, 9, 15)>
<14, (5, 8, 19)>
