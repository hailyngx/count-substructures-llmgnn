Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 17) (1, 0) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 19) (10, 6) (10, 18) (11, 3) (11, 2) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 6) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 0) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 16) (12, 13) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 15) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 16) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 15) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 13) (14, 3) (14, 15) (4, 9) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 6) (13, 12) (13, 19) (13, 16) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 15) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (7, 9, 17)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<16, (5, 12, 17)>
<19, (3, 8, 13)>
