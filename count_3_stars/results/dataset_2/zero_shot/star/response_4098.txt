Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 8) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 13) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 0, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 14)>
<5, (3, 14, 13)>
<11, (10, 4, 2)>
<11, (4, 7, 2)>
<3, (1, 13, 2)>
