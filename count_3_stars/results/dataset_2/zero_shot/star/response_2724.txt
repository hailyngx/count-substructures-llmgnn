Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 12) (3, 13) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 19) (15, 13) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (2, 5) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 6) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 19) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 4) (1, 9) (18, 3) (18, 17) (18, 0) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

<11, (16, 10, 19)>
<3, (13, 18, 4)>
<15, (19, 13, 14)>
<17, (14, 18, 4)>
<10, (6, 12, 7)>
