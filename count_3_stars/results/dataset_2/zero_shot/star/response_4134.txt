Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 3) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 10) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 3) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 13, 12)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>
<4, (9, 12, 14)>
<7, (0, 3, 1)>
<8, (9, 13, 2)>
<2, (9, 8, 12)>
<0, (7, 14, 3)>
<3, (7, 0, 6)>
