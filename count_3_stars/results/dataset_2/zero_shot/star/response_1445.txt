Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 14) (15, 18) (15, 8) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 0) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 1) (17, 19) (1, 17) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 13) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 12) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 16) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 16) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 11) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

<3, (7, 4, 14)>
<15, (18, 8, 19)>
<6, (2, 12, 16)>
<9, (8, 11, 12)>
<4, (7, 0, 2)>
<7, (3, 4, 14)>
<8, (15, 11, 13)>
<13, (19, 0, 8)>
<10, (18, 2, 5)>
<17, (1, 19, 17)>
<5, (7, 18, 19)>
<0, (4, 16, 13)>
