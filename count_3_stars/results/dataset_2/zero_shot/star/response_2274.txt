Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 5) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 10) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 14)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<13, (0, 8, 11)>
