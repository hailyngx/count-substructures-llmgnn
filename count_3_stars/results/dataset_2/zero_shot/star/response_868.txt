Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

[<5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>, <7, (9, 4, 0)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
