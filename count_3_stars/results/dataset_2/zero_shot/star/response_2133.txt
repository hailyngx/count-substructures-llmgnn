Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
