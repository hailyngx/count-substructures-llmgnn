Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by counting the number of times each node appears as the center of a 3-star. 
From the provided edges, we can construct the following 3-stars:
<6, (9, 8, 0)>, <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <5, (6, 1, 4)>, <0, (6, 5, )>, <7, (9, 5, 3)>, <8, (6, 9, 3)>, <3, (6, 9, 7)>, <2, (9, 3, 1)>, <1, (5, 8, 2)>, <4, (9, 5, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
