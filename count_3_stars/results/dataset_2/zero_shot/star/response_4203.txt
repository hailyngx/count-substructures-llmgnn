Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 5) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (8, 9, 5)>
<1, (7, 3, 2)>
<3, (7, 1, 5)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 9, 5)>
