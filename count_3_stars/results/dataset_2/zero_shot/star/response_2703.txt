Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 18) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 15) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (0, 17) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 15) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 3) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 14) (19, 2) (2, 19) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 5) 

Response:
There are <14, (0, 17, 15)> and <16, (18, 10, 11)> 3-stars in this graph. 

The total number of 3-stars is [2].
