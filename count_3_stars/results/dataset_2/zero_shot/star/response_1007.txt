Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 25) (27, 11) (27, 7) (27, 5) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 21) (3, 13) (10, 0) (10, 23) (17, 28) (17, 19) (17, 15) (26, 1) (26, 25) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 12) (22, 2) (11, 27) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 29) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 4) (15, 28) (8, 29) (8, 16) (9, 7) (9, 19) (21, 3) (21, 12) (21, 29) (2, 22) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 4) (19, 17) (19, 9) (19, 16) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 23) (24, 20) (24, 25) (5, 27) (6, 14) (6, 25) (6, 23) (28, 17) (28, 15) (28, 12) (20, 24) (20, 23) (4, 15) (4, 2) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 18) (25, 0) (25, 26) (25, 24) (25, 6) (25, 18) (29, 11) (29, 8) (29, 21) (29, 12) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 13) (18, 25) (12, 14) (12, 21) (12, 28) (12, 29) (7, 27) (7, 9) (7, 2) (23, 10) (23, 16) (23, 6) (23, 20) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (10, 14, 25)>
<3, (1, 11, 13)>
<11, (3, 18, 29)>
<15, (4, 17, 28)>
<16, (2, 19, 23)>
<25, (18, 24, 6)>
