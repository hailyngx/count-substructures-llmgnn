Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 20) (2, 11) (18, 19) (18, 20) (18, 1) (19, 18) (19, 29) (19, 27) (26, 7) (26, 0) (26, 4) (21, 24) (21, 13) (21, 25) (24, 21) (24, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (22, 6) (22, 29) (22, 1) (22, 8) (4, 26) (4, 27) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 3) (27, 19) (27, 4) (0, 26) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 8) (7, 26) (7, 0) (7, 25) (7, 10) (7, 5) (25, 21) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 6) (25, 15) (16, 0) (11, 2) (11, 24) (11, 8) (11, 17) (5, 7) (5, 23) (5, 17) (5, 10) (23, 5) (23, 29) (23, 20) (13, 21) (13, 9) (13, 10) (28, 10) (3, 4) (8, 22) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 15) (1, 18) (1, 22) (1, 4) (1, 25) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 12) (29, 19) (29, 22) (29, 23) (20, 2) (20, 18) (20, 23) (6, 22) (6, 25) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 28) (12, 9) (12, 17) (15, 25) (15, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 3-stars in the given graph.

- <4, (1, 27, 14)>
- <11, (2, 24, 17)>
- <21, (24, 13, 25)>
- <25, (6, 7, 15)>
- <7, (0, 5, 25)>
- <22, (1, 6, 29)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
