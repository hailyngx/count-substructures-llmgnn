Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 10) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (12, 1) (12, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 8, 12)>
<2, (4, 11, 14)>
<7, (4, 8, 13)>
