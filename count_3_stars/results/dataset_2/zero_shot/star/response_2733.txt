Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (14, 4) (17, 1) (17, 6) (10, 0) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 18) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 15) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 6) (0, 10) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 13) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 13) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 13) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 15) (6, 19) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 18) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:

<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (12, 15, 17)>

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
