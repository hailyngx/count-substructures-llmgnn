Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 16) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 13) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 18) (8, 19) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 15) (13, 10) (13, 17) (19, 8) (19, 16) (19, 12) (16, 3) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 18) (16, 2) (6, 10) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 12) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 14) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 18) (18, 1) (18, 17) (18, 16) (18, 12) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
 
Unique 3-stars:
<4, (11, 17, 7)>
<10, (17, 6, 13)>
<17, (4, 10, 13)>
<0, (16, 15, 14)>
<16, (3, 19, 0)>
<11, (7, 5, 2)>
<2, (7, 16, 5)>
<5, (11, 12, 2)>
