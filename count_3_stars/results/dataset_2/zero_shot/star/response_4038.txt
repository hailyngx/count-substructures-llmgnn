Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 12) (16, 25) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 28) (7, 0) (7, 22) (6, 28) (6, 26) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 10) (1, 15) (1, 22) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 24) (3, 23) (3, 29) (12, 16) (12, 1) (12, 27) (12, 2) (27, 12) (27, 23) (28, 4) (28, 6) (28, 25) (17, 11) (17, 9) (17, 29) (17, 5) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 15) (29, 22) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (15, 1) (15, 29) (15, 10) (15, 23) (15, 14) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 21) (8, 18) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 24) (10, 23) (19, 8) (19, 2) (5, 17) (5, 2) (26, 6) (26, 2) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 5) (2, 26) (24, 3) (24, 10) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 20) (14, 13) (20, 14) (20, 21) (23, 3) (23, 27) (23, 15) (23, 10) (21, 8) (21, 20) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 25) (25, 16) (25, 28) (25, 13) (18, 8) (22, 7) (22, 1) (22, 29) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be obtained by identifying all the nodes that satisfy the condition of being the center of a 3-star. 

Calculating the degrees for each node:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 1
- Node 19: degree 2
- Node 20: degree 2
- Node 21: degree 2
- Node 22: degree 3
- Node 23: degree 4
- Node 24: degree 2
- Node 25: degree 3
- Node 26: degree 2
- Node 27: degree 2
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 4

Identifying the 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 7, 6)>
- <1, (12, 15, 22)>
- <2, (12, 5, 26)>
- <3, (14, 15, 29)>
- <4, (13, 0, 28)>
- <8, (9, 21, 19)>
- <9, (8, 10, 17)>
- <10, (9, 15, 24)>
- <12, (16, 27, 1)>
- <13, (25, 14, 4)>
- <14, (14, 13, 20)>
- <15, (1, 14, 23)>
- <17, (11, 17, 29)>
- <22, (7, 29, 1)>
- <23, (29, 15, 3)>
- <25, (16, 13, 28)>
- <26, (6, 2, 28)>
- <27, (12, 23, 2)>

Count of 3-stars: [17]
