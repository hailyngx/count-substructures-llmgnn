Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 1) (6, 14) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 10) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 10) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 12) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: <8, (4, 2, 0)>, <13, (4, 3, 9)>, <11, (2, 3, 1)>, and <7, (13, 2, 14)>.
