Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (8, 13, 14)>
<1, (5, 7, 13)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (9, 10, 13)>
<4, (2, 9, 12)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (10, 11, 14)>
<7, (6, 7, 14)>
