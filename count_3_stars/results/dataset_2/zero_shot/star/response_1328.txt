Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 11) (3, 10) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 0) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 17) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 11) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 14) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 4) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 16) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 17) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 15) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 12) (9, 1) (9, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 12) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 10) (17, 2) (17, 15) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of ways to choose a central node with exactly 3 neighbors. Since each 3-star contributes 1 to the count, the final answer can be found by dividing this count by 3 (since each 3-star is counted 3 times, once for each leaf node).

Let's first list out the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (11, 10, 19)>
<8, (13, 18, 14)>
<13, (8, 16, 0)>
<2, (18, 6, 17)>
<18, (8, 2, 11)>
<11, (3, 18, 14)>
<0, (13, 7, 15)>
<7, (8, 0, 6)>
<5, (1, 19, 12)>
<19, (7, 5, 10)>
<15, (0, 16, 17)>
<16, (13, 19, 15)>
<14, (8, 11, 12)>
<9, (1, 4)>
<4, (5, 9)>
<6, (2, 7)>
<10, (3, 19)>
<12, (5, 14)>
<17, (2, 15)>

There are 20 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is: [20].
