Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 12) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 6) (12, 7) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 13) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be counted by finding all the unique 3-stars in the graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<1, (2, 5, 13)>
<1, (3, 7, 14)>
<1, (5, 11, 13)>
<1, (7, 8, 14)>
<1, (1, 5, 13)>
<3, (1, 11, 14)>
<3, (9, 4, 13)>
<10, (2, 8, 14)>
<10, (11, 2, 5)>
<10, (8, 0, 14)>
<11, (3, 5, 11)>
<4, (9, 13, 14)>
<8, (10, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 11, 13)>
<6, (8, 7, 12)>
<0, (8, 14, 7)>
<14, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 8, 12)>
<12, (6, 7, 12)>

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
