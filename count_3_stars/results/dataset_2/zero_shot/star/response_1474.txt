Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 25) (6, 11) (6, 26) (9, 29) (9, 18) (9, 16) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 13) (21, 7) (21, 13) (21, 26) (21, 8) (21, 5) (4, 8) (4, 25) (8, 21) (8, 4) (8, 25) (28, 0) (28, 25) (29, 9) (29, 11) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 15) (1, 7) (1, 15) (1, 10) (26, 6) (26, 21) (26, 14) (0, 28) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 26) (14, 0) (14, 2) (5, 21) (5, 0) (5, 24) (5, 15) (13, 7) (13, 21) (13, 17) (17, 12) (17, 13) (17, 20) (17, 24) (20, 17) (20, 19) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 5) (25, 6) (25, 4) (25, 8) (25, 28) (25, 27) (27, 25) (27, 11) (27, 16) (27, 23) (10, 12) (10, 1) (2, 14) (22, 16) (22, 24) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 3) (19, 7) (19, 20) (16, 9) (16, 27) (16, 22) (16, 18) (24, 5) (24, 17) (24, 22) (24, 23) (11, 6) (11, 29) (11, 27) (3, 18) (23, 27) (23, 24) 

Response:
