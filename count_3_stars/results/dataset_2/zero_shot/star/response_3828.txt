Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 12) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 12) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 7) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 9) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 9) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 4) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 3) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<5, (6, 8, 3)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 2)>
<0, (6, 10, 11)>
<2, (8, 10, 14)>
<14, (2, 7, 9)>
<13, (12, 4, 3)>
<1, (6, 11, 4)>
<10, (2, 0, 3)>
<7, (6, 2, 14)>
<11, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (13, 1, 10)>
<9, (14, 10, 7)>
<12, (8, 14, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
