Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 2) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 14) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 1) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 1) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (13, 8, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 11)>
<0, (7, 12, 10)>
<4, (12, 13, 11)>
<1, (14, 12, 10)>
