Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 19) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 18) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 14) (15, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 12) (16, 0) (16, 2) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 19) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 11) (14, 18) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 17) (18, 3) (18, 14) (18, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 9) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 17) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 6) (17, 9) (17, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (16, 10, 12)>
<1, (19, 11, 14)>
<2, (16, 9, 17)>
<3, (7, 8, 18)>
<4, (5, 9, 11)>
<5, (13, 4, 7)>
<6, (10, 12, 18)>
<7, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (13, 14, 18)>
