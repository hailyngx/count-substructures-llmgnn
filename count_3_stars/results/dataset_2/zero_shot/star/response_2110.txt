Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 27) (2, 29) (2, 27) (2, 28) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 26) (29, 25) (29, 22) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 23) (6, 8) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 23) (25, 2) (25, 29) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 10) (15, 23) (20, 21) (20, 13) (20, 16) (11, 3) (11, 28) (11, 17) (28, 2) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 19) (21, 20) (21, 13) (21, 18) (14, 26) (14, 13) (26, 29) (26, 14) (4, 12) (4, 24) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 22) (12, 8) (1, 25) (7, 29) (7, 28) (7, 27) (7, 17) (7, 8) (13, 20) (13, 21) (13, 14) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 7) (24, 4) (24, 18) (0, 12) (0, 22) (23, 6) (23, 3) (23, 15) (16, 20) (16, 22) (16, 19) (18, 21) (18, 24) (18, 10) (10, 25) (10, 18) (22, 29) (22, 12) (22, 0) (22, 16) (27, 9) (27, 2) (27, 7) (19, 28) (19, 16) (17, 11) (17, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<25, (2, 29, 3)>
<29, (2, 27, 6)>
<2, (29, 28, 25)>
<28, (11, 7, 19)>
<21, (20, 13, 18)>
<12, (4, 0, 22)>
