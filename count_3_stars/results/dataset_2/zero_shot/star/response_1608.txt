Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 9) (3, 19) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 29) (23, 6) (23, 20) (23, 9) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 2) (0, 7) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 29) (14, 16) (26, 28) (26, 20) (26, 11) (28, 1) (28, 26) (28, 7) (28, 27) (28, 12) (17, 8) (17, 20) (17, 24) (17, 2) (20, 23) (20, 26) (20, 17) (20, 9) (20, 6) (7, 0) (7, 28) (7, 10) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 24) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 5) (25, 21) (27, 28) (27, 21) (27, 18) (6, 1) (6, 23) (6, 8) (6, 20) (5, 22) (5, 16) (5, 11) (5, 21) (10, 7) (21, 13) (21, 25) (21, 27) (21, 5) (21, 29) (24, 17) (24, 15) (24, 4) (18, 27) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 19) (19, 3) (19, 14) (19, 2) (4, 16) (4, 24) (9, 1) (9, 23) (9, 20) (9, 15) (12, 14) (12, 28) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 5) (29, 22) (29, 14) (29, 21) 

Response:

<5, (11, 21, 22)>
<7, (0, 10, 28)>
<8, (6, 13, 17)>
<9, (1, 15, 23)>
<14, (16, 19, 29)>
<16, (4, 15, 24)>
<17, (2, 20, 24)>
<20, (6, 17, 23)>
<21, (5, 13, 25)>
<26, (11, 20, 28)>
<27, (18, 21, 28)>
