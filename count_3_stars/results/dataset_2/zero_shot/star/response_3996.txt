Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

<[5, (6, 2, 7)]>
<[9, (2, 3, 7)]>
<[6, (5, 7, 3)]>
<[1, (3, 2, 4)]>
<[3, (9, 6, 1)]>
<[8, (6, 1, 4)]>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
