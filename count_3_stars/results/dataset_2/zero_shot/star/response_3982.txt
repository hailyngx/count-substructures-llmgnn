Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 17) (9, 2) (9, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 14) (15, 16) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 18) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 13) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 16) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 15) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (18, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 19) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 6) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 2) (16, 15) (16, 12) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 13) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
[<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 9, 11)>, <5, (12, 17, 6)>, <7, (12, 13, 19)>, <8, (4, 14, 18)>]
