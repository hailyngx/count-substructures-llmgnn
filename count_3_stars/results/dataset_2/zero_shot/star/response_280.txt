Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 3) (27, 17) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 13) (14, 21) (17, 27) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 23) (2, 15) (2, 29) (29, 2) (29, 5) (29, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 27) (3, 1) (3, 16) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 23) (28, 6) (28, 7) (28, 20) (20, 28) (20, 13) (20, 22) (20, 4) (6, 28) (9, 18) (9, 19) (22, 14) (22, 20) (22, 24) (4, 27) (4, 20) (4, 26) (18, 9) (18, 26) (26, 4) (26, 18) (26, 0) (5, 29) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 5) (11, 1) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 25) (23, 17) (23, 10) (23, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 24) (24, 22) (24, 16) (25, 11) (25, 8) (8, 14) (8, 25) (8, 21) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 28) (7, 5) (7, 8) (12, 10) (0, 29) (0, 26) (0, 11) (13, 14) (13, 20) (21, 14) (21, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 3-star structures:
[<17, (27, 14, 10)>, <3, (27, 1, 16)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
