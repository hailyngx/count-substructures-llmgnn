Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 5) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 1) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (5, 16) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 17) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 0) (8, 6) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 13) (12, 16) (12, 1) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 19) (1, 15) (1, 12) (1, 19) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 [3-star] patterns in the given graph:

<3, (11, 15, 7)>
<5, (16, 9, 18)>
<6, (9, 10, 19)>
<7, (16, 3, 17)>
