Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (7, 5) (7, 12) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (9, 3, 6)>
<4, (11, 8, 12)>
<8, (11, 2, 0)>
<12, (11, 7, 2)>
