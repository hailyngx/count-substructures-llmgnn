This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 5) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 11) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 5) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 9) 

Response:
[<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 8, 14)>, <7, (2, 4, 12)>, <9, (4, 10, 0)>, <11, (4, 7, 13)>, <14, (5, 8, 3)>] [7]
