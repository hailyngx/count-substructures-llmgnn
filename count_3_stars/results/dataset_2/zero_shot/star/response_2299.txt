Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 11) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 10) 

Response:
There are [13] 3-stars in the graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (1, 9, 10)>
<9, (1, 5, 11)>
<6, (8, 12, 14)>
<4, (8, 10, 13)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 13)>
<8, (6, 7, 14)>
<7, (8, 11, 14)>
<0, (3, 5, 12)>
<12, (0, 6, 13)>
<13, (2, 4, 12)>
<10, (2, 4, 13)>
<2, (3, 10, 13)>
