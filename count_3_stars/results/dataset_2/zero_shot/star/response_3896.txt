Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 18) (10, 15) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 13) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 6) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 6) (9, 10) (9, 18) (13, 17) (13, 11) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 19) (18, 11) (19, 10) (19, 18) (19, 0) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 11) (14, 16) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 16) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 12) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 0) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 6) (5, 3) (5, 11) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (7, 2, 11)>
<15, (1, 10, 6)>
