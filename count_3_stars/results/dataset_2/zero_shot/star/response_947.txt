Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 8) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 4) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 13) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 1) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 9) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars found: 
<7, (12, 6, 14)>
<12, (7, 13, 14)>
<3, (11, 6, 9)>
<11, (3, 14, 9)>
<8, (7, 12, 3)>
<9, (3, 11, 13)>
<1, (7, 6, 2)>
<4, (11, 1, 0)>
