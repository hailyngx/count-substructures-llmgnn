Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 2) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which can be represented as follows:

<5, (2, 1, 10)>
<6, (9, 14, 7)>
<9, (11, 12, 14)>
<1, (3, 11, 8)>
<3, (10, 12, 1)>
<12, (2, 6, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
