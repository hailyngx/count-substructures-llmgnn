Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by examining each node and counting how many potential 3-stars it is a part of. A 3-star can be formed by selecting a central node and three leaves connected to it.

In this graph, the unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
