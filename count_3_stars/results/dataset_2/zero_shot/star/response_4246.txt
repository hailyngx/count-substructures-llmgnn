Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 14) (22, 15) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 29) (16, 26) (14, 22) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 4) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 15) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 27) (3, 24) (3, 26) (3, 18) (15, 13) (15, 22) (15, 17) (15, 6) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 20) (20, 0) (5, 11) (5, 6) (21, 25) (21, 24) (28, 7) (7, 28) (7, 29) (7, 27) (7, 26) (19, 22) (19, 2) (29, 16) (29, 7) (29, 26) (1, 14) (1, 24) (1, 27) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 19) (26, 16) (26, 3) (26, 7) (26, 29) (24, 3) (24, 21) (24, 1) (24, 12) (27, 9) (27, 7) (27, 1) (27, 8) (4, 14) (4, 10) (4, 25) (25, 13) (25, 21) (25, 4) (25, 23) (8, 27) (8, 12) (8, 18) (10, 4) (12, 24) (12, 8) (23, 13) (23, 25) (18, 6) (18, 3) (18, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [90] edges in the given graph. To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star structure. 

Upon analyzing the edges, we find the following unique 3-stars:

1. <13, (22, 15, 2)>
2. <22, (13, 19, 14)>
3. <11, (0, 5, 17)>
4. <16, (29, 26, 0)>
5. <14, (22, 17, 1)>
6. <17, (11, 14, 15)>
7. <6, (9, 5, 15)>
8. <9, (6, 2, 27)>
9. <3, (24, 26, 18)>
10. <15, (13, 22, 17)>
11. <0, (11, 6, 20)>
12. <20, (0, 21, 28)>
13. <5, (11, 6, 25)>
14. <21, (25, 24, 28)>
15. <28, (7, 21, 29)>
16. <7, (28, 29, 27)>
17. <19, (22, 2, 29)>
18. <29, (16, 7, 26)>
19. <1, (14, 24, 27)>
20. <2, (13, 9, 19)>
21. <26, (16, 3, 7)>
22. <24, (3, 21, 1)>
23. <27, (9, 7, 1)>
24. <4, (14, 10, 25)>
25. <10, (4, 12, 25)>
26. <12, (24, 8, 0)>
27. <23, (13, 25, 5)>
28. <18, (6, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].
