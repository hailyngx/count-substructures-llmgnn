Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 14) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 12) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
