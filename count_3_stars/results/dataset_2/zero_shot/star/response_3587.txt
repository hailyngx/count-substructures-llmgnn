Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 11) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
<5, (9, 11, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 13)>
<7, (4, 6, 12)>
<1, (11, 14, 0)>
<3, (0, 14, 10)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<12, (7, 1, 2)>
