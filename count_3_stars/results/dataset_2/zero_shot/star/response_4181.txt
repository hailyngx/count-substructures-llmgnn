Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 18) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 23) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 2) (20, 25) (20, 12) (25, 20) (25, 15) (25, 0) (25, 24) (0, 25) (0, 1) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 19) (18, 16) (18, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 26) (19, 2) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 4) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 27) (26, 12) (9, 24) (9, 7) (22, 28) (22, 12) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 5) (10, 18) (15, 25) (15, 7) (27, 26) (27, 21) (4, 19) (4, 28) (4, 21) (12, 20) (12, 26) (12, 22) (12, 5) (28, 22) (28, 4) (23, 14) (23, 26) (23, 29) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 15) (7, 6) (6, 14) (6, 7) (21, 8) (21, 27) (21, 4) (29, 11) (29, 23) (24, 17) (24, 25) (24, 9) (24, 1) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 24) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<11, (16, 3, 7)>
<14, (17, 6, 13)>
<17, (14, 2, 24)>
<25, (20, 0, 24)>
