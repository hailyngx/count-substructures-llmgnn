Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9 (Degree: 5)
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5 (Degree: 4)
Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8 (Degree: 5)
Node 3: 1, 2, 5 (Degree: 3)
Node 4: 0, 7, 8 (Degree: 3)
Node 5: 1, 3, 6 (Degree: 3)
Node 6: 2, 5, 7, 9 (Degree: 4)
Node 7: 4, 6, 8, 9 (Degree: 4)
Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 7, 9 (Degree: 5)
Node 9: 0, 6, 7, 8 (Degree: 4)

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 2, and Node 8 have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each. 
- Node 1, Node 6, and Node 7 have 4 neighbors, but they can't form any 3-stars as they need at least 3 neighbors to do so.

Total number of 3-stars formed = 3 * 10 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
