Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {9, 2, 7, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 2, 8, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 0, 7, 4}
- Node 3: {6, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 0, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 1, 3, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {9, 6, 1, 3, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8, 0}

Now, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 8, and Node 9 have 5, 5, and 4 neighbors respectively, so they can form 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can also form 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 8>, <6, 3, 8>, <6, 4, 0>
