Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 28) (3, 14) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 28) (0, 20) (0, 21) (0, 19) (20, 0) (20, 7) (1, 13) (1, 27) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 4) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 10) (6, 12) (28, 3) (28, 25) (28, 6) (28, 8) (7, 20) (7, 9) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 18) (2, 27) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 13) (13, 1) (13, 26) (13, 18) (13, 16) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 21) (9, 7) (9, 22) (22, 9) (22, 15) (22, 17) (10, 26) (10, 6) (15, 22) (15, 5) (15, 21) (29, 21) (24, 6) (24, 17) (24, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 11) (14, 27) (8, 28) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 15) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 17) (16, 18) (16, 13) (17, 22) (17, 24) (17, 5) (21, 0) (21, 11) (21, 15) (21, 29) (21, 23) (19, 0) (27, 1) (27, 2) (27, 14) (4, 26) (4, 24) (4, 5) (23, 3) (23, 21) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {20, 21, 19}
- Node 1: {13, 27}
- Node 2: {18, 27, 14}
- Node 3: {25, 11, 28, 14, 23}
- Node 4: {26, 24, 5}
- Node 5: {15, 8, 4, 17}
- Node 6: {28, 24, 10, 12}
- Node 7: {20, 9, 8}
- Node 8: {28, 7, 5}
- Node 9: {7, 22}
- Node 10: {26, 6}
- Node 11: {3, 12, 14, 21}
- Node 12: {6, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 26, 18, 16}
- Node 14: {3, 2, 18, 11, 27}
- Node 15: {22, 21, 5}
- Node 16: {18, 13}
- Node 17: {22, 24, 5}
- Node 18: {2, 13, 16, 14}
- Node 19: {0}
- Node 20: {0, 7}
- Node 21: {0, 11, 15, 29, 23}
- Node 22: {9, 15, 17}
- Node 23: {3, 21}
- Node 24: {6, 17, 4}
- Node 25: {3, 28}
- Node 26: {13, 10, 4}
- Node 27: {1, 2, 14}
- Node 28: {3, 25, 6, 8}
- Node 29: {21}

Nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 (3 neighbors)
- Node 5 (4 neighbors)
- Node 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 11 (4 neighbors)
- Node 14 (5 neighbors)
- Node 15 (3 neighbors)
- Node 17 (3 neighbors)
- Node 18 (4 neighbors)
- Node 21 (5 neighbors)
- Node 24 (3 neighbors)
- Node 26 (3 neighbors)
- Node 27 (3 neighbors)
- Node 28 (4 neighbors)

Calculating the number of 3-stars:    
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = \sum \text{inom}(d_i, 3) \]   
where \(d_i\) is the degree of each node with \(d_i \geq 3\).   

\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = \text{inom}(3, 3) + \text{inom}(4, 3) \times 6 + \text{inom}(5, 3) \times 2 \]  
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = 1 + 4 \times 6 + 10 \times 2 \]  
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = 1 + 24 + 20 \]  
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = 45 \]  

So, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [45].  

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (11, 14, 28)>
<5, (8, 17, 24)>
<5, (8, 17, 5)>
<8, (5, 17, 24)>
<11, (3, 14, 21)>
<14, (3, 11, 27)>
<15, (21, 22, 29)>
<18, (13, 16, 27)>
<21, (11, 15, 23)>
<21, (15, 23, 29)>
<21, (15, 22, 29)>
