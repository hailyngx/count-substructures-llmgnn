Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 10) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 13) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 4, 11}
- Node 1: {5, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 12}
- Node 3: {11, 7, 12, 8, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 0, 10, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 1, 2, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 0, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 3, 5, 2}
- Node 9: {8, 10}
- Node 10: {9, 4, 12}
- Node 11: {3, 5, 14, 7, 0}
- Node 12: {3, 5, 2, 10}
- Node 13: {6, 2, 14}
- Node 14: {11, 7, 4, 13}

Now, for the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we can count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star

There is a total of 8 3-stars in the graph. 

So the final answer is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 11>
<3, 5, 11>
<4, 10, 14>
<5, 6, 8>
<8, 9, 3>
<11, 7, 14>
<12, 2, 10>
<14, 13, 11>
