Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 14) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 6) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 0) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 12) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 11}
- Node 5: {7, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {2, 3}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 11: {4, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 13: {5, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 14: {5, 6, 7, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 6}, giving <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 2, 12}, giving <6, (0, 2, 12)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {11, 13, 14}, giving <7, (11, 13, 14)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 3, 6}, giving <12, (1, 3, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is therefore [4].
