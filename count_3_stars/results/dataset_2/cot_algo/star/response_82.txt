Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 11) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 2) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 2) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 13) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 11, 12, 14}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {2, 5, 8, 12, 13}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 11, 12, 14}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {0, 12, 13}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {6, 7, 8, 10, 11}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 8}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4, 12}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {4, 9, 10, 13}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 13}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {7, 11}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {4, 7, 13}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 9}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {1, 7, 8, 10}

Now, we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

1. Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
3. Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
5. Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
6. Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
7. Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
8. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
9. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
10. Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
11. Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
12. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
13. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
14. Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
15. Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Combining all the 3-stars, we have a total of 40 3-stars in the graph, which can be represented as [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 2, 12>
<0, 12, 14>
<2, 5, 12>
