Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 11) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 12) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 0) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 12) (2, 11) (2, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 5, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 2: neighbors {10, 11}
- Node 3: neighbors {5, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 4: neighbors {6, 10, 11}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 3, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 4, 10, 14}
- Node 7: neighbors {8, 9, 10}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 1, 7, 12}
- Node 9: neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 10: neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 11: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 14}
- Node 12: neighbors {0, 3, 8, 13}
- Node 13: neighbors {5, 10, 12}
- Node 14: neighbors {1, 5, 6, 11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1, 4, 6, 8, and 11 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
