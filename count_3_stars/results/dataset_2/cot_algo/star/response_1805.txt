Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 7) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 17) (17, 13) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 15) (4, 2) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 9) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 13) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 1) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 18) (3, 5) (14, 6) (14, 16) (14, 5) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 19) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 5) (16, 10) (16, 14) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 6) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 15) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 1) (15, 4) (15, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 12, 1}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 7, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 18, 19, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8, 9, 19, 15, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 14, 1}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 14, 19}
- Node 7: Neighbors {13, 17, 19, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 9, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8, 10, 4, 18}
- Node 10: Neighbors {11, 9, 16}
- Node 11: Neighbors {10, 17}
- Node 12: Neighbors {13, 0, 15}
- Node 13: Neighbors {17, 12, 7}
- Node 14: Neighbors {6, 16, 5}
- Node 15: Neighbors {4, 12}
- Node 16: Neighbors {10, 14}
- Node 17: Neighbors {13, 11, 7}
- Node 18: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 19: Neighbors {4, 2, 7, 6}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 8, 9, and 19: <4, (8, 9, 19)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 13, 17, and 19: <7, (13, 17, 19)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 8, 10, and 18: <9, (8, 10, 18)>

Total number of 3-stars = 3, so the final answer is [3].
