Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 7}

Next, we identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 4, 6, and 8 have 4 neighbors.
- Node 1, 2, and 7 have 5 neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 46

Therefore, the final answer is [46], with unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
