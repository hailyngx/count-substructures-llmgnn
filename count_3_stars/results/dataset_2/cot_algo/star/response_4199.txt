Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 3) (27, 5) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 0) (13, 6) (23, 15) (23, 8) (23, 4) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 21) (28, 26) (28, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 16) (19, 21) (19, 6) (19, 9) (14, 15) (14, 26) (14, 22) (14, 9) (16, 13) (16, 1) (21, 26) (21, 19) (21, 2) (21, 17) (29, 1) (2, 21) (2, 5) (2, 20) (2, 11) (5, 27) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (3, 27) (3, 17) (3, 24) (3, 12) (17, 21) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 11) (9, 28) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 17) (9, 25) (25, 9) (25, 12) (22, 14) (24, 13) (24, 3) (24, 10) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 18) (6, 20) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 25) (12, 11) (10, 5) (10, 24) (11, 2) (11, 17) (11, 12) (4, 23) (18, 6) (20, 2) (20, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are:
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors: {8, 16, 24, 0, 6, 1}
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {13, 23, 7, 0}
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: {27, 1, 23, 14}
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {15, 26, 22, 9}
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors: {26, 19, 2, 17}
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors: {15, 3, 5, 1}
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {27, 2, 12, 10}
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {27, 17, 24, 12}
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: {28, 19, 14, 17, 25}
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: {28, 14, 21}
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {13, 7, 1}
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {8, 0, 6}
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors: {15, 8, 4}
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: {13, 7, 19, 18, 20}
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {21, 5, 20, 11}
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: {5, 3, 25, 11}
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: {21, 3, 9, 11}
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors: {13, 3, 10}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 13 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 27 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 26 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 23 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up all these possible 3-stars gives us a total of 69, so the final answer is [69].
