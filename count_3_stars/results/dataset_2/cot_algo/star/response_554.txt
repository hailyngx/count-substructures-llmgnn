Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9 and the edges are provided. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: {9, 6, 1, 4, 0}
   - inom{5}{3} = 10
   - Total 3-stars: 10

2. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {5, 4, 2, 3}
   - inom{4}{3} = 4
   - Total 3-stars: 10 + 4 = 14

3. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {5, 9, 7, 3}
   - inom{4}{3} = 4
   - Total 3-stars: 14 + 4 = 18

4. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {4, 3, 6, 2, 1}
   - inom{5}{3} = 10
   - Total 3-stars: 18 + 10 = 28

Final total number of 3-stars: [28]

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (4, 3, 1)>
