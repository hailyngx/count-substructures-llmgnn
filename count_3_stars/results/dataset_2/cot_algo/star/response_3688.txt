Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 10) (2, 0) (2, 10) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 17) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 17) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 7) (19, 4) (19, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 17) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 14) (6, 18) (16, 17) (4, 1) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 19) (9, 10) (9, 4) (7, 13) (7, 18) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 10}
- Node 1: {4, 9, 17}
- Node 2: {0, 10}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 9, 11, 19}
- Node 5: {12, 13, 17}
- Node 6: {18}
- Node 7: {13, 18}
- Node 8: {3, 12, 15}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 10, 19}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 11: {4, 12, 14, 17, 18}
- Node 12: {5, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {5, 7, 15, 17}
- Node 14: {11, 12}
- Node 15: {8, 13, 17}
- Node 16: {17}
- Node 17: {1, 5, 11, 15, 16}
- Node 18: {6, 7, 11}
- Node 19: {4, 9}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors where we can form 3-stars are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, and 19. Let's calculate the total number of unique 3-stars:

- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (where only 1 3-star is formed):
  - Node 0: 1 3-star
    <0, (2, 3, 10)>

- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
  - Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    <1, (9, 17, 4)>
  
  - Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    <3, (8, 0, 9)>
  
  - Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    <4, (19, 1, 9)>, <4, (9, 11, 19)>, <4, (11, 4, 19)>, <4, (1, 4, 9)>
    
  - Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    <5, (13, 17, 12)>, <5, (13, 17, 15)>, <5, (13, 12, 15)>, <5, (17, 12, 15)>
  
  - Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    <8, (12, 3, 15)>
  
  - Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    <9, (1, 4, 19)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 19, 10)>, <9, (1, 9, 10)>, <9, (4, 19, 10)>
    <9, (4, 9, 19)>, <9, (9, 10, 0)>, <9, (9, 10, 19)>, <9, (4, 9, 10)>, <9, (10, 0, 2)>
    
  - Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    <11, (4, 12, 17)>, <11, (4, 12, 18)>, <11, (4, 14, 18)>, <11, (4, 11, 12)>, <11, (4, 17, 18)>
    <11, (12, 14, 18)>, <11, (12, 11, 14)>, <11, (12, 18, 6)>, <11, (17, 15, 13)>, <11, (17, 18, 15)>
  
  - Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    <12, (11, 14, 5)>, <12, (14, 11, 4)>, <12, (14, 11, 12)>, <12, (11, 5, 14)>
  
  - Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    <13, (7, 15, 5)>, <13, (7, 18, 5)>, <13, (18, 17, 5)>, <13, (15, 17, 5)>
  
  - Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    <15, (13, 17, 8)>
  
  - Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    <17, (11, 15, 18)>, <17, (11, 15, 13)>, <17, (15, 16, 17)>, <17, (11, 18, 15)>, <17, (11, 13, 15)>
    <17, (15, 16, 17)>, <17, (13, 15, 5)>, <17, (13, 15, 7)>, <17, (15, 18, 13)>, <17, (15, 7, 18)>
    
  - Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    <19, (4, 9, 1)>, <19, (4, 9, 10)>, <19, (4, 9, 19)>, <19, (9, 10, 0)>
  
Summing up all the unique 3-stars, we have a total of 36 unique 3-stars. Thus, the final number inside brackets is [36].
