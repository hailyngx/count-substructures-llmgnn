Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 14) (3, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 13) (2, 0) (2, 6) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 19) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 12) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 17) (13, 0) (13, 5) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 17) (9, 18) (9, 8) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 17) (14, 1) (14, 3) (15, 12) (15, 16) (19, 0) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 12) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 19) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (16, 18) (16, 15) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {2, 5, 13, 19}
Node 1: {8, 11, 14}
Node 2: {0, 6}
Node 3: {4, 14}
Node 4: {3, 18, 19}
Node 5: {0, 12, 13, 17}
Node 6: {2, 10, 19}
Node 7: {11, 17, 19}
Node 8: {1, 9, 10, 17}
Node 9: {8, 18}
Node 10: {6, 8}
Node 11: {1, 7, 12}
Node 12: {5, 11, 15, 18, 19}
Node 13: {0, 5}
Node 14: {1, 3}
Node 15: {12, 16}
Node 16: {15, 18}
Node 17: {5, 7, 8}
Node 18: {4, 9, 12, 16}
Node 19: {0, 4, 6, 7, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 1: No 3-stars (only 3 neighbors)
Node 2: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
Node 3: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 6: No 3-stars (only 3 neighbors)
Node 7: No 3-stars (only 3 neighbors)
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 9: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
Node 10: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
Node 11: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 12: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 13: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
Node 14: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
Node 15: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
Node 16: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
Node 17: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 18: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 19: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (2, 5, 19)>
<0, (5, 12, 19)>
<0, (13, 5, 19)>
