Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 15) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 7) (8, 11) (8, 18) (13, 3) (13, 19) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 6) (0, 3) (0, 11) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 12) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 4) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 1) (3, 13) (3, 0) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 15) (7, 17) (4, 2) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 10) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 11
- Node 1: 5, 10, 12
- Node 2: 11, 4, 17
- Node 3: 13, 0
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 9, 1, 16
- Node 6: 14, 17, 10, 15
- Node 7: 17
- Node 8: 11, 18
- Node 9: 5, 15
- Node 10: 1, 6, 15, 16, 19
- Node 11: 8, 0, 2, 18
- Node 12: 17, 16, 18, 1
- Node 13: 3, 19
- Node 14: 17, 6, 19, 15
- Node 15: 9, 14, 10, 6
- Node 16: 5, 10, 12
- Node 17: 14, 6, 12, 2, 7
- Node 18: 8, 12, 11
- Node 19: 14, 13, 10

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 10, 12, 15, 17, 11, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (5, 10, 12)>
- <10, (1, 15, 6)>
- <12, (17, 16, 18)>
- <15, (9, 14, 6)>
- <17, (14, 6, 7)>
- <11, (8, 0, 2)>
- <19, (14, 13, 10)>
