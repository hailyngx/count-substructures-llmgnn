Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 8}

Now, we can see that the nodes 0, 1, 6, and 8 have 6 or more neighbors, which means we can form 3-stars with these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the final answer is [60], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, and <8, (0, 2, 4)>.
