Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 4, 5, and 9 have 5 neighbors each.

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star formed with that node.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 9, each with 5 neighbors, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Since there are 5 nodes with 5 neighbors each, the total number of 3-stars is \( 5 \times 10 = 50 \).

Therefore, the final result is [50], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4)>
