Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 7, 8, 2}
- Node 1: {9, 6, 3, 4}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 6, 1, 4}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 4, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {9, 0}
- Node 8: {5, 4, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {6, 3, 1, 7, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44 \]

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [44].
