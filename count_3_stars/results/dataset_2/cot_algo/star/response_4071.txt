Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 7
Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 8
Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6
Node 4: 5, 6, 8
Node 5: 1, 2, 4
Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
Node 7: 1, 9
Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 6, 9
Node 9: 0, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 0.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 8.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 9.

Adding these up, we have a total of 24 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [24].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 9>
<6, 9, 7>
