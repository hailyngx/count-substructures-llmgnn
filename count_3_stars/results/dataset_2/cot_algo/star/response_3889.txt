Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 10) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 2, 3, 7
- Node 1 neighbors: 4, 7, 10, 13
- Node 2 neighbors: 8, 9, 11, 14
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 9, 11, 14
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 7
- Node 5 neighbors: 10, 11, 12
- Node 6 neighbors: 3, 9, 13, 14
- Node 7 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 10, 12, 13
- Node 8 neighbors: 2, 11
- Node 9 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 14
- Node 10 neighbors: 1, 5, 7
- Node 11 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
- Node 12 neighbors: 5, 7, 13, 14
- Node 13 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 11, 12
- Node 14 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 12

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 4 neighbors.
- Node 2: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 4 neighbors.
- Node 3: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 5 neighbors.
- Node 4: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 5: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 4 neighbors.
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 9: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 4 neighbors.
- Node 10: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 11: [1]
- Node 12: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 4 neighbors.
- Node 13: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 5 neighbors.
- Node 14: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 4 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <11, (2, 5, 13)>
