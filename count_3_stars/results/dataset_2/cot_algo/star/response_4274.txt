Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 6}

Next, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 6, and Node 8 each have 4 neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 38, so the final answer is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4), (0, 2, 5), (1, 2, 8), (2, 0, 8)>
- <6, (0, 7, 9), (3, 4, 7), (3, 5, 8), (4, 6, 7), (7, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
