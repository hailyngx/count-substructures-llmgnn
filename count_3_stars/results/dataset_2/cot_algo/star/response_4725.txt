Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 4, 13, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 7, 3, 14, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 1, 10, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 7, 0, 14, 11}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 4, 0, 3, 10, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 0, 14, 12, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 6, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 11}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 2, 1}
- Node 10: Neighbors {5, 3, 11, 12}
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 10, 14, 13, 8}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 10, 6}
- Node 13: Neighbors {11, 0, 6}
- Node 14: Neighbors {5, 4, 1, 11, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 1: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 3: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 4: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 5: inom(6, 3) = 20
- Node 6: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 9: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 10: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 11: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 14: inom(5, 3) = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 86

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [86].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 5, 14>
- <1, 11, 14>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 3, 10>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 4, 14>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <1, 6, 12>
- <3, 5, 10>
- <4, 11, 14>
- <4, 7, 6>
- <5, 9, 14>
- <6, 12, 14>
