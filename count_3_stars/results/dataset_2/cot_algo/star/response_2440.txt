Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (4, 6) (4, 12) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 10) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 2) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 3}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 4: {6, 12}
- Node 5: {2, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 7: {11, 12}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 10}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {2, 5, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 7, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {5, 6, 12}
- Node 14: {2, 5}

Next, we will count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 35 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 102

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [102].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 3>
<2, 0, 5>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 10>
<3, 5, 11>
<3, 6, 13>
<5, 6, 10>
<5, 6, 11>
<5, 10, 12>
<6, 8, 9>
<6, 9, 13>
<10, 11, 12>
<11, 5, 7>
<12, 7, 10>
<12, 7, 11>
