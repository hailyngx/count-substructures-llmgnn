Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 15) (1, 12) (1, 16) (17, 5) (17, 18) (13, 5) (13, 19) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (15, 14) (15, 4) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 8) (19, 13) (19, 18) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 6) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 18) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 4) (4, 15) (4, 6) (4, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 11) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: {2, 5, 9, 14}
Node 1: {12, 16}
Node 2: {0, 7, 10, 11}
Node 3: {4, 9, 12}
Node 4: {3, 6, 15}
Node 5: {0, 9, 13, 17}
Node 6: {4, 10, 16}
Node 7: {2, 11, 12, 16}
Node 8: {10, 18}
Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 10}
Node 10: {2, 6, 8, 9}
Node 11: {2, 7}
Node 12: {1, 3, 7}
Node 13: {5, 19}
Node 14: {0, 15}
Node 15: {4, 14}
Node 16: {1, 6, 7, 18}
Node 17: {5, 18}
Node 18: {8, 16, 17, 19}
Node 19: {13, 18}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with nodes having 3 or more neighbors:

Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 16: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 18: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 29

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 7, 11)>
<3, (4, 6, 15)>
<5, (0, 9, 13)>
<7, (2, 11, 12)>
<9, (0, 3, 10)>
<10, (2, 6, 8)>
<12, (1, 3, 7)>
<16, (1, 6, 18)>
<18, (8, 16, 17)>
