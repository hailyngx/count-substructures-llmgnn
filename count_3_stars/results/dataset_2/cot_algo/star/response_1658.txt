Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 11) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 4) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) (4, 11) (4, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 1) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph and their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 11}
- Node 3: {7, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {11, 14}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 14}
- Node 8: {6, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {8, 9, 11}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 4, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 13: {3, 6, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 13}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 5
- Nodes with 4 or more neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

For nodes with 3 neighbors, they form 1 3-star each because they have exactly 3 neighbors.
For nodes with 4 or more neighbors, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) where n is the number of neighbors. 

Calculating for each:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Forms a 3-star)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Forms a 3-star)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 10) + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 91

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [91].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 14, 2)>
- <1, (0, 12, 9)>
- <2, (0, 7, 14)>
- <6, (7, 13, 14)>
- <7, (0, 6, 14)>
- <8, (6, 10, 13)>
- <9, (1, 10, 12)>
- <10, (6, 11, 9)>
- <11, (0, 13, 4)>
- <12, (1, 3, 9)>
- <13, (3, 6, 14)>
- <14, (0, 4, 7)>
