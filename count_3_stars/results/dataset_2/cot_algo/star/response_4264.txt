Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 26) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 24) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 29) (14, 13) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 24) (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 13) (20, 18) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 23) (26, 3) (26, 11) (24, 15) (24, 1) (24, 0) (24, 22) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 20) (13, 23) (10, 5) (21, 14) (21, 12) (21, 23) (21, 4) (27, 25) (27, 11) (27, 7) (28, 3) (28, 18) (28, 2) (18, 20) (18, 28) (18, 9) (4, 21) (4, 22) (4, 6) (22, 24) (22, 4) (12, 21) (16, 17) (16, 25) (9, 18) (9, 0) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 24) (0, 9) (0, 2) (29, 14) (29, 11) (7, 20) (7, 27) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 8) (11, 26) (11, 27) (11, 29) (11, 6) (23, 25) (23, 13) (23, 21) (2, 15) (2, 28) (2, 0) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first construct the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 15, 24, 2, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 17, 5}
- Node 2: {3, 15, 28, 0, 6}
- Node 3: {15, 1, 17, 26, 0}
- Node 4: {21, 22, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 10, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 11, 2}
- Node 7: {20, 27}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {18, 0}
- Node 10: {5}
- Node 11: {26, 27, 29, 6}
- Node 12: {21}
- Node 13: {14, 17, 20, 23}
- Node 14: {17, 29, 13, 21}
- Node 15: {3, 2, 28, 0}
- Node 16: {17, 25}
- Node 17: {14, 1, 13, 16}
- Node 18: {20, 28, 9}
- Node 20: {25, 7, 13, 18}
- Node 21: {14, 4, 23, 12}
- Node 22: {24, 4}
- Node 23: {25, 13, 21}
- Node 24: {15, 1, 0, 22}
- Node 25: {20, 27, 16, 23}
- Node 26: {3, 11}
- Node 27: {25, 7, 11}
- Node 28: {3, 15, 2, 18}
- Node 29: {14, 11}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars by looking at nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [1] - <0, 3, 15>, <0, 3, 24>, <0, 15, 24>
- Node 1: [1] - <1, 3, 17>
- Node 2: [0]
- Node 3: [4] - <3, 15, 1>, <3, 15, 0>, <3, 15, 2>, <3, 15, 28>
- Node 4: [0]
- Node 5: [0]
- Node 6: [1] - <6, 11, 2>
- Node 7: [0]
- Node 8: [0]
- Node 9: [0]
- Node 10: [0]
- Node 11: [1] - <11, 26, 27>
- Node 12: [0]
- Node 13: [1] - <13, 14, 17>
- Node 14: [1] - <14, 17, 29>
- Node 15: [0]
- Node 16: [0]
- Node 17: [1] - <17, 1, 13>
- Node 18: [0]
- Node 20: [0]
- Node 21: [0]
- Node 22: [0]
- Node 23: [0]
- Node 24: [0]
- Node 25: [0]
- Node 26: [0]
- Node 27: [0]
- Node 28: [0]
- Node 29: [0]
