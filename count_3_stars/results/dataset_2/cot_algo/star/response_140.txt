Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6
Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 8
Node 2: 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 3: 0, 8, 9
Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 7
Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 9
Node 7: 4, 5, 8
Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 8, 3

Now, let's identify any nodes that have three or more neighbors to see if they form 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, 1, 5>
<1, 0, 5>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 2, 9>
<5, 0, 1>
<6, 2, 9>
<8, 3, 9>
<9, 2, 4>
<9, 3, 8>
