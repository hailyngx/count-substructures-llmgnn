Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 1) (26, 18) (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 24) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 22) (6, 27) (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 19) (25, 12) (25, 24) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 23) (1, 18) (2, 12) (2, 7) (18, 26) (18, 1) (18, 29) (15, 17) (15, 28) (20, 27) (20, 4) (0, 29) (0, 19) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 16) (19, 25) (19, 0) (19, 22) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 23) (21, 8) (28, 15) (28, 21) (13, 16) (13, 29) (13, 23) (13, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 27) (10, 21) (10, 8) (24, 5) (24, 25) (22, 6) (22, 19) (22, 12) (12, 25) (12, 2) (12, 22) (12, 17) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 29) (29, 18) (29, 0) (29, 13) (29, 7) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 10) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 13) (17, 15) (17, 12) (27, 6) (27, 20) (27, 11) (4, 20) (4, 14) (23, 3) (23, 1) (23, 21) (23, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {19, 29}
- Node 1: {3, 9, 18, 23}
- Node 2: {7, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 11, 23, 25}
- Node 4: {14, 20}
- Node 5: {8, 9, 24}
- Node 6: {7, 9, 22, 27}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 13, 29}
- Node 8: {5, 10, 21}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 6, 16}
- Node 10: {8, 21}
- Node 11: {3, 13, 27}
- Node 12: {2, 17, 22, 25}
- Node 13: {7, 11, 16, 23, 29}
- Node 14: {4, 16}
- Node 15: {17, 28}
- Node 16: {9, 13, 14}
- Node 17: {15, 12}
- Node 18: {1, 26, 29}
- Node 19: {0, 22, 25}
- Node 20: {4, 27}
- Node 21: {8, 10, 23, 28}
- Node 22: {6, 12, 19}
- Node 23: {1, 3, 13, 21}
- Node 24: {5, 25}
- Node 25: {3, 12, 19, 24}
- Node 26: {18}
- Node 27: {6, 11, 20}
- Node 28: {15, 21}
- Node 29: {7, 13, 18, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 5 3-stars.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star.

Adding up these individual counts, we get a total of 24 3-stars. So, the final answer is [24].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 9, 23)>, <3, (1, 9, 23)>, <6, (7, 9, 27)>, <7, (6, 13, 29)>, <8, (5, 10, 21)>, <9, (1, 5, 16)>, <11, (3, 13, 27)>, <12, (2, 17, 22)>, <13, (7, 11, 16)>, <16, (9, 13, 14)>, <21, (8, 10, 28)>, <22, (6, 12, 19)>, <23, (1, 3, 13)>, <25, (12, 19, 24)>, <29, (7, 13, 18)>
