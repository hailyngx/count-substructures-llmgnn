Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 4) (11, 15) (16, 12) (16, 26) (16, 27) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 27) (21, 5) (21, 25) (2, 1) (2, 29) (2, 14) (29, 2) (29, 5) (29, 4) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 26) (25, 21) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 15) (20, 25) (15, 11) (15, 25) (15, 27) (15, 17) (27, 16) (27, 1) (27, 15) (27, 24) (8, 23) (8, 4) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 13) (4, 11) (4, 29) (4, 8) (4, 19) (6, 24) (6, 12) (28, 9) (28, 7) (28, 12) (0, 14) (0, 22) (14, 2) (14, 23) (14, 0) (14, 18) (19, 4) (19, 26) (19, 22) (19, 24) (26, 16) (26, 3) (26, 19) (13, 23) (13, 17) (7, 25) (7, 28) (17, 15) (17, 13) (17, 24) (17, 22) (17, 18) (18, 14) (18, 17) (24, 3) (24, 27) (24, 6) (24, 19) (24, 17) (22, 0) (22, 19) (22, 17) (10, 9) (10, 5) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 28) (9, 28) (9, 10) (5, 1) (5, 21) (5, 29) (5, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {14, 22}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 5, 27}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 14, 29}
- Node 3: Neighbors {24, 25, 26}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8, 11, 19, 29}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 10, 21, 29}
- Node 6: Neighbors {12, 24}
- Node 7: Neighbors {25, 28}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 23}
- Node 9: Neighbors {10, 28}
- Node 10: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 15}
- Node 12: Neighbors {6, 16, 28}
- Node 13: Neighbors {17, 23}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 2, 18, 23}
- Node 15: Neighbors {11, 17, 25, 27}
- Node 16: Neighbors {12, 26, 27}
- Node 17: Neighbors {13, 15, 18, 22, 24}
- Node 18: Neighbors {14, 17}
- Node 19: Neighbors {4, 22, 24, 26}
- Node 20: Neighbors {25}
- Node 21: Neighbors {5, 25}
- Node 22: Neighbors {0, 17, 19}
- Node 23: Neighbors {8, 13, 14}
- Node 24: Neighbors {3, 6, 17, 19, 27}
- Node 25: Neighbors {3, 5, 7, 15, 20, 21}
- Node 26: Neighbors {3, 16, 19}
- Node 27: Neighbors {1, 15, 16, 24}
- Node 28: Neighbors {7, 9, 12}
- Node 29: Neighbors {2, 4, 5}

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars using the given neighbor information:

- Node 1, 5, 15, 25, and 29 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes.
- Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 51 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [51].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 5, 27)>
- <5, (1, 10, 29)>
- <15, (11, 17, 25)>
- <25, (3, 5, 15, 21)>
- <29, (2, 5, 4)>
