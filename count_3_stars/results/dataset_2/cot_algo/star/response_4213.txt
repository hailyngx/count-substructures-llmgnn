Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 13) (29, 7) (1, 3) (1, 25) (1, 14) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 18) (22, 23) (22, 15) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 19) (23, 14) (23, 25) (6, 9) (6, 25) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 17) (8, 5) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 12) (21, 26) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 7) (28, 20) (11, 28) (11, 15) (24, 0) (24, 4) (26, 23) (26, 21) (4, 24) (4, 27) (4, 25) (27, 21) (27, 4) (27, 7) (27, 13) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 29) (7, 28) (7, 27) (7, 0) (7, 16) (16, 28) (16, 7) (16, 25) (13, 2) (13, 27) (13, 18) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 5) (10, 21) (10, 15) (14, 1) (14, 23) (14, 15) (12, 6) (12, 21) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 23) (19, 17) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 20) (25, 1) (25, 23) (25, 6) (25, 4) (25, 16) (15, 22) (15, 11) (15, 0) (15, 10) (15, 14) (20, 28) (20, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we can identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 15, 24, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 14, 19, 25}
- Node 2: {13}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 18}
- Node 4: {24, 25, 27}
- Node 5: {8, 17, 20}
- Node 6: {9, 12, 25}
- Node 7: {0, 13, 16, 27, 28, 29}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {6, 17, 18}
- Node 10: {15, 21}
- Node 11: {15, 28}
- Node 12: {6, 21}
- Node 13: {2, 18, 27}
- Node 14: {1, 15, 19, 23}
- Node 15: {0, 10, 11, 14, 22}
- Node 16: {7, 25, 28}
- Node 17: {5, 9, 19}
- Node 18: {3, 9, 13}
- Node 19: {1, 14, 17, 23}
- Node 20: {5, 28}
- Node 21: {10, 12, 26, 27}
- Node 22: {15, 23}
- Node 23: {14, 19, 22, 25}
- Node 24: {0, 4}
- Node 25: {1, 4, 6, 16, 23}
- Node 26: {21, 23}
- Node 27: {4, 7, 13, 21}
- Node 28: {7, 11, 16, 20}
- Node 29: {7}

With this information, we can calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1, 4, 5, 9, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 28 also have 3 or more neighbors but they have exactly 3 neighbors each, so they each form 1 3-star.
  
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 39, which can be denoted as [39].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<7, (0, 16, 28)>, <15, (0, 10, 22)>.
