Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 13) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 12) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 12}
Node 1: {0, 2, 12, 13}
Node 2: {1, 4, 6, 11, 14}
Node 3: {5, 8, 9, 13, 14}
Node 4: {2}
Node 5: {0, 3, 6, 7}
Node 6: {0, 2, 5}
Node 7: {5, 8, 10, 11}
Node 8: {3, 7, 9, 11}
Node 9: {3, 8, 12, 14}
Node 10: {7, 12, 14}
Node 11: {2, 7, 8, 13}
Node 12: {0, 1, 9, 10, 13, 14}
Node 13: {1, 3, 11, 12}
Node 14: {2, 3, 9, 10, 12}

Now, let's check which nodes can form 3-stars:
Node 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, and 14 can potentially form 3-stars as they have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Nodes 0, 9, and 12 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they form 1 3-star each. 
Nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 14 have more than 3 neighbors, thus we need to apply \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each:
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 35

Therefore, the final answer is [35], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 12>, <9, 3, 14>, <5, 0, 6>, <7, 5, 8>, <8, 9, 11>, <14, 2, 12>
