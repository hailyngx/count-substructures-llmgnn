Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 12) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 9) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 8, 11}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 8, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 7, 11}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 7, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 11, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 9, 10}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 4, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 4, 9, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 10, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {2, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star <2, (6, 8, 10)>.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star <5, (1, 11, 12)>.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star <9, (4, 8, 10)>.

Since there are 3 unique 3-stars formed, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
