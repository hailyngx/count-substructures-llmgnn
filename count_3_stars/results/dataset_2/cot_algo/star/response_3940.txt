Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 (Degree 5)
Node 1: 2, 3, 5 (Degree 3)
Node 2: 0, 1, 3 (Degree 3)
Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4 (Degree 4)
Node 4: 0, 3, 7, 8, 9 (Degree 5)
Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9 (Degree 5)
Node 6: 5, 8 (Degree 2)
Node 7: 4, 5, 8 (Degree 3)
Node 8: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9 (Degree 5)
Node 9: 4, 5, 8, 0 (Degree 4)

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44, so the final result is [44].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
