Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 59

Therefore, there are a total of [59] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>
