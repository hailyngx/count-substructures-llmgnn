Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 17) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 12) (13, 5) (13, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 19) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 2) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 7) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 18) (2, 10) (2, 19) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 2) (7, 8) (7, 15) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 13) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 17) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {6, 14}
Node 1: {3, 4, 8}
Node 2: {10, 19}
Node 3: {1, 11, 12, 19}
Node 4: {1, 5}
Node 5: {4, 6, 13}
Node 6: {0, 5, 14, 17}
Node 7: {8, 15}
Node 8: {1, 7, 9}
Node 9: {8, 11, 15, 19}
Node 10: {2, 15, 18}
Node 11: {3, 9, 14, 16}
Node 12: {3, 13, 14}
Node 13: {5, 12}
Node 14: {0, 6, 11, 12, 18}
Node 15: {7, 9, 10}
Node 16: {11, 17}
Node 17: {6, 16, 18}
Node 18: {10, 14, 17}
Node 19: {2, 3, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

Node 11 can form a 3-star with neighbors {3, 14, 16}
Node 14 can form a 3-star with neighbors {11, 12, 18}

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars found:
<11, (3, 14, 16)>
<14, (11, 12, 18)>
