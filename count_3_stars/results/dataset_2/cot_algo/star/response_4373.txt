Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 27) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 22) (20, 2) (25, 6) (25, 24) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 21) (8, 7) (5, 12) (6, 25) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 15) (28, 29) (28, 26) (28, 13) (29, 20) (29, 28) (29, 26) (29, 12) (2, 20) (2, 27) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 17) (0, 7) (0, 22) (0, 23) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 27) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 17) (21, 8) (21, 19) (21, 12) (17, 11) (17, 26) (17, 15) (24, 25) (24, 6) (24, 9) (14, 6) (22, 20) (22, 0) (22, 27) (9, 4) (9, 24) (9, 10) (9, 23) (23, 0) (23, 9) (23, 19) (27, 16) (27, 2) (27, 1) (27, 22) (27, 13) (12, 5) (12, 29) (12, 21) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 19) (18, 20) (18, 10) (18, 13) (19, 21) (19, 23) (19, 10) (13, 28) (13, 1) (13, 27) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 7, 22, 23
Node 1 neighbors: 13, 15, 27
Node 2 neighbors: 20, 27
Node 3 neighbors: 4, 10
Node 4 neighbors: 3, 8, 9
Node 5 neighbors: 12
Node 6 neighbors: 14, 15, 24, 25
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 8, 16
Node 8 neighbors: 4, 7, 21
Node 9 neighbors: 4, 10, 23, 24
Node 10 neighbors: 3, 9, 18, 19
Node 11 neighbors: 16, 17
Node 12 neighbors: 5, 21, 29
Node 13 neighbors: 1, 18, 27, 28
Node 14 neighbors: 6
Node 15 neighbors: 1, 6, 17
Node 16 neighbors: 7, 11, 27
Node 17 neighbors: 11, 15, 26
Node 18 neighbors: 10, 13, 20
Node 19 neighbors: 10, 21, 23
Node 20 neighbors: 2, 18, 22, 29
Node 21 neighbors: 8, 12, 19
Node 22 neighbors: 0, 20, 27
Node 23 neighbors: 0, 9, 19
Node 24 neighbors: 6, 9, 25
Node 25 neighbors: 6, 24
Node 26 neighbors: 17, 28, 29
Node 27 neighbors: 1, 2, 13, 16, 22
Node 28 neighbors: 13, 26, 29
Node 29 neighbors: 12, 20, 26, 28

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].
