Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 6) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 27) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 27) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 5) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 5) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 24) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (4, 22) (4, 9) (4, 15) (8, 22) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 23) (12, 1) (12, 16) (2, 1) (19, 3) (19, 26) (19, 13) (19, 27) (26, 14) (26, 19) (26, 16) (18, 11) (18, 28) (28, 18) (28, 29) (28, 13) (29, 14) (29, 20) (29, 28) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 23) (15, 6) (22, 4) (22, 8) (22, 16) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 26) (16, 22) (16, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (5, 3) (5, 20) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 0) (23, 7) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 9) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 23) (9, 13) (13, 25) (13, 19) (13, 28) (13, 9) (13, 24) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 19) (24, 25) (24, 23) (24, 13) 

Response:
There are 16 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 19, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29. 

Calculating the number of possible 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
2. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
3. Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
4. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
5. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
6. Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
7. Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can from 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
8. Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
9. Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it can from 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
10. Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
11. Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
12. Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
13. Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
14. Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
15. Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
16. Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 59.

The total number of 3-stars is [59].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<1, 2, 12>
<3, 0, 19>
<4, 15, 22>
<6, 14, 29>
<9, 13, 24>
<10, 11, 18>
<16, 12, 26>
<23, 15, 9>
<25, 13, 28>
<27, 1, 19>
