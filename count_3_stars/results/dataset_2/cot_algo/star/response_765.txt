Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 20) (7, 18) (21, 7) (21, 5) (21, 2) (21, 17) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 15) (13, 25) (13, 2) (13, 28) (10, 8) (10, 28) (5, 21) (5, 6) (5, 26) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 19) (12, 7) (12, 28) (12, 18) (12, 15) (28, 13) (28, 10) (28, 12) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 25) (29, 14) (29, 3) (9, 8) (9, 22) (9, 27) (22, 9) (22, 1) (17, 21) (17, 6) (17, 20) (20, 7) (20, 17) (20, 3) (23, 14) (19, 6) (19, 29) (19, 15) (0, 18) (16, 7) (16, 4) (16, 26) (26, 5) (26, 16) (26, 14) (26, 25) (4, 16) (4, 14) (14, 29) (14, 23) (14, 26) (14, 4) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 19) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 0) (1, 5) (1, 22) (1, 2) (2, 21) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 1) (25, 13) (25, 29) (25, 26) (25, 24) (24, 25) (27, 9) (3, 5) (3, 29) (3, 20) 

Response:
The first step is to find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {18}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 22}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 13, 21}
- Node 3: {5, 20, 29}
- Node 4: {14, 16}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 21, 26}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 17, 19}
- Node 7: {12, 16, 18, 20, 21}
- Node 8: {9, 10, 15}
- Node 9: {8, 22, 27}
- Node 10: {8, 28}
- Node 12: {7, 15, 18, 28}
- Node 13: {2, 25, 28}
- Node 14: {4, 23, 26, 29}
- Node 15: {8, 12, 19}
- Node 16: {4, 7, 26}
- Node 17: {6, 20, 21}
- Node 18: {0, 7, 12}
- Node 19: {6, 15, 29}
- Node 20: {3, 7, 17}
- Node 21: {5, 7, 17}
- Node 22: {1, 9}
- Node 23: {14}
- Node 24: {25}
- Node 25: {13, 24, 26, 29}
- Node 26: {4, 5, 14, 16, 25}
- Node 27: {9}
- Node 28: {10, 12, 13, 29}
- Node 29: {3, 14, 19, 25, 28}

Next, we identify nodes with at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 7: <7, (12, 18, 21)>, <7, (16, 18, 20)>
- Node 5: <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 21, 22)>, <5, (3, 20, 26)>, <5, (6, 17, 26)>, <5, (6, 19, 29)>
- Node 6: <6, (2, 5, 17)>, <6, (5, 17, 21)>, <6, (17, 19, 20)>, <6, (19, 26, 29)>
- Node 12: <12, (7, 15, 18)>, <12, (7, 18, 28)>, <12, (15, 18, 28)>
- Node 13: <13, (2, 25, 28)>, <13, (25, 28, 29)>
- Node 14: <14, (4, 26, 29)>, <14, (14, 23, 29)>, <14, (14, 23, 26)>, <14, (23, 26, 29)>
- Node 15: <15, (8, 12, 19)>
- Node 16: <16, (4, 7, 26)>, <16, (4, 14, 26)>
- Node 18: <18, (7, 12, 28)>
- Node 19: <19, (6, 15, 29)>
- Node 20: <20, (3, 7, 17)>, <20, (7, 17, 21)>, <20, (3, 17, 26)>
- Node 21: <21, (5, 6, 17)>
- Node 25: <25, (13, 29, 28)>, <25, (14, 26, 29)>, <25, (14, 23, 29)>
- Node 26: <26, (4, 5, 14)>, <26, (4, 16, 25)>
- Node 28: <28, (12, 13, 29)>
- Node 29: <29, (14, 19, 25)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we get a total of 32 3-stars. 
Therefore, the final answer is [32].
