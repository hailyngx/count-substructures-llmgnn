Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {5, 3, 8}
Node 1: Neighbors {5, 6, 7, 2, 8}
Node 2: Neighbors {9, 6, 7, 1}
Node 3: Neighbors {9, 0}
Node 4: Neighbors {5, 9, 6}
Node 5: Neighbors {9, 6, 8, 1, 4, 0}
Node 6: Neighbors {5, 9, 1, 2, 4}
Node 7: Neighbors {2, 8, 1}
Node 8: Neighbors {5, 0, 7, 1}
Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 4, 3, 2}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 2: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 5: 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
Node 8: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 9: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 2)>, <1, (5, 6, 4)>, <1, (5, 8, 2)>, <1, (5, 8, 4)>, <1, (5, 2, 4)>, <2, (6, 7, 1)>, <5, (6, 8, 4)>, <5, (6, 1, 8)>, <5, (6, 1, 2)>, <5, (6, 1, 4)>, <5, (8, 1, 4)>, <5, (8, 1, 2)>, <5, (8, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (6, 4, 3)>, <9, (6, 4, 2)>, <9, (6, 3, 2)>, <9, (4, 3, 2)>.
