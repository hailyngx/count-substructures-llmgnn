Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 12) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 6) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 4) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 5, 3, 13, 2, 14, 4
- Node 1: 10, 13, 12
- Node 2: 5, 12, 7, 0
- Node 3: 7, 0, 14, 4, 12
- Node 4: 5, 9, 3, 0, 6
- Node 5: 9, 2, 11, 4, 0
- Node 6: 11, 14, 4
- Node 7: 3, 8, 2
- Node 8: 11, 7
- Node 9: 5, 4, 14, 10, 12
- Node 10: 9, 1, 11
- Node 11: 5, 10, 6, 8
- Node 12: 9, 1, 3, 13, 2
- Node 13: 1, 12, 0
- Node 14: 9, 3, 0, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 12: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get a total of 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 74. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [74].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 13, 2)>, <0, (3, 14, 4)>, <0, (3, 2, 7)>, <0, (13, 12, 1)>, <0, (13, 3, 7)>, <0, (13, 3, 12)>, <0, (13, 7, 12)>, <0, (2, 14, 3)>, <0, (2, 14, 6)>, <0, (14, 3, 7)>, <0, (14, 6, 4)>, <3, (0, 13, 1)>, <3, (0, 13, 12)>, <3, (0, 13, 2)>, <3, (0, 13, 7)>, <3, (0, 12, 1)>, <3, (0, 12, 2)>, <3, (0, 12, 13)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 0, 6)>, <4, (5, 0, 6)>, <4, (12, 2, 9)>, <4, (12, 9, 10)>, <4, (12, 9, 14)>, <5, (0, 2, 14)>, <5, (2, 0, 14)>, <5, (2, 7, 11)>, <5, (2, 7, 12)>, <5, (2, 12, 9)>, <9, (5, 4, 14)>, <9, (9, 10, 12)>, <9, (9, 10, 14)>, <9, (9, 12, 14)>, <12, (1, 3, 13)>, <12, (1, 3, 2)>, <12, (1, 13, 0)>, <12, (1, 13, 3)>, <12, (1, 13, 7)>, <12, (1, 13, 12)>, <12, (1, 2, 7)>, <12, (1, 7, 8)>, <12, (3, 0, 13)>, <12, (3, 0, 2)>, <12, (3, 0, 7)>, <14, (3, 0, 6)>, <14, (6, 0, 4)>
