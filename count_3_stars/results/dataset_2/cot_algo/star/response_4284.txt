- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6.
- Node 5 is connected to node 24.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 21, 15, 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 8, 17, 15.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 15, 11.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 21, 24.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 17, 0, 19, 25.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 27, 21, 8, 25.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 14, 0, 19.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 27, 1, 20, 16.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 22, 12, 26.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 8, 7, 25, 6.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 23, 1, 2, 13.

- Node 21 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 11.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 23, 14, 29, 3.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 22, 16.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 20, 5, 25.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 10, 24, 11, 15.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 18, 14.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 29, 11, 2, 13.

Nodes 6, 9, 21, 15, 24 have 4 or more neighbors, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars involving these nodes:

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (9, 21, 15)>
<9, (6, 21, 24)>
<21, (6, 9, 11)>
<15, (6, 8, 7)>
<15, (6, 8, 25)>
<15, (7, 8, 25)>
<15, (7, 17, 25)>
<24, (9, 3, 20)>
<24, (9, 5, 25)>
<24, (3, 20, 5)>
