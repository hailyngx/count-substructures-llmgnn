Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 6) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 0) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 13, 3, 9}
- Node 1: {10, 7, 6, 14}
- Node 2: {10, 4, 7, 13, 6}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 0}
- Node 4: {14, 3, 2}
- Node 5: {11, 8, 0}
- Node 6: {11, 12, 1, 2}
- Node 7: {11, 2, 13, 1}
- Node 8: {11, 5, 14, 3}
- Node 9: {10, 11, 0, 14}
- Node 10: {11, 12, 1, 13, 9, 2}
- Node 11: {10, 7, 9, 6, 8, 5}
- Node 12: {10, 6}
- Node 13: {10, 7, 2, 0}
- Node 14: {4, 8, 1, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 13, Node 14

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
For example, Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Let's do this for all eligible nodes:

- Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 1: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 2: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 3: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 4: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 5: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 6: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 7: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 8: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 9: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 10: 6 choose 3 = 20
- Node 11: 6 choose 3 = 20
- Node 13: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 14: 4 choose 3 = 4

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 75

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [75]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 9, 14>
<1, 6, 10>
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 11>
<1, 14, 4>
<2, 6, 10>
<2, 6, 11>
<4, 14, 9>
<5, 11, 8>
<10, 11, 13>
<10, 11, 9>
<10, 13, 0>
<0, 9, 10>
