Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 20) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 4) (23, 6) (5, 21) (5, 16) (6, 23) (6, 11) (6, 19) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 20) (4, 23) (4, 27) (4, 25) (18, 9) (18, 25) (18, 13) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 25) (28, 20) (29, 26) (29, 21) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 28) (11, 0) (11, 8) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 21) (0, 17) (14, 22) (14, 0) (27, 4) (27, 24) (27, 2) (1, 10) (15, 26) (15, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 24) (10, 20) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 21) (16, 25) (21, 5) (21, 29) (21, 0) (21, 16) (21, 20) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 13) (3, 0) (17, 0) (26, 29) (26, 15) (2, 27) (2, 10) (20, 22) (20, 12) (20, 28) (20, 10) (20, 21) (19, 6) (19, 24) (24, 27) (24, 10) (24, 19) (13, 18) (13, 9) (25, 4) (25, 18) (25, 28) (25, 16) (25, 8) (8, 22) (8, 11) (8, 15) (8, 25) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of them:

1. Node 0: has 5 neighbors (11, 14, 17, 21, 3). 
   - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <0, (11, 14, 17)>, <0, (11, 14, 21)>, <0, (11, 14, 3)>, <0, (11, 17, 21)>, <0, (11, 17, 3)>, 
   <0, (11, 21, 3)>, <0, (14, 17, 21)>, <0, (14, 17, 3)>, <0, (14, 21, 3)>, <0, (17, 21, 3)>

2. Node 4: has 3 neighbors (23, 27, 25).
   - Number of 3-stars = 1

3. Node 5: has 2 neighbors (21, 16).

4. Node 6: has 3 neighbors (23, 11, 19).

5. Node 8: has 4 neighbors (22, 11, 15, 25).
   - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <8, (22, 11, 15)>, <8, (22, 11, 25)>, <8, (22, 15, 25)>, <8, (11, 15, 25)>

6. Node 9: has 3 neighbors (7, 18, 13).

7. Node 10: has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 24, 20).
   - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <10, (1, 2, 24)>, <10, (1, 2, 20)>, <10, (1, 24, 20)>, <10, (2, 24, 20)>

8. Node 11: has 5 neighbors (6, 7, 28, 0, 8).
   - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <11, (6, 7, 28)>, <11, (6, 7, 0)>, <11, (6, 7, 8)>, <11, (6, 28, 0)>, <11, (6, 28, 8)>, 
   <11, (6, 0, 8)>, <11, (7, 28, 0)>, <11, (7, 28, 8)>, <11, (7, 0, 8)>, <11, (28, 0, 8)>

9. Node 16: has 4 neighbors (5, 28, 21, 25).
   - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <16, (5, 28, 21)>, <16, (5, 28, 25)>, <16, (5, 21, 25)>, <16, (28, 21, 25)>

10. Node 20: has 5 neighbors (22, 12, 28, 10, 21).
     - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
     - Unique 3-stars: <20, (22, 12, 28)>, <20, (22, 12, 10)>, <20, (22, 12, 21)>, <20, (22, 28, 10)>, <20, (22, 28, 21)>, 
     <20, (22, 10, 21)>, <20, (12, 28, 10)>, <20, (12, 28, 21)>, <20, (12, 10, 21)>, <20, (28, 10, 21)>

11. Node 22: has 4 neighbors (23, 14, 8, 20).
     - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
     - Unique 3-stars: <22, (23, 14, 8)>, <22, (23, 14, 20)>, <22, (23, 8, 20)>, <22, (14, 8, 20)>

12. Node 25: has 5 neighbors (4, 18, 28, 16, 8).
     - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
     - Unique 3-stars: <25, (4, 18, 28)>, <25, (4, 18, 16)>, <25, (4, 18, 8)>, <25, (4, 28, 16)>, <25, (4, 28, 8)>, 
     <25, (4, 16, 8)>, <25, (18, 28, 16)>, <25, (18, 28, 8)>, <25, (18, 16, 8)>, <25, (28, 16, 8)>

Adding up all the 3-stars results in a total of 47 3-stars: [47].
