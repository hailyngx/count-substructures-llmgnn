Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 14) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 3) (14, 13) (14, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 2) 

Response:
The first step is to list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 11, 8, 3}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 10, 13, 2}
- Node 2: {11, 5, 12, 1}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 5, 0, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 10, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 12, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 3, 5, 1}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 13, 0, 12}
- Node 9: {6, 8}
- Node 10: {12, 1, 13, 5}
- Node 11: {0, 2}
- Node 12: {6, 10, 8, 13, 2}
- Node 13: {10, 8, 12, 1, 14}
- Node 14: {13, 3}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \). 

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing these up, we get a total of 92 three-stars in this graph. 

Thus, the final answer is [92]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 3, 14>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 7, 1>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 4, 10>
- <1, 4, 13>
- <1, 4, 2>
- <1, 10, 13>
- <2, 5, 12>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 4, 1>
- <3, 4, 10>
- <3, 4, 13>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 5, 10>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <5, 6, 10>
- <6, 9, 8>
- <6, 12, 5>
- <7, 4, 1>
- <7, 4, 10>
- <7, 4, 13>
- <7, 4, 2>
- <7, 5, 3>
- <8, 6, 9>
- <8, 9, 13>

- <12, 6, 13>
- <12, 10, 8>
- <13, 10, 1>
- <13, 10, 14>
