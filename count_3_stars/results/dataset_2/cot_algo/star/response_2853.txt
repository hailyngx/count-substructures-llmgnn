Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 5) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 17) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 7) (8, 15) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 16) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 17) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 19) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (19, 3) (19, 12) (13, 1) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (17, 18) (17, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we first need to find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 5, 11, 14, 18
- Node 1 neighbors: 6, 13
- Node 2 neighbors: 8, 12, 16, 18
- Node 3 neighbors: 19
- Node 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 10
- Node 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 15
- Node 6 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 12
- Node 7 neighbors: 12, 14, 17
- Node 8 neighbors: 2, 14, 15, 16
- Node 9 neighbors: 11, 14
- Node 10 neighbors: 4, 11
- Node 11 neighbors: 0, 9, 10
- Node 12 neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 19
- Node 13 neighbors: 1
- Node 14 neighbors: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 15 neighbors: 2, 5, 8, 16
- Node 16 neighbors: 2, 8, 15, 18
- Node 17 neighbors: 7, 18
- Node 18 neighbors: 0, 2, 16, 17
- Node 19 neighbors: 3, 12

Now, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, Node 14, Node 16, Node 18

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 32 3-stars. Therefore, the final number to put inside brackets is [32], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 11, 14, 18>
- <2, 8, 15, 16>
- <5, 0, 4, 6>
- <6, 1, 4, 5>
- <8, 2, 14, 16>
- <14, 0, 7, 8>
- <16, 2, 8, 18>
- <18, 0, 17, 16>
