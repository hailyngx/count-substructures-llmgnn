Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 19) (22, 13) (22, 16) (22, 21) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 14) (7, 2) (21, 22) (21, 7) (12, 27) (27, 12) (27, 25) (27, 28) (27, 3) (27, 1) (15, 23) (15, 29) (20, 19) (20, 6) (19, 13) (19, 20) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 28) (26, 19) (26, 3) (26, 4) (6, 20) (6, 25) (6, 16) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 14) (11, 19) (11, 23) (23, 15) (23, 11) (23, 25) (23, 16) (23, 0) (29, 15) (29, 9) (29, 4) (29, 3) (25, 27) (25, 6) (25, 9) (25, 23) (17, 13) (17, 24) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (0, 23) (0, 3) (0, 24) (3, 27) (3, 26) (3, 29) (3, 0) (5, 8) (5, 28) (5, 16) (24, 7) (24, 17) (24, 0) (1, 27) (1, 10) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 16) (4, 26) (4, 29) (4, 10) (16, 22) (16, 6) (16, 23) (16, 5) (16, 14) (28, 27) (28, 19) (28, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) 

Response:
There are several nodes in the graph that have at least three neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of them.

1. Node 13 has 3 neighbors: {22, 17, 19}
   Number of 3-stars formed with node 13 = 1

2. Node 22 has 4 neighbors: {13, 16, 21, 21}
   Number of 3-stars formed with node 22 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   Unique 3-stars involving node 22: <22, (13, 16, 21)>, <22, (13, 21, 21)>

3. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {21, 24, 14, 2}
   Number of 3-stars formed with node 7 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   Unique 3-stars involving node 7: <7, (21, 24, 14)>, <7, (21, 24, 2)>, <7, (21, 14, 2)>

4. Node 21 has 3 neighbors: {22, 7, 22}
   Number of 3-stars formed with node 21 = 1

5. Node 19 has 6 neighbors: {13, 20, 26, 11, 28, 11}
   Number of 3-stars formed with node 19 = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
   Unique 3-stars involving node 19: <19, (13, 20, 26)>, <19, (13, 20, 11)>, <19, (13, 20, 28)>, <19, (13, 26, 11)>, <19, (13, 26, 28)>, <19, (13, 11, 28)>

6. Node 27 has 5 neighbors: {12, 25, 28, 3, 1}
   Number of 3-stars formed with node 27 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   Unique 3-stars involving node 27: <27, (12, 25, 28)>, <27, (12, 25, 3)>, <27, (12, 25, 1)>, <27, (12, 28, 3)>, <27, (12, 28, 1)>

7. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {20, 25, 16}
   Number of 3-stars formed with node 6 = 1

8. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {8, 29, 25, 14}
   Number of 3-stars formed with node 9 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   Unique 3-stars involving node 9: <9, (8, 29, 25)>, <9, (8, 29, 14)>, <9, (8, 25, 14)>

9. Node 23 has 5 neighbors: {15, 11, 25, 16, 0}
   Number of 3-stars formed with node 23 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   Unique 3-stars involving node 23: <23, (15, 11, 25)>, <23, (15, 11, 16)>, <23, (15, 11, 0)>, <23, (15, 25, 16)>, <23, (15, 25, 0)>

10. Node 29 has 4 neighbors: {15, 9, 4, 3}
    Number of 3-stars formed with node 29 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    Unique 3-stars involving node 29: <29, (15, 9, 4)>, <29, (15, 9, 3)>, <29, (15, 4, 3)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 59
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [59].
