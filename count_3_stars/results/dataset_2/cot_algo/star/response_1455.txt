Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 8
Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 9
Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 9
Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8
Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 2, 3, 9
Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 7
Node 7: 4, 6
Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 9
Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 58

Therefore, the final answer is [58], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>
