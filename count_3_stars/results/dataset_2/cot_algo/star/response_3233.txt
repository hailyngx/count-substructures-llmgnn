Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 21) (7, 4) (7, 20) (7, 23) (7, 2) (18, 22) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 28) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 6) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 26) (3, 29) (25, 5) (25, 8) (25, 14) (25, 11) (12, 24) (12, 17) (27, 10) (27, 1) (8, 25) (8, 5) (24, 12) (24, 26) (24, 2) (24, 15) (26, 3) (26, 24) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 15) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 19) (20, 7) (20, 2) (20, 23) (9, 15) (29, 3) (29, 1) (29, 0) (19, 17) (19, 21) (1, 27) (1, 29) (1, 16) (6, 4) (6, 22) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 29) (0, 10) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 26) (10, 0) (23, 7) (23, 26) (23, 20) (28, 18) (28, 3) (28, 13) (15, 24) (15, 26) (15, 9) (2, 7) (2, 24) (2, 20) (2, 6) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 25) (5, 8) (5, 2) (16, 22) (16, 17) (16, 1) (21, 4) (21, 19) (13, 28) (11, 18) (11, 25) (14, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 neighbors: {10, 29}
- Node 1 neighbors: {16, 27, 29}
- Node 2 neighbors: {5, 6, 7, 20, 24}
- Node 3 neighbors: {6, 26, 28, 29}
- Node 4 neighbors: {5, 6, 7, 21}
- Node 5 neighbors: {2, 4, 8, 25}
- Node 6 neighbors: {2, 3, 4, 22}
- Node 7 neighbors: {2, 4, 20, 23}
- Node 8 neighbors: {5, 25}
- Node 9 neighbors: {15}
- Node 10 neighbors: {0, 18, 26, 27}
- Node 11 neighbors: {18, 25}
- Node 12 neighbors: {17, 24}
- Node 13 neighbors: {28}
- Node 14 neighbors: {25}
- Node 15 neighbors: {9, 24, 26}
- Node 16 neighbors: {1, 17, 22}
- Node 17 neighbors: {12, 16, 19}
- Node 18 neighbors: {10, 11, 22, 28}
- Node 19 neighbors: {17, 21}
- Node 20 neighbors: {2, 7, 23}
- Node 21 neighbors: {4, 19}
- Node 22 neighbors: {6, 16, 18}
- Node 23 neighbors: {7, 20, 26}
- Node 24 neighbors: {2, 12, 15, 26}
- Node 25 neighbors: {5, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 26 neighbors: {3, 10, 15, 23, 24}
- Node 27 neighbors: {1, 10}
- Node 28 neighbors: {3, 13, 18}
- Node 29 neighbors: {0, 1, 3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 18, 27}.
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 11, 14}.
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 15, 24}.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 6, 7}.

Total number of 3-stars = 4, so the final answer is [4].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <10, (0, 18, 27)>
- <25, (5, 11, 14)>
- <26, (3, 15, 24)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
