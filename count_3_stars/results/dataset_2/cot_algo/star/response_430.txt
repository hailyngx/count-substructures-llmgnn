Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 3) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 1) 

Response:
The first step is to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 4, 7, 3
Node 1: 4, 8, 13, 14, 2, 10
Node 2: 9, 13, 1
Node 3: 5, 11, 0, 12
Node 4: 0, 10, 1
Node 5: 3, 14
Node 6: 9, 11, 12, 8, 13
Node 7: 0, 10, 9
Node 8: 6, 13, 14, 11, 12, 1
Node 9: 7, 6, 2
Node 10: 4, 7, 1
Node 11: 6, 8, 3, 14
Node 12: 6, 8, 13, 3
Node 13: 6, 8, 12, 2, 1, 0
Node 14: 8, 5, 11, 1

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

Nodes with 3 neighbors or more: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 13, 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 6: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 13: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up: 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 80

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [80].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 3)>, <1, (4, 8, 13)>, <1, (4, 8, 14)>, <1, (4, 10, 1)>, <1, (8, 13, 1)>, <1, (8, 14, 1)>, <3, (5, 11, 0)>, <4, (0, 7, 10)>, <6, (9, 11, 8)>, <6, (9, 12, 8)>, <6, (9, 13, 8)>, <6, (11, 12, 8)>, <6, (11, 13, 8)>, <6, (12, 13, 8)>, <8, (6, 12, 13)>, <8, (6, 13, 14)>, <8, (8, 11, 14)>, <8, (8, 12, 13)>, <13, (0, 1, 13)>, <13, (0, 8, 13)>, <13, (1, 2, 13)>, <13, (1, 8, 13)>, <13, (2, 1, 13)>, <14, (1, 11, 14)>, <14, (1, 8, 14)>
