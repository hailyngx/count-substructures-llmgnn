Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 11) (4, 2) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 6) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 6) (17, 13) (7, 3) (7, 16) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 19) (9, 3) (9, 18) (9, 13) (9, 0) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 15) (5, 8) (5, 18) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 19) (15, 11) (15, 0) (15, 6) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 6) (6, 18) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 12) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 19) (14, 1) (14, 19) (19, 16) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 15, 19}
- Node 1: {11, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 10, 16}
- Node 3: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 16}
- Node 5: {8, 18}
- Node 6: {12, 13, 15, 18}
- Node 7: {3, 16}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 11}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 13, 18}
- Node 10: {2, 13, 19}
- Node 11: {1, 8, 12, 15}
- Node 12: {6, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {6, 9, 10, 12, 17}
- Node 14: {1, 19}
- Node 15: {0, 6, 11}
- Node 16: {2, 4, 7, 19}
- Node 17: {13}
- Node 18: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 19: {0, 10, 14, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 9, 13, 16, 19 have exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 2, 3, 6, 8, 11, 15, 18 have more than 3 neighbors.

Next, calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Finally, sum up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the answer is [23].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 9, 15>
- <9, 13, 18>
- <13, 6, 12>
- <16, 2, 7>
- <19, 0, 10>
