Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 14) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 14) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 18) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 8) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 0) (11, 1) (11, 17) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 11) (17, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 16) (16, 7) (16, 4) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 19) (18, 9) (18, 6) (18, 12) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 4) (14, 15) (14, 5) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 8) (4, 16) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {13, 10, 19}
- Node 1: {13, 11, 2}
- Node 2: {6, 10, 1, 19, 4}
- Node 3: {15, 7}
- Node 4: {16, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 14}
- Node 6: {5, 2, 18, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 13, 16}
- Node 8: {6, 12}
- Node 9: {15, 5, 18}
- Node 10: {15, 0, 19, 2}
- Node 11: {1, 17}
- Node 12: {17, 18, 8}
- Node 13: {17, 1, 7, 0}
- Node 14: {15, 5}
- Node 15: {3, 10, 9, 14}
- Node 16: {7, 4}
- Node 17: {13, 11, 12}
- Node 18: {9, 6, 12}
- Node 19: {10, 0, 2}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, and for each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 27

Therefore, the final answer is [27], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 13, 10>, <2, 1, 19>, <2, 10, 19>, <2, 1, 4>, <2, 19, 4>, <6, 5, 18>, <6, 2, 18>, <6, 12, 18>, <10, 0, 19>, <13, 1, 7>, <13, 1, 0>, <13, 7, 0>, <15, 3, 9>, <15, 3, 14>, <15, 9, 14>, <15, 10, 9>, <17, 11, 12>, <17, 13, 7>, <17, 13, 0>, <17, 7, 0>, <18, 9, 5>, <19, 10, 0>, <0, 19, 10>, <12, 17, 18>, <14, 15, 5>, <2, 4, 16>, <4, 16, 7>
