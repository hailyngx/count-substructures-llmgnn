Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 5) (4, 1) (4, 16) (4, 14) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (6, 10) (6, 17) (13, 5) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 12) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 3) (7, 15) (0, 3) (0, 15) (16, 4) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 14) (9, 19) (9, 15) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 9) (15, 18) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 16) (1, 4) (1, 18) (14, 4) (14, 16) (14, 12) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 14) (18, 15) (18, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 3, 15
- Node 1: 4, 18
- Node 2: 3, 10, 16
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7
- Node 4: 1, 14, 16
- Node 5: 8, 11, 13
- Node 6: 10, 17
- Node 7: 3, 8, 15, 19
- Node 8: 5, 7, 19
- Node 9: 15, 19
- Node 10: 2, 6, 12
- Node 11: 5, 19
- Node 12: 10, 14, 17, 19
- Node 13: 5
- Node 14: 4, 12, 16
- Node 15: 0, 7, 9, 18
- Node 16: 2, 4, 12, 14
- Node 17: 6, 12, 16
- Node 18: 1, 15
- Node 19: 7, 8, 11, 12, 9

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:

- Node 2: has 3 neighbors
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors
- Node 4: has 3 neighbors
- Node 5: has 3 neighbors
- Node 7: has 4 neighbors
- Node 8: has 3 neighbors
- Node 10: has 3 neighbors
- Node 11: has 2 neighbors
- Node 12: has 4 neighbors
- Node 14: has 4 neighbors
- Node 15: has 4 neighbors
- Node 16: has 4 neighbors
- Node 17: has 3 neighbors
- Node 19: has 5 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [36], and the unique 3-stars found are as follows:
<2, (3, 10, 16)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 14, 16)>
<5, (8, 11, 13)>
<7, (3, 15, 19)>
<8, (5, 7, 19)>
<10, (2, 6, 12)>
<12, (10, 14, 17, 19)>
<14, (4, 12, 16)>
<15, (0, 7, 9, 18)>
<16, (2, 4, 12, 14)>
<17, (6, 12, 16)>
<19, (7, 8, 11, 12, 9)>
