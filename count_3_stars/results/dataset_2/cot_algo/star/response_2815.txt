Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (6, 5, 7)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- <9, (7, 5, 8)>
