Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 13) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 4, 10}
- Node 1: {6, 2, 14, 12, 10}
- Node 2: {1, 12, 14, 11}
- Node 3: {5, 11, 6}
- Node 4: {9, 8, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 12, 3, 7, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 8, 10}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 14, 7, 0}
- Node 10: {1, 0, 6, 13}
- Node 11: {3, 2, 7, 13}
- Node 12: {5, 1, 2, 13}
- Node 13: {11, 10, 12, 7}
- Node 14: {5, 9, 1, 2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 6: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 10: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 11: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 12: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 13: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 14: [1]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [3].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <5, 12, 14>
- <5, 7, 9>
- <9, 5, 14>
