Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 12) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 0) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4, 10}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 10}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {3, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 13}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 8, 13}
- Node 12: {2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 13: {2, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 14: {3, 4, 5}

Now, we need to find the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, as those are potential centers of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 7 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 6 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing these up: 10 + 10 + 35 + 10 + 20 = 85

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [85].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 10>
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 10>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <2, 7, 12>
- <2, 8, 11>
- <2, 8, 12>
- <2, 11, 13>
- <3, 4, 14>
- <3, 5, 12>
- <3, 5, 14>
- <3, 9, 12>
- <4, 6, 12>
- <4, 6, 14>
- <4, 7, 12>
- <4, 12, 14>
- <12, 8, 11>
- <12, 8, 6>
