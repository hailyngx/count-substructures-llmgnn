Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 17) (15, 24) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 19) (7, 21) (7, 8) (21, 7) (21, 8) (21, 25) (12, 27) (12, 16) (12, 28) (12, 23) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (13, 26) (13, 19) (26, 13) (26, 11) (26, 8) (17, 15) (17, 20) (17, 24) (20, 17) (20, 9) (20, 23) (20, 16) (11, 26) (11, 23) (11, 2) (23, 12) (23, 20) (23, 11) (23, 25) (23, 3) (9, 20) (9, 2) (9, 28) (29, 15) (29, 8) (29, 22) (29, 18) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 19) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (16, 12) (16, 20) (16, 3) (3, 23) (3, 16) (3, 22) (19, 27) (19, 13) (19, 1) (19, 4) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 19) (25, 21) (25, 23) (18, 29) (18, 0) (28, 12) (28, 9) (14, 10) (24, 15) (24, 17) (8, 7) (8, 21) (8, 26) (8, 29) (8, 22) (22, 29) (22, 3) (22, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 10, 18}
- Node 1: {6, 2, 4, 19}
- Node 2: {11, 9, 1}
- Node 3: {23, 16, 22}
- Node 4: {1, 19}
- Node 5: {6}
- Node 6: {5, 1, 0, 10}
- Node 7: {21, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 21, 26, 29, 22}
- Node 9: {20, 2, 28}
- Node 10: {6, 0, 14}
- Node 11: {26, 23, 2}
- Node 12: {27, 16, 28, 23}
- Node 13: {26, 19}
- Node 14: {10}
- Node 15: {27, 29, 17, 24}
- Node 16: {12, 20, 3}
- Node 17: {15, 20, 24}
- Node 18: {0, 29}
- Node 19: {27, 13, 1, 4}
- Node 20: {17, 9, 23, 16}
- Node 21: {7, 8, 25}
- Node 22: {29, 3, 8}
- Node 23: {12, 20, 11, 25, 3}
- Node 24: {15, 17}
- Node 25: {21, 23}
- Node 26: {13, 8, 11}
- Node 27: {15, 12, 19}
- Node 28: {12, 9}
- Node 29: {15, 8, 22, 18}

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star.

Counting all the 3-stars, the total number is 18. Therefore, the answer is [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 10, 18)>, <1, (6, 2, 4)>, <2, (11, 9, 1)>, <3, (23, 16, 22)>, <6, (5, 1, 0)>, <8, (7, 21, 26)>, <10, (6, 0, 14)>, <11, (26, 23, 2)>, <12, (27, 16, 28)>, <16, (12, 20, 3)>, <17, (15, 20, 24)>, <19, (27, 13, 1)>, <20, (17, 9, 23)>, <21, (7, 8, 25)>, <22, (29, 3, 8)>, <23, (12, 20, 11)>, <26, (13, 8, 11)>, <27, (15, 12, 19)>, <29, (15, 8, 22)>
