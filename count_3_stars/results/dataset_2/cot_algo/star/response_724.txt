Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 12) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 7) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges in a more readable format listing the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 7, 8
Node 1: 5, 9, 7, 3, 6
Node 2: 3, 6, 8, 13
Node 3: 1, 6, 2, 12, 8
Node 4: 12, 6
Node 5: 9, 1
Node 6: 9, 4, 1, 3, 10, 2
Node 7: 9, 12, 0, 10, 1
Node 8: 3, 10, 13, 2, 14, 0
Node 9: 5, 1, 6, 11, 7, 12
Node 10: 7, 11, 6, 8
Node 11: 9, 10, 14
Node 12: 9, 4, 7, 3
Node 13: 8, 2, 14
Node 14: 11, 8, 13

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Now, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 90 \)

So, the final total number of 3-stars is [90].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (5, 9, 7)>
- <1, (5, 9, 3)>
- <1, (5, 9, 6)>
- <1, (5, 9, 1)>
- <1, (7, 9, 1)>
- <1, (3, 1, 6)>
- <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (1, 9, 5)>
- <6, (1, 9, 7)>
- <6, (1, 9, 3)>
- <6, (1, 9, 12)>
- <7, (9, 5, 1)>
- <7, (9, 12, 4)>
- <7, (9, 12, 3)>
- <8, (3, 6, 1)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 12)>
- <8, (6, 9, 1)>
- <9, (5, 1, 6)>
- <9, (5, 1, 3)>
- <9, (5, 1, 7)>
- <9, (5, 1, 9)>
- <9, (6, 1, 3)>
- <9, (6, 1, 7)>
- <9, (6, 1, 5)>
- <12, (9, 7, 12)>
- <12, (9, 12, 4)>
- <14, (11, 9, 10)>
