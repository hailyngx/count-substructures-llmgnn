Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (6, 7) (6, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: neighbors 4, 10, 12
- Node 1: neighbors 2, 3
- Node 2: neighbors 1, 4, 7, 9, 11, 12
- Node 3: neighbors 1, 8, 13
- Node 4: neighbors 0, 2, 6, 12, 14
- Node 5: neighbors 8, 12, 13, 14
- Node 6: neighbors 4, 7
- Node 7: neighbors 2, 6, 9, 10, 11
- Node 8: neighbors 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 13
- Node 9: neighbors 2, 7, 8, 10
- Node 10: neighbors 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 11: neighbors 2, 7, 8, 12
- Node 12: neighbors 0, 2, 4, 5, 11, 14
- Node 13: neighbors 3, 5, 8, 14
- Node 14: neighbors 4, 5, 12, 13

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars. We observe that the nodes with enough neighbors to form a 3-star are: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13.

For these nodes, the number of 3-stars formed with each node is as follows:
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up these counts gives a total of 66 3-stars.

Thus, the final answer is [66].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <2, (1, 7, 11)>
- <4, (0, 12, 14)>
- <5, (8, 13, 14)>
- <7, (2, 9, 10)>
- <8, (3, 10, 13)>
- <11, (2, 7, 12)>
- <12, (2, 4, 14)>
- <13, (3, 5, 14)>
