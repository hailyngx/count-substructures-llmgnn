Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 11) (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 16) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 14) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 18) (6, 10) (6, 0) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 19) (16, 5) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 13) (2, 9) (2, 4) (11, 15) (11, 1) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 7) (18, 3) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 13) (19, 18) (1, 10) (1, 11) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 15, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {10, 11}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {13, 14, 15, 18}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 16, 17}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 10}
- Node 7: Neighbors {12, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4, 8, 10, 17}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 5, 14, 16}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 6, 8, 17}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 15}
- Node 12: Neighbors {7, 16, 18}
- Node 13: Neighbors {3, 17, 16, 19}
- Node 14: Neighbors {3, 7, 9}
- Node 15: Neighbors {0, 3, 11}
- Node 16: Neighbors {5, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 17: Neighbors {5, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 18: Neighbors {3, 12, 19}
- Node 19: Neighbors {13, 18}

Now, we look for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
  - <3, (13, 14, 15)>
  - <3, (13, 14, 18)>
  - <3, (13, 15, 18)>
  - <3, (14, 15, 18)>
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
  - <8, (0, 10, 17)>
  - <8, (0, 10, 4)>
  - <8, (0, 10, 8)>
  - <8, (0, 17, 4)>
  - <8, (0, 17, 8)>
  - <8, (0, 4, 8)>
  - <8, (10, 17, 4)>
  - <8, (10, 17, 8)>
  - <8, (10, 4, 8)>
  - <8, (17, 4, 8)>
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
  - <9, (14, 16, 5)>
  - <9, (14, 16, 9)>
  - <9, (14, 5, 9)>
  - <9, (16, 5, 9)>
- Node 13: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
  - <13, (16, 17, 19)>
  - <13, (16, 17, 13)>
  - <13, (16, 19, 13)>
  - <13, (17, 19, 13)>
- Node 16: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
  - <16, (13, 5, 9)>
  - <16, (13, 5, 16)>
  - <16, (13, 9, 16)>
  - <16, (5, 9, 16)>
- Node 17: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
  - <17, (10, 8, 13)>
  - <17, (10, 8, 17)>
  - <17, (10, 13, 17)>
  - <17, (8, 13, 17)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
