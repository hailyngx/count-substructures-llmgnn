Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 5) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 4) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 1) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 12) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 13) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 9) (6, 8) (6, 13) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 16) (5, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (14, 2) (4, 17) (4, 19) (9, 16) (9, 2) (9, 1) (12, 11) (12, 15) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 0) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 6) 

Response:
We will first construct the adjacency list representing the graph using the provided edges:

```
0: [11, 8]
1: [11, 18, 9]
2: [9, 3, 14]
3: [2, 7]
4: [17, 19]
5: [16, 7]
6: [8, 13]
7: [3, 5, 19]
8: [11, 10, 17, 6, 0]
9: [16, 2, 1]
10: [17, 15, 8]
11: [16, 1, 0, 8, 12]
12: [11, 15]
13: [15, 19, 6]
14: [2]
15: [10, 19, 13, 12]
16: [11, 18, 9, 5]
17: [10, 8, 4]
18: [16, 19, 1]
19: [18, 15, 4, 7, 13]
```

Next, we will find the 3-star structures in this graph:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. (1, 18, 9)
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars. (19, 15, 13), (19, 15, 7), (19, 15, 4), (19, 15, 19), (19, 13, 7), (19, 13, 4), (19, 13, 6), (19, 13, 19), (19, 7, 4), (19, 7, 19)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, 18, 9> and <19, 15, 13>, <19, 15, 7>, <19, 15, 4>, <19, 15, 19>, <19, 13, 7>, <19, 13, 4>, <19, 13, 6>, <19, 13, 19>, <19, 7, 4>, <19, 7, 19>.
