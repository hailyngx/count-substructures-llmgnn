Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 12) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 11) (11, 0) (11, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 13, 14, 3, 11
Node 1: 4, 6, 8, 11
Node 2: 9, 7, 13, 3
Node 3: 9, 4, 6, 0, 10, 2
Node 4: 5, 10, 1, 3
Node 5: 9, 13, 12, 4, 14
Node 6: 7, 1, 3, 12
Node 7: 9, 6, 2
Node 8: 13, 14, 10, 1
Node 9: 5, 2, 3, 7
Node 10: 4, 8, 3
Node 11: 0, 1
Node 12: 5, 6, 14
Node 13: 5, 8, 2, 14, 0
Node 14: 5, 8, 13, 0, 12

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 13, 14
Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: None

For nodes with 3 neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
Node 5: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 8: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 13: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 14: C(4, 3) = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<5, 9, 13>
<8, 13, 14>
<13, 0, 14>
<13, 8, 14>
