Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 6, 3, 7
Node 1: 5, 4, 6, 2
Node 2: 5, 6, 7, 1, 3
Node 3: 9, 4, 0, 7, 2
Node 4: 8, 0, 3, 1
Node 5: 6, 2, 1, 7
Node 6: 5, 1, 2, 0
Node 7: 5, 8, 0, 3, 2
Node 8: 9, 4, 7
Node 9: 8, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: none
Nodes with 4 neighbors: none
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 2
Nodes with 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7
Nodes with 7 neighbors: 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40

So, the final answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
