Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 2) (13, 9) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {3, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 2: {3, 12, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 5: {1, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {8, 9, 10}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 7, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 10: {7, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 4, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 12: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 13: {9}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 5, 10, 11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get a total of 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 82.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [82].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 5, 8, 11>
- <1, 5, 9, 11>
- <1, 6, 8, 11>
- <1, 6, 9, 11>
- <1, 8, 9, 11>
- <3, 4, 8, 11>
- <3, 4, 11, 14>
- <5, 8, 12, 14>
- <6, 8, 11, 14>
- <6, 9, 11, 14>
