Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 1) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 8, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 5, 12, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 7, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 7, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 13, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 10, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {4, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 11: Neighbors {5, 7, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 5, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 6, 11}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7}

Now, we will check for each node if it can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: Can't form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: Can form a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 12}.
- Node 2: Can't form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: Can't form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: Can form a 3-star with neighbors {1, 3, 10}.
- Node 5: Can form multiple 3-stars:
  - <5, (1, 7, 12)>
  - <5, (9, 11, 12)>
- Node 6: Can't form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: Can form a 3-star with neighbors {2, 8, 14}.
- Node 8: Can form a 3-star with neighbors {2, 7, 12}.
- Node 9: Can't form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 10: Can't form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 11: Can form a 3-star with neighbors {7, 12, 13}.
- Node 12: Can form a 3-star with neighbors {5, 8, 11}.
- Node 13: Can't form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 14: Can't form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (4, 5, 12)>
- <5, (1, 7, 12)>
- <5, (9, 11, 12)>
- <7, (2, 8, 14)>
- <8, (2, 7, 12)>
- <11, (7, 12, 13)>
- <12, (5, 8, 11)>
