Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, we will find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 5, 2, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 8
- Node 2: 9, 3, 5, 0
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 4: 9, 3, 7, 8
- Node 5: 6, 1, 8, 2, 0
- Node 6: 9, 5, 0
- Node 7: 9, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7, 5
- Node 9: 6, 4, 2, 7, 0

Now, we will look at nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, and Node 9 each have 4 neighbors. So, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
    - For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    
Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (6, 2, 5)>
- <2, (9, 3, 5)>
- <5, (6, 1, 8)>
- <9, (4, 7, 0)>
