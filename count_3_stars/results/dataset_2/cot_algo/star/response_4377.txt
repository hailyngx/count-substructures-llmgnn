Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 17) (4, 1) (4, 6) (18, 11) (18, 0) (1, 4) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 16) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 11) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 10) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 12) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 6) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 12) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 14) (11, 18) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 8) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 15) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 7) (13, 2) (13, 0) (7, 8) (7, 10) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {6, 8, 13, 18}
- Node 1: {4, 11, 16, 17}
- Node 2: {5, 10, 13, 14, 19}
- Node 3: {14, 15, 16}
- Node 4: {1, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 10, 12, 19}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 12}
- Node 7: {8, 10}
- Node 8: {0, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {15}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 11: {1, 8, 17, 18}
- Node 12: {5, 6, 16, 19}
- Node 13: {0, 2}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 15: {3, 9, 17}
- Node 16: {1, 3, 12}
- Node 17: {1, 11, 15}
- Node 18: {0, 11}
- Node 19: {2, 5, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 15: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 17: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 19: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 30
Thus, the total number of 3-stars formed in the given graph is [30].
