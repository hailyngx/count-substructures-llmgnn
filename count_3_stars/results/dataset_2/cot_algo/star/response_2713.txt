Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (10, 9) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 13) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 14) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {8, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 4: {7, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 6, 11}
- Node 8: {2, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 5, 10}
- Node 10: {2, 9}
- Node 11: {4, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 2, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 4, 12}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 8, 11, 12}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0, 1, 3, and 9 each have 5 neighbors, so they form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 2, 4, 11, and 12 each have 4 neighbors, so they form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 \times 4 + 4 \times 10 = 16 + 40 = 56 \)

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [56].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (1, 9, 12)>
<0, (7, 9, 12)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 12)>
<1, (0, 6, 13)>
<1, (0, 9, 12)>
<1, (0, 9, 13)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 9, 12)>
<1, (6, 9, 12)>
<2, (4, 8, 12)>
<2, (4, 11, 14)>
<2, (8, 11, 12)>
<2, (8, 12, 14)>
<4, (11, 13, 14)>
<12, (1, 13, 14)>
