Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 15) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 18) (7, 16) (7, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (1, 14) (1, 5) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 18) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 15) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 19) (18, 8) (18, 6) (18, 5) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 2) (19, 9) (19, 15) (3, 0) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 15) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 17) (13, 12) (13, 9) (10, 8) (10, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 18) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 9) (17, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 8, 15, 16}
- Node 1: {5, 14}
- Node 2: {10, 15, 17}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {6, 8, 17}
- Node 5: {1, 12, 18}
- Node 6: {4, 11, 14, 18}
- Node 7: {9, 16}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 10, 17, 18}
- Node 9: {7, 13, 17, 19}
- Node 10: {2, 8}
- Node 11: {6, 17}
- Node 12: {5, 13}
- Node 13: {9, 12}
- Node 14: {1, 6, 15}
- Node 15: {0, 2, 14, 16, 19}
- Node 16: {0, 7, 15}
- Node 17: {2, 4, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 18: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 19: {9, 15}

Following nodes have 3 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars:
- Node 0
- Node 8
- Node 15
- Node 17

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars from each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 15, 16)>, 
<8, (0, 4, 18)>, 
<15, (0, 2, 16)>, 
<17, (2, 8, 9)>
