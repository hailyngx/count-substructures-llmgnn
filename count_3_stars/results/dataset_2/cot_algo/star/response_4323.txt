Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<5, (2, 0, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 3)>
<4, (7, 1, 0)>
<1, (4, 3, 2)>
<3, (7, 1, 2)>
<6, (9, 4, 7)>
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (5, 4, 1)>
