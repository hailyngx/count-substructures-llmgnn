Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 8) (15, 0) (15, 12) (1, 3) (1, 4) (10, 17) (11, 7) (11, 19) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 12) (5, 19) (5, 0) (6, 17) (6, 14) (18, 12) (18, 13) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 16) (13, 18) (13, 12) (13, 2) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 9) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 16) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 2) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 0) (16, 19) (16, 14) (16, 9) (2, 17) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {2, 5, 12, 15}
Node 1: {3, 4}
Node 2: {0, 13, 14, 17}
Node 3: {1, 8}
Node 4: {1, 8, 19}
Node 5: {0, 19}
Node 6: {14, 17}
Node 7: {9, 11, 14, 17}
Node 8: {3, 4, 12, 19}
Node 9: {7, 16}
Node 10: {17}
Node 11: {7, 19}
Node 12: {0, 8, 13, 15, 18}
Node 13: {2, 12, 18}
Node 14: {2, 6, 7, 16}
Node 15: {0, 12}
Node 16: {9, 14, 19}
Node 17: {2, 6, 7, 10}
Node 18: {12, 13}
Node 19: {4, 5, 8, 11, 16}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars centered at each node:

Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4 (4 neighbors, forms 4 unique 3-stars)
Node 2: 4 choose 3 = 4 (4 neighbors, forms 4 unique 3-stars)
Node 4: 3 choose 3 = 1 (3 neighbors)
Node 7: 4 choose 3 = 4 (4 neighbors, forms 4 unique 3-stars)
Node 8: 4 choose 3 = 4 (4 neighbors, forms 4 unique 3-stars)
Node 12: 5 choose 3 = 10 (5 neighbors, forms 10 unique 3-stars)
Node 13: 3 choose 3 = 1 (3 neighbors)
Node 14: 4 choose 3 = 4 (4 neighbors, forms 4 unique 3-stars)
Node 16: 3 choose 3 = 1 (3 neighbors)
Node 17: 4 choose 3 = 4 (4 neighbors, forms 4 unique 3-stars)
Node 19: 5 choose 3 = 10 (5 neighbors, forms 10 unique 3-stars)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 47.

Therefore, the answer is [47].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, 2, 5, (0, 2, 15), (0, 5, 15), (2, 5, 15)>
<2, 13, 17, (2, 13, 17)>
<4, 8, 12, (4, 8, 19), (4, 12, 19), (8, 12, 19)>
<7, 9, 16, (7, 14, 16), (7, 9, 16), (9, 14, 16)>
<19, 11, 4, (19, 11, 8), (19, 4, 8), (19, 4, 11), (19, 4, 16)>
