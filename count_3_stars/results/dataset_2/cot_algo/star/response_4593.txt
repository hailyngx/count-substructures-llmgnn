Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (15, 18) (15, 8) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 8) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 9) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 5) (6, 13) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 16) (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 6) (5, 3) (5, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 7) (14, 5) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 15) (8, 18) (16, 18) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 9, 17
- Node 1: 0, 8, 12
- Node 2: 11, 12, 19
- Node 3: 5, 13, 16, 17
- Node 5: 3, 14
- Node 6: 13
- Node 7: 11, 13, 14
- Node 8: 1, 10, 15, 17, 18
- Node 9: 0, 11, 16
- Node 10: 8, 14
- Node 11: 2, 7, 9, 19
- Node 12: 1, 2, 13, 14
- Node 13: 3, 6, 7, 12
- Node 14: 5, 7, 10, 12
- Node 15: 8, 18
- Node 16: 3, 9, 18
- Node 17: 0, 3, 8
- Node 18: 8, 15, 16, 19
- Node 19: 11, 18, 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: [0]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [0]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 5: [0]
- Node 6: [0]
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 8: [3]
- Node 9: [0]
- Node 10: [0]
- Node 11: [1]
- Node 12: [1]
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 14: [1]
- Node 15: [0]
- Node 16: [0]
- Node 17: [0]
- Node 18: [1]
- Node 19: [0]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars yields [10].

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (0, 8, 15)>
<3, (13, 16, 18)>
<7, (11, 2, 19)>
<8, (1, 12, 14)>
<8, (1, 12, 13)>
<8, (1, 14, 7)>
<8, (8, 17, 0)>
<12, (12, 2, 11)>
<13, (14, 5, 3)>
<14, (14, 12, 7)>
