Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 19) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 11) (7, 21) (7, 15) (7, 28) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 25) (21, 15) (18, 22) (18, 9) (18, 20) (18, 29) (22, 18) (0, 23) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 26) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 25) (29, 18) (29, 9) (29, 8) (6, 17) (28, 7) (28, 23) (9, 18) (9, 29) (9, 23) (26, 14) (26, 27) (26, 15) (26, 20) (5, 13) (5, 24) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 12) (13, 5) (3, 2) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 19) (11, 17) (11, 23) (11, 20) (11, 25) (23, 0) (23, 28) (23, 9) (23, 11) (16, 8) (16, 4) (10, 21) (10, 5) (10, 2) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 2) (24, 27) (24, 5) (15, 7) (15, 21) (15, 26) (15, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 25) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 11) (8, 29) (8, 16) (4, 14) (4, 16) (25, 21) (25, 12) (25, 11) (25, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

1: 2, 7, 17, 19
2: 1, 3, 10, 19, 25
3: 2
4: 14, 16
5: 10, 13, 15, 24
6: 7, 17
7: 1, 6, 15, 21, 28
8: 16, 29
9: 18, 23, 29
10: 2, 5, 21
11: 17, 20, 23, 25
12: 13, 15, 25, 27
13: 5, 12
14: 4, 17, 19, 26
15: 5, 7, 12, 15, 26
16: 4, 8
17: 1, 6, 11, 14
18: 9, 20, 22, 29
19: 1, 2, 14
20: 11, 18, 26
21: 7, 10, 15, 25
22: 18
23: 0, 9, 11, 28
24: 5, 27
25: 2, 11, 12, 21
26: 14, 15, 20, 26, 27
27: 12, 24, 26
28: 7, 23
29: 8, 9, 18

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

1: 4 neighbors
2: 5 neighbors
5: 4 neighbors
7: 5 neighbors
11: 4 neighbors
12: 4 neighbors
14: 4 neighbors
15: 5 neighbors
17: 4 neighbors
18: 4 neighbors
19: 3 neighbors
20: 3 neighbors
21: 4 neighbors
23: 4 neighbors
25: 4 neighbors
26: 5 neighbors
27: 3 neighbors
29: 4 neighbors

Now we need to calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

\[ \sum_{v \in V, |N(v)| \geq 3} \binom{|N(v)|}{3} \]

Calculating this for each applicable node:

1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 71 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [71].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 7, 19)>
<2, (1, 10, 25)>
<5, (10, 13, 15)>
<7, (1, 15, 21)>
<11, (17, 20, 25)>
<12, (5, 15, 25)>
<14, (17, 19, 26)>
<15, (7, 12, 25)>
<17, (1, 11, 14)>
<18, (9, 20, 29)>
<19, (1, 2, 14)>
<20, (11, 18, 26)>
<21, (7, 10, 15)>
<23, (9, 11, 28)>
<25, (2, 11, 21)>
<26, (14, 15, 27)>
<27, (12, 24, 26)>
<29, (18, 9, 29)>
