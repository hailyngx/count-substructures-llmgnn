Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 25) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 15) (26, 20) (18, 9) (18, 22) (18, 14) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 29) (22, 21) (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 7) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 29) (8, 4) (8, 19) (13, 26) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (0, 20) (0, 2) (20, 26) (20, 0) (20, 3) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 19) (1, 7) (17, 1) (17, 28) (17, 2) (24, 7) (24, 14) (15, 26) (15, 1) (15, 28) (15, 16) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 2) (25, 9) (25, 14) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 5) (21, 22) (21, 10) (21, 23) (12, 16) (12, 23) (2, 0) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 28) (28, 22) (28, 17) (28, 15) (28, 2) (6, 4) (6, 29) (6, 23) (29, 22) (29, 11) (29, 6) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 25) (14, 2) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 24) (7, 23) (3, 20) (5, 11) (5, 16) (23, 21) (23, 12) (23, 6) (23, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first determine the neighbors for each node.

| Node | Neighbors |
|------|-----------|
| 0    | 2, 20     |
| 1    | 7, 15, 17, 19 |
| 2    | 0, 14, 17, 19, 28 |
| 3    | 20        |
| 4    | 6, 8      |
| 5    | 11, 16    |
| 6    | 4, 23, 29 |
| 7    | 1, 10, 13, 23, 24 |
| 8    | 4, 19     |
| 9    | 18, 25, 26 |
| 10   | 7, 11, 19, 21 |
| 11   | 5, 10, 29  |
| 12   | 16, 23    |
| 13   | 7, 26     |
| 14   | 2, 18, 24, 25 |
| 15   | 1, 16, 26, 28 |
| 16   | 5, 12, 15  |
| 17   | 1, 2, 28   |
| 18   | 9, 14, 22  |
| 19   | 1, 2, 8, 10 |
| 20   | 0, 3, 26   |
| 21   | 10, 22, 23 |
| 22   | 18, 21, 28, 29 |
| 23   | 6, 7, 12, 21 |
| 24   | 7, 14     |
| 25   | 9, 14     |
| 26   | 9, 13, 15, 20 |
| 28   | 2, 15, 17, 22 |
| 29   | 6, 11, 22  |

Now, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. Nodes with 3 neighbors can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of those nodes:

- Node 1, 2, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 28, and 29 have 4 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars.
- Nodes 1, 10, 17, 19, 21, 22, 28, and 29 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 3-star each. This adds up to 8 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (7, 15, 17)>
- <10, (7, 11, 21)>
- <17, (1, 2, 28)>
- <19, (2, 14, 28)>
- <21, (22, 23, 10)>
- <22, (18, 28, 29)>
- <28, (15, 17, 2)>
- <29, (6, 22, 11)>
