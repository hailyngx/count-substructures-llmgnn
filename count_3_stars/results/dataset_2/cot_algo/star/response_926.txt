Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 6) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 13) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 7, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 12, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 12, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 5, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 9, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors {8, 9, 6}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 3, 6}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 10}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5}

Now let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 5 and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 3, Node 8, and Node 1 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \[ 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 38 \].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<5, (3, 8, 14)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 14)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 10, 13)>
