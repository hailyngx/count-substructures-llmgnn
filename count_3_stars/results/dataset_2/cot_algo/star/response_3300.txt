Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 4) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 2) (0, 17) (0, 5) (7, 19) (7, 17) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 17) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 15) (12, 6) (12, 4) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 13) (16, 3) (16, 14) (16, 15) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 15) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 17) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 3) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 19) (17, 2) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 1) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 16) (15, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 5, 17
Node 1: 2, 5, 6, 13
Node 2: 1, 11, 17
Node 3: 5, 14, 16
Node 4: 9, 12, 13, 15
Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 10, 18
Node 6: 1, 8, 12
Node 7: 17, 19
Node 8: 6, 15, 19
Node 9: 4
Node 10: 5, 11
Node 11: 2, 10
Node 12: 4, 6
Node 13: 1, 4, 18
Node 14: 3, 15, 16
Node 15: 4, 8, 14, 16
Node 16: 3, 14, 15
Node 17: 0, 2, 7, 19
Node 18: 5, 13, 19
Node 19: 7, 8, 17, 18

Now, let's apply the formula to each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 15: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 16: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 18: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 19: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is [29], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (2, 5, 13)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 13, 18)>
<1, (5, 3, 14)>
<5, (0, 17, 7)>
<8, (6, 12, 4)>
<13, (1, 4, 18)>
<15, (4, 8, 14)>
<17, (2, 7, 19)>
<19, (8, 17, 18)>
