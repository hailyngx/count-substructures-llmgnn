Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 3, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 8, 3}
- Node 3: {6, 4, 0, 2}
- Node 4: {6, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 1, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 0}
- Node 8: {2, 0, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 2, 1, 0, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 46 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 6, 4)>
<2, (9, 4, 8)>
<3, (6, 4, 1)>
<4, (6, 1, 3)>
<6, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
<9, (6, 1, 3)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (4, 1, 6)>
<9, (5, 1, 7)>
