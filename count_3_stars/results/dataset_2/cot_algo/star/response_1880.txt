Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 14) (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 18) (2, 29) (2, 24) (2, 28) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 26) (29, 12) (29, 24) (7, 16) (7, 22) (7, 8) (21, 0) (21, 5) (21, 4) (6, 25) (6, 0) (9, 20) (0, 2) (0, 21) (0, 6) (0, 20) (20, 9) (20, 0) (20, 13) (1, 24) (26, 29) (26, 23) (26, 25) (17, 29) (17, 28) (3, 11) (4, 27) (4, 21) (4, 19) (4, 5) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 25) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 23) (12, 29) (12, 18) (23, 16) (23, 26) (23, 19) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 15) (14, 22) (22, 7) (22, 14) (22, 24) (28, 2) (28, 17) (28, 13) (18, 15) (18, 27) (18, 12) (10, 13) (5, 21) (5, 4) (25, 6) (25, 26) (25, 8) (24, 2) (24, 29) (24, 1) (24, 22) (13, 20) (13, 28) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 6, 20, 21}
- Node 1: {24}
- Node 2: {0, 24, 28, 29}
- Node 3: {11}
- Node 4: {5, 19, 21, 27}
- Node 5: {4, 21}
- Node 6: {0, 25}
- Node 7: {8, 16, 22}
- Node 8: {7, 11, 16, 19, 25}
- Node 9: {20}
- Node 10: {13}
- Node 11: {3, 8, 14, 16}
- Node 12: {18, 29}
- Node 13: {10, 20, 28}
- Node 14: {11, 15, 16, 22}
- Node 15: {14, 18, 27}
- Node 16: {7, 8, 11, 14, 23}
- Node 17: {28, 29}
- Node 18: {12, 15, 27}
- Node 19: {4, 8, 23}
- Node 20: {9, 13, 0}
- Node 21: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 22: {7, 14, 24}
- Node 23: {16, 19, 26}
- Node 24: {1, 2, 22, 29}
- Node 25: {6, 8, 26}
- Node 26: {23, 25, 29}
- Node 27: {15, 18, 4}
- Node 28: {2, 13, 17}
- Node 29: {2, 12, 17, 24, 26}

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [51].
