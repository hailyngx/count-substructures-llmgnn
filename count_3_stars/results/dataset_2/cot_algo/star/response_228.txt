Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 5) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 16) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 2) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 10) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 0) (7, 9) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 11) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 6) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (18, 19) (18, 6) (11, 19) (11, 13) (1, 13) (2, 17) (2, 4) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 9) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 1) (6, 8) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 18) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 16) (9, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {17, 7, 10}
- Node 1: {13}
- Node 2: {17, 4, 10}
- Node 3: {9, 5}
- Node 4: {8, 2, 13}
- Node 5: {3, 17, 19, 12}
- Node 6: {8, 16, 10, 18}
- Node 7: {0, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 14, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 16, 12}
- Node 10: {4, 0, 6, 2}
- Node 11: {19, 13}
- Node 12: {5, 9}
- Node 13: {4, 11, 1}
- Node 14: {15, 17, 8}
- Node 15: {19, 14, 16}
- Node 16: {15, 9, 6}
- Node 17: {14, 0, 5, 2}
- Node 18: {19, 6}
- Node 19: {15, 5, 18, 11}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars based on the given neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6, 10, 17, 19
- Number of 3-stars for each of these nodes: inom{n}{3}
- Total number of 3-stars: [7]

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (7, 10, 17)>
- <2, (4, 10, 17)>
- <5, (3, 12, 19)>
- <6, (8, 16, 18)>
- <10, (4, 0, 6)>
- <17, (14, 5, 2)>
- <19, (15, 18, 11)>
