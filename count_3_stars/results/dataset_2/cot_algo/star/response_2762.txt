Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 18) (3, 5) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 19) (8, 11) (8, 4) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 14) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 16) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 7) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 16) (12, 6) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 6) (9, 0) (9, 14) (18, 1) (18, 11) (2, 4) (2, 6) (7, 10) (7, 19) (7, 15) (7, 17) (13, 11) (13, 16) (17, 19) (17, 7) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 9, 15}
- Node 1: {0, 12, 15, 18}
- Node 2: {4, 6}
- Node 3: {5, 12}
- Node 4: {2, 8, 19}
- Node 5: {3, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 12, 16}
- Node 7: {10, 15, 17, 19}
- Node 8: {4, 11}
- Node 9: {0, 14}
- Node 10: {7, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {5, 8, 10, 13, 18}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 6, 16}
- Node 13: {11, 16}
- Node 14: {5, 9, 10}
- Node 15: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 16: {6, 12, 13, 19}
- Node 17: {7, 19}
- Node 18: {1, 11}
- Node 19: {4, 7, 16, 17}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with the neighbor set {10, 17, 19}.
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with the neighbor set {10, 13, 18}.
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with the neighbor set {6, 13, 19}.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <7, (10, 17, 19)>
- <11, (10, 13, 18)>
- <16, (6, 13, 19)>
