Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 11) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 14) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 14) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 15) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 18) (17, 6) (17, 13) (19, 8) (19, 18) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (15, 5) (15, 18) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 1) (2, 1) (2, 10) (10, 16) (10, 1) (10, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: {2, 5, 10, 11}
- Node 2: {1, 10}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 9, 18}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 9, 15, 16}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 9, 17}
- Node 7: {3, 12}
- Node 8: {3, 8, 11, 13, 19}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 16}
- Node 11: {1, 8, 13}
- Node 12: {7, 14, 16}
- Node 13: {8, 11, 14, 17}
- Node 14: {12, 13, 18}
- Node 15: {5, 18}
- Node 16: {5, 10, 12}
- Node 17: {6, 13}
- Node 18: {4, 14, 15, 19}
- Node 19: {8, 18}

Now let's identify which nodes can form 3-star graphs:
- Node 1: not applicable (has fewer than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: not applicable (has fewer than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: can form 1 3-star
- Node 4: can form 1 3-star
- Node 5: can form 1 3-star
- Node 6: can form 1 3-star
- Node 7: not applicable (has fewer than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: can form 1 3-star
- Node 9: not applicable (has fewer than 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: not applicable (has fewer than 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: not applicable (has fewer than 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: not applicable (has fewer than 3 neighbors)
- Node 13: can form 1 3-star
- Node 14: can form 1 3-star
- Node 15: not applicable (has fewer than 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: not applicable (has fewer than 3 neighbors)
- Node 17: not applicable (has fewer than 3 neighbors)
- Node 18: can form 1 3-star
- Node 19: not applicable (has fewer than 3 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 5. Therefore, the answer is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (5, 15, 18)>
- <4, (6, 9, 18)>
- <5, (1, 9, 16)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (13, 14, 18)>
