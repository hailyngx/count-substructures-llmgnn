Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 8, and Node 9 have 6 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.

For nodes with 6 neighbors, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars

For Node 5 with 4 neighbors, there's only 1 3-star.

Adding these up: \(20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 1 = 101\)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [101].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>
