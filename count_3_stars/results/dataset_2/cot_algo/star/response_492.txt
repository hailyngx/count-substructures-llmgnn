Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 8) (6, 9) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 19) (10, 9) (10, 17) (10, 13) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 4) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 18) (4, 17) (4, 19) (18, 17) (18, 8) (18, 1) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 15) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 19) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 8) (1, 18) (1, 12) (0, 17) (0, 5) (15, 17) (15, 13) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 3) (19, 14) (12, 1) (12, 14) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 17}
- Node 1: {8, 12, 18}
- Node 2: Not connected to any other node
- Node 3: {7, 11, 16, 19}
- Node 4: {17, 19}
- Node 5: {0, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {9, 13}
- Node 7: {3, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 16, 18}
- Node 9: {6, 7, 10, 19}
- Node 10: {5, 9, 13, 17}
- Node 11: {3, 7, 16}
- Node 12: {1, 14}
- Node 13: {5, 6, 10, 15}
- Node 14: {7, 12, 19}
- Node 15: {13, 17}
- Node 16: {3, 8, 11}
- Node 17: {0, 10, 15, 18, 4}
- Node 18: {1, 8, 17}
- Node 19: {3, 4, 7, 9, 14}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors, which are potential centers of 3-stars:
Nodes: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 17, 18, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 38

Therefore, the final answer is [38], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (7, 11, 16)>
<5, (0, 10, 13)>
<7, (3, 9, 11)>
<9, (6, 10, 13)>
<10, (5, 9, 13)>
<13, (5, 6, 15)>
<17, (0, 15, 18)>
<17, (4, 15, 18)>
<18, (1, 8, 17)>
<19, (7, 14, 9)>
<19, (14, 4, 9)>
