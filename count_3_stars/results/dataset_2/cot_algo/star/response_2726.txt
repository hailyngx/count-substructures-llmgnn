Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 7) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 13) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 13) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 14}
- Node 1: {7, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 2: {3, 9, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {6, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 10}
- Node 9: {7, 8, 2}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 7, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 5, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 6, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 4, 7, 10, 12, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us 86. Therefore, the final answer is [86]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (7, 10, 12)>
<2, (7, 10, 13)>
<2, (10, 13, 14)>
<2, (11, 12, 13)>
<3, (0, 12, 14)>
<3, (2, 11, 12)>
<3, (5, 11, 12)>
<5, (6, 11, 12)>
<7, (1, 10, 13)>
<10, (2, 7, 13)>
<10, (7, 13, 14)>
<11, (2, 5, 11)>
<12, (1, 3, 5)>
<13, (2, 7, 10)>
<13, (7, 10, 14)>
<14, (0, 7, 14)>
