Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 11) (9, 1) (26, 19) (26, 24) (15, 20) (15, 21) (27, 21) (27, 22) (27, 6) (27, 8) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 20) (29, 4) (4, 29) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 25) (7, 16) (7, 22) (8, 27) (8, 16) (8, 3) (23, 17) (23, 25) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 21) (0, 1) (20, 15) (20, 2) (20, 24) (20, 5) (17, 23) (17, 28) (17, 12) (17, 11) (19, 26) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 12) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 5) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 25) (24, 26) (24, 20) (3, 8) (3, 28) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 17) (25, 7) (25, 23) (25, 18) (28, 17) (28, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 27) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 12) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 12) (16, 22) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 16) (5, 20) (5, 14) (5, 3) (21, 15) (21, 27) (21, 0) (22, 27) (22, 7) (22, 16) (10, 4) (13, 19) (13, 14) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 4, 14, 21
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 6, 9
Node 2 neighbors: 6, 19, 20
Node 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 28
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 10, 18, 29
Node 5 neighbors: 3, 14, 20
Node 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 12, 27
Node 7 neighbors: 16, 22, 25
Node 8 neighbors: 3, 8, 16, 27
Node 9 neighbors: 1, 11
Node 10 neighbors: 4
Node 11 neighbors: 9, 17
Node 12 neighbors: 6, 12, 14, 16, 17
Node 13 neighbors: 14, 19
Node 14 neighbors: 0, 5, 12, 13
Node 15 neighbors: 20, 21
Node 16 neighbors: 7, 8, 12, 16, 18, 22
Node 17 neighbors: 11, 12, 17, 23, 28
Node 18 neighbors: 4, 16, 18, 25
Node 19 neighbors: 2, 12, 13, 26
Node 20 neighbors: 2, 5, 15, 24
Node 21 neighbors: 0, 15, 21, 27
Node 22 neighbors: 7, 16, 22, 27
Node 23 neighbors: 17, 25
Node 24 neighbors: 20, 26
Node 25 neighbors: 7, 18, 23, 25
Node 26 neighbors: 19, 24
Node 27 neighbors: 6, 8, 21, 22, 27
Node 28 neighbors: 3, 9, 17, 28
Node 29 neighbors: 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (3, 8, 16, 27) [1 3-star]
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: (6, 12, 14, 16, 17) [1 3-star]
- Node 16 has 6 neighbors: (7, 8, 12, 16, 18, 22) [4 3-stars]
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors: (11, 12, 17, 23, 28) [1 3-star]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7. 
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

Unique 3-stars found:
<8, (3, 16, 27)>
<12, (6, 14, 16)>
<16, (7, 8, 18)>
<16, (7, 8, 22)>
<16, (7, 12, 17)>
<16, (8, 12, 17)>
<17, (11, 23, 28)>
