Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 10) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 27) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 29) (21, 7) (21, 11) (10, 9) (10, 4) (11, 21) (11, 28) (20, 0) (20, 1) (20, 6) (25, 8) (25, 12) (25, 24) (25, 2) (8, 25) (13, 23) (13, 27) (13, 6) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 1) (12, 7) (12, 25) (14, 0) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 20) (6, 13) (6, 5) (22, 15) (22, 24) (22, 17) (22, 3) (28, 11) (28, 19) (28, 18) (1, 20) (1, 0) (1, 15) (1, 23) (15, 26) (15, 22) (15, 1) (15, 4) (18, 28) (29, 9) (29, 7) (29, 4) (4, 10) (4, 15) (4, 29) (16, 17) (16, 23) (16, 19) (19, 28) (19, 16) (19, 17) (2, 25) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 24) (3, 5) (3, 22) (3, 2) (3, 27) (17, 22) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 27) (24, 25) (24, 22) (24, 2) (24, 27) (27, 26) (27, 13) (27, 3) (27, 17) (27, 24) (23, 13) (23, 1) (23, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 14, 20}
- Node 1: {0, 15, 20, 23}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 24, 25}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 22, 27}
- Node 4: {10, 15, 29}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 13, 20}
- Node 7: {12, 21, 29}
- Node 8: {12, 25}
- Node 9: {10, 26, 29}
- Node 10: {4, 9}
- Node 11: {21, 28}
- Node 12: {7, 25}
- Node 13: {6, 23, 27}
- Node 14: {0}
- Node 15: {1, 4, 22, 26}
- Node 16: {17, 19, 23}
- Node 17: {16, 19, 22, 27}
- Node 18: {28}
- Node 19: {16, 17, 28}
- Node 20: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 21: {7, 11}
- Node 22: {3, 15, 17, 24}
- Node 23: {1, 13, 16}
- Node 24: {2, 22, 25, 27}
- Node 25: {2, 8, 12, 24}
- Node 26: {9, 15, 27}
- Node 27: {3, 13, 17, 24, 26}
- Node 28: {11, 18, 19}
- Node 29: {4, 7, 9}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Nodes forming 3-stars: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 15, 17, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 (20 nodes)

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes gives:
- Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{20}{3} = 1140 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1140].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, 1, 14>, <0, 1, 20>, <0, 14, 20>, <1, 14, 20>, <2, 5, 24>, <2, 5, 25>, <2, 5, 25>, <2, 24, 25>, <3, 5, 22>, <3, 5, 27>, <3, 22, 27>, <3, 5, 22>, <4, 10, 15>, <4, 10, 29>, <4, 15, 29>, <5, 6, 13>, <7, 12, 25>, <7, 29, 4>, <7, 29, 9>, <9, 10, 26>, <10, 9, 26>, <11, 21, 28>, <12, 25, 8>, <13, 6, 23>, <15, 4, 29>, <16, 17, 23>, <16, 17, 19>, <16, 19, 23>, <17, 19, 28>, <17, 22, 27>, <17, 27, 24>, <20, 0, 1>, <20, 0, 6>, <20, 1, 6>, <22, 24, 25>, <22, 24, 27>, <22, 25, 27>, <24, 25, 27>, <26, 15, 27>, <27, 13, 17>, <27, 13, 24>, <27, 17, 22>, <28, 18, 19>, <28, 19, 16>
