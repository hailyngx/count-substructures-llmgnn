Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 4, 7, 8, 2 (Degree: 4)
Node 1: 9, 7, 2, 8 (Degree: 4)
Node 2: 6, 7, 1, 0 (Degree: 4)
Node 3: 5, 6 (Degree: 2)
Node 4: 5, 9, 7, 0 (Degree: 4)
Node 5: 9, 6, 4, 3 (Degree: 4)
Node 6: 5, 7, 3, 2, 8 (Degree: 5)
Node 7: 6, 4, 0, 1, 2 (Degree: 5)
Node 8: 9, 6, 1, 0 (Degree: 4)
Node 9: 5, 8, 4, 1 (Degree: 4)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
Node 6 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 7 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 = 20, which we represent as [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <6, (5, 9, 4)>, <6, (5, 9, 3)>, <6, (5, 4, 7)>, <6, (5, 4, 0)>, <6, (9, 4, 7)>, <6, (9, 4, 0)>, <6, (4, 7, 0)>, <6, (7, 0, 2)>, <7, (6, 4, 0)>, <7, (6, 1, 2)>.
