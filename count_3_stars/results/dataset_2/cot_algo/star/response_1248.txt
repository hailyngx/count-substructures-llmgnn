Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 15) (22, 13) (22, 10) (22, 21) (22, 8) (5, 13) (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 21) (4, 23) (4, 0) (4, 24) (7, 18) (7, 1) (3, 13) (3, 25) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 16) (25, 29) (21, 22) (21, 9) (0, 4) (0, 27) (0, 18) (0, 26) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 6) (6, 27) (6, 29) (26, 13) (26, 0) (26, 18) (26, 2) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 27) (18, 26) (8, 22) (8, 9) (8, 28) (8, 15) (20, 29) (29, 25) (29, 6) (29, 20) (29, 24) (10, 22) (10, 1) (10, 14) (15, 13) (15, 8) (15, 23) (15, 28) (16, 25) (16, 2) (16, 14) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 12) (28, 8) (28, 15) (11, 19) (11, 2) (24, 4) (24, 29) (24, 2) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 17) (14, 10) (14, 16) (2, 26) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 24) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 15) (12, 1) (12, 17) (17, 19) (17, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 18, 27}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 10, 12, 19}
- Node 2: Neighbors {11, 16, 24, 26}
- Node 3: Neighbors {13, 23, 25}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 23, 24}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {27, 29}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 18}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 15, 22, 28}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 21}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 14, 22}
- Node 11: Neighbors {2, 19}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 17}
- Node 13: Neighbors {3, 5, 15, 22, 26}
- Node 14: Neighbors {10, 16}
- Node 15: Neighbors {8, 13, 23, 28}
- Node 16: Neighbors {2, 14, 25}
- Node 17: Neighbors {12, 19}
- Node 18: Neighbors {0, 7, 26, 27}
- Node 19: Neighbors {1, 11, 17}
- Node 20: Neighbor {29}
- Node 21: Neighbors {9, 22}
- Node 22: Neighbors {8, 10, 13, 21}
- Node 23: Neighbors {3, 4, 15}
- Node 24: Neighbors {2, 4, 29}
- Node 25: Neighbors {3, 16, 29}
- Node 26: Neighbors {2, 13, 18}
- Node 27: Neighbors {0, 6, 18}
- Node 28: Neighbors {8, 15}
- Node 29: Neighbors {6, 20, 24, 25}

Next, we need to find the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars in the graph.
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29

Now, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 38\)

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [38], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 18, 27)>, <1, (7, 10, 12)>, <2, (11, 16, 24)>, <3, (13, 23, 25)>, <8, (9, 15, 28)>, <9, (5, 8, 21)>, <10, (1, 14, 22)>, <13, (3, 15, 26, 22)>, <15, (8, 13, 23, 28)>, <22, (8, 10, 21, 13)>, <23, (3, 4, 15)>, <24, (2, 4, 29)>, <25, (3, 16, 29)>, <26, (2, 13, 18)>, <27, (0, 6, 18)>, <29, (6, 20, 24, 25)>.
