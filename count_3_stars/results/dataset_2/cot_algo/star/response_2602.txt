Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node using the given edges:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 5

Next, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8}

Now, let's find any 3-stars:
Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 7, and 9.
Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 9, and 4.
Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 7, and 9.
Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 7, and 5.
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, and 8.

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph, represented as <1, 5, 7, 9>, <3, 1, 4, 9>, <5, 1, 7, 9>, <6, 1, 7, 5>, and <9, 1, 5, 8>. Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
