Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 7, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:

- <6, 8, 9, 3>
- <6, 8, 3, 4>
- <6, 8, 4, 9>
- <1, 4, 7, 5>
- <3, 1, 7, 9>
- <3, 4, 7, 9>
- <4, 1, 7, 9>
- <4, 3, 7, 9>
