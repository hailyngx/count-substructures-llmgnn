Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
To begin, let's first list out the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 6}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9.

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up gives a total of 58 3-stars: 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <5, 8, 9>
