Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 11) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (0, 13) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {13, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 10, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 10}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 7, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {3, 7, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 10, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 1, 10, 11}
- Node 14: Neighbors {5, 10, 11, 12}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<5, 10, 12>
<7, 9, 11>
<9, 11, 13>
<11, 12, 14>
