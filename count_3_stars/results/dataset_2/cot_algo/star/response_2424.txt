Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first organize the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 3}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 7}

Next, we need to count the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 38

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>

So, the final number of 3-stars is [38].
