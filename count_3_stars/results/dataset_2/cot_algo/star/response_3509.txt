Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 11) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 12) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 14) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges. 

- Node 0: {1, 2, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 10, 11}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 8: {3, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 7, 12}
- Node 10: {5, 6, 14}
- Node 11: {5, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {4, 7, 11}
- Node 14: {2, 10, 12, 3}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 62 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [62].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 12)>
<0, (1, 7, 12)>
<0, (6, 7, 12)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 9, 14)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 10)>
<7, (0, 6, 12)>
<7, (1, 4, 11)>
<7, (4, 11, 13)>
<7, (4, 11, 13)>
<7, (9, 11, 13)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<12, (0, 11, 14)>
