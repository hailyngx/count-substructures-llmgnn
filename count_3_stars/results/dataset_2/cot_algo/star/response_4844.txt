Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 22) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 8) (16, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 23) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 19) (7, 17) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 17) (20, 0) (20, 1) (20, 8) (15, 26) (15, 5) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 13) (28, 0) (28, 29) (28, 23) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 3) (6, 14) (6, 21) (6, 12) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 22) (22, 11) (22, 9) (21, 6) (21, 26) (27, 29) (27, 25) (27, 2) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 13) (26, 15) (26, 21) (26, 18) (25, 27) (25, 2) (2, 27) (2, 25) (1, 20) (24, 16) (24, 7) (24, 8) (24, 17) (5, 15) (5, 8) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 20) (8, 24) (8, 5) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 29) (19, 23) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 18) (23, 4) (23, 28) (23, 19) (23, 3) (17, 7) (17, 0) (17, 24) (12, 6) (12, 3) (3, 29) (3, 23) (3, 12) 

Response:
First, we need to find the neighbor set for each node:

1. Node 0: {20, 14, 28, 17}
2. Node 1: {20}
3. Node 2: {27, 25}
4. Node 3: {29, 23, 12}
5. Node 4: {7, 9, 13, 23}
6. Node 5: {15, 8}
7. Node 6: {14, 21, 12}
8. Node 7: {4, 24, 19, 17}
9. Node 8: {11, 16, 20, 24, 5}
10. Node 9: {16, 4, 22}
11. Node 11: {16, 19, 22, 8}
12. Node 12: {6, 3}
13. Node 13: {4, 14, 18}
14. Node 15: {26, 5}
15. Node 16: {11, 24, 8, 9}
16. Node 17: {0, 7, 24}
17. Node 18: {14, 26, 13}
18. Node 19: {11, 7, 29, 23}
19. Node 20: {0, 1, 8}
20. Node 21: {6, 26}
21. Node 22: {11, 9}
22. Node 23: {4, 28, 19, 3}
23. Node 24: {16, 7, 8, 17}
24. Node 25: {27, 2}
25. Node 26: {15, 21, 18}
26. Node 27: {29, 25, 2}
27. Node 28: {0, 29, 23}
28. Node 29: {28, 27, 19, 3}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 8, Node 16, and Node 24 have 5 neighbors each, hence there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving each of them.
- Node 4, Node 7, Node 14, Node 19, Node 23, and Node 28 have 4 neighbors each, hence there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving each of them.

Adding these up: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<8, 16, 24>, <8, 16, 17>, <8, 16, 5>, <8, 24, 17>, <8, 24, 5>, <16, 24, 17>, <16, 24, 8>, <16, 24, 17>, <16, 24, 5>, <16, 17, 24>, <16, 17, 8>, <16, 17, 24>, <16, 17, 5>, <16, 5, 8>, <16, 5, 24>, <16, 5, 17>, <24, 17, 8>, <24, 17, 16>, <24, 17, 5>, <24, 5, 8>, <24, 5, 16>, <24, 5, 17>, <17, 24, 8>, <17, 24, 16>, <17, 24, 5>, <17, 16, 24>, <17, 16, 8>, <17, 16, 24>, <17, 16, 5>, <17, 5, 8>, <17, 5, 24>, <17, 5, 16>, <5, 24, 8>, <5, 24, 16>, <5, 24, 17>, <5, 16, 24>, <5, 16, 8>, <5, 16, 24>, <5, 16, 17>, <5, 17, 8>, <5, 17, 24>, <5, 17, 16>
