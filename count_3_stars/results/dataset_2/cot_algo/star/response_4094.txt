Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 13) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 16) (9, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 17) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 19) (18, 12) (19, 14) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 1) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 17) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 1) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 16) (1, 12) (1, 19) (1, 16) (2, 10) (2, 3) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 15) (15, 12) (15, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors: 11, 5, 14
2. Node 1: Neighbors: 12, 16, 19
3. Node 2: Neighbors: 10, 3
4. Node 3: Neighbors: 11, 2, 14, 7
5. Node 4: Neighbors: 5, 6, 12, 19, 17
6. Node 5: Neighbors: 11, 0, 4
7. Node 6: Neighbors: 11, 4, 8
8. Node 7: Neighbors: 3, 13, 17
9. Node 8: Neighbors: 6, 16
10. Node 9: Neighbor: 10
11. Node 10: Neighbor: 2, 9
12. Node 11: Neighbors: 3, 0, 5, 6
13. Node 12: Neighbors: 4, 18, 15, 1, 19
14. Node 13: Neighbors: 14, 7, 15
15. Node 14: Neighbors: 19, 3, 13, 0
16. Node 15: Neighbors: 13, 12
17. Node 16: Neighbors: 8, 17, 1
18. Node 17: Neighbors: 4, 7, 16
19. Node 18: Neighbor: 12
20. Node 19: Neighbors: 14, 4, 12, 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
2. Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
3. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
5. Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
6. Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
7. Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
8. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
9. Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
10. Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
11. Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 11, 14>
<1, 12, 16>
<3, 11, 14>
<3, 11, 2>
<3, 14, 7>
<4, 5, 19>
<4, 6, 19>
<4, 12, 19>
<4, 12, 17>
<12, 18, 15>
<14, 19, 3>
<14, 19, 13>
<16, 17, 1>
<19, 12, 1>
<19, 12, 4>
<19, 12, 1>
