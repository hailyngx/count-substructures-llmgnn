Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 21) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 29) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 2) (20, 1) (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 18) (25, 20) (25, 15) (18, 22) (18, 20) (18, 8) (4, 8) (4, 27) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 4) (7, 11) (7, 20) (7, 12) (7, 27) (12, 7) (12, 15) (17, 11) (17, 29) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 6) (29, 26) (26, 29) (26, 28) (26, 24) (26, 14) (26, 0) (28, 26) (28, 27) (28, 24) (24, 26) (24, 28) (24, 21) (27, 4) (27, 7) (27, 28) (27, 21) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 5) (23, 10) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 6) (15, 25) (15, 12) (6, 29) (6, 23) (21, 22) (21, 24) (21, 27) (21, 14) (0, 10) (0, 26) (14, 26) (14, 23) (14, 21) (14, 16) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 9) (9, 2) (16, 3) (16, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {10, 26}
- Node 1: {3, 8, 20}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {1, 8, 16, 29}
- Node 4: {8, 27}
- Node 5: {2, 19}
- Node 6: {14, 23, 29}
- Node 7: {11, 12, 20, 27}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 18}
- Node 9: {2}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 11, 23}
- Node 11: {2, 7, 10, 17, 23}
- Node 12: {7, 15}
- Node 13: {22}
- Node 14: {6, 16, 21, 23, 26}
- Node 15: {12, 25}
- Node 16: {3, 14}
- Node 17: {11, 29}
- Node 18: {8, 20, 22}
- Node 19: {5}
- Node 20: {1, 18, 7, 25}
- Node 21: {14, 21, 22, 24, 27}
- Node 22: {13, 18, 21}
- Node 23: {6, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 24: {26, 28, 21}
- Node 25: {15, 20}
- Node 26: {0, 14, 24, 28, 29}
- Node 27: {4, 7, 21, 28}
- Node 28: {24, 26, 27}
- Node 29: {3, 6, 16, 17, 26}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 75

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [75].

List of unique 3-stars:
