Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 12) (15, 24) (27, 15) (27, 10) (27, 8) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 21) (29, 6) (29, 18) (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 26) (6, 29) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 7) (18, 29) (18, 22) (18, 24) (22, 14) (22, 18) (22, 21) (1, 26) (1, 13) (26, 17) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 25) (5, 26) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 13) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 25) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 8) (11, 13) (11, 4) (23, 4) (3, 6) (3, 28) (3, 20) (28, 2) (28, 3) (28, 0) (24, 15) (24, 17) (24, 6) (24, 18) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 21) (21, 2) (21, 22) (21, 0) (20, 2) (20, 3) (4, 11) (4, 23) (4, 10) (10, 27) (10, 9) (10, 19) (10, 4) (16, 9) (8, 27) (8, 25) (8, 12) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 11) (12, 15) (12, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we first construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {15, 28, 21}
- Node 1: {26, 13}
- Node 2: {20, 28, 21}
- Node 3: {6, 28, 20}
- Node 4: {11, 23, 10}
- Node 5: {26, 19, 7}
- Node 6: {29, 9, 24, 3}
- Node 7: {5, 25, 9}
- Node 8: {27, 25, 12}
- Node 9: {6, 10, 16, 7}
- Node 10: {27, 9, 19, 4}
- Node 11: {13, 4}
- Node 12: {15, 8}
- Node 13: {15, 1, 19, 11}
- Node 14: {17, 22, 19}
- Node 15: {27, 0, 13, 12, 24}
- Node 16: {9}
- Node 17: {14, 24, 26}
- Node 18: {29, 22, 24}
- Node 19: {14, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 20: {2, 3}
- Node 21: {2, 22, 0}
- Node 22: {14, 18, 21}
- Node 23: {4}
- Node 24: {17, 6, 18, 15}
- Node 25: {26, 8, 7}
- Node 26: {17, 1, 5, 25}
- Node 27: {15, 10, 8}
- Node 28: {2, 3, 0}
- Node 29: {6, 18}

From the neighbor sets, we can see that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.

For each of these nodes, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 44 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <15, (0, 12, 24)>
- <27, (8, 25, 15)>
- <2, (20, 28, 21)>
- <6, (29, 9, 24)>
- <9, (10, 19, 6)>
- <13, (1, 11, 15)>
- <14, (22, 19, 17)>
- <15, (24, 12, 0)>
- <17, (14, 26, 24)>
- <18, (29, 24, 22)>
- <19, (10, 13, 5)>
- <24, (18, 17, 6)>
- <26, (25, 17, 5)>
- <28, (0, 2, 3)>
