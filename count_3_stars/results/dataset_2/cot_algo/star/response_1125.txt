Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 9) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 10) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 18) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 5) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 14) (0, 8) (0, 7) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 11) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 2) (19, 18) (19, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 5) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 2) (17, 12) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 15) (2, 3) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {8, 7}
- Node 1: {15, 2}
- Node 2: {6, 1, 15, 3}
- Node 3: {7, 19, 2}
- Node 4: {8, 18, 12, 10}
- Node 5: {6, 18, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 2}
- Node 7: {13, 0, 3}
- Node 8: {13, 4, 10, 0}
- Node 9: {16, 6, 14, 10}
- Node 10: {9, 8, 4}
- Node 11: {16, 14, 15}
- Node 12: {4, 17, 18}
- Node 13: {8, 15, 7}
- Node 14: {11, 9, 5}
- Node 15: {13, 1, 11, 2}
- Node 16: {11, 9}
- Node 17: {12}
- Node 18: {4, 12, 19, 5}
- Node 19: {18, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 8
- Node 9
- Node 10
- Node 12
- Node 13
- Node 15
- Node 18

These nodes can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars formed is 24. 

Therefore, the answer is [24]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (6, 15, 3)>
- <2, (6, 15, 1)>
- <2, (6, 1, 3)>
- <2, (15, 1, 3)>
- <3, (7, 19, 2)>
- <4, (8, 18, 12)>
- <5, (6, 18, 14)>
- <8, (13, 10, 4)>
- <9, (16, 14, 10)>
- <12, (4, 17, 18)>
- <13, (15, 7, 1)>
- <15, (13, 11, 2)>
- <18, (12, 19, 5)>
