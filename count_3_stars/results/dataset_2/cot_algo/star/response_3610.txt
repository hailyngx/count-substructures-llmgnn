Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (6, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 10) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 14) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify which nodes can form 3-stars based on their neighbors. 

Here are the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 2, 13, 10
- Node 1: 2, 13, 10, 11, 14
- Node 2: 1, 10, 14, 0
- Node 3: 7, 13, 9, 14, 12
- Node 4: 9, 0
- Node 5: 13, 8, 11
- Node 6: 12
- Node 7: 4, 0, 3, 14, 8
- Node 8: 7, 5, 10, 12
- Node 9: 4, 10, 3
- Node 10: 2, 8, 0, 9, 1, 14
- Node 11: 5, 13, 1, 12
- Node 12: 6, 8, 3, 11
- Node 13: 5, 8, 11, 3, 1, 0
- Node 14: 7, 2, 10, 3, 1

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 13 <0, (4, 7, 13)>
- Node 1: forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 10, and 13 <1, (2, 10, 13)>
- Node 3: forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 13, and 14 <3, (7, 13, 14)>
- Node 8: forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 10, and 13 <8, (5, 10, 13)>
- Node 10: forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 14, and 0 <10, (2, 14, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
