Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
The central idea here is to identify all unique 3-stars in the given graph. To do this, we first need to find the neighbor nodes of each node.  
Here are the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 6, 1}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 9, 2, 0}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 7, 1}
- Node 3: {5, 9}
- Node 4: {8, 5, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {4, 2, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 0}
- Node 7: {8, 5, 6, 9, 2}
- Node 8: {4, 9, 0, 7}
- Node 9: {8, 2, 3, 1, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 2)>, <1, (4, 5, 0)>, <1, (4, 5, 2)>, <1, (4, 9, 2)>, <1, (4, 9, 0)>, <1, (4, 2, 0)>, <1, (5, 9, 2)>, <1, (5, 9, 0)>, <1, (5, 2, 0)>
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 additional 3-stars.
  <5, (4, 1, 3)>, <5, (4, 1, 7)>, <5, (4, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (4, 9, 3)>, <5, (4, 9, 7)>, <5, (4, 3, 7)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 9, 3)>, <5, (1, 9, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars is 20, so we put this number inside brackets: [20].
