This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 19) (2, 29) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 14) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 6) (25, 3) (25, 1) (22, 19) (22, 11) (23, 8) (23, 6) (23, 10) (23, 0) (8, 23) (8, 28) (8, 20) (8, 15) (8, 17) (18, 9) (18, 0) (6, 3) (6, 23) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 27) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 6) (26, 14) (26, 15) (26, 16) (4, 27) (4, 1) (4, 11) (27, 6) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 10) (27, 20) (17, 8) (17, 13) (20, 8) (20, 27) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 19) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 27) (12, 13) (12, 16) (12, 1) (19, 9) (19, 22) (19, 13) (19, 24) (7, 29) (11, 22) (11, 4) (11, 21) (1, 25) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 12) (16, 9) (16, 26) (16, 12) (24, 3) (24, 19) (24, 21) (15, 8) (15, 26) (15, 0) (0, 29) (0, 23) (0, 18) (0, 15) (10, 2) (10, 23) (10, 27) (21, 11) (21, 24) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {29, 23, 18, 15}
- Node 1: {25, 6, 4, 12}
- Node 2: {29, 10}
- Node 3: {25, 28, 24, 6}
- Node 4: {27, 1, 11}
- Node 6: {3, 23, 28, 1, 27}
- Node 7: {29}
- Node 8: {23, 28, 20, 15, 17}
- Node 9: {18, 16, 19}
- Node 10: {2, 23, 27}
- Node 11: {22, 4, 21}
- Node 12: {13, 16, 1}
- Node 13: {17, 12, 19}
- Node 14: {29, 26, 27}
- Node 15: {8, 26, 0}
- Node 16: {9, 26, 12}
- Node 17: {8, 13}
- Node 18: {9, 0}
- Node 19: {22, 13, 9, 24}
- Node 20: {8, 27}
- Node 21: {11, 24}
- Node 22: {19, 11}
- Node 23: {8, 6, 0, 10}
- Node 24: {3, 19, 21}
- Node 25: {3, 1}
- Node 26: {29, 15, 16}
- Node 27: {4, 6, 14, 20, 10}
- Node 28: {3, 8, 6}
- Node 29: {2, 7, 0, 14}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <0, 15, 18>, <0, 15, 23>, <0, 18, 29>, <0, 23, 29>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <1, 6, 25>, <1, 6, 12>, <1, 12, 16>, <1, 25, 6>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <3, 6, 28>, <3, 6, 25>, <3, 6, 23>, <3, 25, 28>
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <8, 15, 26>, <8, 15, 23>, <8, 15, 17>, <8, 15, 20>, <8, 17, 20>, <8, 17, 13>, <8, 17, 15>, <8, 17, 28>, <8, 17, 23>, <8, 20, 27>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <9, 16, 18>
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <13, 17, 19>
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <14, 27, 29>
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <19, 24, 22>, <19, 24, 21>, <19, 24, 3>, <19, 24, 13>
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <16, 9, 26>
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <27, 10, 20>, <27, 10, 4>, <27, 10, 6>, <27, 10, 14>, <27, 4, 11>, <27, 4, 1>, <27, 4, 6>, <27, 4, 14>, <27, 1, 6>, <27, 1, 14>
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <28, 3, 6>
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <29, 14, 26>, <29, 14, 27>, <29, 14, 2>, <29, 2, 7>

Adding these up, we get a total of 40 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [40].
