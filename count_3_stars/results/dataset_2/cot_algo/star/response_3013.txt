Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 27) (3, 28) (3, 17) (3, 29) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 9) (11, 12) (0, 28) (0, 5) (14, 13) (14, 25) (26, 21) (26, 6) (26, 8) (28, 3) (28, 0) (28, 9) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 24) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 27) (13, 6) (7, 24) (7, 27) (25, 14) (25, 21) (8, 26) (8, 20) (8, 29) (8, 27) (19, 22) (19, 15) (19, 12) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 6) (22, 19) (22, 17) (22, 21) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 6) (29, 3) (29, 8) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 4) (17, 3) (17, 22) (17, 24) (16, 18) (24, 5) (24, 7) (24, 17) (24, 18) (18, 16) (18, 24) (18, 23) (18, 27) (23, 15) (23, 18) (23, 21) (23, 20) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 28) (20, 8) (20, 23) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 22) (21, 23) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 7) (27, 8) (27, 18) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 15) (6, 26) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 12) 

Response:
The first step is to identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 28, 5
- Node 1: 27
- Node 2: 10, 5, 6
- Node 3: 28, 17, 29
- Node 4: 10, 13, 15
- Node 5: 0, 13, 2, 24
- Node 6: 26, 13, 2, 12
- Node 7: 24, 27
- Node 8: 26, 29, 27, 20
- Node 9: 10, 11, 28
- Node 10: 4, 2, 9
- Node 11: 9, 12
- Node 12: 11, 19, 6
- Node 13: 4, 5, 6, 27
- Node 14: 13, 25
- Node 15: 19, 23, 4
- Node 16: 18
- Node 17: 3, 22, 24
- Node 18: 16, 24, 23, 27
- Node 19: 22, 15, 12
- Node 20: 8, 23
- Node 21: 26, 25, 22, 23
- Node 22: 19, 17, 21
- Node 23: 15, 18, 21, 20
- Node 24: 5, 7, 17, 18
- Node 25: 14, 21
- Node 26: 21, 8, 6
- Node 27: 1, 13, 7, 8, 18
- Node 28: 3, 0, 9
- Node 29: 3, 8

Nodes with three or more neighbors that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1 3-star]
- Node 3: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1 3-star]
- Node 5: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars]
- Node 6: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars]
- Node 8: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars]
- Node 10: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1 3-star]
- Node 12: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1 3-star]
- Node 13: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars]
- Node 15: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1 3-star]
- Node 17: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1 3-star]
- Node 18: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars]
- Node 21: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars]
- Node 22: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1 3-star]
- Node 23: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars]
- Node 24: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars]
- Node 26: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1 3-star]
- Node 27: [\( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10 3-stars]
- Node 28: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1 3-star]

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 47

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [47].
