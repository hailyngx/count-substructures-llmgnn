Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 10) (9, 8) (9, 15) (1, 20) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 27) (7, 21) (7, 20) (21, 6) (21, 7) (21, 23) (21, 5) (21, 22) (10, 6) (10, 17) (10, 27) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 27) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 16) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 22) (8, 18) (29, 5) (24, 6) (24, 26) (26, 24) (26, 15) (16, 4) (16, 28) (16, 15) (28, 16) (28, 13) (28, 18) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 20) (12, 17) (12, 2) (2, 12) (2, 22) (2, 13) (2, 25) (22, 21) (22, 8) (22, 2) (11, 14) (11, 25) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 5) (23, 21) (23, 10) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 5) (15, 9) (15, 26) (15, 16) (15, 0) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 19) (27, 3) (27, 10) (27, 17) (18, 8) (18, 28) (18, 14) (18, 13) (25, 2) (25, 11) (13, 28) (13, 2) (13, 18) (5, 21) (5, 29) (5, 14) (5, 0) 

Response:
The graph has the following neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 20}
- Node 2: {12, 13, 22, 25}
- Node 3: {0, 14, 27}
- Node 4: {8, 16, 19}
- Node 5: {0, 14, 21, 29}
- Node 6: {10, 21, 24}
- Node 7: {20, 21}
- Node 8: {4, 9, 18, 19, 22}
- Node 9: {8, 15}
- Node 10: {6, 17, 23, 27}
- Node 11: {14, 25}
- Node 12: {2, 17}
- Node 13: {2, 18, 28}
- Node 14: {3, 5, 11, 18}
- Node 15: {0, 9, 16, 26}
- Node 16: {4, 15, 28}
- Node 17: {10, 12, 27}
- Node 18: {8, 13, 14, 28}
- Node 19: {4, 8, 20}
- Node 20: {1, 7, 19}
- Node 21: {5, 6, 7, 22, 23}
- Node 22: {2, 8, 21}
- Node 23: {10, 21}
- Node 24: {6, 26}
- Node 25: {2, 11}
- Node 26: {15, 24}
- Node 27: {3, 10, 17}
- Node 28: {13, 16, 18}
- Node 29: {5}

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 
Node 5, Node 14, and Node 21 each have 4 neighbors, so they each contribute \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 0, Node 8, and Node 18 each have 5 neighbors, so they each contribute \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 
\( 3 \times 4 + 3 \times 10 = 12 + 30 = 42 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <5, (0, 14, 21)>
- <5, (0, 14, 29)>
- <5, (0, 21, 29)>
- <14, (3, 5, 18)>
- <18, (8, 13, 28)>
- <18, (8, 14, 28)>
- <18, (13, 14, 28)>
- <21, (5, 6, 23)>
- <21, (5, 7, 22)>
- <21, (6, 7, 22)>
