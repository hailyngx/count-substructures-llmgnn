Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 18) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 19) (10, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (3, 12) (3, 18) (1, 11) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 17) (15, 4) (8, 9) (13, 6) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 5) (17, 15) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 15) (12, 11) (12, 3) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 19) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 19) (14, 19) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 14) (18, 16) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 15, 18, 19}
- Node 1: {11, 15, 12}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {12, 18}
- Node 4: {10, 6, 15}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 17}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 4, 0, 13}
- Node 7: {16, 9, 6, 15, 19}
- Node 8: {9}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 7, 19}
- Node 10: {4}
- Node 11: {16, 1, 12}
- Node 12: {11, 3}
- Node 13: {6, 19, 18}
- Node 14: {19}
- Node 15: {1, 7, 5, 4, 17, 0}
- Node 16: {11, 7, 18}
- Node 17: {5, 15}
- Node 18: {16, 3, 13, 0}
- Node 19: {9, 13, 7, 0, 14}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as those are the ones that can form 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 5, 15, 6, 7, 9, 19

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars formed: 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 58

Therefore, the final answer is [58], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<5, 2, 6, 17>, 
<15, 17, 5, 4>, 
<6, 7, 13, 19>, 
<7, 16, 18, 9>, 
<9, 7, 5, 19>
