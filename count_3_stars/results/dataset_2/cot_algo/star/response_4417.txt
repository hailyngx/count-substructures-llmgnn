Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 1) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 8, 11}
Node 1: {5, 6, 8, 13}
Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
Node 3: {0, 2, 8, 12}
Node 4: {2}
Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 9}
Node 6: {1, 10, 11, 12, 14}
Node 7: {2, 10, 11, 12, 13}
Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 11, 13, 14}
Node 9: {2, 5, 12}
Node 10: {6, 7}
Node 11: {0, 6, 7, 8, 14}
Node 12: {3, 6, 7, 9}
Node 13: {1, 7, 8, 14}
Node 14: {6, 8, 11, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed with them:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14

Number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 90

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [90].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 8, 11)>
<0, (3, 8, 14)>
<0, (5, 11, 14)>
<0, (5, 8, 13)>
<0, (5, 11, 8)>
<1, (6, 13, 14)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (7, 12, 13)>
<2, (7, 12, 6)>
<2, (9, 12, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 11, 14)>
<7, (2, 10, 12)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<11, (6, 7, 14)>
<12, (3, 6, 7)>
<13, (1, 7, 14)>
<14, (6, 8, 11)>
