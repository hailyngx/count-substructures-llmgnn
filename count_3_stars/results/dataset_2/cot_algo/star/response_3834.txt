Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 3) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 5) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 14) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {4, 12, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {11, 6, 2, 9, 5}
- Node 2: {7, 1, 9, 13}
- Node 3: {12, 0, 11}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 0}
- Node 5: {7, 1, 14, 0, 10}
- Node 6: {12, 1, 14, 13}
- Node 7: {4, 12, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 14}
- Node 9: {11, 1, 2}
- Node 10: {13, 5}
- Node 11: {12, 3, 1, 9, 14}
- Node 12: {7, 6, 0, 3, 11}
- Node 13: {6, 14, 2, 10}
- Node 14: {8, 11, 6, 13, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50].

Unique 3-stars found:
