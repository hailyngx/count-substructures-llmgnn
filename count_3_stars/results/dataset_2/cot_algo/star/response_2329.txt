Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 24) (22, 17) (22, 8) (9, 26) (9, 19) (9, 11) (9, 3) (26, 9) (26, 10) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 24) (2, 17) (29, 2) (29, 8) (0, 20) (0, 4) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 19) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 5) (8, 22) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 14) (21, 28) (21, 16) (21, 11) (21, 25) (28, 21) (28, 1) (28, 12) (4, 0) (4, 18) (4, 23) (18, 4) (18, 14) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 23) (5, 13) (5, 15) (7, 20) (7, 25) (7, 16) (25, 21) (25, 7) (25, 11) (10, 26) (10, 15) (10, 3) (17, 22) (17, 2) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 19) (16, 21) (16, 7) (12, 28) (12, 11) (19, 9) (19, 20) (19, 15) (19, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 27) (23, 4) (23, 6) (23, 27) (11, 9) (11, 21) (11, 25) (11, 12) (27, 3) (27, 23) (1, 28) (24, 22) (24, 2) 

Response:
The nodes that have at least 3 neighbors are: 2, 4, 8, 9, 13, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 28.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<4, (0, 18, 14)>
<8, (2, 14, 29)>
<9, (3, 10, 15)>
<13, (3, 6, 5)>
<15, (5, 19, 20)>
<19, (14, 15, 20)>
<20, (0, 7, 19)>
<21, (11, 16, 25)>
<22, (8, 13, 17)>
<25, (7, 11, 21)>
<26, (3, 9, 10)>
<28, (1, 12, 21)>
