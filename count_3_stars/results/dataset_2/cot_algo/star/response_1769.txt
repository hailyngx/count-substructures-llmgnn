Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 3, 8, 6}
- Node 1: {9, 4, 3, 2}
- Node 2: {9, 1, 3, 8, 6}
- Node 3: {7, 1, 2, 0}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 8, 7}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 4, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {5, 4, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 7, 1, 0}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 8, and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 6, and Node 7 have 4 neighbors each.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0, Node 2, Node 8, and Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- For Node 1, Node 4, Node 6, and Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (9, 3, 8)>
- <2, (9, 1, 8)>
- <8, (5, 4, 0)>
- <9, (5, 8, 7)>
- <1, (9, 4, 3)>
- <4, (7, 8, 6)>
- <6, (4, 7, 2)>
- <7, (5, 4, 3)>
