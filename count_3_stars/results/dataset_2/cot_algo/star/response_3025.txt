Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 14) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 0) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 2) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 9) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 5, 2, 9
- Node 1: 3, 6, 5
- Node 2: 4, 14, 7, 0
- Node 3: 1, 11, 4, 9, 12, 8
- Node 4: 3, 10, 11, 2
- Node 5: 1, 0, 7, 14
- Node 6: 1, 8, 11, 14
- Node 7: 8, 13, 11, 5, 2
- Node 8: 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 10, 14, 0
- Node 10: 11, 12, 4, 9
- Node 11: 3, 10, 7, 6, 4, 1
- Node 12: 3, 13, 10
- Node 13: 12, 14, 7
- Node 14: 13, 5, 6, 2, 9

Next, we identify nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 3 has 6 neighbors: <3, (1, 11, 4)>, <3, (1, 12, 8)>, <3, (4, 11, 8)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: <4, (2, 10, 11)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: <5, (1, 7, 14)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: <6, (1, 11, 14)>
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: <7, (2, 11, 13)>, <7, (5, 11, 14)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: <9, (0, 10, 14)>
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: <10, (4, 9, 11)>
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors: <11, (1, 3, 6)>, <11, (1, 4, 7)>, <11, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: <14, (2, 5, 13)>, <14, (2, 6, 9)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars formed, the total number is 16. Therefore, the answer is [16].
