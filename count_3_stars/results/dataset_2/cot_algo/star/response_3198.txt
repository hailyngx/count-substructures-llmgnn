Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 12) (16, 0) (16, 5) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 23) (6, 27) (9, 29) (4, 24) (4, 3) (8, 14) (8, 21) (8, 26) (8, 12) (5, 16) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 21) (26, 8) (26, 25) (26, 17) (26, 27) (28, 0) (28, 15) (17, 26) (17, 20) (17, 18) (20, 17) (20, 21) (20, 2) (27, 6) (27, 26) (27, 25) (27, 21) (1, 5) (1, 29) (1, 10) (29, 9) (29, 1) (29, 0) (29, 18) (19, 6) (19, 18) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 12) (18, 17) (18, 29) (18, 19) (0, 16) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 2) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 23) (3, 22) (7, 22) (2, 20) (2, 0) (2, 15) (14, 8) (14, 23) (21, 8) (21, 5) (21, 20) (21, 27) (13, 11) (13, 25) (13, 3) (15, 28) (15, 2) (24, 4) (24, 12) (24, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 25) (12, 24) (12, 22) (10, 1) (10, 24) (22, 3) (22, 7) (22, 12) (23, 6) (23, 3) (23, 14) 

Response:
From the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed.

First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: {16, 28, 29, 2}
- Node 1: {5, 29, 10}
- Node 2: {20, 0, 15}
- Node 3: {4, 13, 23, 22}
- Node 4: {24, 3, 12}
- Node 5: {16, 6, 1, 21}
- Node 6: {5, 19, 23, 27}
- Node 7: {22}
- Node 8: {14, 21, 26, 12}
- Node 9: {29}
- Node 10: {1, 24}
- Node 11: {13, 12}
- Node 12: {11, 8, 25, 24, 22}
- Node 13: {11, 25, 3}
- Node 14: {8, 23}
- Node 15: {28, 2}
- Node 16: {0, 5}
- Node 17: {26, 20, 18}
- Node 18: {17, 29, 19}
- Node 19: {6, 18}
- Node 20: {17, 21, 2}
- Node 21: {8, 5, 20, 27}
- Node 22: {3, 7, 12}
- Node 23: {6, 3, 14}
- Node 24: {4, 12, 10}
- Node 25: {26, 12, 13}
- Node 26: {8, 25, 17, 27}
- Node 27: {6, 26, 25, 21}
- Node 28: {0, 15}
- Node 29: {9, 1, 0, 18}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 7: No 3-star can be formed (less than 3 neighbor nodes)
- Node 9: No 3-star can be formed (less than 3 neighbor nodes)
- Node 15: No 3-star can be formed (less than 3 neighbor nodes)

Nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: [1] (<0, (16, 28, 2)>)
- Node 1: [1] (<1, (5, 29, 10)>)
- Node 2: No 3-star can be formed (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: No 3-star can be formed (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: [1] (<4, (24, 12, 3)>)
- Node 5: [1] (<5, (16, 6, 1)>)
- Node 6: [2] (<6, (5, 19, 23)>, <6, (5, 21, 27)>)
- Node 8: [1] (<8, (14, 21, 26)>)
- Node 10: [1] (<10, (1, 24, 4)>)
- Node 11: [1] (<11, (13, 12, 25)>)
- Node 12: [3] (<12, (11, 8, 25)>, <12, (11, 24, 10)>, <12, (3, 24, 22)>)
- Node 13: [1] (<13, (11, 25, 3)>)
- Node 14: [1] (<14, (8, 23, 3)>)
- Node 16: No 3-star can be formed (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 17: [1] (<17, (26, 20, 18)>)
- Node 18: [1] (<18, (17, 29, 19)>)
- Node 19: No 3-star can be formed (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 20: No 3-star can be formed (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 21: [1] (<21, (8, 5, 20)>)
- Node 22: [1] (<22, (3, 12, 7)>)
- Node 23: [1] (<23, (6, 3, 14)>)
- Node 24: No 3-star can be formed (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 25: No 3-star can be formed (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 26: No 3-star can be formed (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 27: [1] (<27, (21, 5, 26)>)
- Node 28: No 3-star can be formed (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 29: [1] (<29, (9, 1, 0)>)

Total number of 3-stars: [14]
