Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 23) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 6) (0, 27) (0, 11) (0, 29) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 7) (27, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 0) (11, 10) (11, 22) (11, 13) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 25) (7, 27) (7, 18) (12, 14) (12, 9) (29, 17) (29, 0) (29, 6) (29, 25) (29, 24) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 26) (19, 22) (19, 1) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 21) (21, 26) (21, 28) (21, 2) (28, 21) (28, 2) (13, 11) (13, 26) (13, 3) (24, 29) (24, 26) (1, 19) (1, 15) (1, 18) (15, 1) (2, 21) (2, 28) (22, 11) (22, 19) (22, 20) (6, 17) (6, 27) (6, 29) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (16, 14) (16, 5) (5, 3) (5, 16) (23, 14) (23, 0) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 20) (25, 8) (25, 29) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 1) (20, 22) (20, 9) 

Response:
Let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 27, 11, 29, 23
- Node 1: 19, 15, 18
- Node 2: 21, 28
- Node 3: 10, 13, 5
- Node 4: 8, 9, 19
- Node 5: 3, 16
- Node 6: 17, 27, 29
- Node 7: 27, 18
- Node 8: 10, 11, 4, 19, 25
- Node 9: 4, 12, 20
- Node 10: 11, 3, 8
- Node 11: 0, 10, 22, 13, 8
- Node 12: 14, 9
- Node 13: 11, 26, 3
- Node 14: 17, 12, 23, 16
- Node 15: 1
- Node 16: 14, 5
- Node 17: 14, 29, 6
- Node 18: 27, 7, 1
- Node 19: 4, 8, 26, 22, 1
- Node 20: 22, 9
- Node 21: 2, 28
- Node 22: 11, 19, 20
- Node 23: 14, 0
- Node 24: 29, 26
- Node 25: 8, 29
- Node 26: 19, 13, 24, 21
- Node 27: 0, 18, 7, 6
- Node 28: 21, 2
- Node 29: 17, 0, 6, 25, 24

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors (3-star formed)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (3-star formed)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (3-star formed)
- Node 11: 5 neighbors (3-star formed)
- Node 19: 5 neighbors (3-star formed)
- Node 26: 4 neighbors (3-star formed)
- Node 27: 4 neighbors (3-star formed)
- Node 29: 5 neighbors (3-star formed)

Now, calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 14 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (27, 29, 11)>, <4, (8, 19, 25)>, <8, (10, 11, 19)>, <11, (0, 10, 22)>, <19, (4, 8, 26)>, <26, (13, 24, 21)>, <27, (18, 7, 6)>, <29, (17, 6, 25)>
