Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node. 

The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 8}

Now, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if it can form a 3-star:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars, we get 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 49.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <1, 3, 7>
