Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {9, 7, 3}
Node 1: {5, 9, 3}
Node 2: {5, 8}
Node 3: {4, 1, 6, 8, 0}
Node 4: {5, 9, 6, 3}
Node 5: {9, 6, 1, 4, 2}
Node 6: {5, 4, 7, 3, 8}
Node 7: {9, 0, 6, 8}
Node 8: {7, 3, 6, 2}
Node 9: {5, 4, 1, 7, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have 3 3-stars in total, so the final result is [3].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (5, 8, 7)>
<7, (9, 0, 4)>
<5, (9, 1, 6)>
