Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 5) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: {6, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {6, 2, 3}
- Node 2: {6, 1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {9, 1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {9, 3, 7, 8, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 0, 8, 2}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 7: {9, 3, 4, 0}
- Node 8: {9, 5, 4, 2}
- Node 9: {8, 4, 3, 7}

From the neighbor sets, we find that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 47 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \[47\], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 7), (5, 8), (7, 8), (7, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 4), (3, 1, 4), (3, 4, 1), (4, 1, 3), (4, 1, 3)>
<3, (1, 2, 4), (1, 4, 2), (2, 1, 4), (2, 4, 1), (4, 1, 2), (4, 2, 1)>
<4, (3, 5, 7), (5, 7, 3), (7, 3, 5), (7, 5, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 8), (0, 8, 2), (2, 0, 8), (2, 8, 0), (8, 0, 2), (8, 2, 0)>

<9, (3, 4, 7), (3, 7, 4), (4, 3, 7), (4, 7, 3), (7, 3, 4), (7, 4, 3)>
