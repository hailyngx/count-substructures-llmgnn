Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 4) (5, 9) (5, 29) (5, 11) (5, 24) (6, 17) (6, 10) (3, 21) (3, 10) (25, 15) (25, 0) (18, 27) (18, 10) (18, 20) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 28) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 12) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 21) (29, 5) (29, 2) (29, 28) (0, 25) (0, 24) (0, 1) (20, 9) (20, 18) (20, 2) (28, 22) (28, 29) (28, 15) (8, 2) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 7) (15, 25) (15, 28) (27, 9) (27, 18) (27, 14) (1, 26) (1, 0) (1, 8) (21, 3) (21, 2) (16, 24) (16, 17) (16, 14) (11, 5) (11, 23) (4, 26) (4, 22) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 16) (24, 5) (24, 0) (24, 16) (24, 7) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 12) (12, 23) (12, 19) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 7) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 14) (7, 8) (7, 24) (7, 13) (14, 27) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 13) (14, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {1, 24, 25}
Node 1: {0, 8, 26}
Node 2: {8, 20, 21, 29}
Node 3: {10, 21}
Node 4: {1, 22, 26}
Node 5: {9, 11, 24, 29}
Node 6: {10, 17}
Node 7: {8, 13, 24}
Node 8: {1, 2, 7, 17}
Node 9: {5, 20, 26, 27}
Node 10: {3, 6, 14, 18}
Node 11: {5, 23}
Node 12: {19, 23}
Node 13: {7, 14, 19}
Node 14: {10, 13, 16, 27}
Node 15: {25, 28}
Node 16: {14, 17, 24}
Node 17: {6, 8, 16}
Node 18: {10, 20, 27}
Node 19: {12, 13, 14}
Node 20: {2, 9, 18}
Node 21: {2, 3}
Node 22: {4, 23, 28}
Node 23: {11, 12, 22}
Node 24: {0, 5, 7, 16}
Node 25: {0, 15}
Node 26: {1, 4, 9}
Node 27: {9, 14, 18}
Node 28: {2, 15, 22, 29}
Node 29: {2, 5, 28}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

Node 9 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

Unique 3-stars:
<9, (5, 20, 27)>
<5, (9, 11, 24)>
<2, (8, 20, 29)>
