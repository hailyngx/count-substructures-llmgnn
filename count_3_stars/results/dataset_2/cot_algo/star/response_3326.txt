Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 23) (9, 0) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 3) (8, 4) (13, 15) (13, 27) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 6) (22, 24) (23, 9) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 1) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 27) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 27) (4, 8) (4, 20) (4, 6) (4, 15) (16, 28) (16, 14) (28, 9) (28, 16) (28, 3) (28, 14) (29, 1) (29, 5) (21, 12) (21, 19) (2, 22) (2, 27) (12, 21) (12, 11) (12, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 20) (11, 25) (14, 16) (14, 28) (14, 11) (1, 23) (1, 29) (6, 22) (6, 4) (6, 25) (3, 26) (3, 10) (3, 28) (3, 12) (5, 29) (5, 0) (15, 26) (15, 13) (15, 23) (15, 4) (20, 4) (20, 11) (20, 18) (25, 11) (25, 6) (25, 24) (24, 22) (24, 25) (18, 10) (18, 20) (18, 27) (18, 0) (27, 13) (27, 10) (27, 17) (27, 2) (27, 18) (19, 17) (19, 21) (19, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {9, 5, 18, 19}
- Node 1: {23, 29}
- Node 2: {22, 27}
- Node 3: {26, 10, 28, 12}
- Node 4: {8, 20, 6, 15}
- Node 5: {0, 29}
- Node 6: {22, 4, 25}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {26, 23, 28, 0}
- Node 10: {17, 3, 18, 27}
- Node 11: {12, 14, 20, 25}
- Node 12: {21, 11, 3}
- Node 13: {15, 27}
- Node 14: {16, 28, 11}
- Node 15: {26, 13, 23, 4}
- Node 16: {28, 14}
- Node 17: {10, 19, 27}
- Node 18: {10, 20, 27, 0}
- Node 19: {17, 21, 0}
- Node 20: {4, 11, 18}
- Node 21: {12, 19}
- Node 22: {23, 2, 6, 24}
- Node 23: {9, 22, 15, 1}
- Node 24: {22, 25}
- Node 25: {11, 6, 24}
- Node 26: {9, 15, 3}
- Node 27: {13, 2, 18, 10}
- Node 28: {9, 16, 3, 14}
- Node 29: {1, 5}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (26, 23, 0)>
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star: <22, (23, 2, 6)>
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star: <23, (9, 22, 15)>
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star: <27, (13, 2, 18)>
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star: <28, (16, 3, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
