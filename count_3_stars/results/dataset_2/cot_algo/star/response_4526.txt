Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 14) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 7) 

Response:
After exploring the neighbor nodes for each node, we find the following:

- Node 0: {9, 4, 8, 12}
- Node 1: {4, 7}
- Node 2: {6, 3, 10, 13, 12}
- Node 3: {6, 11, 7, 2}
- Node 4: {1, 11, 0, 8}
- Node 5: {9, 12}
- Node 6: {9, 3, 2}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {4, 0, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 0, 14}
- Node 10: {11, 12, 2}
- Node 11: {3, 10, 13, 4, 7}
- Node 12: {5, 10, 8, 0, 2, 14}
- Node 13: {11, 2, 14, 7}
- Node 14: {9, 8, 13, 12, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with this information: 
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
- Node 12: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
- Node 14: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node, we get a total of 60. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [60]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 8, 12>, <0, 8, 14>, <0, 12, 14>, <2, 7, 13>, <3, 4, 11>, <3, 7, 11>, <3, 7, 13>, <7, 11, 13>
