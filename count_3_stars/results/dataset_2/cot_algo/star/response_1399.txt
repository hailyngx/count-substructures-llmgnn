Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (6, 5) (6, 10) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 12) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 11) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 10}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {5, 10}
- Node 7: {2, 11, 13, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 10, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 5, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 14: {8, 9, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Nodes 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 13 have 6 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed:
- For nodes with 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars per node
- For nodes with 7 neighbors: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars per node

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 35 + 35 = 150

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [150].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 4, 13>
- <4, 8, 13>
- <5, 9, 13>
- <5, 11, 14>
- <8, 9, 13>
