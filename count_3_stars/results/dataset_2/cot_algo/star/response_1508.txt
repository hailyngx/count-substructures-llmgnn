Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 11) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 13) (1, 2) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 8) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 16) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 4) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 13) (16, 7) (11, 2) (11, 1) (14, 18) (14, 13) (3, 6) (3, 19) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 6) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 14) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 19) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 7, 12}
- Node 1: {2, 8, 11, 17}
- Node 2: {1, 11, 17}
- Node 3: {6, 19}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6, 10}
- Node 5: {4, 10, 15}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 8, 12}
- Node 7: {0, 9, 16}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 10, 15}
- Node 9: {7, 12}
- Node 10: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 11: {1, 2}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 9, 18, 19}
- Node 13: {14, 15, 18}
- Node 14: {13, 18}
- Node 15: {5, 8, 13}
- Node 16: {7}
- Node 17: {1, 2, 18}
- Node 18: {12, 13, 14, 17}
- Node 19: {3, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0: {4, 7, 12} - forms 3-stars with <4, 7, 12>
- Node 1: {2, 8, 11, 17} - forms 3-stars with <2, 8, 17>, <1, 8, 11>, <1, 8, 17>, <1, 11, 17>
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6, 10} - forms 3-stars with <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 10>, <4, 6, 10>
- Node 6: {3, 4, 8, 12} - forms 3-stars with <4, 8, 12>, <6, 8, 12>
- Node 8: {1, 6, 10, 15} - forms 3-stars with <1, 6, 8>, <1, 8, 10>, <8, 10, 15>, <6, 8, 15>
- Node 12: {0, 6, 9, 18, 19} - forms 3-stars with <0, 6, 12>, <6, 12, 19>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [13].
