Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 3) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 9) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 15) (7, 8) (7, 18) (7, 16) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 19) (2, 6) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 19) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 1) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 5) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 11) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 17) (3, 18) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 3) (15, 16) (15, 12) (15, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 15) (17, 0) (17, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 19. 

The degree of each node:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 2
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 3
- Node 10: 4
- Node 11: 3
- Node 12: 3
- Node 13: 2
- Node 14: 3
- Node 15: 3
- Node 16: 4
- Node 17: 2
- Node 18: 3
- Node 19: 4

Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3-star formed at <0, (3, 16, 17)>
- Node 1: 3-star formed at <1, (5, 8, 14)>
- Node 3: 3-star formed at <3, (0, 16, 18)>
- Node 5: 3-star formed at <5, (1, 8, 11)>
- Node 6: 3-star formed at <6, (1, 4, 11)>
- Node 7: 3-star formed at <7, (8, 16, 18)>
- Node 9: 3-star formed at <9, (0, 15, 3)>
- Node 10: 3-star formed at <10, (13, 18, 19)>
- Node 11: 3-star formed at <11, (4, 5, 19)>
- Node 12: 3-star formed at <12, (14, 15, 19)>
- Node 14: 3-star formed at <14, (1, 3, 12)>
- Node 15: 3-star formed at <15, (9, 12, 16)>
- Node 16: 3-star formed at <16, (0, 7, 15)>
- Node 18: 3-star formed at <18, (7, 10, 3)>
- Node 19: 3-star formed at <19, (10, 11, 12)>

This gives a total of 14 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
