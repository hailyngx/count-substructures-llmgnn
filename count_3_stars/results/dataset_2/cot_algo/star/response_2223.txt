Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 3) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 9) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for the given graph:

Node 0: 6, 13
Node 1: 4, 6
Node 2: 4, 6, 8
Node 3: 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14
Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
Node 5: 4, 6, 11
Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5
Node 7: 8, 9, 10, 11
Node 8: 2, 4, 7, 12
Node 9: 3, 4, 7, 9, 13, 14
Node 10: 3, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14
Node 11: 5, 7, 10, 14
Node 12: 3, 8, 10, 14
Node 13: 0, 3, 8, 9
Node 14: 3, 9, 10, 11

Now, let's find the 3-stars by examining each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 3 has neighbors: 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14
Since Node 3 has 6 neighbors, it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars. 
List of 3-stars with Node 3 as the center:
<3, (6, 9, 10)>
<3, (6, 9, 12)>
<3, (6, 9, 13)>
<3, (6, 9, 14)>
<3, (6, 10, 12)>
<3, (6, 10, 13)>
<3, (6, 10, 14)>
<3, (6, 12, 13)>
<3, (6, 12, 14)>
<3, (6, 13, 14)>
<3, (9, 10, 12)>
<3, (9, 10, 13)>
<3, (9, 10, 14)>
<3, (9, 12, 13)>
<3, (9, 12, 14)>
<3, (9, 13, 14)>
<3, (10, 12, 14)>
<3, (10, 13, 14)>
<3, (12, 13, 14)>

Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
Since Node 4 has 5 neighbors, it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
List of 3-stars with Node 4 as the center:
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars formed is 20 + 10 = 30, so the final answer is [30].
