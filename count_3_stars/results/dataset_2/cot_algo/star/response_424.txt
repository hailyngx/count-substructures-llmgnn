Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 5) (14, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 7) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 12) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 9) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 9) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 8, 14, 5, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {14, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 8, 13, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 6, 2, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 8, 0, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8, 0, 14, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 2, 11, 12}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 10, 9, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 2, 5, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7, 12, 13, 10}
- Node 10: Neighbors {14, 7, 9}
- Node 11: Neighbors {6, 13, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {6, 11, 13, 9}
- Node 13: Neighbors {2, 0, 11, 12, 9}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 0, 5, 10}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 13, Node 14

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars formed:
10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 8, 14)>, <0, (4, 8, 5)>, <0, (4, 14, 5)>, <0, (8, 5, 14)>, <2, (3, 8, 6)>, <3, (7, 6, 4)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (8, 0, 14)>, <6, (3, 4, 2)>, <7, (3, 10, 9)>, <13, (2, 0, 11)>, <14, (1, 0, 5)>.
