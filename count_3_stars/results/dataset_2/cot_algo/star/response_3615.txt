Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 10) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 14) (11, 12) (11, 0) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 4) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 10) 

Response:
There are a few nodes which have more than 3 neighbors, namely nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 14. We will focus on these nodes to find all the 3-stars in the graph. 

For node 1:
Neighbors: 3, 5, 13, 9, 7
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 13)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 9, 13)>, <1, (5, 9, 13)>, <1, (7, 9, 13)>, <1, (3, 5, 13)>, <1, (5, 7, 13)>

For node 3:
Neighbors: 1, 9, 2, 5, 4
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 4)>, <3, (1, 5, 13)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (5, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 9, 13)>, <3, (5, 9, 13)>, <3, (4, 9, 13)>, <3, (1, 5, 13)>, <3, (5, 4, 13)>

For node 5:
Neighbors: 1, 3, 13, 6, 10
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 10)>, <5, (1, 6, 10)>, <5, (3, 6, 10)>, <5, (1, 3, 13)>, <5, (3, 6, 13)>, <5, (1, 6, 13)>, <5, (1, 10, 13)>, <5, (3, 10, 13)>, <5, (6, 10, 13)>

For node 7:
Neighbors: 1, 12, 6, 10
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<7, (1, 12, 6)>, <7, (1, 12, 10)>, <7, (1, 6, 10)>, <7, (12, 6, 10)>

For node 9:
Neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 12, 14
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 12)>, <9, (1, 3, 14)>, <9, (1, 8, 12)>, <9, (3, 8, 12)>, <9, (1, 3, 14)>, <9, (3, 12, 14)>, <9, (1, 12, 14)>, <9, (1, 3, 14)>, <9, (3, 8, 14)>

For node 12:
Neighbors: 7, 0, 11, 9
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<12, (7, 0, 11)>, <12, (7, 0, 9)>, <12, (7, 9, 11)>, <12, (0, 9, 11)>

For node 14:
Neighbors: 8, 0, 6, 9
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<14, (8, 0, 6)>, <14, (8, 0, 9)>, <14, (8, 6, 9)>, <14, (0, 6, 9)>

Summing all the 3-stars, we get a total of 48 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [48].
