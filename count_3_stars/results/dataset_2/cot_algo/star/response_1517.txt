Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 17) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (2, 18) (2, 0) (2, 15) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 8) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 19) (17, 8) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 19) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 13) (10, 15) (10, 8) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 10) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 17) (8, 10) (19, 17) (19, 3) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 6) (14, 5) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 14) (6, 18) (6, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 11, 15, 16}
- Node 1: {0, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 15, 18}
- Node 3: {4, 11, 19}
- Node 4: {3, 17}
- Node 5: {7, 12, 14, 18}
- Node 6: {16, 18}
- Node 7: {5, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 10, 15, 17, 18}
- Node 9: {11, 12}
- Node 10: {8, 15}
- Node 11: {0, 3, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 13: {11, 14, 16}
- Node 14: {5, 13}
- Node 15: {0, 2, 8, 10, 18}
- Node 16: {0, 6, 13}
- Node 17: {4, 8, 19}
- Node 18: {2, 5, 6, 8, 15}
- Node 19: {3, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors or more: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 12, 15, 18

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 11: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 12: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 15: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 18: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 54

So, the final answer is [54].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 1, 2, 15>
- <0, 1, 10, 15>
- <0, 1, 11, 15>
- <0, 1, 12, 15>
- <0, 2, 5, 18>
- <0, 2, 8, 15>
- <0, 3, 11, 19>
- <0, 8, 15, 18>
- <2, 5, 6, 18>
- <5, 7, 8, 18>
