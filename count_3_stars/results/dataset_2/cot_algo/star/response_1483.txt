Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 25) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 17) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 19) (9, 12) (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 4) (0, 1) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 3) (27, 26) (7, 21) (7, 2) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 13) (21, 18) (21, 29) (20, 25) (20, 2) (25, 11) (25, 20) (25, 28) (25, 18) (25, 24) (26, 5) (26, 27) (26, 22) (17, 5) (17, 29) (17, 18) (17, 4) (29, 21) (29, 17) (22, 27) (22, 26) (22, 19) (22, 14) (22, 3) (10, 5) (10, 21) (10, 8) (19, 9) (19, 22) (14, 22) (14, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 28) (13, 21) (13, 12) (28, 0) (28, 25) (28, 1) (28, 23) (8, 10) (8, 6) (15, 6) (23, 28) (23, 6) (2, 7) (2, 20) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 24) (12, 3) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 4) (4, 0) (4, 17) (4, 24) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 23) (3, 27) (3, 22) (3, 12) (3, 18) (18, 21) (18, 25) (18, 17) (18, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 27, 28}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 28}
- Node 2: {7, 14, 20}
- Node 3: {12, 18, 22, 27}
- Node 4: {0, 17, 24}
- Node 5: {9, 10, 17, 26}
- Node 6: {8, 15, 23}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 21}
- Node 8: {6, 10}
- Node 9: {5, 12, 19}
- Node 10: {5, 8, 21}
- Node 11: {25}
- Node 12: {3, 9, 13, 24}
- Node 13: {12, 21}
- Node 14: {2, 22}
- Node 15: {6}
- Node 17: {4, 5, 18, 29}
- Node 18: {3, 17, 21, 25}
- Node 19: {9, 22}
- Node 20: {2, 25}
- Node 21: {7, 10, 13, 18, 29}
- Node 22: {3, 14, 19, 26, 27}
- Node 23: {6, 28}
- Node 24: {4, 12, 25}
- Node 25: {11, 18, 20, 24, 28}
- Node 26: {5, 22, 27}
- Node 27: {0, 3, 22, 26}
- Node 28: {0, 1, 23, 25}
- Node 29: {17, 21}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Nodes forming a 3-star: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 12, 17, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

- Each of the 13 nodes above can form \( \binom{d}{3} \) 3-stars, where \( d \) is the degree of the node.
- Summing up these combinations: \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 277 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [277].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, 1, 4, 27>
- <0, 1, 4, 28>
- <0, 1, 27, 28>
- <3, 18, 22, 27>
- <5, 17, 18, 29>
- <5, 17, 21, 29>
- <12, 17, 21, 29>
- <12, 21, 24, 25>
- <18, 21, 24, 25>
- <18, 21, 25, 28>
- <18, 24, 25, 28>
- <21, 24, 25, 28>
- <22, 26, 27, 29>
- <22, 26, 27, 25>
- <22, 26, 27, 18>
- <22, 27, 25, 28>
- <22, 27, 25, 18>
- <25, 27, 28, 5>
