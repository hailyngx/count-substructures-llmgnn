Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 5, 4
Node 1: 5, 9, 7, 8, 6
Node 2: 5, 8, 6
Node 3: 4, 7, 8
Node 4: 9, 0, 6, 3
Node 5: 9, 2, 8, 1, 0
Node 6: 4, 2, 8, 1
Node 7: 9, 7, 8, 1, 3
Node 8: 5, 7, 2, 6, 3, 1
Node 9: 5, 4, 1, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
Nodes with 4 neighbors: None
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 1, 8 (2 3-stars)
Nodes with 6 neighbors: 4, 7 (15 3-stars)
Nodes with 7 neighbors: None

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( \text{Total 3-stars} = 2 \times \binom{5}{3} + 2 \times \binom{6}{3} = 2 \times 10 + 2 \times 20 = 80 \)

So, there are a total of 80 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<1, (5, 9, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (9, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 2)>
<1, (6, 8, 3)>
<1, (6, 2, 3)>
<1, (8, 2, 3)>
<8, (5, 9, 7)>
<8, (5, 7, 2)>
<8, (5, 7, 3)>
<8, (5, 2, 3)>
<8, (7, 2, 3)>
<4, (9, 0, 6)>
<4, (9, 6, 3)>
<4, (0, 6, 3)>
<7, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (9, 7, 1)>
<7, (9, 8, 1)>
<7, (7, 8, 1)>
<7, (4, 6, 3)>
<7, (6, 3, 8)>
<7, (3, 8, 4)>
<7, (8, 4, 3)>
