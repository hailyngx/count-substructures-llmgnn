Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {4, 8, 6, 7, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 0, 2}
- Node 4: {8, 5, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {4, 8, 5, 1, 3}
- Node 7: {8, 5, 0, 1}
- Node 8: {4, 9, 0, 6, 1, 7}
- Node 9: {8}

Next, we identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8 each have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we count the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 63, so the final answer is [63].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 7, 3)>, <1, (4, 8, 6)>, <1, (4, 8, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (6, 8, 7)>, <1, (8, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 2)>, <3, (5, 6, 0)>, <4, (5, 1, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 3)>, <5, (6, 3, 7)>, <6, (4, 8, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 1)>, <6, (5, 1, 3)>, <7, (8, 1, 0)>, <8, (6, 1, 7)>.
