Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 2) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 14) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 10, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {8, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 6}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 7, 12}
- Node 4: {3, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {3, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 5}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 7, 11}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 6, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 2, 6}

Now, we can check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 11, and Node 14 have at least 3 neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up all the possible 3-stars, we get: 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 80

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [80].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 8, 10, 11>, <0, 8, 10, 14>, <0, 8, 11, 14>, <0, 10, 11, 14>, <2, 6, 11, 14>, <2, 6, 13, 14>, <2, 11, 12, 13>, <2, 11, 12, 14>, <2, 12, 13, 14>, <3, 5, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 7, 8>, <3, 5, 8, 9>, <3, 7, 8, 10>, <3, 7, 10, 11>, <3, 12, 13, 14>, <8, 10, 11, 14>.
