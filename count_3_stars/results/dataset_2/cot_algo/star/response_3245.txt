Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (25, 26) (25, 29) (25, 18) (15, 20) (15, 21) (15, 16) (20, 15) (20, 24) (0, 19) (0, 13) (2, 7) (2, 21) (2, 4) (28, 29) (28, 12) (28, 18) (29, 25) (29, 28) (29, 4) (29, 24) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 17) (26, 25) (26, 22) (26, 17) (9, 3) (9, 22) (9, 21) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 2) (4, 29) (4, 5) (27, 1) (11, 23) (11, 14) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 16) (23, 10) (13, 0) (13, 9) (13, 17) (17, 22) (17, 26) (17, 13) (17, 7) (5, 4) (5, 23) (5, 7) (5, 14) (12, 28) (12, 21) (12, 18) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 16) (19, 0) (19, 22) (7, 2) (7, 17) (7, 5) (24, 20) (24, 29) (24, 8) (8, 24) (8, 1) (21, 15) (21, 2) (21, 9) (21, 12) (10, 23) (10, 1) (18, 25) (18, 28) (18, 12) (18, 14) (16, 15) (16, 22) (16, 23) (16, 14) (1, 9) (1, 27) (1, 8) (1, 10) 

Response:
First, we'll construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {19, 13}
Node 1: {27, 8, 10, 9}
Node 2: {7, 21, 4}
Node 3: {9}
Node 4: {2, 29, 5}
Node 5: {4, 23, 7, 14}
Node 6: Not connected to any other node.
Node 7: {2, 17, 5}
Node 8: {24, 1}
Node 9: {3, 22, 21, 13, 1}
Node 10: {23, 1}
Node 11: {23, 14}
Node 12: {28, 21, 18}
Node 13: {0, 9, 17}
Node 14: {11, 5, 18, 16}
Node 15: {20, 21, 16}
Node 16: {15, 22, 23, 14}
Node 17: {22, 26, 13, 7}
Node 18: {25, 28, 12, 14}
Node 19: {0, 22}
Node 20: {15, 24}
Node 21: {2, 9, 12, 15}
Node 22: {26, 9, 19, 16, 17}
Node 23: {11, 5, 10, 16}
Node 24: {20, 29, 8}
Node 25: {26, 29, 18}
Node 26: {25, 22, 17}
Node 27: {1}
Node 28: {29, 12, 18}
Node 29: {25, 28, 4, 24}

Node 6 is not connected to any other node.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Nodes forming 3-stars:
Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 15: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 18: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 22: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 23: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 24: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 25: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 26: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 28: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 29: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 55
