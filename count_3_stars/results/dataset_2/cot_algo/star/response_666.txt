Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 10 = 30, so the answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 6>
