Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 6) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 2) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 8) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 18) (9, 1) (9, 8) (19, 14) (0, 16) (0, 4) (16, 5) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 2) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 18) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (14, 19) (14, 4) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 6) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (3, 16) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 18) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 12) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 18) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {16, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {17, 15, 5, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {13, 16, 11, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {16, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 13, 11, 16}
- Node 6: Neighbors {17, 15, 2, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {16, 10, 18}
- Node 8: Neighbors {15, 9, 18}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 10: Neighbors {7, 3, 18}
- Node 11: Neighbors {5, 2, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {11, 3, 18}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 2}
- Node 14: Neighbors {19, 4}
- Node 15: Neighbors {1, 6, 8}
- Node 16: Neighbors {5, 0, 7, 3, 2}
- Node 17: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 18: Neighbors {8, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 19: Neighbors {14}

Now we can identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star:

- Node 1, with 4 neighbors, can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. These 3-stars are <1, (15, 5, 9)>, <1, (17, 5, 1)>, <1, (15, 17, 6)>, and <1, (5, 9, 1)>.
- Node 5, with 4 neighbors, can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. These 3-stars are <5, (13, 11, 16)>, <5, (1, 15, 6)>, <5, (1, 11, 16)>, and <5, (1, 13, 16)>.
- Node 6, with 4 neighbors, can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. These 3-stars are <6, (15, 2, 3)>, <6, (17, 2, 3)>, <6, (15, 17, 6)>, and <6, (2, 17, 3)>.
- Node 16, with 5 neighbors, can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. These 3-stars are <16, (5, 3, 2)>, <16, (5, 0, 7)>, <16, (5, 2, 13)>, <16, (5, 1, 13)>, <16, (0, 7, 3)>, <16, (0, 2, 3)>, <16, (7, 2, 3)>, <16, (7, 3, 12)>, <16, (2, 3, 6)>, and <16, (2, 11, 13)>.
- Node 18, with 4 neighbors, can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. These 3-stars are <18, (8, 7, 10)>, <18, (8, 10, 12)>, <18, (7, 10, 12)>, and <18, (7, 3, 12)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 26. So, the final count is [26].
