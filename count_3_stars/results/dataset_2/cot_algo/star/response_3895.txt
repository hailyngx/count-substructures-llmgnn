Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 4, 7, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 9, 3, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 6, 2, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 7, 0, 1}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 2, 8, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 8, 0, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 4, 0, 1, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 7, 3, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 2, 3, 0}

Now, we'll determine the number of 3-stars each node is a part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 45

So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 6)>, <0, (4, 7, 1)>, <0, (7, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 9, 3)>, <2, (5, 9, 6)>, <2, (9, 3, 8)>, <3, (9, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 1)>, <5, (2, 8, 4)>, <5, (2, 8, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 1)>, <5, (2, 7, 1)>, <5, (9, 3, 8)>, <7, (5, 8, 4)>, <7, (5, 8, 8)>, <7, (5, 4, 1)>, <7, (5, 8, 1)>, <7, (4, 1, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>
