Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 5) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 9) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 11, 12
Node 1: 2, 10, 11, 14
Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
Node 3: 0, 6, 7, 12
Node 4: 8, 9, 13
Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 13
Node 6: 3, 5, 7, 10, 11
Node 7: 3, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14
Node 8: 2, 4, 12
Node 9: 2, 4, 7, 13
Node 10: 1, 6, 7, 13
Node 11: 0, 1, 6
Node 12: 0, 3, 7, 8
Node 13: 4, 5, 7, 9, 10
Node 14: 1, 7

We can see that nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 13 have 5 or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 35 + 10 = 79

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [79].

List of unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 5, 12)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 10)>, <7, (6, 9, 13)>.
