Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's denote the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:

- Node 0: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5
- Node 7: 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 6 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 6 neighbors

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can be a part of. Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we get:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 72 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [72], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, 8, 9>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <5, 6, 8>
