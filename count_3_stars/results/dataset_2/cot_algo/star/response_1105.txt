Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 19) (9, 12) (26, 22) (26, 21) (1, 21) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 22) (21, 26) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 5) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 7) (29, 23) (29, 15) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 27) (3, 8) (3, 18) (17, 25) (17, 6) (17, 0) (4, 16) (4, 25) (4, 20) (18, 3) (0, 2) (0, 17) (22, 26) (22, 1) (22, 27) (22, 8) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 7) (28, 14) (28, 24) (7, 2) (7, 28) (7, 25) (7, 15) (7, 13) (25, 17) (25, 4) (25, 7) (11, 13) (11, 15) (23, 29) (23, 19) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 13) (12, 9) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 20) (8, 3) (8, 22) (8, 28) (8, 20) (24, 28) (24, 14) (24, 19) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 23) (19, 24) (15, 29) (15, 7) (15, 11) (27, 3) (27, 22) (5, 21) (20, 4) (20, 16) (20, 8) (20, 13) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 20) (14, 9) (14, 28) (14, 24) 

Response:
There are some nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:

Node 1 has neighbors: 21, 3, 6, and 22.
Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 19, and 7.
Node 3 has neighbors: 9, 1, 27, and 8.
Node 4 has neighbors: 16, 25, and 20.
Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 17, and 13.
Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 28, 25, and 15.
Node 8 has neighbors: 3, 22, 28, and 20.
Node 13 has neighbors: 7, 11, 6, and 20.
Node 14 has neighbors: 9, 28, and 24.
Node 16 has neighbors: 12, 4, and 20.
Node 19 has neighbors: 9, 2, 23, and 24.
Node 20 has neighbors: 4, 16, 8, and 13.
Node 21 has neighbors: 26, 1, 28, and 5.
Node 22 has neighbors: 26, 1, 27, and 8.
Node 24 has neighbors: 28, 14, 19, and 24.
Node 25 has neighbors: 17, 4, 7.
Node 28 has neighbors: 21, 8, 7, and 14.
Node 29 has neighbors: 23, 15.

Now we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

- Node 1 (4 neighbors) forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 (3 neighbors) forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 (4 neighbors) forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 (3 neighbors) forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 (3 neighbors) forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 (4 neighbors) forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 (4 neighbors) forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 (4 neighbors) forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 (3 neighbors) forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 (3 neighbors) forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 (4 neighbors) forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 (4 neighbors) forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 21 (4 neighbors) forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 (4 neighbors) forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 24 (4 neighbors) forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 25 (3 neighbors) forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 (4 neighbors) forms 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes gives us a total of 52 3-stars. So, the final answer is [52].
