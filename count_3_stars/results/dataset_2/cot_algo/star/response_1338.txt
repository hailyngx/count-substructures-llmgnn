Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 26) (15, 9) (27, 12) (2, 29) (2, 20) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 26) (29, 14) (6, 28) (6, 25) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 13) (14, 29) (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 23) (12, 27) (12, 3) (1, 15) (1, 26) (1, 25) (26, 15) (26, 29) (26, 1) (26, 4) (28, 6) (28, 14) (28, 0) (28, 18) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 22) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (20, 2) (20, 29) (20, 14) (20, 5) (20, 10) (13, 9) (13, 16) (10, 20) (10, 7) (21, 16) (16, 13) (16, 21) (16, 7) (16, 22) (16, 23) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 16) (7, 8) (0, 28) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 19) (24, 3) (24, 22) (5, 20) (5, 8) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 5) (18, 28) (18, 23) (23, 17) (23, 16) (23, 18) (22, 14) (22, 3) (22, 16) (22, 24) (25, 6) (25, 1) (4, 26) (4, 0) (4, 19) (19, 0) (19, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that each node is connected to:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 28, 19}
- Node 1: {15, 25, 26}
- Node 2: {20, 29}
- Node 3: {0, 11, 12, 22, 24}
- Node 4: {0, 19, 26}
- Node 5: {8, 20}
- Node 6: {25, 28}
- Node 7: {8, 10, 11, 16}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 11}
- Node 9: {11, 13, 15}
- Node 10: {7, 20}
- Node 11: {3, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 12: {3, 27}
- Node 13: {9, 16}
- Node 14: {17, 20, 22, 28, 29}
- Node 15: {1, 9, 26}
- Node 16: {7, 13, 16, 21, 22, 23}
- Node 17: {14, 23}
- Node 18: {23, 28}
- Node 19: {0, 4}
- Node 20: {2, 5, 10, 14, 29}
- Node 21: {16}
- Node 22: {3, 14, 16, 24}
- Node 23: {17, 18, 16}
- Node 24: {3, 22}
- Node 25: {1, 6}
- Node 26: {1, 4, 15, 29}
- Node 27: {12}
- Node 28: {0, 14, 18, 6}
- Node 29: {2, 14, 20, 26}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: {17, 20, 22, 28, 29}
- Node 16 has 6 neighbors: {7, 13, 21, 22, 23, 14}
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors: {2, 5, 10, 14, 29}
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: {3, 14, 16, 24}
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors: {17, 18, 16}
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: {0, 14, 18, 6}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

- For Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 16: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49].

The unique 3-stars are:

- <14, 17, 22>
- <14, 20, 22>
