Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 15) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 19) (10, 11) (10, 9) (11, 10) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 15) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 16) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 7) (12, 9) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 19) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 0) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 7) (16, 13) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 0) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 12) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 16) (13, 19) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 19) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node. Then, for each node that has three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed.

The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 19}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 7, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 9, 13, 19}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 18}
- Node 6: {5, 16}
- Node 7: {1, 12, 14, 16}
- Node 9: {3, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {9, 11}
- Node 11: {10}
- Node 12: {7, 9}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 16, 19}
- Node 14: {1, 7, 17}
- Node 15: {17, 18, 19}
- Node 16: {6, 7, 13, 15, 17}
- Node 17: {14, 15, 16}
- Node 18: {5, 15, 19}
- Node 19: {0, 3, 15, 18, 13}

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are: 11, 18.

The number of 3-stars that can be formed with these nodes are:

- Node 11: \( \binom{1}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Since there is no other node with three or more neighbors, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2. Therefore, the final answer is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <11, (10)>
- <18, (5, 15, 19)>
