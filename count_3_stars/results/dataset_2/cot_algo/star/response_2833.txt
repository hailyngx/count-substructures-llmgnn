Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 19) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 15) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (9, 8) (9, 13) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 8) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 18) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 18) (0, 5) (16, 17) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 18) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 14) (2, 13) (2, 5) (14, 1) (14, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

1. Node 1's neighbors: {3, 17, 14, 19}
2. Node 3's neighbors: {1, 11, 4}
3. Node 8's neighbors: {13, 9, 15, 7}
4. Node 13's neighbors: {8, 17, 2, 11, 9}
5. Node 5's neighbors: {2, 12, 0, 7}
6. Node 6's neighbors: {19}
7. Node 11's neighbors: {3, 13, 7, 19, 15}
8. Node 17's neighbors: {1, 13, 16, 7}
9. Node 9's neighbors: {8, 13}
10. Node 10's neighbors: {15, 18}
11. Node 15's neighbors: {8, 11, 10, 18}
12. Node 4's neighbors: {3}
13. Node 12's neighbors: {5, 18}
14. Node 0's neighbors: {5}
15. Node 16's neighbors: {17}
16. Node 18's neighbors: {10, 15, 12, 19}
17. Node 19's neighbors: {1, 6, 11, 18}
18. Node 7's neighbors: {8, 5, 11, 17, 14}
19. Node 2's neighbors: {13, 5}
20. Node 14's neighbors: {1, 7}

Now, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars. Nodes with at least three neighbors are: 1, 3, 8, 13, 5, 11, 17, 15, 18, 19, 7.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars isomorphic to K(1,3), which is \( \binom{n}{3} \):

1. Node 1: 4 choose 3 = 4
2. Node 3: 3 choose 3 = 1
3. Node 8: 4 choose 3 = 4
4. Node 13: 5 choose 3 = 10
5. Node 5: 4 choose 3 = 4
6. Node 11: 5 choose 3 = 10
7. Node 17: 4 choose 3 = 4
8. Node 15: 4 choose 3 = 4
9. Node 18: 4 choose 3 = 4
10. Node 19: 4 choose 3 = 4
11. Node 7: 5 choose 3 = 10

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 55 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [55].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <1, (3, 17, 19)>, <3, (1, 11, 4)>, <8, (13, 9, 15)>, <13, (8, 17, 2)>, <5, (2, 12, 0)>, <11, (3, 13, 7)>, <17, (1, 13, 16)>, <15, (8, 11, 10)>, <18, (10, 15, 12)>, <19, (1, 6, 18)>, <7, (8, 5, 17)>.

These are the unique 3-stars in the graph.
