Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up, we get a total of 61 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [61].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
