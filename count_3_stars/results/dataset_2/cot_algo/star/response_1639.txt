Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 20) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 6) (0, 15) (0, 22) (0, 23) (27, 10) (7, 15) (7, 21) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 5) (21, 29) (22, 0) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 24) (22, 17) (23, 0) (23, 22) (8, 5) (8, 20) (8, 18) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 25) (29, 21) (29, 26) (6, 15) (6, 28) (6, 11) (5, 21) (5, 8) (5, 19) (13, 12) (13, 19) (26, 7) (26, 29) (17, 22) (17, 12) (17, 2) (20, 3) (20, 8) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 25) (19, 24) (19, 16) (10, 27) (10, 21) (10, 9) (10, 25) (16, 19) (2, 3) (2, 22) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 4) (9, 28) (9, 10) (9, 18) (18, 8) (18, 9) (24, 22) (24, 19) (24, 14) (1, 25) (1, 14) (1, 4) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 12) (25, 28) (25, 19) (25, 10) (25, 1) (25, 4) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 11) (14, 24) (14, 1) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {15, 22, 23}
- Node 1: {4, 14, 25}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 11, 17, 22}
- Node 3: {2, 15, 20}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 25}
- Node 5: {8, 19, 21}
- Node 6: {11, 15, 28}
- Node 7: {15, 21, 26}
- Node 8: {5, 18, 20}
- Node 9: {10, 18, 25, 28}
- Node 10: {9, 21, 25, 27}
- Node 11: {2, 6, 12}
- Node 12: {11, 13, 17}
- Node 13: {12, 19}
- Node 14: {1, 24}
- Node 15: {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 16: {19}
- Node 17: {2, 12, 22}
- Node 18: {8, 9}
- Node 19: {5, 13, 16, 24, 25}
- Node 20: {3, 8}
- Node 21: {5, 7, 10, 29}
- Node 22: {0, 2, 17, 23, 24}
- Node 23: {0, 22}
- Node 24: {14, 19, 22}
- Node 25: {1, 4, 9, 10, 19}
- Node 26: {7, 29}
- Node 27: {10}
- Node 28: {6, 9, 25}
- Node 29: {21, 26}

Next, let's find the 3-stars formed using the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, with 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 2, with 5 neighbors: 10 3-stars
- Node 4, with 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 5, with 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 15, with 4 neighbors: 4 3-stars
- Node 19, with 5 neighbors: 10 3-stars
- Node 21, with 4 neighbors: 4 3-stars
- Node 22, with 5 neighbors: 10 3-stars
- Node 25, with 5 neighbors: 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 51

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [51].
