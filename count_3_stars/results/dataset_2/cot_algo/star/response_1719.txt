Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 23) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 28) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 4) (29, 11) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (1, 21) (1, 18) (21, 5) (21, 1) (21, 22) (4, 2) (4, 18) (18, 1) (18, 4) (18, 23) (18, 20) (18, 24) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 15) (7, 19) (25, 7) (25, 0) (25, 12) (25, 24) (10, 15) (10, 26) (10, 13) (10, 14) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 16) (17, 8) (17, 27) (12, 5) (12, 25) (12, 19) (26, 10) (26, 3) (8, 17) (8, 28) (8, 11) (28, 9) (28, 8) (28, 14) (28, 23) (3, 6) (3, 26) (3, 13) (3, 19) (16, 2) (16, 15) (24, 18) (24, 25) (23, 5) (23, 18) (23, 28) (11, 29) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 0) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 14) (20, 18) (20, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (14, 10) (14, 28) (14, 19) (14, 27) (27, 5) (27, 17) (27, 14) (22, 21) (0, 25) (0, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {25, 11}
- Node 1: {21, 18}
- Node 2: {16, 6, 4}
- Node 3: {6, 26, 13, 19}
- Node 4: {2, 18}
- Node 5: {9, 23, 12, 21, 27}
- Node 6: {9, 2, 3}
- Node 7: {25, 20, 15, 19}
- Node 8: {17, 28, 11}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 28}
- Node 10: {15, 26, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {29, 8, 19, 0}
- Node 12: {5, 25, 19}
- Node 13: {3, 10}
- Node 14: {10, 28, 19, 27}
- Node 15: {7, 10, 16}
- Node 16: {2, 15}
- Node 17: {8, 27}
- Node 18: {1, 4, 23, 20, 24}
- Node 19: {6, 12, 3, 11, 14}
- Node 20: {7, 18}
- Node 21: {5, 1, 22}
- Node 22: {21}
- Node 23: {5, 18, 28}
- Node 24: {18, 25}
- Node 25: {7, 25, 12, 24}
- Node 26: {10, 3}
- Node 27: {5, 17, 14}
- Node 28: {9, 8, 14, 23}
- Node 29: {11}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 5, 18, and 28 can form a 3-star: <5, 18, 28>
- Node 5, 21, and 23 can form a 3-star: <5, 21, 23>
- Node 5, 9, and 28 can form a 3-star: <5, 9, 28>
- Node 12, 19, and 25 can form a 3-star: <12, 19, 25>
- Node 13, 19, and 10 can form a 3-star: <13, 19, 10>
- Node 14, 19, and 28 can form a 3-star: <14, 19, 28>
- Node 16, 2, and 15 can form a 3-star: <16, 2, 15>
- Node 18, 4, and 23 can form a 3-star: <18, 4, 23>
- Node 7, 25, and 20 can form a 3-star: <7, 25, 20>
- Node 1, 21, and 22 can form a 3-star: <1, 21, 22>

Since there are 9 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
