Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 4: {8, 13}
- Node 5: {6, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 6, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 11: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 12: {2, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {6, 9, 13}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes {5, 10, 14} <6, (5, 10, 14)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 1, 14} <9, (0, 1, 14)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes {8, 10, 13} <3, (8, 10, 13)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes {2, 10, 11} <7, (2, 10, 11)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes {5, 8, 13} <12, (5, 8, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, so the final answer is [5].
