Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 19) (14, 11) (14, 16) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 18) (2, 13) (2, 10) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 12) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 11) (1, 15) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 16) (19, 8) (19, 13) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 0) (16, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 2) (5, 3) (5, 18) (12, 18) (12, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {4, 7, 8, 16, 11}
Node 1: {15, 7, 6, 16}
Node 2: {13, 10}
Node 3: {15, 5}
Node 4: {7, 13, 0, 16}
Node 5: {3, 18}
Node 6: {9, 1, 10, 13}
Node 7: {4, 0, 1}
Node 8: {19, 17, 0}
Node 9: {6, 10}
Node 10: {6, 9, 2}
Node 11: {14, 0, 12}
Node 12: {18, 11}
Node 13: {4, 6, 2, 19}
Node 14: {11, 16}
Node 15: {3, 1, 17}
Node 16: {4, 0, 14, 1}
Node 17: {15, 8, 18}
Node 18: {17, 5, 12}
Node 19: {8, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 35

Therefore, the final answer is [35], and the unique 3-stars are:

<0, (4, 7, 16)>
<0, (4, 8, 16)>
<0, (4, 11, 16)>
<0, (7, 8, 16)>
<0, (7, 11, 16)>
<1, (6, 7, 16)>
<1, (6, 13, 16)>
<1, (6, 15, 17)>
<4, (13, 6, 19)>
<4, (13, 6, 19)>
<4, (13, 16, 14)>
<4, (13, 16, 19)>
<13, (6, 16, 1)>
<13, (6, 16, 19)>
<13, (2, 16, 19)>
<16, (0, 14, 4)>
<16, (0, 14, 1)>
<16, (0, 14, 4)>
<16, (0, 1, 4)>
<16, (0, 1, 14)>
<18, (5, 17, 15)>
