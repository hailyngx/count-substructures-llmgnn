Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First we will identify the neighborhood sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 7, 8}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 3, and Node 8 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can also form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can also form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 \), which we put inside brackets as [50].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 5, 8)>
- <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
