Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {5, 7, 13, 1}
Node 1: {11, 7, 14, 0, 6}
Node 2: {5, 10, 11, 12}
Node 3: {5, 13, 10, 12}
Node 4: {6}
Node 5: {9, 2, 8, 0, 3}
Node 6: {13, 1, 4}
Node 7: {8, 0, 1}
Node 8: {5, 13, 10, 11, 7}
Node 9: {5, 14, 13, 12}
Node 10: {8, 11, 3, 2}
Node 11: {8, 10, 14, 1, 2}
Node 12: {9, 2, 14, 3}
Node 13: {9, 8, 3, 0, 6}
Node 14: {9, 11, 1, 12}

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
Nodes 5, 8, 13, and 1 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can form 3-stars with their neighbors according to the combinatorial calculation mentioned earlier:

Node 5: \( {{5} \choose {3}} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( {{5} \choose {3}} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( {{5} \choose {3}} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( {{5} \choose {3}} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 40 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [40], and the unique 3-star configurations are:
<5, 3, 0, 13>
<5, 8, 0, 13>
<5, 8, 3, 13>
<5, 8, 10, 2>
<5, 11, 1, 14>
<5, 11, 2, 12>
<8, 7, 1, 0>
<8, 7, 0, 5>
<8, 10, 2, 11>
<13, 6, 1, 4>
