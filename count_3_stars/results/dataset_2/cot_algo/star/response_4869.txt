Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 4) (7, 5) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 0) (14, 11) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the number of neighbors for each node based on the given edges.

Node 0: 4 neighbors (1, 2, 6, 11)
Node 1: 3 neighbors (0, 5, 7)
Node 2: 5 neighbors (3, 4, 11, 12, 13)
Node 3: 2 neighbors (2, 5)
Node 4: 4 neighbors (2, 7, 9, 11)
Node 5: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 7, 12)
Node 6: 4 neighbors (0, 8, 9, 13)
Node 7: 5 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 9, 10)
Node 8: 3 neighbors (3, 6, 1)
Node 9: 5 neighbors (4, 6, 7, 10, 13)
Node 10: 4 neighbors (7, 9, 11, 12)
Node 11: 5 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 10, 14)
Node 12: 3 neighbors (2, 5, 10)
Node 13: 3 neighbors (6, 9, 2)
Node 14: 1 neighbor (11)

Now, let's calculate the number of unique 3-stars in this graph.

Node 2, 4, 7, 9, 11 have 5 neighbors each, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for each of these nodes.
Node 0, 5 also have 4 neighbors each, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
10 (from node 2) + 10 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 7) + 10 (from node 9) + 10 (from node 11) + 4 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 5) = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 4, 13)>
<2, (3, 4, 12)>
<2, (3, 4, 11)>
<2, (3, 13, 12)>
<2, (3, 13, 11)>
<2, (3, 12, 11)>
<2, (4, 13, 12)>
<2, (4, 13, 11)>
<2, (4, 12, 11)>
<2, (13, 12, 11)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 11)>
<4, (2, 7, 10)>
<4, (2, 9, 11)>
<4, (2, 9, 10)>
<4, (2, 11, 10)>
<4, (7, 9, 11)>
<4, (7, 9, 10)>
<4, (7, 11, 10)>
<4, (9, 11, 10)>
