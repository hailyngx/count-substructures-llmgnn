Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 4) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 10) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 9) (27, 2) (27, 19) (27, 13) (2, 27) (2, 8) (29, 17) (29, 9) (29, 16) (29, 13) (5, 13) (5, 25) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 28) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 20) (4, 1) (4, 28) (18, 10) (8, 2) (8, 25) (8, 17) (8, 7) (28, 6) (28, 4) (28, 19) (28, 25) (9, 0) (9, 29) (9, 22) (9, 12) (22, 9) (22, 10) (13, 27) (13, 29) (13, 5) (13, 16) (19, 27) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 23) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 3) (17, 29) (17, 8) (17, 23) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 7) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 15) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 10) (15, 14) (3, 5) (3, 26) (7, 8) (7, 24) (16, 29) (16, 13) (16, 23) (11, 0) (11, 24) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (25, 5) (25, 8) (25, 28) (23, 19) (23, 17) (23, 16) (23, 20) (14, 5) (14, 15) (20, 6) (20, 23) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated as follows:
1. For each node, find its neighbor nodes:
   
   Node 0: {1, 9, 11, 15}
   
   Node 1: {0, 4, 12, 21}
   
   Node 2: {8, 27}
   
   Node 3: {5, 26}
   
   Node 4: {1, 28}
   
   Node 5: {3, 13, 14, 25}
   
   Node 6: {12, 15, 20, 28}
   
   Node 7: {8, 24}
   
   Node 8: {2, 7, 17, 25}
   
   Node 9: {0, 12, 22, 29}
   
   Node 10: {15, 18, 21, 22}
   
   Node 11: {0, 24}
   
   Node 12: {1, 6, 9, 15}
   
   Node 13: {5, 16, 27, 29}
   
   Node 14: {5, 15}
   
   Node 15: {0, 6, 10, 14}
   
   Node 16: {13, 23, 29}
   
   Node 17: {8, 17, 23, 29}
   
   Node 18: {10}
   
   Node 19: {27, 23, 26, 28}
   
   Node 20: {6, 23}
   
   Node 21: {1, 10, 21}
   
   Node 22: {9, 10}
   
   Node 23: {19, 16, 17, 20}
   
   Node 24: {7, 11, 26}
   
   Node 25: {5, 8, 25, 28}
   
   Node 26: {3, 19, 24, 26}
   
   Node 27: {2, 13, 19}
   
   Node 28: {4, 6, 19, 25}
   
   Node 29: {9, 13, 16, 17}

2. For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
   
   - Node 0, Node 5, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 12, Node 13, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 19, Node 23, Node 25, Node 26, and Node 29 can form 3-stars.
   
   - Calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes: \( inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + 1 + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} = 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 1 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 = 211
   
3. The final number of 3-stars is [211].

4. Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
   
   <0, (1, 9, 15)>, 
   
   <5, (3, 13, 25)>, 
   
   <8, (2, 17, 25)>, 
   
   <9, (12, 22, 29)>, 
   
   <10, (15, 18, 21)>, 
   
   <12, (1, 6, 15)>, 
   
   <13, (5, 16, 27)>, 
   
   <15, (0, 6, 10)>, 
   
   <16, (13, 17, 29)>, 
   
   <17, (8, 23, 29)>, 
   
   <19, (27, 26, 28)>, 
   
   <23, (16, 17, 20)>, 
   
   <25, (5, 8, 28)>, 
   
   <26, (3, 19, 24)>, 
   
   <29, (9, 16, 17)>
