Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can find the 3-stars as follows:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 2, 3
Node 2 neighbors: 1, 4, 8, 9
Node 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 8
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 8, 9
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 7
Node 6 neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 9
Node 7 neighbors: 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7
Node 9 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 7

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 4, 5>
<2, 1, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 8, 9>
<2, 4, 8, 3>
<2, 4, 9, 3>
<4, 0, 1, 3>
<4, 3, 1, 8>
<4, 3, 8, 2>
<6, 0, 9, 4>
<6, 0, 4, 3>
<7, 5, 0, 6>
<7, 5, 0, 9>
<7, 5, 0, 1>
<7, 6, 0, 9>
<7, 6, 9, 4>
<7, 6, 4, 3>
<7, 9, 4, 8>
<9, 2, 1, 0>
