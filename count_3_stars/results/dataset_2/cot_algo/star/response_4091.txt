Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 58

Therefore, the final answer is [58].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
