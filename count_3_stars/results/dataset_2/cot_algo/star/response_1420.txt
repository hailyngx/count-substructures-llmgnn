Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 7) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 7) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 5) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 12, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 8, 10}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {8, 9, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 2, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 11: Neighbors {8, 10}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 5, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 6, 9, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star configurations.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star configurations.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star configuration.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-star configurations.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-star configurations.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star configuration.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations.

Summing up all the possible 3-star configurations from each node, we get a total of 86 3-stars in the graph: \([4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4]\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (7, 8, 10)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <5, (3, 7, 13)>
- <8, (1, 9, 10)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
- <13, (0, 5, 7)>
