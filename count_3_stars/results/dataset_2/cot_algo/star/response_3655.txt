Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 9, 7, 8, 3, 6
- Node 1: 9, 4, 2
- Node 2: 9, 8, 1
- Node 3: 4, 7, 8, 0
- Node 4: 5, 1, 6, 3
- Node 5: 9, 8, 4, 7
- Node 6: 4, 7, 0
- Node 7: 5, 0, 3, 6
- Node 8: 9, 2, 5, 0, 3
- Node 9: 5, 8, 2, 1, 0

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 47

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
