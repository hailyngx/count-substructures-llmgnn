Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 7, 8}

Next, we will find the number of 3-stars by applying the formula to nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 46 3-stars. So, the final answer is [46].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
