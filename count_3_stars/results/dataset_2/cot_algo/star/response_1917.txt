Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 8, 7, 5, 2}
- Node 1: {6, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {6, 9, 1, 0, 5}
- Node 3: {6, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 2}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {6, 9, 1, 0, 5}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 4, 0}
- Node 9: {8, 7, 2, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0: {4, 8, 7, 5, 2} -> inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 1: {6, 2, 4, 7} -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: {6, 9, 1, 0, 5} -> inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: {6, 9, 1, 0, 5} -> inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 34, so we have [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 8, 7)>
<0, (4, 8, 5)>
<0, (4, 7, 5)>
<0, (8, 7, 5)>
<0, (4, 1, 7)>
<0, (4, 2, 5)>
<1, (6, 2, 7)>
<2, (6, 9, 5)>
<7, (6, 9, 1)>
