Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 17) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 18) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 16) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 11) (15, 16) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 13) (0, 3) (0, 2) (10, 1) (10, 7) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 2) (16, 12) (16, 15) (16, 17) (16, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 16) (17, 9) (17, 16) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 19) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3}
- Node 1: {10, 14, 19}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 7, 14, 16}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 13}
- Node 4: {8, 13, 14, 19}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 11}
- Node 6: {9, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {4, 18}
- Node 9: {6, 17, 18}
- Node 10: {1, 7}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 14}
- Node 12: {7, 16}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 18, 19}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 4, 6, 11}
- Node 15: {16}
- Node 16: {2, 12, 15, 17}
- Node 17: {9, 16}
- Node 18: {8, 9, 13}
- Node 19: {1, 4, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star graphs:

- Node 1: (10, 14, 19)
- Node 2: (0, 5, 7), (0, 5, 11), (0, 5, 14), (0, 5, 16), (0, 7, 16), (0, 14, 16), (2, 5, 7), (2, 5, 14), (2, 5, 16), (2, 7, 14), (2, 7, 16), (2, 14, 16)
- Node 3: (0, 4, 13), (0, 5, 13), (3, 4, 13), (4, 5, 13)
- Node 4: (13, 18, 19), (14, 18, 19)
- Node 7: (10, 11, 14)
- Node 9: (9, 17, 18)
- Node 13: (18, 19, 13)

Hence, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (10, 14, 19)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 11)>, <2, (0, 5, 14)>, <2, (0, 5, 16)>, <2, (0, 7, 16)>, <2, (0, 14, 16)>, <2, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (2, 5, 14)>, <2, (2, 5, 16)>, <2, (2, 7, 14)>, <2, (2, 7, 16)>, <2, (2, 14, 16)>, <3, (0, 4, 13)>, <3, (0, 5, 13)>, <3, (3, 4, 13)>, <3, (4, 5, 13)>, <4, (13, 18, 19)>, <4, (14, 18, 19)>, <7, (10, 11, 14)>, <9, (9, 17, 18)>, <13, (18, 19, 13)>
