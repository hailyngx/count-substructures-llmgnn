Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 5
Node 2 neighbors: 3, 6, 9
Node 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 8, 9
Node 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4
Node 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 3, 6, 7
Node 9 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Node 4: <4, (3, 5, 7)>
Node 7: <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>
Node 9: <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars formed, we have 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Therefore, the final answer is [5].
