Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {6, 3, 7}
- Node 1: {9, 3, 5, 4, 8, 7}
- Node 2: {6, 9, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {9, 1, 0}
- Node 4: {1, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 1, 8, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 2, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 1, 5, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {6, 1, 5}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 3, 1, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: 0 C 3 = 0
- Node 1: 6 C 3 = 20
- Node 2: 4 C 3 = 4
- Node 3: 3 C 3 = 1
- Node 4: 2 C 3 = 0
- Node 5: 4 C 3 = 4
- Node 6: 5 C 3 = 10
- Node 7: 5 C 3 = 10
- Node 8: 3 C 3 = 1
- Node 9: 5 C 3 = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 0 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (9, 5, 7)>, <2, (9, 6, 4)>, <3, (9, 1, 0)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <6, (9, 5, 8)>, <7, (9, 1, 5)>, <9, (6, 2, 7)>
