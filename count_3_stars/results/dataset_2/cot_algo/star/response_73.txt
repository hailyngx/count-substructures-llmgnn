Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 17) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 19) (21, 15) (4, 7) (4, 24) (4, 10) (7, 21) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 5) (3, 28) (3, 23) (25, 26) (25, 22) (25, 14) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 17) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 15) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 15) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 28) (15, 21) (15, 7) (15, 29) (15, 0) (14, 25) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 13) (8, 20) (8, 27) (22, 25) (22, 26) (22, 28) (22, 12) (26, 25) (26, 22) (6, 28) (6, 24) (28, 3) (28, 20) (28, 22) (28, 6) (28, 18) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 27) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 23) (24, 4) (24, 6) (24, 12) (17, 1) (17, 2) (17, 27) (9, 27) (19, 1) (19, 21) (19, 29) (19, 18) (16, 0) (16, 14) (11, 14) (11, 18) (10, 4) (18, 28) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 12) (12, 22) (12, 24) (12, 18) (23, 3) (23, 2) (23, 13) (27, 8) (27, 5) (27, 17) (27, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {20, 15, 16}
- Node 1: {17, 19, 21}
- Node 2: {17, 23, 29}
- Node 3: {23, 28}
- Node 4: {7, 10, 24}
- Node 5: {7, 13, 27}
- Node 6: {24, 28}
- Node 7: {4, 15, 21}
- Node 8: {20, 27}
- Node 9: {27}
- Node 10: {4}
- Node 11: {14, 18}
- Node 12: {18, 22, 24}
- Node 13: {5, 14, 23}
- Node 14: {13, 16, 25}
- Node 15: {0, 21, 29}
- Node 16: {0, 14}
- Node 17: {1, 2, 27}
- Node 18: {11, 12, 19, 28}
- Node 19: {1, 18, 21, 29}
- Node 20: {0, 8, 28}
- Node 21: {1, 15, 19, 7}
- Node 22: {12, 25, 26, 28}
- Node 23: {2, 3, 13}
- Node 24: {4, 6, 12}
- Node 25: {14, 22, 26}
- Node 26: {22, 25}
- Node 27: {5, 17, 27, 9}
- Node 28: {3, 6, 18, 20, 22}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: 3 neighbors (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 15: 3 neighbors (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 18: 4 neighbors (\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars)
- Node 19: 4 neighbors (\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars)
- Node 21: 4 neighbors (\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars)
- Node 22: 4 neighbors (\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars)
- Node 23: 3 neighbors (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 24: 3 neighbors (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 25: 3 neighbors (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 27: 4 neighbors (\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars)
- Node 28: 5 neighbors (\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) unique 3-stars)

Adding all the unique 3-stars, we have 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 32 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].
