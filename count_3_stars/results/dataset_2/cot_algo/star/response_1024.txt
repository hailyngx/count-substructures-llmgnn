Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6
Node 1: 0, 4, 8, 9
Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 7, 9
Node 4: 1, 2
Node 5: 0, 2, 6
Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 7
Node 7: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 1, 7, 9
Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8

Next, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors where 3-stars can form:
Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 53

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 5, 6>, <0, 1, 6, 7>, <0, 1, 3, 6>, <0, 1, 3, 7>, <1, 2, 7, 9>, <1, 3, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 7, 9>.
