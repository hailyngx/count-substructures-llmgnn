Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 1) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 13) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 3) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 2) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 12) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7, 14}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6, 11}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 13}
- Node 3: {2, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 9, 11}
- Node 8: {4, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {6, 7, 10}
- Node 10: {6, 9}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {4, 6, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 5, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 8, 11, 12, 13}

Next, we'll check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 50. 
So, the final number of 3-stars is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
