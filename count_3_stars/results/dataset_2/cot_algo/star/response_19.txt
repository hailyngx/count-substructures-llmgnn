Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges based on the nodes they connect:

Node 0: {6, 7, 8}
Node 1: {5, 7, 8, 9}
Node 2: {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 3: {4, 7, 8}
Node 4: {2, 3, 7}
Node 5: {1, 9}
Node 6: {0, 2, 9}
Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 8}

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 7: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing them up: 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>
