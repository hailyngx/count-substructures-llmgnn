Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 18) (27, 14) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 22) (3, 1) (3, 26) (8, 23) (8, 9) (8, 25) (8, 11) (23, 8) (23, 13) (23, 19) (9, 8) (9, 22) (22, 1) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 29) (22, 7) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 21) (26, 3) (26, 2) (26, 20) (26, 16) (17, 20) (17, 6) (17, 5) (20, 26) (20, 17) (20, 12) (20, 10) (4, 27) (4, 10) (11, 8) (11, 0) (28, 24) (28, 18) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 6) (16, 26) (16, 0) (16, 21) (21, 24) (21, 16) (21, 2) (2, 15) (2, 26) (2, 21) (2, 12) (12, 20) (12, 2) (12, 5) (6, 1) (6, 22) (6, 17) (6, 0) (10, 20) (10, 4) (10, 0) (7, 22) (13, 23) (13, 25) (13, 18) (25, 8) (25, 13) (25, 19) (5, 24) (5, 17) (5, 12) (14, 27) (14, 1) (18, 27) (18, 28) (18, 13) (18, 29) (19, 23) (19, 25) (29, 22) (29, 18) 

Response:
Based on the provided edges, we can determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 10, 11, 16}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 14, 22}
- Node 2: {12, 15, 21, 26}
- Node 3: {1, 26}
- Node 4: {10, 27}
- Node 5: {12, 17, 24}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 17, 22}
- Node 7: {22}
- Node 8: {9, 11, 23, 25}
- Node 9: {8, 22}
- Node 10: {0, 4, 20}
- Node 11: {0, 8}
- Node 12: {2, 5, 20}
- Node 13: {18, 23, 25}
- Node 14: {1, 27}
- Node 15: {2, 27}
- Node 16: {0, 21, 26}
- Node 17: {5, 6, 20}
- Node 18: {13, 27, 28, 29}
- Node 19: {23, 25}
- Node 20: {10, 12, 17, 26}
- Node 21: {2, 16, 24}
- Node 22: {1, 6, 7, 9, 29}
- Node 23: {8, 13, 19}
- Node 24: {5, 21, 28}
- Node 25: {8, 13, 19}
- Node 26: {2, 3, 16, 20}
- Node 27: {4, 14, 15, 18}
- Node 28: {18, 24}
- Node 29: {18, 22}

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 18 forms a 3-star with (13, 23, 29) and (27, 28, 29).
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with (6, 7, 29).
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with (2, 3, 16).

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <18, (13, 23, 29)>
- <18, (27, 28, 29)>
- <22, (6, 7, 29)>
- <26, (2, 3, 16)>
