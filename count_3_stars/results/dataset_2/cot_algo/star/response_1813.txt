Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 12) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 13) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 15) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (18, 6) (19, 3) (19, 14) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (0, 11) (0, 8) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 13) (7, 1) (7, 13) (17, 5) (17, 15) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 9) (8, 0) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 17) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 13) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 16) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 11) 

Response:
First, let's organize the given edges based on the nodes they connect:

Node 0: {8, 11}
Node 1: {3, 7, 10}
Node 2: {5, 11, 12}
Node 3: {1, 12, 14, 19}
Node 4: {9, 10, 12, 15, 16}
Node 5: {2, 6, 11, 16, 17}
Node 6: {5, 13, 15, 18}
Node 7: {1, 13}
Node 8: {0}
Node 9: {4, 13, 14}
Node 10: {1, 4, 16}
Node 11: {0, 2, 5, 13}
Node 12: {2, 3, 4}
Node 13: {6, 7, 9, 11}
Node 14: {3, 9, 19}
Node 15: {4, 6, 17}
Node 16: {4, 5, 10}
Node 17: {5, 15}
Node 18: {6}
Node 19: {3, 14}

Next, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to check for 3-star formations: Nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 13, and 14.

1. Node 1: As it has 3 neighbors {3, 7, 10}, there is only one 3-star with Node 1: <1, (3, 7, 10)>.

2. Node 3: As it has 4 neighbors {1, 12, 14, 19}, it can form 4 3-stars:
   - <3, (1, 12, 14)>
   - <3, (1, 12, 19)>
   - <3, (14, 12, 19)>
   - <3, (1, 14, 19)>

3. Node 4: As it has 5 neighbors {9, 10, 12, 15, 16}, it can form 10 3-stars:
   - <4, (9, 12, 15)>
   - <4, (9, 12, 16)>
   - <4, (9, 15, 16)>
   - <4, (10, 12, 15)>
   - <4, (10, 12, 16)>
   - <4, (10, 15, 16)>
   - <4, (12, 15, 16)>
   - <4, (9, 10, 15)>
   - <4, (9, 10, 16)>
   - <4, (15, 16, 10)>

4. Node 5: As it has 5 neighbors {2, 6, 11, 16, 17}, it can form 10 3-stars:
   - <5, (6, 11, 16)>
   - <5, (6, 11, 17)>
   - <5, (16, 11, 17)>
   - <5, (2, 6, 11)>
   - <5, (2, 6, 16)>
   - <5, (2, 6, 17)>
   - <5, (11, 16, 17)>
   - <5, (2, 11, 16)>
   - <5, (2, 11, 17)>
   - <5, (2, 16, 17)>

5. Node 6: As it has 4 neighbors {5, 13, 15, 18}, it can form 4 3-stars:
    - <6, (5, 13, 15)>
    - <6, (5, 13, 18)>
    - <6, (5, 15, 18)>
    - <6, (13, 15, 18)>

6. Node 11: As it has 4 neighbors {0, 2, 5, 13}, it can form 4 3-stars:
   - <11, (0, 2, 13)>
   - <11, (0, 5, 13)>
   - <11, (0, 2, 5)>
   - <11, (2, 5, 13)>

7. Node 13: As it has 4 neighbors {6, 7, 9, 11}, it can form 4 3-stars:
   - <13, (6, 7, 9)>
   - <13, (6, 7, 11)>
   - <13, (6, 9, 11)>
   - <13, (7, 9, 11)>

8. Node 14: As it has 3 neighbors {3, 9, 19}, there is only one 3-star with Node 14: <14, (3, 9, 19)>.

The total number of unique 3-stars formed is 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 38, so the final answer is [38].
