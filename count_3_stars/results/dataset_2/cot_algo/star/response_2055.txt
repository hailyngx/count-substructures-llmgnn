Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 6, 8, 5
- Node 8: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 5

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 2 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Adding the total number of 3-stars: 
10 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 7) + 4 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 9) = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, 7, 9>
- <2, 8, 9>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <2, 1, 9>
- <3, 1, 4>
- <4, 8, 6>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <5, 9, 6>
- <8, 7, 2>
- <9, 5, 4>
- <9, 2, 3>
- <9, 2, 4>
- <9, 2, 5>
- <9, 3, 4>
