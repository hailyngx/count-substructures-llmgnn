Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 18) (16, 19) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 14) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 6) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 18) (17, 0) (17, 9) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 14) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 15) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 6) (0, 2) (0, 17) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) (9, 15) (9, 17) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:
1: {15, 18}
2: {0, 5, 10}
3: {12, 13, 14}
4: {6, 7, 12}
5: {2, 12, 13, 16}
6: {4, 13, 19}
7: {4, 8, 11, 14}
8: {7, 10, 14}
9: {15, 17}
10: {2, 8, 11}
11: {7, 10, 18}
12: {3, 4, 5, 14}
13: {3, 5, 6, 19}
14: {3, 7, 8, 12}
15: {1, 9, 18}
16: {5, 19}
17: {0, 9}
18: {1, 11, 15}
19: {6, 13, 16}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 neighbors or more: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Total number of 3-stars:

\[ \binom{1}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{11}{3} + \binom{12}{3} + \binom{13}{3} + \binom{14}{3} + \binom{15}{3} + \binom{16}{3} + \binom{17}{3} + \binom{18}{3} + \binom{19}{3}\]

This simplifies to:

\[ 0 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 35 + 56 + 120 + 165 + 220 + 286 + 455 + 560 + 680 + 816 + 969 + 1140 = 5333\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5333].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (12, 13, 14)>, <7, (4, 11, 14)>, <7, (8, 10, 14)>, <7, (10, 11, 14)>, <10, (2, 8, 11)>, <12, (4, 5, 14)>, <13, (5, 6, 19)>, <14, (3, 7, 8)>, <15, (1, 18, 9)>, <18, (11, 15, 1)>
