Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 14) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 2) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 10) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {3, 9, 10}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 8, 12}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 4, 5, 12}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {2, 9, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 13}

Now, for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they belong to:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 12: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 69

Thus, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [69].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 12)>
<1, (0, 7, 12)>
<2, (4, 11, 13)>
<3, (5, 10, 12)>
<4, (0, 2, 10)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (6, 11, 13)>
<10, (1, 4, 12)>
<12, (1, 3, 4)>
<13, (2, 9, 14)>
<14, (0, 13, 2)>
