Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (7, 5) (7, 12) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Based on the given edges, the neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {8, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 7: {5, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 11: {4, 8, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 4, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {4, 6, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 11, 0}

Now we check for the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes:
\( 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 86 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [86].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 14>
- <0, 8, 12>
- <0, 8, 14>
- <0, 12, 7>
- <1, 0, 14>
- <1, 4, 11>
- <1, 4, 14>
- <1, 6, 10>
- <1, 6, 13>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <2, 10, 6>
- <2, 12, 0>
- <3, 1, 9>
- <4, 11, 8>
- <4, 11, 14>
- <4, 12, 0>
- <4, 12, 13>
- <4, 12, 7>
- <4, 13, 6>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <6, 1, 10>
- <6, 1, 13>

- <12, 0, 8>
- <12, 4, 13>
