Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 6, 9, 2}
- Node 1: {7, 8, 6, 9, 2}
- Node 2: {7, 0, 9, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 2}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 3}
- Node 5: {4, 3}
- Node 6: {8, 1, 3, 0}
- Node 7: {0, 9, 8, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {7, 6, 1}
- Node 9: {7, 0, 2, 1}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with Node 0.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with Node 1.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with Node 2.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed with Node 3.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed with Node 4.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed with Node 5.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed with Node 6.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with Node 7.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed with Node 8.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed with Node 9.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
