Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 19) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 24) (22, 12) (22, 25) (15, 27) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 6) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 16) (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 8) (9, 18) (26, 11) (20, 25) (20, 12) (25, 22) (25, 20) (25, 7) (0, 15) (0, 4) (8, 3) (8, 23) (8, 1) (23, 8) (23, 24) (28, 18) (29, 17) (29, 16) (29, 24) (29, 21) (17, 29) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 21) (4, 22) (4, 27) (4, 0) (4, 17) (6, 15) (6, 1) (21, 3) (21, 29) (21, 17) (21, 11) (7, 25) (7, 2) (7, 1) (5, 3) (5, 17) (19, 13) (19, 18) (14, 27) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 16) (18, 13) (18, 9) (18, 28) (18, 19) (10, 3) (10, 2) (16, 27) (16, 29) (16, 1) (16, 24) (24, 22) (24, 23) (24, 29) (24, 16) (11, 26) (11, 21) (11, 1) (11, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (12, 22) (12, 20) (12, 11) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 15, 4
- Node 1: 8, 6, 7, 11, 16
- Node 2: 10, 7
- Node 3: 15, 21, 10, 5, 8
- Node 4: 22, 27, 0, 17
- Node 5: 3, 17
- Node 6: 15, 1
- Node 7: 25, 2, 1
- Node 8: 3, 23, 1
- Node 9: 18
- Node 10: 3, 2
- Node 11: 26, 21, 1, 12
- Node 12: 22, 20, 11
- Node 13: 22, 19, 18
- Node 14: 27
- Node 15: 27, 3, 0, 6
- Node 16: 27, 29, 1, 24
- Node 17: 29, 4, 21, 5
- Node 18: 13, 9, 28, 19
- Node 19: 13, 18
- Node 20: 25, 12
- Node 21: 3, 29, 17, 11
- Node 22: 13, 4, 24, 12, 25
- Node 23: 8, 24
- Node 24: 22, 23, 29, 16
- Node 25: 22, 20, 7
- Node 26: 11
- Node 27: 15, 4, 14, 16
- Node 28: 18
- Node 29: 17, 16, 24, 21

Next, we determine the number of 3-stars using the neighbor set for each node:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 9, 10, 14, 28, 26
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 29

For nodes with 3 neighbors, each node forms 1 unique 3-star:
- Node 0: <0, (15, 4, X)>
- Node 2: <2, (10, 7, X)>
- Node 6: <6, (15, 1, X)>
- Node 9: <9, (18, X, X)>
- Node 10: <10, (3, 2, X)>
- Node 14: <14, (27, X, X)>
- Node 28: <28, (18, X, X)>
- Node 26: <26, (11, X, X)>

For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed using \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula:
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 95

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [95].
