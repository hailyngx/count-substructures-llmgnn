Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges as described, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

**Neighbor sets for each node:**
- Node 0 neighbors: 5, 6, 4, 3
- Node 1 neighbors: 9, 6, 8, 7
- Node 2 neighbors: 5, 8, 3
- Node 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 2, 0, 7
- Node 4 neighbors: 9, 8, 0
- Node 5 neighbors: 9, 6, 2, 0, 3
- Node 6 neighbors: 5, 1, 7, 0
- Node 7 neighbors: 6, 8, 3, 1
- Node 8 neighbors: 4, 2, 7, 3, 1
- Node 9 neighbors: 5, 4, 1

**Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:**
- Node 0 and Node 3 have 4 neighbors.
- Node 1, Node 5, and Node 8 have 5 neighbors.

**Calculating the total number of 3-stars:**
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each of Node 0 and Node 3.
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for each of Node 1, Node 5, and Node 8.

Total number of 3-stars = \( (4+4+10+10+10) = 38 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [38].

**Unique 3-stars found:**
- <0, (6, 4, 3)>
- <3, (5, 8, 7)>
- <1, (6, 8, 7)>
- <5, (9, 2, 0)>
- <8, (4, 3, 1)>
