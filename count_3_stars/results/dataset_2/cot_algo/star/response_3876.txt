Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 15) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 1) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 18) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 19) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 17) (15, 13) (15, 19) (4, 0) (4, 19) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 2) (19, 14) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by determining the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {6, 13, 17, 18}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 12, 18}
- Node 3: {2, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 19}
- Node 5: {0, 11}
- Node 6: {1, 9, 10}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 17, 19}
- Node 8: {0, 13}
- Node 9: {6, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {6, 12}
- Node 11: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 12: {2, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 8, 15}
- Node 14: {3, 17, 19}
- Node 15: {13, 17, 19}
- Node 17: {1, 7, 15, 19}
- Node 18: {1, 2, 18}
- Node 19: {4, 7, 14, 15}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 27 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27]. 

The unique 3-stars formed are:
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 5, 11>
- <1, 6, 13>
- <1, 6, 17>
- <1, 13, 17>
- <1, 13, 18>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <2, 3, 12>
- <2, 7, 17>
- <2, 7, 18>
- <3, 11, 13>
- <7, 17, 19>
- <9, 11, 6>
- <12, 9, 10>
- <13, 15, 17>
- <14, 3, 17>
- <15, 17, 19>
- <17, 1, 13>
- <17, 1, 18>
- <17, 15, 19>
- <19, 4, 7>
- <19, 4, 15>
