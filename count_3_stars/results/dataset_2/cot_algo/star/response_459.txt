Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 6) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 1) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 10) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 4) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {5, 7, 11}
- Node 1: neighbors {4, 7, 14}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 13}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 6, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 8, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 8: neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 4, 7}
- Node 10: neighbors {4, 5, 6, 12}
- Node 11: neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 12: neighbors {4, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 13: neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 14: neighbors {1, 6, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 67

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [67].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, 5, 11>
- <3, 5, 13>
- <3, 6, 13>
- <3, 11, 13>
- <3, 6, 14>
- <5, 6, 13>
- <5, 6, 10>
- <7, 11, 13>
- <7, 9, 13>
- <10, 12, 6>
- <4, 12, 10>
- <4, 1, 14>
