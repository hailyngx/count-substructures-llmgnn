Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 1: No 3-star formed (has only 5 neighbors)
- Node 2: No 3-star formed (has only 4 neighbors)
- Node 3: No 3-star formed (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from all nodes that can form them: \(20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36\)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [36], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 4)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 8, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 9, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 9, 0)>
<6, (5, 8, 0)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 4)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 6)>
