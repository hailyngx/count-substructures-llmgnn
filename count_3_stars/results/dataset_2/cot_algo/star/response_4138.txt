Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (10, 2) (10, 12) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges, and the list of edges you provided, we will first identify the neighbor nodes for each of the 15 nodes:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 12, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {8, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 13, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 12}
- Node 11: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 13: Neighbors {3, 5, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 1, 7, 8}

Now, we will identify the number of 3-stars formed in this graph:

- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 0, 13, 14
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors but less than or equal to 15: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, each forms a unique 3-star:
<0, (1, 12, 14)>, <13, (7, 9, 11)>, <14, (1, 7, 8)>

For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we apply the \( \binom{n}{3} \) calculation:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Already included in the unique 3-stars)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Already included in the unique 3-stars)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 3 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 10 = 51 \)

Therefore, the final answer is: [51]
