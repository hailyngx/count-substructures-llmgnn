Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 2) (15, 8) (15, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 17) (2, 4) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (17, 2) (17, 4) (17, 7) (10, 5) (10, 19) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (7, 17) (7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 18) (16, 7) (12, 15) (12, 13) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 18) (19, 1) (19, 10) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 4) (14, 18) (14, 4) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 14) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 17) (4, 13) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 6, 11}
- Node 1: {5, 13, 19}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 17}
- Node 3: {0, 2}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 13, 14, 17}
- Node 5: {1, 10, 11}
- Node 6: {0, 8}
- Node 7: {9, 16, 17, 18}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 15}
- Node 9: {7, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {5, 19}
- Node 11: {0, 5, 9, 18}
- Node 12: {13, 15}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {4, 18}
- Node 15: {8, 12}
- Node 16: {7}
- Node 17: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 18: {7, 11, 14}
- Node 19: {1, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate how many 3-stars are formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of 38 3-stars in this graph.
