Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 17) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 8) (7, 26) (3, 25) (3, 2) (3, 12) (25, 5) (25, 3) (25, 16) (25, 15) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 20) (22, 17) (22, 8) (8, 7) (8, 22) (8, 23) (8, 29) (23, 8) (23, 1) (23, 21) (23, 28) (6, 28) (6, 11) (28, 23) (28, 6) (28, 2) (28, 20) (13, 26) (13, 20) (13, 15) (26, 7) (26, 18) (26, 13) (26, 14) (11, 6) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 2) (10, 1) (10, 2) (21, 23) (21, 19) (14, 26) (14, 15) (0, 11) (0, 17) (1, 23) (1, 10) (1, 29) (1, 27) (29, 8) (29, 1) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 21) (20, 5) (20, 18) (20, 28) (20, 13) (24, 17) (16, 25) (16, 15) (17, 9) (17, 22) (17, 0) (17, 24) (27, 1) (27, 2) (2, 3) (2, 28) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 27) (12, 3) (15, 4) (15, 25) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 16) 

Response:
First, let's find all the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {11, 17}
- Node 1: {2, 10, 23, 27, 29}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 10, 11, 27, 28}
- Node 3: {2, 12, 25}
- Node 4: {7, 15, 18}
- Node 5: {9, 20, 25}
- Node 6: {11, 28}
- Node 7: {4, 8, 19, 26}
- Node 8: {7, 22, 23, 29}
- Node 9: {5, 17}
- Node 10: {1, 2}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 6, 19}
- Node 12: {3}
- Node 13: {15, 20, 26}
- Node 14: {15, 26}
- Node 15: {4, 13, 14, 16, 25}
- Node 16: {15, 25}
- Node 17: {0, 9, 22, 24}
- Node 18: {4, 20, 26}
- Node 19: {7, 11, 21}
- Node 20: {5, 13, 18, 28}
- Node 21: {19, 23}
- Node 22: {8, 17}
- Node 23: {1, 8, 21, 28}
- Node 24: {17}
- Node 25: {3, 5, 15, 16}
- Node 26: {7, 13, 14, 18}
- Node 27: {1, 2}
- Node 28: {2, 6, 20, 23}
- Node 29: {1, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1, 2, 8, 15, 17, and 25 have three or more neighbors. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 52 \), so the answer is [52].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
