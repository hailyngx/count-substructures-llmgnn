Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 14) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 9) (12, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 8, 10}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 9, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7, 11}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 8, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 5, 11}
- Node 11: {4, 5, 10}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 9, 13}
- Node 13: {8, 12}
- Node 14: {5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors, [1 3-star]
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, [4 3-stars]
- Node 2: 6 neighbors, [20 3-stars]
- Node 3: 4 neighbors, [4 3-stars]
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, [4 3-stars]
- Node 5: 6 neighbors, [20 3-stars]
- Node 7: 5 neighbors, [10 3-stars]
- Node 8: 6 neighbors, [20 3-stars]
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, [4 3-stars]
- Node 12: 4 neighbors, [4 3-stars]
- Node 14: 3 neighbors, [1 3-star]

Total number of 3-stars: [92]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 2, 10>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 14>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 12>
<3, 6, 14>
<4, 7, 11>
<5, 8, 13>
<5, 8, 14>
<8, 9, 12>
