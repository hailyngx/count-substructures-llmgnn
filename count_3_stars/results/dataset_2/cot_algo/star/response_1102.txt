Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 8) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 11) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 10) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 1) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 14, 7, 4, 12
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 14, 2, 12, 10
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 12, 1, 10
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 7, 10, 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 0, 13
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 11, 0
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 14, 7, 4
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 0, 14, 3, 11, 13
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 11
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 13
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 2, 1
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 7, 13, 8, 12
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 0, 11, 2, 1
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 9, 11, 7, 4
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 0, 7, 1

Now, let's check each node that has three or more neighbors to form 3-stars. Computing the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4} {3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  
Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 72 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [72]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (5, 14, 12)>
<0, (5, 7, 12)>
<0, (14, 7, 12)>
<1, (9, 14, 12)>
<1, (9, 2, 10)>
<1, (14, 2, 10)>
<3, (11, 7, 13)>
<5, (9, 8, 11)>
<7, (0, 14, 1)>
<7, (0, 3, 13)>
<7, (14, 3, 11)>
<7, (3, 11, 13)>
<11, (5, 7, 13)>
<12, (0, 2, 11)>
