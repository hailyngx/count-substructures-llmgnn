Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 13) (5, 6) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 13) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 6, 14, 4, 8, 12
- Node 1: Neighbors are 9, 3, 12, 7
- Node 2: Neighbors are 8, 13, 7
- Node 3: Neighbors are 9, 1, 10, 4
- Node 4: Neighbors are 6, 9, 3, 0, 13
- Node 5: Neighbors are 6, 7
- Node 6: Neighbors are 9, 5, 8, 4, 0
- Node 7: Neighbors are 9, 1, 10, 5, 14, 2
- Node 8: Neighbors are 6, 0, 14, 2, 12
- Node 9: Neighbors are 6, 4, 3, 1, 7
- Node 10: Neighbors are 3, 11, 7
- Node 11: Neighbors are 10, 13
- Node 12: Neighbors are 1, 0, 8
- Node 13: Neighbors are 11, 4, 14, 2
- Node 14: Neighbors are 0, 8, 7, 13

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 4, 7, and 8 have 5 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these together, we have a total of \( 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 50 \) 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, 6, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 4, 12>, <0, 6, 8, 14>, <0, 6, 12, 1>, <0, 4, 6, 9>, <0, 4, 6, 13>, <0, 4, 6, 3>, <0, 4, 9, 3>, <0, 4, 12, 1>, <4, 6, 9, 3>, <4, 6, 9, 13>, <4, 6, 9, 7>, <4, 6, 3, 9>, <4, 6, 3, 13>, <4, 6, 3, 7>, <4, 6, 13, 2>, <4, 9, 6, 11>, <4, 9, 6, 3>, <4, 9, 3, 7>, <4, 9, 3, 1>, <7, 9, 3, 1>, <7, 9, 3, 10>, <7, 9, 13, 2>, <7, 9, 13, 11>, <7, 3, 9, 1>, <7, 3, 9, 10>, <7, 13, 9, 11>, <7, 13, 9, 2>, <8, 6, 0, 14>, <8, 6, 0, 12>, <8, 6, 0, 4>, <8, 6, 0, 1>, <8, 6, 14, 2>, <8, 0, 6, 12>, <8, 0, 6, 14>, <8, 0, 6, 4>, <8, 0, 12, 1>, <8, 0, 14, 2>, <8, 12, 0, 1>, <8, 12, 0, 4>, <8, 12, 0, 14>, <8, 12, 1, 7>, <8, 12, 1, 0>
