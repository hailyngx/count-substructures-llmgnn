Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 5) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 9) (4, 19) (4, 16) (7, 14) (7, 5) (2, 18) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 1) (8, 10) (8, 16) (3, 16) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (0, 18) (0, 15) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 5) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 1) (15, 9) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 9) (6, 11) (6, 19) (12, 17) (12, 10) (9, 17) (9, 15) (9, 13) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 12) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 13) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {18, 15}
- Node 1: {18, 5, 15}
- Node 2: {18, 11}
- Node 3: {16}
- Node 4: {19, 16}
- Node 5: {14, 7, 11, 1}
- Node 6: {11, 19}
- Node 7: {14, 5}
- Node 8: {10, 16}
- Node 9: {17, 15, 13}
- Node 10: {8, 13, 12}
- Node 11: {14, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 12: {17, 10}
- Node 13: {17, 16, 10, 9, 19}
- Node 14: {11, 7, 5}
- Node 15: {18, 0, 1, 9}
- Node 16: {4, 18, 8, 3, 13}
- Node 17: {13, 12, 9}
- Node 18: {2, 15, 16, 0, 1}
- Node 19: {4, 13, 6}

Now, for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, we will count the number of unique 3-stars they form:

- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 13: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 16: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 18: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]

Adding up the total number of unique 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 18, 5>, <5, 14, 11>, <5, 14, 7>, <5, 14, 1>, <9, 13, 17>, <9, 13, 16>, <9, 13, 10>, <9, 13, 19>, <9, 15, 18>, <13, 17, 12>, <13, 17, 10>, <13, 17, 9>, <13, 17, 19>, <13, 16, 8>, <13, 16, 3>, <13, 16, 10>, <13, 16, 19>, <13, 16, 4>, <16, 18, 8>, <16, 18, 3>
