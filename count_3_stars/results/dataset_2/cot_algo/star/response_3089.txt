Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (18, 4) (18, 27) (22, 11) (22, 0) (22, 25) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 24) (6, 24) (6, 20) (4, 18) (4, 10) (0, 22) (0, 15) (14, 8) (14, 27) (14, 13) (21, 28) (21, 8) (21, 29) (21, 17) (28, 21) (28, 16) (28, 2) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 24) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 16) (16, 28) (16, 26) (16, 7) (16, 20) (19, 5) (19, 23) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 12) (29, 21) (29, 26) (29, 7) (29, 25) (17, 21) (17, 13) (17, 2) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 20) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 13) (24, 11) (23, 26) (23, 19) (11, 1) (11, 22) (11, 24) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 21) (20, 6) (20, 16) (20, 7) (12, 9) (12, 15) (2, 3) (2, 28) (2, 9) (2, 17) (15, 0) (15, 12) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 27) (10, 25) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 10) (25, 22) (25, 29) (25, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: 3, 11, 5, 9
3: 1, 10, 2, 8
18: 4, 27
22: 11, 0, 25
5: 1, 19, 24
6: 24, 20
4: 18, 10
0: 22, 15
14: 8, 27, 13
21: 28, 8, 29, 17
28: 21, 16, 2
13: 14, 17, 24
26: 23, 29, 16
16: 28, 26, 7, 20
19: 5, 23
9: 1, 2, 12
29: 21, 26, 7, 25
17: 21, 13, 2
7: 16, 29, 20
24: 5, 6, 13, 11
23: 26, 19
11: 1, 22, 24
8: 3, 14, 21
20: 6, 16, 7
12: 9, 15
2: 3, 28, 9, 17
15: 0, 12
10: 3, 4, 27, 25
27: 18, 14, 10
25: 22, 29, 10

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 21, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars:
4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 35

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars is [35], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 11)>, <1, (5, 11, 24)>, <1, (5, 9, 11)>, <3, (1, 10, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 10, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 10)>, <5, (1, 19, 23)>, <8, (3, 8, 14)>, <10, (4, 10, 27)>, <10, (3, 10, 25)>, <10, (4, 10, 27)>, <10, (3, 4, 25)>, <11, (1, 11, 24)>, <13, (14, 13, 17)>, <16, (7, 16, 20)>, <16, (16, 26, 29)>, <16, (20, 26, 29)>, <16, (16, 20, 7)>, <17, (2, 17, 21)>, <21, (8, 21, 29)>, <21, (21, 28, 2)>, <21, (8, 21, 29)>, <21, (21, 17, 2)>, <24, (5, 24, 13)>, <24, (11, 24, 13)>, <24, (5, 24, 11)>, <24, (13, 24, 11)>, <25, (10, 25, 29)>, <26, (23, 26, 29)>, <28, (2, 28, 16)>, <29, (7, 29, 25)>, <29, (21, 29, 26)>, <29, (7, 29, 25)>, <29, (21, 29, 7)>
