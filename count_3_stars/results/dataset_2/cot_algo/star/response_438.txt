Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
Node 1: 0, 2, 4
Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 6, 9
Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 6
Node 4: 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 6, 7, 8
Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 9
Node 7: 4, 5, 8
Node 8: 0, 4, 5, 7
Node 9: 2, 4, 6

Next, we need to identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. These nodes are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up all the 3-stars formed: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 3>, 
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, 
<2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, 
<3, 4, 9>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, 
<4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, 
<5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>
