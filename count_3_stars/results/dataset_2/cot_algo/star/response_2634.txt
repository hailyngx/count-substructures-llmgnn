Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 16) (13, 7) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 15) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 17) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 15) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 2) (17, 6) (17, 1) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 1) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 15) (14, 4) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 11) (9, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {8, 3, 11}
- Node 1: {17, 16}
- Node 2: {18, 10, 17, 15}
- Node 3: {8, 5, 0}
- Node 4: {18, 19, 14}
- Node 5: {18, 6, 3, 10}
- Node 6: {5, 17}
- Node 7: {13, 12, 19, 10}
- Node 8: {16, 0, 3}
- Node 9: {10}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 11: {0, 14, 19, 15}
- Node 12: {7, 15}
- Node 13: {16, 7}
- Node 14: {4, 11}
- Node 15: {2, 18, 12, 11}
- Node 16: {8, 13, 1}
- Node 17: {2, 6, 1}
- Node 18: {2, 4, 5, 15}
- Node 19: {4, 7, 11}

Now we'll identify the nodes that form a 3-star:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves: <2, (17, 6, 15)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves: <5, (18, 6, 10)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves: <7, (13, 19, 10)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with leaves: <10, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with leaves: <15, (2, 18, 12)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with leaves: <18, (2, 5, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars is 6, so the final answer is [6].
