Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 11) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 12) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 13) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 12) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {11, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 10, 11}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 13}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 11}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 8: {12}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 6, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 5, 7, 11, 0}
- Node 14: {3, 9, 10, 12}

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1: <1, (3, 4, 10)>
- Node 2: <2, (3, 4, 13)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 7: <7, (5, 9, 13)>
- Node 9: <9, (3, 4, 12)>
- Node 11: <11, (0, 6, 13)>
- Node 12: <12, (0, 8, 14)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 8, so the answer is [8].
