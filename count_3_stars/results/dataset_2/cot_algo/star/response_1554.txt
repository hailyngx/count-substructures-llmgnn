Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 10) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 10) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (11, 0) (11, 9) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 10) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to calculate the degree of each node:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 6
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 3

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, and 14

For each of these nodes, we apply the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars centered at that node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} \) = 20
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1

Summing up these counts, we get:
4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 63

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [63].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 8, 13>
<7, 10, 14>
