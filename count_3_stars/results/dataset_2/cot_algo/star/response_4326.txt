Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 20) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 14) (22, 27) (22, 12) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 8) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 16) (17, 29) (17, 27) (4, 28) (7, 8) (10, 18) (11, 0) (11, 29) (11, 20) (6, 3) (6, 23) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 23) (8, 21) (23, 13) (23, 6) (23, 8) (23, 25) (23, 16) (29, 17) (29, 11) (29, 1) (29, 27) (1, 29) (1, 16) (1, 12) (26, 19) (26, 0) (19, 26) (19, 15) (19, 21) (19, 20) (19, 16) (16, 14) (16, 23) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 28) (28, 4) (28, 16) (3, 6) (3, 27) (21, 8) (21, 19) (21, 15) (25, 23) (25, 24) (15, 19) (15, 21) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 29) (27, 3) (27, 18) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 27) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 24) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 0) (0, 11) (0, 26) (0, 24) (2, 13) (2, 14) (20, 13) (20, 5) (20, 11) (20, 19) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {11, 24, 26}
- Node 1: {12, 16, 29}
- Node 2: {13, 14}
- Node 3: {6, 27}
- Node 4: {28}
- Node 5: {9, 18, 20}
- Node 6: {3, 23}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {7, 9, 21, 23}
- Node 9: {5, 8}
- Node 10: {18}
- Node 11: {0, 20, 29}
- Node 12: {1, 14, 22, 24}
- Node 13: {2, 20, 22, 23}
- Node 14: {2, 12, 16, 22}
- Node 15: {19, 21}
- Node 16: {1, 14, 19, 28}
- Node 17: {27, 29}
- Node 18: {5, 10, 27}
- Node 19: {16, 20, 21, 26}
- Node 20: {5, 11, 13, 19}
- Node 21: {8, 15, 19}
- Node 22: {12, 13, 14, 27}
- Node 23: {3, 8, 13, 16, 25}
- Node 24: {0, 12, 25}
- Node 25: {23, 24}
- Node 26: {19, 0}
- Node 27: {3, 17, 18, 22, 29}
- Node 28: {4, 16}
- Node 29: {1, 11, 17, 27}

Next, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs:

- Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (2, 22, 23)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (2, 12, 16)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star: <16, (1, 14, 28)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star: <19, (1, 20, 26)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star: <22, (12, 13, 27)>
- Node 23 forms a 3-star: <23, (3, 13, 25)>
- Node 27 forms a 3-star: <27, (17, 18, 22)>
- Node 29 forms a 3-star: <29, (1, 17, 27)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we find 8, so the final answer is [8].
