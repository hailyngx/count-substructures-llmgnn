Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (29, 2) (29, 1) (29, 16) (29, 25) (29, 21) (18, 22) (18, 14) (18, 21) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 0) (23, 15) (23, 10) (23, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 17) (27, 6) (7, 12) (7, 26) (7, 17) (15, 23) (15, 20) (15, 8) (20, 15) (20, 21) (20, 3) (20, 16) (20, 28) (19, 26) (19, 6) (26, 7) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 21) (11, 22) (11, 13) (11, 4) (28, 20) (28, 0) (28, 25) (24, 26) (24, 14) (24, 5) (1, 29) (1, 5) (5, 12) (5, 24) (5, 1) (5, 8) (16, 29) (16, 20) (16, 21) (21, 29) (21, 18) (21, 20) (21, 26) (21, 16) (14, 18) (14, 24) (6, 27) (6, 19) (6, 17) (6, 8) (17, 12) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 3) (3, 20) (3, 17) (3, 13) (9, 23) (25, 29) (25, 28) (25, 13) (8, 15) (8, 5) (8, 6) (0, 22) (0, 28) (0, 13) (4, 11) (13, 18) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 25) (13, 0) (10, 23) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph by following the process outlined earlier.

We begin by determining the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {22, 13, 28}
- Node 1: {29, 5}
- Node 2: {29}
- Node 3: {20, 17, 13}
- Node 4: {11}
- Node 5: {12, 24, 1, 8}
- Node 6: {27, 19, 17, 8}
- Node 7: {12, 26, 17}
- Node 8: {15, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {23}
- Node 10: {23}
- Node 11: {22, 13, 4}
- Node 12: {7, 5, 17}
- Node 13: {18, 11, 3, 25, 0}
- Node 14: {18, 24}
- Node 15: {23, 20, 8}
- Node 16: {29, 20, 21}
- Node 17: {12, 7, 6, 3}
- Node 18: {22, 14, 21, 13}
- Node 19: {26, 6}
- Node 20: {15, 21, 3, 16, 28}
- Node 21: {29, 18, 20, 26, 16}
- Node 22: {18, 11, 0}
- Node 23: {15, 10, 9}
- Node 24: {26, 14, 5}
- Node 25: {29, 13, 28}
- Node 26: {7, 19, 24, 21}
- Node 27: {6}
- Node 28: {20, 25, 0}
- Node 29: {2, 1, 16, 25, 21}

Now, we can identify the nodes that form a 3-star:

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 13
- Node 20
- Node 21
- Node 25
- Node 28
- Node 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using \( \textit{inom}(n, 3) \):

- Node 13: \( \textit{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \textit{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 21: \( \textit{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 25: \( \textit{inom}(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \textit{inom}(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \textit{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <13, (18, 3, 25)>
- <20, (15, 21, 28)>
- <21, (18, 20, 29)>
- <25, (13, 28, 29)>
- <28, (20, 25, 0)>
- <29, (16, 21, 25)>
