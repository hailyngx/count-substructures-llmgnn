Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and the specified edges, we will first find the neighbor set for each node:

1. Node 0 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
2. Node 1 neighbors: {0, 2, 5, 6, 8}
3. Node 2 neighbors: {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
4. Node 3 neighbors: {0, 4, 6, 8}
5. Node 4 neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 6}
6. Node 5 neighbors: {1, 8, 9}
7. Node 6 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 4, 7}
8. Node 7 neighbors: {6, 8}
9. Node 8 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}
10. Node 9 neighbors: {2, 5}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the final answer is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <6, 7, 8>
- <6, 8, 1>
