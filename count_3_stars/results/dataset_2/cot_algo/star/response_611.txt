Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 19) (16, 11) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 18) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 2) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 0) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 18) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 19) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 9) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 6) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 9) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 2) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 12) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 1) 

Response:
The given graph has three nodes with exactly three neighbors: node 2, node 8, and node 12. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around these nodes:

For node 2:
Node 2 has neighbors {15, 13, 12, 19, 6}
Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<2, (15, 13, 12)>, <2, (15, 13, 19)>, <2, (15, 12, 19)>, <2, (13, 12, 19)>, <2, (15, 13, 6)>, <2, (15, 12, 6)>, <2, (15, 19, 6)>, <2, (13, 12, 6)>, <2, (13, 19, 6)>, <2, (12, 19, 6)>

For node 8:
Node 8 has neighbors {3, 13, 14, 18}
Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<8, (3, 13, 14)>, <8, (3, 13, 18)>, <8, (3, 14, 18)>, <8, (13, 14, 18)>

For node 12:
Node 12 has neighbors {10, 2, 5, 9}
Number of 3-stars with node 12 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<12, (10, 2, 5)>, <12, (10, 2, 9)>, <12, (10, 5, 9)>, <12, (2, 5, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars in the given graph: 10 + 4 + 4 = 18
Therefore, the answer is [18].
