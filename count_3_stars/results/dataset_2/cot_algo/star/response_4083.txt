Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 9) (27, 19) (3, 25) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (25, 3) (25, 16) (25, 2) (22, 23) (22, 28) (23, 15) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 28) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 29) (6, 26) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 26) (21, 12) (21, 29) (11, 23) (4, 3) (4, 17) (12, 15) (12, 21) (12, 2) (12, 17) (2, 25) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 28) (1, 10) (1, 8) (29, 6) (29, 21) (29, 13) (9, 27) (9, 2) (26, 6) (26, 7) (26, 8) (20, 18) (20, 16) (8, 1) (8, 26) (8, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (17, 0) (17, 4) (17, 12) (19, 27) (19, 0) (19, 7) (19, 24) (13, 29) (13, 14) (16, 25) (16, 20) (16, 18) (16, 10) (28, 22) (28, 23) (28, 2) (18, 20) (18, 16) (18, 24) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 16) (10, 24) (24, 19) (24, 18) (24, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {7, 17, 19}
Node 1: {8, 10}
Node 2: {9, 12, 25, 28}
Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 25}
Node 4: {3, 17}
Node 5: {3, 6, 7, 10}
Node 6: {3, 5, 26, 29}
Node 7: {0, 5, 19, 26}
Node 8: {1, 14, 26}
Node 9: {2, 27}
Node 10: {1, 5, 16, 24}
Node 11: {23}
Node 12: {2, 17, 15, 21}
Node 13: {14, 29}
Node 14: {8, 13}
Node 15: {12, 23, 27}
Node 16: {10, 18, 20, 25}
Node 17: {0, 4, 12}
Node 18: {16, 20, 24}
Node 19: {0, 7, 24, 27}
Node 20: {16, 18}
Node 21: {12, 29}
Node 22: {23, 28}
Node 23: {11, 15, 22, 28}
Node 24: {10, 18, 19}
Node 25: {2, 3, 16}
Node 26: {6, 7, 8}
Node 27: {9, 15, 19}
Node 28: {2, 22, 23}
Node 29: {6, 13, 21}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 4, 9, 11, 13, 14, 22

Nodes with 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 16, 18, 20

Nodes with 5 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 7, 12, 15, 17, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Now, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars:

Total number of 3-stars = [13]

Considering the unique 3-stars formed:

<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 26)>
<7, (0, 5, 26)>
<12, (2, 15, 21)>
<15, (12, 23, 27)>
<17, (0, 4, 12)>
<24, (10, 18, 19)>
<25, (2, 3, 16)>
<26, (6, 7, 8)>
<27, (9, 15, 19)>
<28, (2, 22, 23)>
<29, (6, 13, 21)>
