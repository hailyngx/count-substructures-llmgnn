Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes {4, 6, 7} <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes {4, 5, 7} <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 7, 8} <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 4, 9} <7, (1, 4, 9)>

This gives us a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
