Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 9, 4, 8, 2
Node 1: 9, 4, 2
Node 2: 5, 9, 7, 6, 1, 0
Node 3: 9, 7, 6, 8
Node 4: 5, 9, 8, 0, 1
Node 5: 9, 6, 2, 8, 4
Node 6: 5, 3, 2
Node 7: 3, 2
Node 8: 5, 4, 0, 3
Node 9: 5, 2, 3, 1, 0

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: 9, 4, 8, 2 (4 neighbors)
Node 1: 9, 4, 2 (3 neighbors)
Node 2: 5, 9, 7, 6, 1, 0 (6 neighbors)
Node 3: 9, 7, 6, 8 (4 neighbors)
Node 4: 5, 9, 8, 0, 1 (5 neighbors)
Node 5: 9, 6, 2, 8, 4 (5 neighbors)
Node 8: 5, 4, 0, 3 (4 neighbors)
Node 9: 5, 2, 3, 1, 0 (5 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = [4] = 4
Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = [1] = 1
Node 2: [inom{6}{3}] = [20] = 20
Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = [4] = 4
Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = [10] = 10
Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = [10] = 10
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = [4] = 4
Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = [10] = 10

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 63

Final answer: [63]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 8, 9)> 
<1, (4, 9, 2)> 
<2, (5, 9, 6)> 
<3, (9, 6, 7)> 
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
