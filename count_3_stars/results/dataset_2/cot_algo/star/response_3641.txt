Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 13) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 11) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 10) (5, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 13) 

Response:
There are 3-stars formed by the nodes in this graph. The total number of 3-stars is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 11)>
<2, (4, 10, 13)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (8, 11, 12)>
<10, (1, 13, 4)>
<13, (0, 2, 14)>
<14, (9, 11, 13)>
<11, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 10)>
<9, (3, 11, 14)>
<1, (0, 10, 8)>
<4, (2, 10, 13)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<12, (6, 8, 9)>
