Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 10) (15, 27) (15, 9) (27, 15) (27, 18) (27, 3) (1, 21) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 2) (7, 24) (7, 17) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 3) (22, 18) (22, 19) (22, 0) (22, 12) (10, 16) (10, 21) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 13) (17, 7) (17, 10) (2, 11) (2, 21) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 4) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 14) (0, 24) (14, 0) (14, 25) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 28) (4, 3) (26, 5) (28, 4) (28, 8) (28, 20) (5, 26) (5, 13) (5, 8) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 20) (8, 16) (8, 28) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 16) (9, 15) (9, 8) (19, 22) (19, 23) (23, 19) (23, 25) (23, 3) (6, 10) (25, 14) (25, 23) (20, 28) (20, 13) (3, 27) (3, 18) (3, 4) (3, 23) (24, 7) (24, 0) (24, 12) (12, 1) (12, 22) (12, 24) (29, 16) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {11, 22, 14, 24}
- Node 1: {21, 12}
- Node 2: {11, 21, 18, 13, 4}
- Node 3: {27, 18, 4, 23}
- Node 4: {18, 2, 28, 3}
- Node 5: {26, 13, 8}
- Node 6: {10}
- Node 7: {24, 17}
- Node 8: {16, 28, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {16, 15, 8}
- Node 10: {16, 21, 17, 6, 13}
- Node 11: {16, 0, 2}
- Node 12: {1, 22, 24}
- Node 13: {10, 2, 5, 20}
- Node 14: {0, 25}
- Node 15: {27, 9}
- Node 16: {11, 29, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 17: {7, 10}
- Node 18: {27, 22, 2, 4, 3}
- Node 19: {22, 23}
- Node 20: {28, 13}
- Node 21: {1, 2, 10}
- Node 22: {18, 0, 12, 19}
- Node 23: {19, 25, 3}
- Node 24: {7, 0, 12}
- Node 25: {14, 23}
- Node 26: {5}
- Node 27: {15, 18, 3}
- Node 28: {4, 8, 20}
- Node 29: {16}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 16, 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 18, 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 2, 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 8, 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 9, 3 neighbors: 1
- Node 21, 3 neighbors: 1
- Node 10, 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 27, 3 neighbors: 1
- Summing all of these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 53

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [53].

The unique 3-stars found are as follows:
- <0, (11, 22, 24)>
- <16, (11, 0, 8)>
- <18, (27, 22, 2)>
- <2, (11, 21, 4)>
- <8, (16, 28, 5)>
- <9, (16, 15, 8)>
- <21, (1, 2, 10)>
- <10, (16, 21, 13)>
- <27, (15, 18, 3)>
