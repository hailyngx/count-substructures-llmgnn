Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 8
Node 2: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 3: 1, 4, 5
Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 8
Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 8
Node 6: 0, 7
Node 7: 2, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7
Node 9: 0, 2, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

For node 0, there are 4 neighbors, so it can form ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
For node 1, there are 4 neighbors, so it can form ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
For node 2, there are 5 neighbors, so it can form ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars.
For node 3, there are 3 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
For node 4, there are 4 neighbors, so it can form ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
For node 5, there are 4 neighbors, so it can form ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
For node 6, there are 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
For node 7, there are 4 neighbors, so it can form ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
For node 8, there are 6 neighbors, so it can form ${6 \choose 3} = 20$ 3-stars.
For node 9, there are 3 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 46

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [46], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, 5, 8, 9>
<1, 2, 4, 8>
<2, 7, 8, 9>
