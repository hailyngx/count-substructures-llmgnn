Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with leaves {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 5}, {1, 3, 5}, and {2, 3, 5}.
2. Node 2 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with leaves {0, 1, 7}, {0, 1, 9}, {0, 7, 8}, {0, 8, 9}, {1, 7, 8}, {1, 7, 9}, {1, 8, 9}, {7, 8, 9}, {1, 2, 7}, and {1, 7, 2}.
3. Node 4 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with leaves {6, 7, 8}, {6, 7, 9}, {7, 8, 9}, and {6, 8, 9}.
4. Node 5 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with leaves {0, 3, 7}, {0, 3, 9}, {3, 7, 9}, and {0, 7, 9}.
5. Node 9 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with leaves {1, 2, 7}, {1, 2, 9}, {1, 7, 8}, {1, 8, 9}, {2, 7, 8}, {2, 7, 9}, {2, 8, 9}, {7, 8, 9}, {0, 3, 7}, and {0, 7, 3}.

Adding up the 3-stars from each node, we get a total of 32 3-stars as follows: 
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <1, 2, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 0, 7>, <1, 0, 3>, <1, 0, 5>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 9>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32].
