Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 9, 6, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 7
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: [0 choose 3] = 0
- Node 7: [1 choose 3] = 0
- Node 5: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 6: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 8: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 9: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 0: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 2: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 3: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 4: [5 choose 3] = 10

Total number of unique 3-stars: [46]
