Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 23) (1, 27) (26, 24) (26, 29) (26, 8) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 19) (21, 20) (21, 18) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 24) (29, 26) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 25) (13, 27) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 20) (5, 27) (24, 26) (24, 17) (7, 1) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 15) (25, 29) (25, 7) (25, 4) (25, 10) (25, 11) (16, 17) (16, 23) (16, 4) (16, 19) (20, 21) (20, 29) (20, 5) (20, 7) (9, 29) (9, 15) (2, 22) (2, 4) (22, 0) (22, 14) (22, 2) (3, 17) (3, 10) (12, 17) (12, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (11, 0) (11, 25) (11, 6) (11, 8) (19, 14) (19, 16) (15, 7) (15, 9) (23, 1) (23, 16) (23, 27) (10, 25) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (18, 21) (18, 5) (8, 26) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 10) (4, 25) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 10) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 5) (27, 23) 

Response:
First, let's find all the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 14, 11, 22, 8
Node 1: 7, 23, 27
Node 2: 22, 4
Node 3: 17, 10
Node 4: 25, 16, 2, 10
Node 5: 18, 12, 20, 27
Node 6: 14, 11
Node 7: 1, 25, 20, 15
Node 8: 26, 0, 11, 10
Node 9: 29, 15
Node 10: 25, 3, 8, 4
Node 11: 0, 25, 6, 8
Node 12: 17, 5
Node 13: 27
Node 14: 0, 22, 6, 19
Node 15: 7, 9
Node 16: 17, 23, 4, 19
Node 17: 3, 16, 12, 24
Node 18: 21, 5
Node 19: 14, 16
Node 20: 21, 29, 5, 7
Node 21: 20, 18
Node 22: 0, 14, 2
Node 23: 1, 16, 27
Node 24: 26, 17
Node 25: 29, 7, 4, 11, 10
Node 26: 24, 29, 8
Node 27: 1, 5, 23, 13

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 20, 25, 26, 27

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 20: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 25: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 26: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 27: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4*13 + 10 = 63

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [63].

Unique 3-stars found:
<4, (0, 8, 11)>
<5, (12, 16, 27)>
<7, (1, 20, 25)>
<8, (0, 10, 25)>
<10, (4, 8, 25)>
<11, (0, 8, 25)>
<14, (0, 19, 22)>
<16, (4, 19, 23)>
<17, (3, 12, 24)>
<20, (5, 21, 29)>
<25, (7, 10, 11)>
