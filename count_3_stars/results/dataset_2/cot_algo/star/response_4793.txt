Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 9) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 9) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 11) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 15) (2, 4) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 12) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 18) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 8) (12, 4) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 6) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 15) (18, 9) (18, 15) (15, 2) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 17) (19, 15) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 15) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph using the approach described earlier.

First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 13, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 11, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 6, 15}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 9, 10}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 14, 15}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 8, 16, 17}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7, 12, 16}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 10, 18}
- Node 10: Neighbors {4, 9, 17}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 13, 17}
- Node 12: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 11, 0}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 15: Neighbors {2, 5, 16, 18, 19}
- Node 16: Neighbors {7, 8, 15}
- Node 17: Neighbors {10, 11, 7, 19}
- Node 18: Neighbors {9, 15}
- Node 19: Neighbors {15, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1, 10, 11, 15, and 17 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of possible 3-stars:
- For Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For Node 10: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For Node 11: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For Node 15: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 17

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 11, 13)>, <10, (4, 17, 9)>, <11, (1, 17, 13)>, <15, (2, 16, 18)>, <17, (10, 11, 19)>
