Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
- 0: {4, 6, 10, 12}
- 1: {5, 7, 13}
- 2: {3, 6, 13, 14}
- 3: {2, 11, 13}
- 4: {0, 5, 7}
- 5: {1, 4, 11, 12}
- 6: {0, 2, 7, 13, 14}
- 7: {1, 4, 6, 14}
- 8: {10, 12, 13, 14}
- 9: {10, 11, 12}
- 10: {0, 8, 9, 11}
- 11: {3, 5, 9, 10, 12}
- 12: {0, 5, 8, 9, 11}
- 13: {1, 2, 3, 6, 8}
- 14: {6, 7, 8, 2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed in this graph.

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {4, 6, 10, 12} => Total 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {5, 7, 13} => Total 3-stars: 1 
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {3, 6, 13, 14} => Total 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {2, 11, 13} => Total 3-stars: 1 
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {0, 5, 7} => Total 3-stars: 1 
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {1, 4, 11, 12} => Total 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: {0, 2, 7, 13, 14} => Total 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {1, 4, 6, 14} => Total 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {10, 12, 13, 14} => Total 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {10, 11, 12} => Total 3-stars: 1 
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {0, 8, 9, 11} => Total 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: {3, 5, 9, 10, 12} => Total 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: {0, 5, 8, 9, 11} => Total 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 6, 8} => Total 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {6, 7, 8, 2} => Total 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is:
\[ [4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4] = [66]. \]

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 10>, <0, 4, 12>, <1, 5, 13>, <2, 3, 13>, <2, 6, 13>, <2, 13, 14>, <3, 11, 13>, <5, 1, 11>, <5, 11, 12>, <6, 0, 14>, <6, 2, 14>, <6, 7, 14>, <7, 1, 14>, <8, 10, 12>, <8, 10, 13>, <8, 10, 14>, <8, 11, 13>, <8, 12, 13>, <9, 10, 11>.
