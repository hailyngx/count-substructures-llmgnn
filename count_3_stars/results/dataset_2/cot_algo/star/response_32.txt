Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {5, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with the following sets of neighbors: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>. (Total: 3)
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with the following set of neighbors: <1, (0, 2, 4)>. (Total: 1)
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with the following set of neighbors: <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>. (Total: 2) 

Since we have found a total of 6 unique 3-stars, the final answer is [6].
