Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {7, 6, 2}
- Node 1: {4, 3, 2, 6}
- Node 2: {5, 4, 1, 6, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 7, 1, 8}
- Node 4: {7, 2, 1}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 8, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 7, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8, 3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 9, 2, 8: <5, (9, 2, 8)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 5, 6, 8: <9, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 5, 9, 7: <3, (5, 9, 7)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 4, 2, 6: <1, (4, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, so the final answer is [4].
