Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 16) (0, 13) (27, 0) (27, 26) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 19) (22, 18) (22, 5) (8, 5) (8, 17) (23, 17) (23, 1) (23, 13) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (15, 20) (15, 6) (15, 17) (20, 15) (20, 29) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 28) (12, 7) (21, 28) (21, 11) (21, 25) (21, 24) (28, 7) (28, 21) (28, 5) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 24) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 19) (29, 4) (9, 29) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 3) (26, 27) (26, 18) (3, 9) (19, 18) (19, 29) (24, 21) (24, 16) (24, 1) (24, 25) (5, 22) (5, 8) (5, 28) (13, 0) (13, 23) (13, 25) (13, 11) (25, 21) (25, 24) (25, 13) (25, 4) (10, 9) (10, 6) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (4, 29) (4, 25) (4, 6) (4, 11) (1, 23) (1, 24) (17, 8) (17, 23) (17, 15) (17, 9) (14, 2) (11, 2) (11, 21) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges provided, we will first determine the neighbors for each node and then identify the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
