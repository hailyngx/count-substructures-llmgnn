Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 19) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 11) (12, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 16) (1, 5) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 14) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 5) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (13, 0) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 15) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 15) (16, 1) (16, 13) (17, 4) (17, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 17) (19, 3) (19, 0) (19, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 19) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: {5, 8, 13, 19}
- Node 1: {5, 11, 14, 16}
- Node 2: {9, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {9, 10, 19}
- Node 4: {6, 10, 13, 17}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 15}
- Node 6: {4, 13, 19}
- Node 7: {8, 11, 15}
- Node 8: {0, 7, 17}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 10}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 7, 12}
- Node 12: {11, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 6, 12, 16}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 15}
- Node 15: {5, 7, 14}
- Node 16: {1, 13}
- Node 17: {4, 8}
- Node 19: {0, 3, 6}

Now, let's find the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 4, Node 11, Node 13

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of unique 3-star configurations:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 22 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [22]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (5, 8, 13)>
<4, (6, 10, 17)>
<11, (1, 2, 7)>
<13, (0, 6, 12)>
<13, (0, 4, 12)>
<13, (0, 6, 16)>
<13, (4, 6, 12)>
<13, (4, 6, 16)>
<13, (6, 12, 16)>
<13, (0, 12, 16)>
<13, (4, 12, 16)>
