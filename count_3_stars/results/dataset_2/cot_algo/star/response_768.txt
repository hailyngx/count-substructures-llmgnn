Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (8, 14) (8, 11) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 18) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (10, 2) (10, 4) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 17) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 14) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 13) (18, 11) (18, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 14) (16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 12) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 16) (1, 7) (4, 10) (4, 16) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given edges:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: 
(6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
(2, 5) (2, 10) 
(8, 14) (8, 11) 
(3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 5) 
(11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 18) 
(5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 19) 
(19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) 
(10, 2) (10, 4) 
(15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 17) 
(13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 14) 
(17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 13) 
(18, 11) (18, 14) 
(0, 11) (0, 1) 
(12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 14) 
(16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 4) 
(7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 1) 
(14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 12) 
(1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 16) (1, 7) 
(4, 10) (4, 16)
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 11
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9, 16
- Node 2: 5, 10
- Node 3: 5, 7, 11, 17
- Node 4: 10, 16
- Node 5: 2, 3, 19
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 9, 19
- Node 8: 11, 14
- Node 9: 1, 6, 7, 11
- Node 10: 2, 4
- Node 11: 0, 3, 8, 9, 18
- Node 12: 13, 14, 15
- Node 13: 12, 14, 16, 17
- Node 14: 8, 12, 13, 18
- Node 15: 12, 17, 19
- Node 16: 1, 4, 13
- Node 17: 3, 13, 15
- Node 18: 11, 14
- Node 19: 5, 7, 15

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 1
- Node 3
- Node 7
- Node 11
- Node 13
- Node 15

Total number of 3-stars = 6
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<11, 9, 18>
<13, 14, 16>
<15, 17, 19>
