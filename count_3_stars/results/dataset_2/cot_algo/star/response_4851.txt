Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:

First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 3, 2, 7, 4}
- Node 1: {9, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 1, 8, 4, 7, 0}
- Node 3: {9, 7, 0}
- Node 4: {2, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 2}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 3, 2, 8, 0}
- Node 8: {6, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 3, 1, 7, 0}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 71

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [71].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 9, 2)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>.
