Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 22) (12, 27) (12, 2) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 23) (27, 9) (27, 6) (15, 20) (20, 15) (20, 22) (20, 5) (6, 27) (6, 25) (6, 19) (28, 26) (28, 7) (28, 24) (19, 6) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 23) (26, 28) (26, 19) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 23) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 21) (11, 19) (11, 8) (11, 29) (17, 1) (17, 18) (17, 21) (5, 20) (5, 8) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 22) (16, 8) (7, 28) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 18) (2, 12) (4, 22) (4, 25) (22, 3) (22, 20) (22, 16) (22, 4) (9, 27) (9, 21) (9, 10) (18, 17) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 25) (29, 1) (29, 27) (29, 11) (29, 10) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 16) (21, 14) (21, 17) (21, 9) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 29) (13, 1) (25, 6) (25, 4) (25, 18) (23, 27) (23, 19) (23, 0) (24, 28) 

Response:
The center nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 1, 3, 20, 27, 6, 19, 0, 14, 11, 17, 22, 8, 7, and 18.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each center node:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 27 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 60 \)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars formed in this graph is [60].
