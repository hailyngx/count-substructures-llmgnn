Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 2) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 14) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 12) (9, 7) (9, 11) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 13) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 10) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

1: {5, 6, 8, 12}
2: {0, 3, 4, 8, 12}
3: {2, 7, 11}
4: {2, 10, 12, 14}
5: {1, 8, 10, 14}
6: {1, 7, 10, 13}
7: {3, 6, 9, 13, 14}
8: {1, 2, 5, 14}
9: {7, 11}
10: {0, 4, 5, 6, 14}
11: {0, 3, 9, 12}
12: {1, 2, 4, 11, 13}
13: {6, 7, 12}
14: {4, 5, 7, 8, 10}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 6, and 8: <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 8, and 12: <2, (4, 8, 12)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 7, and 11: <3, (2, 7, 11)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 10, and 12: <4, (2, 10, 12)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 10, and 14: <5, (1, 10, 14)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 7, and 10: <6, (1, 7, 10)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 6, and 13: <7, (3, 6, 13)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 14, and 2: <8, (5, 14, 2)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 5, and 14: <10, (4, 5, 14)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 9, and 12: <11, (3, 9, 12)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 4, and 13: <12, (2, 4, 13)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 7, and 10: <14, (4, 7, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
