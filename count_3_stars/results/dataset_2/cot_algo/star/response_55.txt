Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 14) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 12) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {3, 5, 9}
Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 8, 13}
Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 10, 11}
Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 11, 13}
Node 4: Neighbors {6, 10, 12}
Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 13}
Node 6: Neighbors {4, 9, 14}
Node 7: Neighbors {8, 10, 11, 12}
Node 8: Neighbors {1, 7, 13, 14}
Node 9: Neighbors {0, 6, 14}
Node 10: Neighbors {2, 4, 7}
Node 11: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 13, 14}
Node 12: Neighbors {4, 7, 13, 14}
Node 13: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 8, 11, 12}
Node 14: Neighbors {6, 8, 9, 11, 12}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 
- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{13}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{9}{3} + \binom{9}{3} \]

\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = 286 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 84 + 84  \]

\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = 532 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [532].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 5, 13>, <1, 8, 13>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 11, 13>, <9, 0, 6>, <7, 8, 13>, <7, 10, 11>, <7, 11, 12>, <13, 11, 14>, <13, 12, 14>, <14, 6, 9>
