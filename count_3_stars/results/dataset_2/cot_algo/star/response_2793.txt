Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 14) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 10) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 10) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 14) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 12 nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: Neighbors {5, 6, 2, 7, 12, 10}
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
   3-stars: <1, (2, 7, 12)>, <1, (2, 7, 10)> 

2. Node 2: Neighbors {9, 1, 7, 11}
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   3-stars: <2, (1, 7, 11)>

3. Node 3: Neighbors {9, 6, 12, 11, 10}
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   3-stars: <3, (6, 12, 11)>

4. Node 4: Neighbors {6, 13, 0}
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   3-stars: <4, (6, 13, 0)>

5. Node 7: Neighbors {2, 12, 0, 1, 14}
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   3-stars: <7, (2, 1, 14)>, <7, (1, 12, 14)>

6. Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 2, 11, 3}
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   3-stars: <9, (2, 11, 3)>

7. Node 10: Neighbors {12, 13, 3, 1, 14}
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   3-stars: <10, (12, 1, 14)>

8. Node 11: Neighbors {9, 2, 12, 3, 0}
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   3-stars: <11, (2, 12, 3)>

9. Node 12: Neighbors {7, 13, 10, 11, 3, 1}
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
   3-stars: <12, (10, 11, 1)>, <12, (10, 3, 1)>

Adding all the 3-stars, we get a total of [85].
