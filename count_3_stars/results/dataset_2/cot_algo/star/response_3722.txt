Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 27) (26, 16) (15, 27) (15, 4) (27, 9) (27, 15) (27, 19) (2, 22) (2, 1) (29, 17) (29, 8) (29, 14) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 25) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 21) (23, 14) (17, 29) (17, 10) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 29) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 12) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 19) (20, 0) (20, 14) (20, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 24) (6, 4) (6, 20) (6, 5) (6, 18) (25, 11) (25, 24) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 3) (24, 5) (24, 25) (24, 19) (7, 16) (7, 28) (16, 26) (16, 7) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 18) (19, 27) (19, 22) (19, 0) (19, 24) (19, 1) (14, 29) (14, 11) (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 3) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 7) (28, 1) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 18) (1, 2) (1, 19) (1, 28) (21, 22) (21, 18) (18, 6) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 21) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 20, 28, 19
Node 1 neighbors: 2, 19, 28
Node 2 neighbors: 1, 22
Node 3 neighbors: 13, 14, 18
Node 4 neighbors: 15, 8, 12, 5, 6
Node 5 neighbors: 4, 6, 24
Node 6 neighbors: 4, 20, 5, 18
Node 7 neighbors: 16, 28
Node 8 neighbors: 29, 4, 12, 28
Node 9 neighbors: 27
Node 10 neighbors: 11, 17, 12, 13
Node 11 neighbors: 10, 14, 13, 25
Node 12 neighbors: 10, 4, 8, 18
Node 13 neighbors: 10, 11, 3
Node 14 neighbors: 29, 11, 23, 20, 3
Node 15 neighbors: 27, 4
Node 16 neighbors: 26, 7
Node 17 neighbors: 29, 10
Node 18 neighbors: 6, 12, 3, 21
Node 19 neighbors: 27, 22, 0, 24, 1
Node 20 neighbors: 0, 14, 6
Node 21 neighbors: 22, 18
Node 22 neighbors: 2, 19, 21
Node 23 neighbors: 14
Node 24 neighbors: 5, 25, 19
Node 25 neighbors: 11, 24
Node 26 neighbors: 16
Node 27 neighbors: 9, 15, 19
Node 28 neighbors: 8, 0, 7, 1
Node 29 neighbors: 17, 8, 14

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to count the 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 8, 14, 19, 28

Now we can count the number of 3-stars:

inic{7}{3} = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (19, 20, 28)>
<1, (19, 28, 2)>
<4, (5, 6, 20)>
<8, (28, 12, 4)>
<14, (20, 29, 14)>
<19, (1, 24, 19)>
<28, (1, 8, 19)>
