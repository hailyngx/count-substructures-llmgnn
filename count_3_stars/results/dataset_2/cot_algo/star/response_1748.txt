Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 7}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 34\), which we will represent as [34].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
- <0, 1, 4, 8>
- <0, 1, 4, 7>
- <0, 1, 7, 8>
- <0, 4, 5, 7>
- <0, 4, 7, 8>
- <1, 4, 6, 7>
- <1, 6, 7, 8>
- <4, 5, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 7, 8>
- <6, 7, 8, 9>
