Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 15) (16, 3) (16, 9) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 4) (10, 12) (10, 9) (10, 5) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 15) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 15) (18, 17) (18, 13) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 5) (19, 14) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 1) (2, 14) (2, 9) (12, 14) (12, 10) (3, 16) (3, 0) (6, 17) (6, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 1) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 7) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 19) (1, 5) (1, 9) (13, 18) (13, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. 

Let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 19}
- Node 2: {9, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 16}
- Node 4: {15, 17, 19}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 6: {13, 17}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 15}
- Node 8: {5, 15, 19}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 10, 11, 16}
- Node 10: {5, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {5, 9, 15}
- Node 12: {10, 14}
- Node 13: {6, 18}
- Node 14: {2, 12, 17, 19}
- Node 15: {4, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 16: {3, 9}
- Node 17: {4, 6, 14, 18}
- Node 18: {13, 17}
- Node 19: {1, 4, 8, 14}

Now, let's look at each node that has three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 1: \(^5C_3 = 10\) 3-star(s)
  - <1, 5, 9>
  - <1, 5, 19>
  - <1, 9, 19>
  - <1, 5, 9>
  - <1, 9, 19>
  - <1, 5, 19>
  - <1, 5, 9>
  - <1, 9, 19>
  - <1, 5, 9>
  - <1, 5, 19>

- Node 4: \(^3C_3 = 1\) 3-star(s)
  - <4, 15, 17>

- Node 5: \(^5C_3 = 10\) 3-star(s)
  - <5, 7, 8>
  - <5, 9, 10>
  - <5, 9, 11>
  - <5, 7, 8>
  - <5, 9, 10>
  - <5, 9, 11>
  - <5, 7, 8>
  - <5, 9, 10>
  - <5, 9, 11>
  - <5, 7, 8>

- Node 9: \(^5C_3 = 10\) 3-star(s)
  - <9, 10, 11>
  - <9, 10, 16>
  - <9, 11, 15>
  - <9, 10, 11>
  - <9, 10, 16>
  - <9, 11, 15>
  - <9, 10, 11>
  - <9, 10, 16>
  - <9, 11, 15>
  - <9, 10, 11>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([31]\).
