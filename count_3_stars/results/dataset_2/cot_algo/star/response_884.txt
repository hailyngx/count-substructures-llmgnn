Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 11) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 16) (14, 13) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 6) (3, 11) (3, 18) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 13) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 10) (15, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (6, 17) (6, 18) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 1) (18, 3) (18, 10) (18, 6) (13, 14) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 15) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by determining the number of 3-star configurations around each node and summing them up. 

Let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {9, 16, 17}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 3: {11, 18}
- Node 4: {0, 8, 15}
- Node 5: {7, 13, 15, 19}
- Node 6: {17, 18}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 11, 14, 16}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 10: {15, 18}
- Node 11: {3, 8, 13}
- Node 12: {2, 14}
- Node 13: {5, 11, 15, 19}
- Node 14: {8, 12, 13, 16}
- Node 15: {4, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 16: {1, 8, 14}
- Node 17: {1, 6}
- Node 18: {3, 6, 10}
- Node 19: {5, 13}

Now we can see which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 
\( 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 32 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 4, 9>
- <2, 7, 9, 12>
- <4, 8, 15>
- <5, 7, 13, 19>
- <7, 9, 0>
- <8, 11, 14, 16>
- <9, 0, 1, 2>
- <13, 5, 11, 15>
- <14, 8, 12, 13>
- <15, 4, 5, 10>
- <16, 1, 8, 14>
