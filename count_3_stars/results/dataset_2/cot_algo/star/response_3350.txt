Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 0) (7, 0) (7, 13) (12, 3) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 16) (6, 11) (6, 5) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 13) (1, 19) (15, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 4) (17, 5) (17, 13) (16, 5) (16, 0) (19, 18) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 3) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 15) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 19) (3, 14) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 3) (4, 13) (4, 19) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:  
- Node 0 has degree 5  
- Node 1 has degree 1  
- Node 2 has degree 2  
- Node 3 has degree 4  
- Node 4 has degree 2  
- Node 5 has degree 5  
- Node 6 has degree 3  
- Node 7 has degree 2  
- Node 8 has degree 5  
- Node 9 has degree 4  
- Node 10 has degree 4  
- Node 11 has degree 3  
- Node 12 has degree 1  
- Node 13 has degree 4  
- Node 14 has degree 3  
- Node 15 has degree 1  
- Node 16 has degree 2  
- Node 17 has degree 2  
- Node 18 has degree 4  
- Node 19 has degree 4  

Now, we will go through each node to find the 3-stars that can be formed:

For node 0: It has degree 5 and neighbors {18, 7, 8, 16, 13}. Hence, it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.  
<0, (18, 7, 8)>, <0, (18, 7, 16)>, <0, (18, 7, 13)>, <0, (18, 8, 16)>, <0, (18, 8, 13)>, <0, (18, 16, 13)>,  
<0, (7, 8, 16)>, <0, (7, 8, 13)>, <0, (7, 16, 13)>, <0, (8, 16, 13)>  

For node 5: It has degree 5 and neighbors {18, 6, 8, 17, 16}. It can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.  
<5, (18, 6, 8)>, <5, (18, 6, 17)>, <5, (18, 6, 16)>, <5, (18, 8, 17)>, <5, (18, 8, 16)>, <5, (18, 17, 16)>,  
<5, (6, 8, 17)>, <5, (6, 8, 16)>, <5, (6, 17, 16)>, <5, (8, 17, 16)>  

For node 8: It has degree 5 and neighbors {10, 2, 5, 14, 0}. It can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.  
<8, (10, 2, 5)>, <8, (10, 2, 14)>, <8, (10, 2, 0)>, <8, (10, 5, 14)>, <8, (10, 5, 0)>, <8, (10, 14, 0)>,  
<8, (2, 5, 14)>, <8, (2, 5, 0)>, <8, (2, 14, 0)>, <8, (5, 14, 0)>  

For node 9: It has degree 4 and neighbors {11, 2, 18, 15}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

For node 13: It has degree 4 and neighbors {7, 0, 17, 4}. We can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.  
<13, (7, 0, 17)>, <13, (7, 0, 4)>, <13, (7, 17, 4)>, <13, (0, 17, 4)>  

For node 14: It has degree 3 and neighbors {10, 8, 3}. Only one 3-star can be formed with this node.  
<14, (10, 8, 3)>  

Adding up the 3-stars from each node: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 39  
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39].  

Unique 3-stars:  
<0, (18, 7, 8)>, <0, (18, 7, 16)>, <0, (18, 7, 13)>, <0, (18, 8, 16)>, <0, (18, 8, 13)>, <0, (18, 16, 13)>,  
<0, (7, 8, 16)>, <0, (7, 8, 13)>, <0, (7, 16, 13)>, <0, (8, 16, 13)>,  
<5, (18, 6, 8)>, <5, (18, 6, 17)>, <5, (18, 6, 16)>, <5, (18, 8, 17)>, <5, (18, 8, 16)>, <5, (18, 17, 16)>,  
<5, (6, 8, 17)>, <5, (6, 8, 16)>, <5, (6, 17, 16)>, <5, (8, 17, 16)>,  
<8, (10, 2, 5)>, <8, (10, 2, 14)>, <8, (10, 2, 0)>, <8, (10, 5, 14)>, <8, (10, 5, 0)>, <8, (10, 14, 0)>,  
<8, (2, 5, 14)>, <8, (2, 5, 0)>, <8, (2, 14, 0)>, <8, (5, 14, 0)>,  
<13, (7, 0, 17)>, <13, (7, 0, 4)>, <13, (7, 17, 4)>, <13, (0, 17, 4)>,  
<14, (10, 8, 3)>
