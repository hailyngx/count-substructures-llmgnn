Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 7) (4, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 11) (7, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (10, 17) (10, 0) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 16) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 18) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 13) (3, 13) (11, 4) (11, 13) (1, 6) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 11) (19, 8) (19, 9) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 9) (18, 15) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 15) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 12) (9, 19) (9, 18) (15, 18) (15, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 2, 7, 10, 14, 18
Node 1: 6
Node 2: 0, 5, 12, 13
Node 3: 13
Node 4: 7, 8, 11, 14
Node 5: 2, 6
Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 16
Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 17
Node 8: 4, 8, 16, 18, 19
Node 9: 18, 19
Node 10: 0, 17
Node 11: 4, 13
Node 12: 2, 15, 16
Node 13: 2, 3, 11
Node 14: 0, 4, 16, 17
Node 15: 12, 18
Node 16: 6, 8, 12, 14
Node 17: 7, 10, 14
Node 18: 0, 8, 9, 15
Node 19: 8, 9

Now, we will identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 18: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 47

Therefore, the final answer is [47], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 7, 10>
<0, 7, 14>
<0, 10, 17>
<0, 14, 17>
<0, 14, 18>
<0, 18, 15>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 12>
<2, 5, 13>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 11>
<4, 8, 16>
<4, 11, 13>
<6, 7, 16>
<8, 16, 12>
<8, 16, 14>
<8, 18, 15>
<9, 18, 19>
