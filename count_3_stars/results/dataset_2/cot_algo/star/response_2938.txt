Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 8}

Now, we will calculate the 3-stars:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
<0, (4, 7, 9)>

Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>

Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>

Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>

Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 9, 8)>, <4, (8, 9, 2)>, <4, (8, 9, 7)>

Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 5, 7)>

Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>

Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
<7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 8, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 35

Therefore, the final answer is [35].
