The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 24) (0, 26) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 11) (12, 27) (12, 16) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 17) (26, 0) (26, 25) (26, 7) (9, 18) (9, 14) (9, 23) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (17, 22) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 7) (3, 2) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 8) (21, 18) (10, 1) (10, 7) (15, 19) (11, 27) (11, 23) (11, 4) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 29) (20, 21) (20, 8) (29, 23) (29, 14) (29, 4) (28, 0) (28, 19) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 16) (16, 12) (16, 21) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 5) (18, 9) (18, 21) (18, 6) (4, 22) (4, 11) (4, 29) (19, 17) (19, 15) (19, 28) (19, 25) (6, 18) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 26) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 6) (24, 0) (24, 25) (8, 1) (8, 21) (8, 20) (8, 16) (8, 6) (25, 26) (25, 19) (25, 24) (13, 14) (5, 22) (5, 16) (14, 9) (14, 29) (14, 13) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 24, 26, 27, 28}
- Node 1: {2, 8, 10, 17}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 16}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {11, 22, 29}
- Node 5: {16, 22}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 18}
- Node 7: {6, 10, 17, 26}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 16, 20, 21}
- Node 9: {14, 18, 23}
- Node 10: {1, 7}
- Node 11: {4, 23, 27}
- Node 12: {16, 27}
- Node 13: {14}
- Node 14: {9, 13, 29}
- Node 15: {19}
- Node 16: {2, 5, 8, 12, 21}
- Node 17: {1, 7, 19, 22}
- Node 18: {6, 9, 21}
- Node 19: {17, 25, 28}
- Node 20: {8, 21}
- Node 21: {8, 16, 18, 20}
- Node 22: {4, 5, 17}
- Node 23: {9, 11, 29}
- Node 24: {0, 25}
- Node 25: {19, 24, 26}
- Node 26: {0, 7, 25}
- Node 27: {0, 11, 12}
- Node 28: {0, 19}
- Node 29: {4, 14, 23}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 5 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors
- Node 21: 4 neighbors
- Node 22: 3 neighbors
- Node 25: 3 neighbors
- Node 26: 3 neighbors
- Node 27: 3 neighbors
- Node 29: 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars from the calculations: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 26, 27>
- <0, 26, 28>
- <0, 26, 24>
- <0, 27, 28>
- <0, 27, 24>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <1, 2, 10>
- <1, 2, 17>
- <1, 8, 10>
- <1, 8, 17>
- <2, 3, 16>
- <4, 11, 23>
- <7, 17, 22>
- <8, 16, 21>
- <9, 14, 29>
- <16, 5, 22>
- <18, 6, 7>
- <19, 25, 28>
- <26, 7, 17>
- <26, 25, 24>
