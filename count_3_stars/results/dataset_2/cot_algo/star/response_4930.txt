Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 11) (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 16) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 19) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 17) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 15) (18, 19) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 12) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 6) (0, 16) (0, 11) (16, 9) (16, 0) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 11) (1, 13) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 19) (14, 8) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 11, 16}
- Node 1: Neighbors {13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 8, 17}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 9, 15}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5, 17}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 17}
- Node 7: Neighbors {10, 12, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 13, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 5, 16}
- Node 10: Neighbors {7, 12, 15}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 15, 19}
- Node 12: Neighbors {7, 10, 14, 19}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 7, 8, 17}
- Node 14: Neighbors {8, 12}
- Node 15: Neighbors {3, 10, 11, 18}
- Node 16: Neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 17: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 13}
- Node 18: Neighbors {15, 19}
- Node 19: Neighbors {11, 12, 18}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3, 4, 6, 12, 13, 15, 17, and 19 have 5 neighbors each.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 38 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [38], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<3, (2, 4, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 3, 17)>, <12, (7, 10, 14)>, <13, (7, 8, 17)>, <15, (3, 10, 11)>, <17, (2, 4, 6)>, <19, (11, 12, 18)>
