Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (13, 16) (13, 12) (13, 2) (4, 18) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 14) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 17) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (1, 6) (3, 19) (3, 12) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 3) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 15) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 0) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 15) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 17) (10, 8) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 12) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 2, 15}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {8, 13, 0}
- Node 3: {19, 12}
- Node 4: {18}
- Node 5: {11, 6, 15, 14}
- Node 6: {16, 9, 5, 1, 18}
- Node 7: {11, 15, 19}
- Node 8: {2, 14, 10}
- Node 9: {6, 17, 14}
- Node 10: {8}
- Node 11: {16, 7, 19, 0, 5}
- Node 12: {13, 3, 17}
- Node 13: {16, 12, 2}
- Node 14: {9, 8, 5, 15}
- Node 15: {5, 7, 14, 0}
- Node 16: {11, 13, 6}
- Node 17: {9, 18, 12}
- Node 18: {6, 4, 17}
- Node 19: {11, 7, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

For nodes with 3 neighbors, there are no 3-stars.

For nodes with 4 neighbors, there is 1 3-star.

For nodes with 5 neighbors, there are 2 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars formed by this graph is [0 + 1 + 2] = [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (11, 6, 15)>
<6, (16, 9, 5)>
<6, (16, 11, 5)>
