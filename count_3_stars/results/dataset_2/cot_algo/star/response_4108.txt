Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 19) (6, 16) (6, 8) (10, 11) (2, 5) (2, 8) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 13) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 17) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 18) (13, 7) (15, 8) (15, 7) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 13) (7, 15) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 3) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 14) (3, 0) (3, 12) (19, 9) (19, 0) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 0) (17, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {16, 17, 3, 19}
- Node 1: {4, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 12}
- Node 4: {11, 17, 1, 18}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 2, 17}
- Node 6: {8, 16}
- Node 7: {13, 15}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 12, 15, 16}
- Node 9: {5, 18, 19}
- Node 10: {11}
- Node 11: {10, 14, 4}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 8, 17}
- Node 13: {5, 7, 18}
- Node 14: {11, 18, 1}
- Node 15: {7, 8}
- Node 16: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 17: {0, 4, 5, 12}
- Node 18: {9, 13, 4, 14}
- Node 19: {9, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars involving each of them:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 12: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 16: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 17: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 37 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [37], and the unique 3-stars found inside <> are:

<0, 3, 19>
<0, 16, 17>
