Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 : {2, 4, 5, 9}
Node 1 : {3, 4, 6, 7}
Node 2 : {0, 3, 5}
Node 3 : {1, 2, 6, 7}
Node 4 : {0, 1, 5, 7}
Node 5 : {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
Node 6 : {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
Node 7 : {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
Node 8 : {3, 5, 7}
Node 9 : {0, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0 : {} (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 1 : {3, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 2 : {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors) -> 1 3-star
Node 3 : {1, 2, 6, 7} (4 neighbors) -> 4 3-stars
Node 4 : {0, 1, 5, 7} (4 neighbors) -> 4 3-stars
Node 5 : {0, 2, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors) -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 6 : {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors) -> 10 3-stars
Node 7 : {1, 3, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors) -> 10 3-stars
Node 8 : {3, 5, 7} (3 neighbors) -> 1 3-star
Node 9 : {} (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40], and the unique 3-stars found are:
