Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 27) (7, 20) (7, 24) (21, 3) (21, 11) (20, 7) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 6) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 8) (25, 0) (18, 22) (18, 9) (18, 10) (15, 23) (15, 17) (15, 28) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 17) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 10) (3, 29) (28, 15) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 24) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 0) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 10) (9, 13) (9, 18) (9, 27) (11, 21) (11, 29) (24, 7) (24, 28) (24, 12) (16, 1) (16, 23) (16, 29) (5, 25) (5, 8) (8, 20) (8, 25) (8, 5) (26, 27) (26, 17) (14, 4) (14, 1) (0, 25) (0, 2) (0, 23) (23, 15) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 6) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 28) (17, 26) (17, 19) (27, 22) (27, 9) (27, 26) (19, 17) (19, 6) (1, 16) (1, 14) (29, 3) (29, 11) (29, 16) (10, 18) (10, 3) (10, 12) (6, 20) (6, 4) (6, 23) (6, 19) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors = {25, 2, 23}
2. Node 1: Neighbors = {16, 14}
3. Node 2: Neighbors = {13, 12, 0}
4. Node 3: Neighbors = {21, 28, 10, 29}
5. Node 4: Neighbors = {6, 14, 17}
6. Node 5: Neighbors = {25, 8}
7. Node 6: Neighbors = {20, 4, 23, 19}
8. Node 7: Neighbors = {20, 24}
9. Node 8: Neighbors = {20, 25, 5}
10. Node 9: Neighbors = {13, 18, 27}
11. Node 10: Neighbors = {18, 3, 12}
12. Node 11: Neighbors = {21, 29}
13. Node 12: Neighbors = {2, 10, 24}
14. Node 13: Neighbors = {22, 2, 9}
15. Node 14: Neighbors = {4, 1}
16. Node 15: Neighbors = {23, 17, 28}
17. Node 16: Neighbors = {1, 23, 29}
18. Node 17: Neighbors = {26, 4, 15, 28, 19}
19. Node 18: Neighbors = {22, 10, 9}
20. Node 20: Neighbors = {25, 7, 6, 8}
21. Node 21: Neighbors = {3, 11}
22. Node 23: Neighbors = {15, 16, 0, 6}
23. Node 24: Neighbors = {7, 28, 12}
24. Node 25: Neighbors = {20, 5, 8, 0}
25. Node 26: Neighbors = {27, 17}
26. Node 27: Neighbors = {22, 9, 26}
27. Node 28: Neighbors = {15, 3, 17, 24}
28. Node 29: Neighbors = {16, 11, 3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 3 forms a 3-star with the leaves {21, 11, 29}
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with the leaves {4, 23, 19}
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with the leaves {20, 5, 25}
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with the leaves {1, 23, 29}
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with the leaves {26, 15, 28}
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with the leaves {15, 17, 24}

Counting these unique 3-stars gives a total of [6]. 

Therefore, the answer is [6].
