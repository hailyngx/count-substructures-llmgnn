Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 0) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 14) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 9) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 8, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 13}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 7, 13}
- Node 6: {3, 12}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 9, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 10, 11}
- Node 9: {2, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {8, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 4, 5, 10}
- Node 14: {1, 7, 9, 10}

Now, we can observe that nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, and 14 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars involving these nodes.

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 11>, <0, 1, 14>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 8, 11>, <0, 8, 10>, <0, 8, 13>, <0, 11, 12>, <0, 11, 13>, <0, 12, 11>, <0, 13, 10>, <0, 13, 4>, <0, 13, 5>, <0, 13, 12>, <3, 2, 7>, <3, 2, 9>, <3, 2, 4>, <3, 2, 14>, <3, 4, 13>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 0>, <3, 4, 13>, <4, 0, 13>, <4, 0, 5>, <4, 2, 13>, <4, 2, 5>, <9, 2, 7>, <9, 2, 14>, <9, 2, 7>, <9, 2, 14>, <10, 8, 11>, <10, 8, 13>, <10, 8, 9>, <10, 8, 14>, <10, 9, 13>, <10, 9, 14>, <10, 14, 1>, <10, 14, 7>
