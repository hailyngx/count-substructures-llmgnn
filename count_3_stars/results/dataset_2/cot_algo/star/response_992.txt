Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 14) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 0) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 9) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 9, 10}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 4, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 10}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 10, 12}

Now, we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 6, 11} -> <1, (0, 6, 11)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 10, 11} -> <3, (9, 10, 11)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 1, 7} -> <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 12, 14} -> <10, (1, 12, 14)>

The total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is therefore [4].
