Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node with at least 3 neighbors.

1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors: {1, 3, 13, 14, 11}. Since it has more than 3 neighbors, we can form \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars centered at node 0.

2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors: {0, 3, 7, 8, 10}. Again, it has more than 3 neighbors, so we can form \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars centered at node 1.

3. Node 2 has 5 neighbors: {3, 5, 8, 11, 13}. With more than 3 neighbors, we can form \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars centered at node 2.

4. Node 3 has 5 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 10, 12}. More than 3 neighbors, we can form \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars centered at node 3.

5. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {6, 7, 10}. Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 unique 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (6, 7, 10)>.

6. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {2, 9, 13, 14}. With more than 3 neighbors, we can form \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 5.

7. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {4, 8, 11}. Just like node 4, there is 1 unique 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (4, 8, 11)>.

8. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {1, 4, 8, 12, 14}. More than 3 neighbors, we can form \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars centered at node 7.

9. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {2, 6, 7, 11}. More than 3 neighbors, we can form \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 8.

10. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {5, 11, 12, 14}. More than 3 neighbors, we can form \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 9.

11. Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 4, 6}. More than 3 neighbors, we can form \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 10.

12. Node 11 has 4 neighbors: {2, 6, 9, 0}. More than 3 neighbors, we can form \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 11.

13. Node 12 has 3 neighbors: {3, 7, 9}. Just like nodes 4 and 6, there is 1 unique 3-star centered at node 12: <12, (3, 7, 9)>.

14. Node 13 has 3 neighbors: {0, 2, 5}. Just like nodes 4, 6, and 12, there is 1 unique 3-star centered at node 13: <13, (0, 2, 5)>.

15. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {0, 5, 7, 9}. More than 3 neighbors, we can form \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 14.

Adding up all the unique 3-stars formed, we get a total of \(10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 68 \). Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].
