Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 3) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 10) (7, 6) (7, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (1, 4) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

1: 4

2: 6, 9, 8, 12, 5

3: 9, 0, 14, 11, 10 

4: 8, 13, 5, 14, 1

5: 4, 8, 2, 0

6: 9, 7, 2, 11, 12, 13

7: 6, 10

8: 4, 2, 5, 10, 0

9: 6, 2, 11, 10, 3

10: 9, 8, 3, 12, 7, 13

11: 6, 9, 3 

12: 6, 2, 10

13: 4, 6, 10 

14: 4, 0, 3

Based on the neighbor sets, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = 0
Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = 0
Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = 0

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 80 [80]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<2, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 10>, <2, 9, 10>, <4, 6, 10>, <4, 6, 13>, <5, 8, 10>.
