Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph using adjacency list notation to make it easier to visualize:

```
0: 5, 1, 6
1: 5, 6, 8, 0
2: 4, 6, 7
3: 5, 9, 7, 6
4: 5, 9, 8, 2
5: 9, 1, 4, 0, 3
6: 1, 3, 2, 0, 7
7: 3, 8, 2, 6
8: 1, 4, 7
9: 5, 4, 3, 0
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 5 has neighbors {9, 1, 4, 0, 3}. It forms <5, (9, 1, 4)>, <5, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (9, 4, 3)>, <5, (1, 4, 3)>, and <5, (4, 0, 3)>, resulting in 5 three-stars.
- Node 9 has neighbors {5, 4, 3, 0}. It forms <9, (5, 4, 3)>, <9, (5, 4, 0)>, <9, (5, 3, 0)>, and <9, (4, 3, 0)>, resulting in 4 three-stars.
- Node 1 has neighbors {5, 6, 8, 0}. It forms <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 0)>, and <1, (5, 8, 0)>, resulting in 3 three-stars.
- Node 3 has neighbors {5, 9, 7, 6}. It forms <3, (5, 9, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, 6)>, <3, (9, 7, 6)>, and <3, (5, 9, 6)>, resulting in 4 three-stars.
- Node 4 has neighbors {5, 9, 8, 2}. It forms <4, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (5, 9, 2)>, and <4, (9, 8, 2)>, resulting in 3 three-stars.
- Nodes 0, 2, 6, 7, and 8 have less than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any three-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 5 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 3 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
