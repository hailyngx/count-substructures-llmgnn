Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 9) (16, 5) (16, 10) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 5) (8, 19) (8, 6) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 19) (6, 8) (6, 5) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 3) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 0) (3, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 19) (1, 9) (15, 7) (15, 2) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 14) (13, 11) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 2) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 17) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 17) (10, 16) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by first determining the neighbors of each node. After calculating, we find that node 5 has 5 neighbors, node 0 has 5 neighbors, node 3 has 5 neighbors, node 9 has 4 neighbors, node 10 has 4 neighbors, node 14 has 4 neighbors, node 16 has 4 neighbors, node 17 has 4 neighbors, node 1 has 3 neighbors, and node 19 has 3 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors, we get:
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].
