Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 29) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 20) (9, 5) (18, 22) (18, 7) (23, 13) (23, 0) (24, 6) (24, 8) (24, 20) (4, 13) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 24) (8, 4) (8, 29) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 19) (21, 17) (28, 21) (28, 3) (28, 1) (28, 20) (1, 28) (1, 17) (1, 25) (17, 21) (17, 1) (17, 2) (17, 7) (26, 11) (26, 16) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 2) (10, 13) (10, 21) (10, 14) (3, 13) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 24) (6, 4) (12, 16) (12, 15) (16, 26) (16, 12) (16, 27) (16, 20) (11, 26) (11, 14) (11, 27) (11, 29) (14, 10) (14, 11) (0, 23) (0, 3) (0, 25) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 3) (7, 18) (7, 17) (7, 15) (15, 12) (15, 7) (25, 1) (25, 0) (27, 21) (27, 16) (27, 11) (20, 5) (20, 24) (20, 28) (20, 16) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 23, 25}
- Node 1: {17, 25, 28}
- Node 2: {3, 17, 19}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 13, 28}
- Node 4: {6, 8, 13}
- Node 5: {9, 19, 20}
- Node 6: {4, 8, 24}
- Node 7: {15, 17, 18}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 29}
- Node 9: {5}
- Node 10: {13, 14, 21}
- Node 11: {14, 26, 27, 29}
- Node 12: {15, 16}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 10, 22, 23}
- Node 14: {10, 11}
- Node 15: {7, 12}
- Node 16: {12, 20, 26, 27}
- Node 17: {1, 2, 7, 21}
- Node 18: {7, 22}
- Node 19: {2, 5, 21}
- Node 20: {5, 16, 24, 28}
- Node 21: {10, 17, 19, 27, 28}
- Node 22: {13, 18, 29}
- Node 23: {3, 13}
- Node 24: {6, 8, 20}
- Node 25: {0, 1}
- Node 26: {11, 16}
- Node 27: {11, 16, 21}
- Node 28: {1, 3, 20, 21}
- Node 29: {8, 11, 22}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 13: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 16: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 21: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 28: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the final answer is [28].

Unique 3-stars:
<13, (3, 4, 10)>
<13, (3, 4, 22)>
<13, (3, 10, 22)>
<13, (4, 10, 22)>
<13, (10, 21, 22)>
<16, (12, 20, 26)>
<21, (10, 19, 27)>
<21, (10, 21, 27)>
<21, (19, 20, 21)>
<21, (19, 21, 28)>
<28, (1, 20, 21)>
<28, (3, 20, 21)>
<28, (20, 21, 27)>
<28, (20, 21, 28)>
