Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs.

By examining the edges provided, we can determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars around each node:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node gives a total of 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 58. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
