This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 20) (26, 9) (26, 23) (26, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 25) (12, 7) (12, 21) (28, 9) (28, 29) (28, 4) (29, 28) (29, 19) (11, 6) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 8) (25, 7) (25, 4) (25, 18) (25, 2) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 20) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 27) (6, 11) (6, 16) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 27) (10, 22) (18, 0) (18, 25) (18, 15) (18, 3) (3, 18) (3, 5) (3, 22) (3, 4) (17, 23) (17, 2) (22, 10) (22, 3) (22, 8) (20, 9) (20, 23) (20, 27) (20, 19) (8, 0) (8, 10) (8, 22) (8, 15) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 27) (2, 25) (2, 1) (2, 17) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 21) (4, 28) (4, 11) (4, 25) (4, 3) (4, 19) (19, 29) (19, 20) (19, 4) (19, 21) (19, 24) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 24) (27, 1) (27, 10) (27, 20) (27, 16) (21, 12) (21, 15) (21, 19) (24, 19) (24, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {7, 18, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 16, 5, 27}
- Node 2: {25, 17, 1}
- Node 3: {18, 5, 4, 22}
- Node 4: {28, 11, 25, 3, 19}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 24}
- Node 6: {11, 16}
- Node 7: {12, 0, 25}
- Node 8: {0, 10, 22, 15}
- Node 9: {26, 28, 20}
- Node 10: {26, 8, 27, 22}
- Node 11: {6, 4}
- Node 12: {7, 21}
- Node 15: {18, 8, 21}
- Node 16: {1, 6, 27}
- Node 17: {23, 2}
- Node 18: {0, 25, 15, 3}
- Node 19: {29, 20, 4, 21, 24}
- Node 20: {9, 23, 27, 19}
- Node 21: {12, 15, 19}
- Node 22: {10, 3, 8}
- Node 23: {26, 17, 20}
- Node 24: {19, 5}
- Node 25: {7, 4, 18, 2}
- Node 26: {9, 23, 10}
- Node 27: {1, 10, 20, 16}
- Node 28: {9, 29, 4}
- Node 29: {28, 19}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 (3 neighbors)
- Node 1 (4 neighbors)
- Node 2 (3 neighbors)
- Node 3 (4 neighbors)
- Node 4 (5 neighbors)
- Node 5 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 10 (4 neighbors)
- Node 18 (4 neighbors)
- Node 19 (5 neighbors)
- Node 20 (4 neighbors)
- Node 25 (4 neighbors)
- Node 26 (3 neighbors)
- Node 27 (4 neighbors)
- Node 28 (3 neighbors)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <4, (19, 21, 24)>
- <10, (20, 27, 16)>
- <18, (15, 21, 19)>
- <19, (4, 21, 24)>
- <27, (10, 16, 20)>
