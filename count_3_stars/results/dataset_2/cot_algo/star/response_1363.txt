Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 8, 5}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 5}
- Node 2: {3, 9, 8}
- Node 3: {7, 1, 6, 2, 5}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 1, 3, 6, 0}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 9, 5}
- Node 7: {4, 8, 9, 0, 3}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 9, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {7, 6, 8, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \(10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\).

So, the final answer is [40], and the unique 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 0)>
<3, (1, 6, 0)>
<3, (5, 6, 0)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 0)>
<5, (1, 6, 0)>
<5, (3, 6, 0)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 0, 8)>
<7, (4, 9, 0)>
<7, (8, 9, 0)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 2, 7)>
<8, (4, 9, 2)>
<8, (7, 9, 2)>
