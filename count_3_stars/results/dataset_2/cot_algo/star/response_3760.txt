Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 14) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 2) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list format for better visualization:

1: [3, 10, 12, 14]
2: [8, 10, 11, 14]
3: [0, 1, 9, 13]
4: [7, 10, 11]
5: [8, 11]
6: [9, 14]
7: [4, 8, 11, 13, 14]
8: [0, 2, 5, 7, 9]
9: [3, 6, 8, 10]
10: [1, 2, 4, 9, 11, 12]
11: [2, 4, 5, 7, 10]
12: [1, 10, 14]
13: [0, 3, 7]
14: [1, 2, 6, 7, 12, 0]

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes: <1, (3, 10, 14)>

Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes: <4, (7, 10, 11)>

Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes: <7, (4, 11, 13)>, <7, (8, 11, 14)>

Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes: <8, (0, 2, 9)>

Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes: <10, (1, 2, 4)>

Adding these unique 3-stars together, we have a total of 5 3-stars. Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [5].
