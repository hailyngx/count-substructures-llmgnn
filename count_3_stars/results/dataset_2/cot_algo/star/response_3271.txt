Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 17) (9, 25) (9, 13) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 25) (15, 29) (15, 4) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 22) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 7) (18, 21) (10, 0) (10, 26) (10, 6) (10, 16) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 25) (23, 11) (23, 29) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 12) (0, 3) (0, 10) (16, 10) (16, 21) (28, 3) (28, 1) (28, 20) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 29) (24, 3) (24, 27) (19, 22) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 27) (8, 12) (8, 7) (21, 18) (21, 16) (21, 26) (7, 18) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (12, 22) (12, 8) (25, 9) (25, 15) (25, 11) (25, 26) (26, 10) (26, 21) (26, 25) (26, 17) (20, 28) (17, 5) (17, 26) (29, 15) (29, 23) (29, 6) (27, 24) (27, 19) (27, 14) (1, 28) (1, 19) (1, 14) (14, 19) (14, 27) (14, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 7) (4, 15) (4, 11) 

Response:
The first step is to determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 10
Node 1: 14, 19, 28
Node 2: 3, 18, 22
Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 15, 24, 28
Node 4: 3, 11, 15
Node 5: 17, 18
Node 6: 7, 10, 29
Node 7: 6, 8, 11, 13, 18
Node 8: 7, 12
Node 9: 13, 15, 25
Node 10: 0, 6, 16, 26
Node 11: 4, 7, 13, 25
Node 12: 8, 22
Node 13: 7, 9, 11
Node 14: 1, 19, 27
Node 15: 3, 4, 9, 25, 29
Node 16: 10, 21
Node 17: 5, 26
Node 18: 2, 5, 7, 21
Node 19: 1, 14, 22, 27
Node 20: 28
Node 21: 16, 18, 26
Node 22: 2, 12, 19
Node 23: 11, 29
Node 24: 3, 27
Node 25: 9, 11, 15, 26
Node 26: 10, 17, 21, 25
Node 27: 14, 19, 24
Node 28: 1, 3, 20
Node 29: 6, 15, 23

Now, we'll identify the 3-stars in the graph:

No 3-stars are formed using the nodes with fewer than 3 neighbors.

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in the graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (15, 24, 28)>
<3, (2, 4, 15)>
<3, (3, 15, 25)>
<7, (6, 13, 29)>
<11, (4, 7, 13)>
<15, (9, 25, 29)>
<15, (25, 11, 26)>
<18, (5, 7, 21)>
<19, (1, 14, 27)>
<25, (9, 11, 26)>
<26, (10, 17, 21)>
<28, (1, 3, 20)>
