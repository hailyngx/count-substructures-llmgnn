Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 16) (9, 3) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 4) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 2) (7, 0) (7, 18) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 18) (16, 5) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 19) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 12) (11, 0) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 14) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 2) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 2) (14, 13) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 11) (15, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 7, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 14}
- Node 3: {2, 9, 13, 17}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 10}
- Node 5: {4, 16, 17}
- Node 6: {4, 6, 15, 19}
- Node 7: {0, 18}
- Node 8: {1, 14, 18}
- Node 9: {3}
- Node 10: {1, 4, 17, 18}
- Node 11: {0, 12}
- Node 12: {1, 11, 19}
- Node 13: {3, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 8, 13, 19}
- Node 15: {6}
- Node 16: {5}
- Node 17: {3, 5, 10}
- Node 18: {7, 8, 10, 19}
- Node 19: {6, 12, 14, 18}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: can form 4 3-stars
- Node 1: can form 4 3-stars
- Node 2: can form 4 3-stars
- Node 3: can form 4 3-stars
- Node 4: can form 1 3-star
- Node 5: can form 1 3-star
- Node 6: can form 1 3-star
- Node 8: can form 1 3-star
- Node 10: can form 1 3-star
- Node 12: can form 1 3-star
- Node 14: can form 1 3-star
- Node 17: can form 1 3-star
- Node 18: can form 1 3-star
- Node 19: can form 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is the sum of the above, which is 22. Thus, the final answer is [22].

The unique 3-stars identified are:
<0, (1, 8, 10)>
<1, (0, 8, 12)>
<2, (3, 14, 19)>
<3, (2, 13, 17)>
<4, (5, 6, 10)>
<5, (4, 16, 17)>
<6, (4, 15, 19)>
<8, (1, 14, 18)>
<10, (4, 17, 18)>
<12, (1, 11, 19)>
<14, (2, 13, 19)>
<17, (3, 5, 10)>
<18, (7, 8, 19)>
<19, (6, 12, 14)>
