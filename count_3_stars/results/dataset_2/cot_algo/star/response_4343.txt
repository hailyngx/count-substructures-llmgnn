Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 5}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 7}

Next, we identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 9 have 5 or more neighbors.

Now, we apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 54.

Therefore, there are 54 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 9>
