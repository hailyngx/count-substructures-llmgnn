Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 10) (22, 29) (12, 27) (12, 17) (27, 13) (27, 12) (27, 18) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 23) (28, 6) (28, 17) (4, 3) (18, 27) (18, 11) (18, 17) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 24) (14, 0) (14, 23) (14, 15) (14, 16) (5, 23) (5, 1) (5, 21) (5, 16) (26, 15) (26, 7) (7, 26) (7, 15) (7, 24) (25, 1) (25, 29) (25, 15) (8, 20) (9, 16) (11, 18) (11, 23) (11, 17) (11, 2) (23, 6) (23, 14) (23, 5) (23, 11) (23, 21) (10, 13) (10, 22) (10, 6) (10, 0) (21, 5) (21, 23) (21, 24) (20, 8) (20, 3) (20, 19) (29, 22) (29, 25) (29, 3) (17, 12) (17, 28) (17, 18) (17, 11) (1, 5) (1, 25) (3, 4) (3, 20) (3, 29) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 26) (15, 7) (15, 25) (2, 11) (2, 19) (19, 20) (19, 2) (24, 0) (24, 7) (24, 21) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 5) (16, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {10, 14, 15, 24}
- Node 1: {5, 25}
- Node 2: {11, 19}
- Node 3: {4, 20, 29}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {1, 16, 21, 23}
- Node 6: {10, 23, 28}
- Node 7: {15, 24, 26}
- Node 8: {20}
- Node 9: {16}
- Node 10: {0, 13, 22, 6}
- Node 11: {2, 17, 18, 23}
- Node 12: {17, 27}
- Node 13: {10, 16, 22, 27}
- Node 14: {0, 15, 16, 23}
- Node 15: {0, 7, 14, 25, 26}
- Node 16: {5, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 17: {11, 12, 18, 28}
- Node 18: {11, 17, 27}
- Node 19: {2, 20}
- Node 20: {3, 8, 19}
- Node 21: {5, 23, 24}
- Node 22: {10, 13, 29}
- Node 23: {5, 6, 11, 14, 21}
- Node 24: {0, 7, 14, 21}
- Node 25: {1, 15, 29}
- Node 26: {7, 15}
- Node 27: {12, 13, 18}
- Node 28: {6, 17}
- Node 29: {3, 22, 25}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we have \( \binom{n}{3} \) 3-stars, where \( n \) is the number of neighbors.
- Summing these up, we get: \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} \)
- This simplifies to: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 56 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, 10, 14, 15>
- <5, 11, 16, 23>
- <15, 14, 24, 7>
- <15, 24, 21, 7>
- <23, 5, 11, 21>
