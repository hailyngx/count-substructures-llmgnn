Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 13) (14, 17) (14, 15) (14, 10) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 8) (2, 15) (18, 15) (18, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 15) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 16) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 13) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 19) (8, 6) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (16, 1) (16, 19) (3, 12) (3, 10) (6, 8) (6, 11) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 19) (10, 14) (10, 3) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 15) (15, 14) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 4) (15, 11) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {7, 11, 13}
Node 1: {4, 7, 16, 17}
Node 2: {15}
Node 3: {10, 12}
Node 4: {1, 15, 19}
Node 5: {9, 17}
Node 6: {8, 11}
Node 7: {0, 1, 12}
Node 8: {6, 12, 17, 19}
Node 9: {5, 13}
Node 10: {3, 14}
Node 11: {0, 6, 15, 18}
Node 12: {3, 7, 8, 13}
Node 13: {0, 9, 12, 19}
Node 14: {10, 15, 17}
Node 15: {2, 4, 11, 14, 18}
Node 16: {1, 19}
Node 17: {1, 5, 8, 14}
Node 18: {11, 15}
Node 19: {4, 8, 13, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 33 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [33].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (7, 11, 13)>, <1, (4, 16, 17)>, <1, (4, 7, 17)>, <1, (4, 16, 19)>, <1, (7, 16, 17)>, <4, (1, 15, 19)>, <7, (0, 12, 13)>, <8, (12, 17, 19)>, <11, (15, 18, 19)>, <12, (8, 13, 19)>, <13, (0, 12, 19)>, <15, (11, 14, 18)>, <15, (11, 15, 18)>, <17, (1, 14, 17)>, <17, (8, 14, 19)>, <17, (14, 15, 18)>, <17, (14, 15, 19)>, <19, (4, 16, 19)>, <19, (8, 13, 16)>, <19, (8, 16, 17)>
