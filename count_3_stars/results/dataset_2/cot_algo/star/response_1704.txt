Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 9
- Node 4: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0, 5-stars: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1, 3-stars: 1
- Node 2, 5-stars: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3, 3-stars: 1
- Node 4, 4-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5, 5-stars: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6, 4-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7, 5-stars: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8, 3-stars: 1
- Node 9, 3-stars: 1

Total number of 3-stars is 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 42

Therefore, the final answer, to be put inside brackets, is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 7, 9>
<0, 5, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 9, 1>
<1, 3, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 7, 8>
<6, 4, 7, 8>
<7, 0, 6, 8>
