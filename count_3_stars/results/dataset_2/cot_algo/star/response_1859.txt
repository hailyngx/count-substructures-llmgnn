Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 9, 7, 6, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 4, 7, 3, 6, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 1, 8, 6, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 7, 1}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 7, 1}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 0, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 1, 8, 2, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 4, 0, 3, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 3, 1, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 1 have 5 common neighbors: (9, 7, 6, 2, 4)
- Node 0 and Node 2 have 3 common neighbors: (6, 7, 2)
- Node 0 and Node 6 have 4 common neighbors: (5, 8, 2, 6)
- Node 0 and Node 7 have 3 common neighbors: (5, 7, 2)
- Node 1 and Node 6 have 3 common neighbors: (2, 6, 1)
- Node 1 and Node 7 have 4 common neighbors: (2, 7, 6, 4)

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [5]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
