Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 12) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 15) (1, 20) (1, 27) (21, 19) (21, 22) (21, 15) (6, 22) (6, 18) (9, 5) (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 29) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 18) (14, 17) (14, 3) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 4) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 23) (27, 1) (27, 2) (27, 3) (4, 8) (4, 17) (4, 20) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 21) (15, 20) (15, 28) (20, 1) (20, 17) (20, 4) (20, 15) (20, 26) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 27) (3, 25) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 29) (7, 2) (19, 11) (19, 21) (19, 23) (19, 18) (19, 24) (23, 0) (23, 25) (23, 19) (26, 20) (26, 29) (18, 6) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 29) (2, 13) (2, 27) (2, 7) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 24) (28, 15) (29, 5) (29, 25) (29, 26) (29, 18) (10, 12) (10, 22) (24, 19) (24, 12) (22, 16) (22, 21) (22, 6) (22, 10) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {16, 3, 23}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {20, 27}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {13, 27, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 14, 27, 25}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {8, 17, 20}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {9, 8, 29}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {22, 18}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {2}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {5, 13, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {5}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {12, 22}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {16, 19, 12, 15}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {11, 10, 24}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {8, 2, 18}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {17, 3}
- Node 15: Neighbors = {11, 16, 21, 20, 28}
- Node 16: Neighbors = {11, 0, 22, 15}
- Node 17: Neighbors = {14, 20, 4}
- Node 18: Neighbors = {6, 13, 19, 29}
- Node 19: Neighbors = {11, 21, 23, 18, 24}
- Node 20: Neighbors = {1, 17, 4, 15, 26}
- Node 21: Neighbors = {19, 22, 15}
- Node 22: Neighbors = {16, 21, 6, 10}
- Node 23: Neighbors = {25, 0, 19}
- Node 24: Neighbors = {19, 12}
- Node 25: Neighbors = {3, 23, 29}
- Node 26: Neighbors = {20, 29}
- Node 27: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3}
- Node 28: Neighbors = {15}
- Node 29: Neighbors = {5, 25, 26, 18}

Next, we will find the nodes that are part of at least one 3-star:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 27, 29

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 16 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 20 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 22 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 27 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 29 can form 2 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 31
So, the final answer is [31].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 14, 23)>
<15, (11, 16, 21)>
<15, (11, 16, 28)>
<15, (16, 21, 22)>
<15, (16, 21, 26)>
<15, (11, 21, 28)>
<15, (21, 22, 26)>
<15, (11, 28, 21)>
<15, (21, 26, 22)>
<15, (16, 22, 26)>
<16, (0, 22, 6)>
<18, (13, 19, 29)>
<18, (13, 19, 29)>
<18, (13, 29, 18)>
<18, (19, 29, 18)>
<19, (11, 21, 24)>
<19, (11, 24, 12)>
<19, (21, 24, 12)>
<19, (22, 6, 10)>
<19, (18, 6, 29)>
<19, (6, 10, 22)>
<20, (1, 17, 26)>
<22, (6, 10, 16)>
<27, (1, 2, 3)>
<29, (18, 26, 20)>
<29, (18, 26, 20)>
