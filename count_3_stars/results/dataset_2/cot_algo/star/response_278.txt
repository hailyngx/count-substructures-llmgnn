Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 19) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 0) (18, 13) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (15, 17) (15, 7) (13, 17) (13, 18) (13, 19) (16, 7) (16, 3) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 9) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 9) (6, 17) (6, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 9) (4, 17) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 3) (8, 7) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 3) (3, 16) (3, 4) (3, 9) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 6, 18}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 9, 16}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 17, 19}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 17}
- Node 7: Neighbors {8, 11, 15, 16}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 11, 14, 19}
- Node 10: Neighbors {19}
- Node 11: Neighbors {7, 9, 14, 19}
- Node 12: Neighbors {9, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {17, 18, 19}
- Node 14: Neighbors {9, 11, 12}
- Node 15: Neighbors {7, 17}
- Node 16: Neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 17: Neighbors {4, 6, 13, 15}
- Node 18: Neighbors {0, 13}
- Node 19: Neighbors {4, 9, 10, 11, 13}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 47 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [47].

The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 1, 6>
4. <0, 2, 4>
5. <0, 2, 5>
6. <0, 4, 5>
7. <0, 2, 18>
8. <2, 4, 5>
9. <4, 4, 17>
10. <4, 4, 19>
11. <4, 5, 19>
12. <9, 9, 11>
13. <9, 9, 14>
14. <9, 11, 14>
15. <9, 11, 19>
16. <11, 14, 19>
17. <19, 11, 19>
