Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 19) (6, 7) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 2) (13, 5) (13, 15) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 12) (10, 18) (10, 1) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 2) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 4) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 15) (2, 12) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (17, 16) (17, 8) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 16) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 12) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 15) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 17) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's find the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph:

First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 14, 16, 3, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {14, 10, 16, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 11, 15, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 7, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 19, 16}
- Node 5: Neighbors {13, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbor {7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 3, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {11, 7, 17}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 11, 19}
- Node 10: Neighbors {18, 1}
- Node 11: Neighbors {9, 18, 8, 2}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 19, 2, 1}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 15}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 15: Neighbors {13, 18, 2}
- Node 16: Neighbors {0, 17, 1, 4}
- Node 17: Neighbors {16, 8}
- Node 18: Neighbors {10, 11, 15}
- Node 19: Neighbors {9, 4, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars each can form:

- Node 0: Can form 3-stars with 4 out of 5 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: Can form 3-stars with 3 out of 4 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: Can form 3-stars with 4 out of 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: Can form 3-stars with 2 out of 3 neighbors => \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 4: Can form 3-stars with 3 out of 3 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: Can form 3-stars with 3 out of 3 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: Can form 3-stars with 3 out of 3 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: Can form 3-stars with 3 out of 3 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: Can form 3-stars with 3 out of 4 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: Can form 3-stars with 3 out of 4 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: Can form 3-stars with 3 out of 4 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: Can form 3-stars with 3 out of 3 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: Can form 3-stars with 3 out of 3 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the final answer is [17], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 14, 16)>, <0, (9, 16, 3)>, <0, (9, 3, 12)>, <0, (14, 16, 1)>, <2, (3, 11, 15)>, <2, (11, 15, 18)>, <2, (15, 18, 2)>, <2, (11, 18, 10)>, <4, (5, 19, 16)>, <7, (3, 7, 8)>, <8, (11, 7, 8)>, <9, (0, 11, 19)>, <11, (9, 18, 8)>, <12, (0, 19, 2)>, <16, (0, 17, 1)>, <18, (10, 11, 15)>, <19, (9, 4, 12)>
