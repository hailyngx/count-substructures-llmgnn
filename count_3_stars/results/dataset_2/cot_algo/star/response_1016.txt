Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 17) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 1) (25, 21) (20, 29) (20, 18) (8, 23) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 22) (23, 8) (23, 17) (23, 24) (23, 28) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 21) (18, 20) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (15, 8) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 5) (21, 3) (21, 25) (21, 2) (21, 5) (28, 23) (28, 17) (28, 13) (13, 28) (13, 26) (13, 12) (26, 13) (26, 14) (26, 11) (9, 8) (9, 22) (9, 12) (22, 8) (22, 9) (1, 25) (11, 8) (11, 26) (11, 7) (10, 29) (14, 26) (14, 27) (14, 7) (14, 19) (6, 17) (6, 19) (29, 20) (29, 10) (29, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 19) (16, 7) (16, 5) (27, 25) (27, 14) (17, 3) (17, 23) (17, 18) (17, 28) (17, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 7) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 29) (12, 24) (24, 23) (24, 12) (5, 4) (5, 21) (5, 16) (5, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:

1. Node 0: {4, 5}
2. Node 1: {25}
3. Node 2: {18, 19, 21}
4. Node 3: {17, 21, 25}
5. Node 4: {0, 5, 18}
6. Node 5: {0, 4, 16, 21}
7. Node 6: {17, 19}
8. Node 7: {11, 14, 16, 19}
9. Node 8: {9, 11, 15, 22, 23}
10. Node 9: {8, 12, 22}
11. Node 10: {12, 29}
12. Node 11: {7, 8, 26}
13. Node 12: {9, 13, 24, 29}
14. Node 13: {12, 26, 28}
15. Node 14: {7, 19, 26, 27}
16. Node 15: {8}
17. Node 16: {5, 7}
18. Node 17: {3, 6, 18, 23, 28}
19. Node 18: {2, 4, 17, 20}
20. Node 19: {2, 6, 7, 14}
21. Node 20: {18, 29}
22. Node 21: {2, 3, 5, 25}
23. Node 22: {8, 9}
24. Node 23: {8, 17, 24, 28}
25. Node 24: {23, 12}
26. Node 26: {11, 13, 14}
27. Node 27: {14, 25}
28. Node 28: {13, 17, 23}
29. Node 29: {10, 12, 20}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 39 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [39]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, 17, 21, 25>, 
<8, 9, 11, 22>, 
<12, 24, 28, 29>, 
<17, 18, 23, 28>, 
<18, 19, 20, 29>, 
<19, 7, 14, 27>.
