Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (12, 8) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 0) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 0) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {8, 10, 2, 3}
- Node 1: {10, 11, 14, 6}
- Node 2: {9, 8, 14, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 13, 6, 0}
- Node 4: {7, 8}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 13, 8, 14, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 11, 1, 3}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 3, 11}
- Node 8: {5, 4, 13, 2, 0, 12}
- Node 9: {5, 2, 7, 13}
- Node 10: {13, 0, 1}
- Node 11: {7, 1, 6}
- Node 12: {8, 14}
- Node 13: {5, 9, 8, 3, 10}
- Node 14: {5, 1, 2, 12}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Inside the brackets, the total number of 3-stars is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (8, 10, 2)>
2. <1, (10, 11, 6)>
3. <2, (9, 8, 14)>
4. <3, (5, 7, 13)>
5. <5, (9, 6, 13)>
6. <6, (5, 11, 3)>
7. <7, (9, 4, 11)>
8. <8, (5, 13, 2)>
9. <10, (13, 0, 1)>
10. <14, (5, 1, 2)>
