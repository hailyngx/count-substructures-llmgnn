Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 15) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 5) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 13) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 15) (0, 18) (0, 13) (14, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (3, 11) (3, 10) (1, 16) (1, 14) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 13) (13, 18) (13, 0) (13, 9) (13, 17) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (10, 18) (10, 3) (10, 4) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 4) (19, 16) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 18, 13
- Node 1: 16, 14
- Node 2: 18, 8, 5
- Node 3: 11, 10
- Node 4: 12, 10, 5, 6
- Node 5: 2, 8, 4
- Node 6: 8, 4
- Node 7: 11, 12, 15, 8
- Node 8: 2, 7, 5, 6
- Node 9: 15, 13
- Node 10: 18, 3, 4
- Node 11: 3, 7, 18, 17
- Node 12: 7, 4, 15
- Node 13: 18, 0, 9, 17
- Node 14: 1
- Node 15: 16, 7, 12, 9
- Node 16: 1, 15, 19, 17
- Node 17: 11, 16, 13
- Node 18: 11, 2, 10, 0, 13
- Node 19: 16

Now, we can identify the 3-star configurations:
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 18, and 17: <11, (7, 18, 17)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 15, and 17: <16, (1, 15, 17)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have 2 unique configurations, so the final answer is [2].
