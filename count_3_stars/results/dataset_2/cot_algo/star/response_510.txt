Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 14) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 10) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 12) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 11) (18, 9) (18, 17) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 12) (11, 17) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 16) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 15) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 19) 

Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, and the edge list is provided. 

Let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 13, 17}
- Node 2: {10}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 7, 16}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 10, 17}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 10, 13, 19}
- Node 8: {3, 13}
- Node 9: {6, 12, 18}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 7, 16, 19}
- Node 11: {17}
- Node 12: {9, 14, 19}
- Node 13: {1, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 14: {5, 12, 13, 0}
- Node 15: {16}
- Node 16: {4, 10, 15}
- Node 17: {1, 6, 11, 18}
- Node 18: {9, 17}
- Node 19: {7, 10, 12}

Based on the neighbors, the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 14, 17, 9, 12, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 43

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [43], and the unique 3-stars found are:
