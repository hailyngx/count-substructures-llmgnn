Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 14) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 13) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 9) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 6, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 11}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 13}
- Node 9: {3, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 4, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {4, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 9}
- Node 13: {8, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {10, 11, 13}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 74

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [74].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 6, 10)>
- <1, (4, 6, 5)>
- <1, (5, 6, 10)>
- <1, (5, 6, 4)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 6, 10)>
- <4, (5, 6, 10)>
- <10, (4, 11, 13)>
- <10, (11, 13, 14)>
- <11, (7, 9, 13)>
- <11, (9, 13, 14)>
- <13, (10, 11, 14)>
