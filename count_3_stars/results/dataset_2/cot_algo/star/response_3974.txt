Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 12) (11, 17) (16, 21) (16, 17) (16, 3) (1, 21) (1, 26) (21, 16) (21, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (27, 15) (27, 20) (15, 27) (15, 14) (15, 2) (8, 26) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 18) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 6) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 28) (18, 25) (26, 1) (26, 8) (26, 22) (26, 4) (6, 2) (6, 28) (6, 3) (6, 22) (28, 18) (28, 6) (28, 22) (22, 26) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 29) (4, 26) (4, 14) (5, 12) (5, 29) (5, 20) (19, 10) (19, 20) (19, 23) (20, 27) (20, 5) (20, 19) (29, 22) (29, 5) (29, 25) (23, 19) (23, 7) (23, 10) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 23) (7, 14) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 16) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 9) (24, 12) (24, 9) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 24) (9, 17) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 17) (25, 18) (25, 29) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 23) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 7, 9  
Node 1: 21, 26  
Node 2: 6, 15, 18  
Node 3: 6, 9, 14, 16  
Node 4: 14, 26  
Node 5: 12, 20, 29  
Node 6: 2, 3, 22, 28  
Node 7: 0, 8, 14, 23  
Node 8: 7, 26  
Node 9: 0, 3, 17, 24  
Node 10: 13, 19, 23  
Node 11: 12, 17  
Node 12: 5, 11, 17, 24  
Node 13: 10, 18  
Node 14: 3, 7, 14, 15  
Node 15: 2, 14, 20, 27  
Node 16: 3, 17, 21  
Node 17: 9, 11, 12, 16  
Node 18: 2, 13, 25, 28  
Node 19: 10, 20, 23  
Node 20: 5, 15, 19, 27  
Node 21: 1, 16, 26  
Node 22: 6, 26, 28, 29  
Node 23: 7, 10, 19  
Node 24: 9, 12  
Node 25: 18, 29  
Node 26: 1, 4, 8, 21, 22  
Node 27: 15, 20  
Node 28: 6, 18, 22, 25  
Node 29: 5, 22, 25  

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9, Node 10, Node 12, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19, Node 20, Node 22, Node 23, Node 26, Node 28, Node 29  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 2: } \binom{3}{2} = 3 \]
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 3: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 6: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 7: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 9: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 10: } \binom{3}{2} = 3 \]
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 12: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 14: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 15: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 16: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 17: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 18: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 19: } \binom{3}{2} = 3 \]
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 20: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 22: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 23: } \binom{3}{2} = 3 \]
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 26: } \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 28: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 29: } \binom{3}{2} = 3 \]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 10 + 4 + 3 = 67

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [67]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<2, 18, 28>, <3, 14, 15>, <3, 16, 17>, <3, 6, 22>,  
<6, 22, 26>, <7, 14, 15>, <9, 12, 24>, <9, 17, 24>,  
<10, 13, 18>, <10, 19, 23>, <14, 7, 15>, <17, 11, 12>,  
<18, 2, 28>, <18, 25, 29>, <20, 15, 27>, <26, 22, 28>
