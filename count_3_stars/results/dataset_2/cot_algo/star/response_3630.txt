Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <5, 7, 8>
- <7, 8, 9>
