Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 0) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 18) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 18) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 4) (3, 14) (3, 8) (11, 9) (11, 4) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 14) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 19) (18, 6) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 4) (2, 12) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 13) (5, 17) (5, 15) (8, 3) (14, 3) (14, 15) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 0) (13, 9) (13, 0) 

Response:
The central nodes with at least three neighbors are node 6, node 9, node 15, node 17, node 18, and node 19. Let's find the 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

- For node 6: 
  - Neighbors: 9, 15, 18, 19
  - 3-stars: <6, (9, 15, 18)>, <6, (9, 15, 19)>

- For node 9: 
  - Neighbors: 6, 11, 17, 13, 0
  - 3-stars: <9, (6, 11, 17)>, <9, (6, 17, 13)>, <9, (6, 11, 0)>, <9, (11, 17, 13)>, <9, (6, 17, 0)>

- For node 15: 
  - Neighbors: 6, 1, 16, 5, 14
  - 3-stars: <15, (6, 1, 16)>, <15, (6, 1, 5)>, <15, (6, 1, 14)>, <15, (16, 1, 5)>, <15, (1, 5, 14)>

- For node 17: 
  - Neighbors: 9, 10, 1, 5, 18
  - 3-stars: <17, (9, 10, 1)>, <17, (9, 10, 5)>, <17, (9, 1, 5)>, <17, (9, 1, 18)>, <17, (10, 1, 5)>

- For node 18: 
  - Neighbors: 6, 10, 17, 19, 12
  - 3-stars: <18, (6, 10, 17)>, <18, (6, 17, 19)>, <18, (6, 10, 19)>, <18, (10, 17, 19)>

- For node 19: 
  - Neighbors: 6, 16, 18, 4
  - 3-stars: <19, (6, 16, 18)>, <19, (6, 16, 4)>, <19, (6, 18, 4)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us [21].
