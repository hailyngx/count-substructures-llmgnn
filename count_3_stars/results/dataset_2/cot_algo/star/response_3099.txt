Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors (8, 9)
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (1, 8, 9)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 9)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 9)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 6)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (1, 5, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (1, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (0, 2, 6, 7)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 4, 6)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 4, 6, 9 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 7 and 8 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 4 \times 10 + 2 \times 4 = 48 \).

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>
