Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 7}
Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 8}
Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
Node 3: {2, 4, 6}
Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
Node 5: {2, 6, 8}
Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
Node 7: {0, 8}
Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 9: {2, 8}

Now, we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these together, we have a total of 30 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 8, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>
