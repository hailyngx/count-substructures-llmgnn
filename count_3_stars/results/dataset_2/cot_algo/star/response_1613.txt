Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 14) (4, 8) (4, 9) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 8) (17, 13) (17, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 18) (0, 6) (0, 5) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 2) (5, 0) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 10) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 12) (16, 3) (16, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 10) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 10) (12, 13) (12, 18) (18, 8) (18, 11) (18, 12) (10, 19) (10, 1) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges based on the nodes they connect:

- Node 0: (5, 0), (0, 6)
- Node 1: (7, 1), (6, 1), (9, 1), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 16), (10, 1)
- Node 2: (17, 2), (11, 2), (19, 2), (2, 10)
- Node 3: (15, 3), (11, 3), (14, 3), (16, 3)
- Node 4: (9, 4), (8, 4)
- Node 5: (19, 5)
- Node 6: (7, 6), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 0), (6, 13)
- Node 7: (15, 7), (7, 1), (6, 7)
- Node 8: (14, 8), (8, 4), (8, 18)
- Node 9: (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 1)
- Node 10: (19, 10), (1, 10), (2, 10)
- Node 11: (3, 11), (11, 18), (2, 11)
- Node 12: (13, 12), (18, 12)
- Node 13: (17, 13), (6, 13), (13, 17)
- Node 14: (3, 14), (15, 14), (14, 8)
- Node 15: (3, 15), (15, 7), (15, 14)
- Node 16: (3, 16), (1, 16)
- Node 17: (17, 13), (2, 17)
- Node 18: (8, 18), (11, 18), (18, 12), (18, 8)
- Node 19: (5, 19), (19, 2), (19, 10)

Next, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 1: 6, 7, 9, 16, 10
- Node 2: 17, 11, 19, 10
- Node 3: 15, 11, 14, 16
- Node 4: 9, 8
- Node 5: 0, 19
- Node 6: 7, 9, 1, 0, 13
- Node 7: 15, 1, 6
- Node 8: 4, 14, 18
- Node 9: 4, 6, 1
- Node 10: 19, 1, 2
- Node 11: 3, 18, 2
- Node 12: 13, 18
- Node 13: 17, 6, 12
- Node 14: 3, 15, 8
- Node 15: 3, 7, 14
- Node 16: 3, 1
- Node 17: 13, 2
- Node 18: 8, 11, 12
- Node 19: 5, 2, 10

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 6, 7, 9>, <1, 6, 7, 10>, <1, 6, 9, 10>, <1, 7, 9, 10>, <2, 11, 17, 19>, <3, 14, 15, 8>, <8, 14, 15, 3>, <9, 1, 6, 4>, <13, 17, 6, 12>, <1, 10, 19, 2>, <3, 15, 14, 7>, <6, 13, 17, 12>, <1, 16, 3, 6>, <3, 15, 7, 14>, <4, 9, 6, 8>, <18, 11, 12, 8>, <1, 16, 6, 3>, <11, 2, 19, 17>, <1, 6, 13, 3>, <1, 16, 6, 9>, <5, 0, 19, 2>, <5, 19, 10, 2>, <8, 14, 3, 4>, <13, 6, 17, 12>, <14, 3, 8, 15>, <18, 8, 12, 14>, <1, 9, 6, 4>, <1, 10, 2, 19>, <11, 2, 17, 19>, <18, 8, 14, 3>, <19, 2, 10, 1>, <7, 1, 6, 15>, <16, 1, 3, 6>
