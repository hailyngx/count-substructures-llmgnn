Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 25) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 8) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 4) (25, 1) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 18) (25, 24) (8, 3) (8, 9) (13, 25) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 23) (0, 3) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 29) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 7) (4, 20) (4, 10) (4, 29) (4, 17) (18, 25) (18, 21) (18, 29) (19, 26) (19, 22) (19, 2) (19, 24) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 16) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 9) (12, 28) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 23) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 2) (6, 7) (21, 18) (21, 23) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 28) (9, 11) (2, 19) (2, 5) (22, 19) (22, 29) (24, 3) (24, 25) (24, 19) (23, 13) (23, 26) (23, 12) (23, 21) (14, 12) (29, 0) (29, 4) (29, 18) (29, 22) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 9) (17, 4) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 9) (16, 26) (16, 10) (27, 10) (10, 4) (10, 16) (10, 27) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {3, 28, 15, 29}
Node 1: Neighbors {3, 11, 25}
Node 2: Neighbors {5, 19}
Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 24, 8}
Node 4: Neighbors {10, 20, 17, 29}
Node 5: Neighbors {2, 13, 26}
Node 6: Neighbors {7}
Node 7: Neighbors {6, 9, 15}
Node 8: Neighbors {3, 9}
Node 9: Neighbors {8, 11, 7, 28}
Node 10: Neighbors {4, 16, 27}
Node 11: Neighbors {1, 13, 9, 12}
Node 12: Neighbors {28, 14, 11, 23}
Node 13: Neighbors {25, 5, 11, 23}
Node 14: Neighbors {12}
Node 15: Neighbors {0, 20, 7}
Node 16: Neighbors {10, 26}
Node 17: Neighbors {4}
Node 18: Neighbors {29, 25, 21}
Node 19: Neighbors {2, 24, 22, 26}
Node 20: Neighbors {25, 4, 15}
Node 21: Neighbors {18, 23}
Node 22: Neighbors {19, 29}
Node 23: Neighbors {12, 21, 13, 26}
Node 24: Neighbors {3, 25, 19}
Node 25: Neighbors {24, 20, 18, 13, 1}
Node 26: Neighbors {19, 23, 16, 5}
Node 27: Neighbors {10}
Node 28: Neighbors {29, 0, 12, 9}
Node 29: Neighbors {4, 0, 18, 22, 28}

Now, let's calculate how many 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (0, 1, 24)>, <3, (1, 8, 11)>, <3, (1, 13, 25)>, <3, (8, 9, 28)>, <4, (10, 20, 29)>, <5, (2, 13, 26)>, <9, (7, 9, 28)>, <11, (1, 11, 13)>, <13, (11, 13, 25)>, <15, (0, 15, 20)>, <19, (2, 19, 24)>, <23, (12, 21, 23)>, and <25, (13, 25, 26)>.
