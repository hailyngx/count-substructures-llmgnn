Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 19) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 19) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 6) (2, 13) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 7) (4, 9) (4, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 19) (7, 18) (7, 0) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 6) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 14) (16, 12) (3, 5) (3, 12) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 11) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 0) (15, 13) (15, 0) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 20 nodes and 60 edges. 

Let's first identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 10, 15, 19}
- Node 1: {0, 8, 12}
- Node 2: {13, 18}
- Node 3: {5, 12}
- Node 4: {9, 11}
- Node 5: {3, 10, 11}
- Node 6: {10, 11, 13, 17}
- Node 7: {0, 18}
- Node 8: {1, 13}
- Node 9: {4, 10, 14, 19}
- Node 10: {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 11: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 16}
- Node 13: {2, 6, 8, 15}
- Node 14: {9, 16, 17, 19}
- Node 15: {0, 13}
- Node 16: {12, 14}
- Node 17: {6, 14, 19}
- Node 18: {2, 7}
- Node 19: {0, 9, 14, 17}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 2: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: [inom{2}{3}] = [0]
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 7: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 11: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 15: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: [inom{2}{3}] = [0]
- Node 17: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 18: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 19: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 15, 19)>, <1, (0, 12, 15)>, <5, (3, 10, 11)>, <6, (10, 11, 13)>, <9, (10, 14, 19)>, <10, (0, 6, 9)>, <11, (4, 5, 6)>, <14, (9, 17, 19)>, <17, (6, 14, 19)>
