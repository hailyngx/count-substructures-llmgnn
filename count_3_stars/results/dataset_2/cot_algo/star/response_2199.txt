Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 15) (4, 7) (4, 23) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 21) (21, 7) (21, 26) (21, 29) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 27) (25, 13) (25, 18) (25, 14) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 23) (14, 25) (19, 26) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 27) (26, 21) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 2) (9, 11) (9, 22) (22, 9) (22, 24) (22, 20) (22, 29) (6, 10) (6, 20) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 26) (2, 10) (12, 16) (12, 8) (23, 4) (23, 0) (23, 26) (23, 1) (1, 23) (1, 10) (29, 21) (29, 19) (29, 22) (17, 4) (17, 8) (13, 25) (13, 6) (13, 20) (13, 18) (24, 22) (24, 27) (24, 5) (27, 3) (27, 19) (27, 24) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 1) (18, 25) (18, 0) (18, 13) (8, 12) (8, 17) (20, 22) (20, 6) (20, 13) (20, 28) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 28) (5, 24) (5, 15) (5, 28) (28, 20) (28, 15) (28, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {3, 18, 23}
Node 1: {10, 23}
Node 2: {4, 10, 19, 26}
Node 3: {0, 11, 27}
Node 4: {2, 7, 17, 23}
Node 5: {15, 24, 28}
Node 6: {10, 13, 20}
Node 7: {4, 21}
Node 8: {12, 17}
Node 9: {11, 22}
Node 10: {1, 2, 6}
Node 11: {3, 9, 16}
Node 12: {8, 16}
Node 13: {6, 18, 20, 25}
Node 14: {25}
Node 15: {5, 16, 28}
Node 16: {11, 12, 15}
Node 17: {4, 8}
Node 18: {0, 13, 25}
Node 19: {2, 26, 27, 29}
Node 20: {6, 13, 22, 28}
Node 21: {7, 26, 29}
Node 22: {9, 20, 24, 29}
Node 23: {0, 4, 26, 1}
Node 24: {5, 22, 27}
Node 25: {13, 14, 18}
Node 26: {2, 19, 21, 23}
Node 27: {3, 19, 24}
Node 28: {5, 15, 20}
Node 29: {19, 21, 22}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0, Node 3, Node 11: [1]
<0, (3, 23, 18)>

Node 2, Node 4, Node 26: [1]
<2, (4, 26, 19)>

Node 4, Node 7, Node 21: [1]
<4, (7, 21, 17)>

Node 6, Node 10, Node 13: [1]
<6, (10, 13, 20)>

Node 15, Node 28, Node 5: [1]
<15, (28, 5, 24)>

Total number of 3-stars: 5

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
