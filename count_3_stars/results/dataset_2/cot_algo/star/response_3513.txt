Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 14) (22, 8) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 17) (23, 10) (10, 23) (10, 17) (10, 21) (17, 23) (17, 10) (17, 4) (28, 29) (28, 24) (28, 18) (28, 5) (29, 28) (29, 1) (29, 27) (29, 0) (7, 6) (7, 26) (12, 24) (12, 8) (12, 9) (3, 14) (11, 23) (11, 19) (5, 28) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 20) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 4) (8, 22) (8, 12) (8, 18) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 13) (21, 26) (21, 4) (16, 21) (16, 13) (16, 9) (25, 27) (25, 14) (27, 29) (27, 25) (27, 6) (14, 22) (14, 3) (14, 25) (14, 26) (26, 7) (26, 21) (26, 14) (1, 29) (1, 13) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 20) (2, 0) (13, 21) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 24) (6, 7) (6, 27) (6, 15) (4, 23) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 21) (0, 29) (0, 1) (0, 2) (15, 6) (18, 28) (18, 5) (18, 8) (24, 28) (24, 12) (24, 13) (9, 12) (9, 16) (20, 5) (20, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 29}
- Node 1: {0, 13, 29}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 20}
- Node 3: {14}
- Node 4: {17, 19, 21, 23}
- Node 5: {2, 18, 19, 20, 28}
- Node 6: {7, 15, 27}
- Node 7: {6, 26}
- Node 8: {12, 18, 22}
- Node 9: {12, 16}
- Node 10: {17, 21, 23}
- Node 11: {19, 23}
- Node 12: {8, 9, 24}
- Node 13: {1, 16, 21, 24}
- Node 14: {3, 22, 25, 26}
- Node 15: {6}
- Node 16: {9, 13, 21}
- Node 17: {4, 10, 21, 23}
- Node 18: {5, 8, 28}
- Node 19: {4, 5, 11}
- Node 20: {2, 5}
- Node 21: {4, 10, 13, 16, 26}
- Node 22: {8, 14}
- Node 23: {4, 10, 11, 17}
- Node 24: {12, 13, 28}
- Node 25: {14, 27}
- Node 26: {4, 7, 14, 21, 27}
- Node 27: {6, 25, 26, 29}
- Node 28: {5, 18, 24, 29}
- Node 29: {0, 1, 27, 28}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 4, 5, 21, 23, 26, 28, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 46

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

Unique 3-stars found:
<4, (17, 19, 21)>
<5, (2, 18, 28)>
<21, (13, 16, 26)>
<23, (10, 11, 17)>
<26, (7, 14, 21)>
<28, (8, 24, 29)>
<29, (0, 1, 27)>
