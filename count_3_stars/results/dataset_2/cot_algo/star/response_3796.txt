Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 19) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 15) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 1) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 17) (12, 17) (12, 3) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 3) (18, 14) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 3) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 6) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 3) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 6) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 6) (15, 9) (15, 4)
