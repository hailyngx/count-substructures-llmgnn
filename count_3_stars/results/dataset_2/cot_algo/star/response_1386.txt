Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 13) (15, 16) (15, 13) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (18, 16) (18, 17) (16, 15) (16, 18) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 17) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (19, 7) (19, 0) (9, 0) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 1) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 9) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 18) (17, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {1, 5, 9, 19}
Node 1: {0, 13, 14}
Node 2: {7, 8, 11, 12}
Node 3: {6, 13}
Node 4: {7, 12, 13, 17}
Node 5: {0, 12, 14}
Node 6: {3, 8, 13}
Node 7: {2, 4, 8, 19}
Node 8: {2, 6, 7}
Node 9: {0}
Node 10: {11, 14}
Node 11: {2, 10}
Node 12: {2, 4, 5, 17}
Node 13: {1, 3, 4, 6, 15}
Node 14: {1, 5, 10}
Node 15: {13, 16, 17}
Node 16: {15, 18}
Node 17: {4, 12, 15, 18}
Node 18: {16, 17}
Node 19: {0, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 12, 13, 15, 17

For each of these nodes, let's calculate how many 3-stars can be formed:
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 27

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27].

Unique 3-stars found:

<2, (7, 8, 11)>
<4, (7, 12, 17)>
<5, (0, 12, 14)>
<7, (2, 4, 19)>
<12, (2, 5, 17)>
<13, (1, 4, 6, 15)>
<15, (13, 16, 17)>
<17, (4, 12, 18)>
