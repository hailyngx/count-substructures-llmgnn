Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {6, 2, 7}
Node 1 neighbors: {6, 4}
Node 2 neighbors: {9, 3, 0, 8, 7, 4}
Node 3 neighbors: {2, 8, 4}
Node 4 neighbors: {5, 6, 1, 3, 2}
Node 5 neighbors: {9, 6, 4, 7}
Node 6 neighbors: {5, 1, 4, 0}
Node 7 neighbors: {5, 9, 0, 2, 8}
Node 8 neighbors: {9, 3, 2, 7}
Node 9 neighbors: {5, 8, 2, 7}

Now, we will apply the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula to nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 52 3-stars in the given graph, which we put inside brackets as [52]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 1)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>
