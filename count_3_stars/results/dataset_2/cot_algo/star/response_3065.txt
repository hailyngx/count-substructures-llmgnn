Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 8, and 22.
Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 5, and 24.
Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 28, 29, and 23.
Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors 17, 19, and 25.
Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors 11, 16, and 24.
Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 26, and 28.
Node 13 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 15, and 29.
Node 15 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 13, and 22.
Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 10, and 23.
Node 18 forms a 3-star with neighbors 14, 19, and 27.
Node 19 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 18, and 23.
Node 22 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 15, and 27.
Node 23 forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 16, and 19.
Node 27 forms a 3-star with neighbors 18, 22, and 26.
Node 29 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 13, and 6.

Total number of unique 3-stars: 15
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
