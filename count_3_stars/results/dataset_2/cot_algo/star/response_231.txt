Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 14) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighborhood sets for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 2, 10}
- Node 1: {3, 14, 13, 4, 12, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 11, 0}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 10}
- Node 4: {1, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {9, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 2, 11}
- Node 7: {3, 8, 12, 11, 10}
- Node 8: {1, 13, 2, 0, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {9, 3, 7, 4, 0, 14}
- Node 11: {6, 7, 2, 4, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 13, 7}
- Node 13: {9, 1, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 13, 10, 11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 0: [1]
Node 1: [5]
Node 2: [1]
Node 3: [1]
Node 4: [1]
Node 5: [0]
Node 6: [1]
Node 7: [2]
Node 8: [2]
Node 9: [1]
Node 10: [3]
Node 11: [2]
Node 12: [1]
Node 13: [3]
Node 14: [2]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 25.

Therefore, the final result is [25], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 2, 10)>, <1, (3, 14, 13, 4, 12, 8)>, <2, (6, 8, 11, 0)>, <3, (1, 7, 10)>, <4, (1, 10, 11)>, <6, (5, 2, 11)>, <7, (3, 8, 12, 11, 10)>, <8, (1, 13, 2, 0, 7)>, <9, (5, 10, 13)>, <10, (9, 3, 7, 4, 0, 14)>, <11, (6, 7, 2, 4, 14)>, <12, (1, 13, 7)>, <13, (9, 1, 8, 12, 14)>, <14, (1, 13, 10, 11)>.
