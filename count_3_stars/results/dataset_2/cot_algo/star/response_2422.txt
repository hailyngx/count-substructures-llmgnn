Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (0, 9) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 5}
- Node 1: {8, 6, 2}
- Node 2: {9, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {6, 4, 7, 5, 2}
- Node 4: {9, 8, 5, 3}
- Node 5: {6, 4, 8, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 1, 7, 3}
- Node 7: {6, 9, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 7, 5, 1}
- Node 9: {8, 4, 7, 0, 2}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:
Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 8, 9

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the final answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
