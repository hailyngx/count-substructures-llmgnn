Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: Inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: Inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 8: Inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
