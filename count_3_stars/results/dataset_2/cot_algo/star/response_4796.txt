Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 3) (4, 29) (4, 2) (7, 24) (7, 19) (18, 23) (18, 0) (22, 10) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 24) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 26) (3, 5) (20, 13) (20, 28) (25, 27) (25, 28) (25, 11) (10, 22) (10, 12) (10, 16) (17, 9) (17, 24) (17, 8) (15, 26) (15, 0) (15, 16) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 23) (2, 13) (8, 17) (8, 2) (26, 3) (26, 15) (21, 28) (21, 29) (28, 20) (28, 25) (28, 21) (28, 12) (5, 3) (5, 13) (13, 20) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 23) (27, 25) (27, 6) (11, 1) (11, 25) (11, 9) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 15) (16, 24) (16, 23) (24, 7) (24, 1) (24, 17) (24, 16) (29, 4) (29, 21) (29, 6) (23, 18) (23, 2) (23, 13) (23, 16) (23, 9) (6, 27) (6, 29) (0, 18) (0, 15) (0, 19) (9, 17) (9, 11) (9, 23) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 28) (12, 9) (12, 19) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 0) (19, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first determine the set of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {18, 15, 19}
- Node 1: {11, 16, 24}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 13, 23}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 19, 26}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 29}
- Node 5: {3, 13}
- Node 6: {27, 29}
- Node 7: {19, 24}
- Node 8: {2, 17}
- Node 9: {11, 12, 17, 23}
- Node 10: {12, 16, 22}
- Node 11: {1, 9, 25}
- Node 12: {10, 19, 28, 9}
- Node 13: {2, 5, 19, 20, 23}
- Node 15: {0, 16, 26}
- Node 16: {1, 10, 15, 23, 24}
- Node 17: {8, 9, 24}
- Node 18: {0, 23}
- Node 19: {3, 7, 12, 13, 0}
- Node 20: {13, 28}
- Node 21: {28, 29}
- Node 22: {10}
- Node 23: {2, 9, 13, 16, 18}
- Node 24: {1, 7, 16, 17, 19}
- Node 25: {11, 28, 27}
- Node 26: {3, 15}
- Node 27: {25, 6}
- Node 28: {12, 20, 21, 25}
- Node 29: {4, 21, 6}

Now, we'll identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 29} 
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 5, 19} 
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 7, 12} 

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [3]. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are: <4, 2, 3, 29>, <13, 2, 5, 19>, and <19, 3, 7, 12>.
