Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 4) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 14) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 17) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 19) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 17) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 11) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 17) (3, 2) (3, 13) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 17) (5, 10) (8, 0) (8, 15) (17, 18) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 16) (1, 9) (10, 2) (10, 5) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can first find the neighbor set for each node. 

- Node 0: {8}
- Node 1: {9, 16}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 10}
- Node 3: {2, 13}
- Node 4: {9, 11, 14, 18}
- Node 5: {10, 12, 17, 18}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 13}
- Node 7: {6, 13, 16, 19}
- Node 8: {0, 15}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 5}
- Node 11: {4, 17, 19}
- Node 12: {5, 19}
- Node 13: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 14: {4, 9, 18}
- Node 15: {8, 17, 19}
- Node 16: {1, 7, 17, 18}
- Node 17: {5, 11, 15, 16}
- Node 18: {4, 5, 14, 16, 17}
- Node 19: {7, 11, 12, 15}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors. 
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: This forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    <4, (9, 14, 18)>, <4, (11, 14, 18)>, <4, (9, 11, 14)>, <4, (9, 18, 14)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: This forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    <5, (10, 12, 17)>, <5, (10, 17, 18)>, <5, (12, 17, 18)>, <5, (10, 12, 18)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: This forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    <7, (6, 13, 16)>, <7, (13, 16, 19)>, <7, (6, 16, 19)>, <7, (6, 13, 19)>
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: This forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    <16, (1, 7, 17)>, <16, (1, 17, 18)>, <16, (7, 17, 18)>, <16, (1, 7, 18)>
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors: This forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    <17, (5, 11, 15)>, <17, (5, 15, 16)>, <17, (5, 11, 16)>, <17, (11, 15, 16)>, <17, (5, 11, 16)>, <17, (5, 11, 17)>, <17, (5, 15, 17)>, <17, (5, 16, 17)>, <17, (11, 15, 17)>, <17, (11, 16, 17)>
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors: This forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    <18, (4, 5, 14)>, <18, (4, 14, 16)>, <18, (4, 5, 16)>, <18, (4, 5, 17)>, <18, (4, 14, 17)>, <18, (5, 14, 16)>, <18, (5, 14, 17)>, <18, (5, 16, 17)>, <18, (14, 16, 17)>, <18, (5, 14, 17)>
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: This forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    <19, (11, 12, 15)>, <19, (11, 15, 17)>, <19, (11, 15, 19)>, <19, (12, 15, 17)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of 40 3-stars in this graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [40].
