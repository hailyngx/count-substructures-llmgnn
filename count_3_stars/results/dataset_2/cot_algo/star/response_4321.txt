Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 15) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 19) (14, 19) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 15) (18, 1) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 17) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 7) (17, 0) (17, 19) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 16) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 13) (8, 3) (8, 15) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 2) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 17, 12, 19
- Node 1: 6, 18, 7
- Node 2: 13, 12, 16
- Node 3: 11, 8
- Node 4: 12, 5, 15
- Node 5: 10, 4, 19, 15
- Node 6: 9, 1, 10, 16, 12
- Node 7: 9, 1, 13
- Node 8: 3, 15
- Node 9: 6, 16, 7
- Node 10: 6, 11, 5
- Node 11: 3, 10, 15
- Node 12: 6, 0, 4, 2
- Node 13: 16, 2, 7
- Node 14: 19
- Node 15: 11, 4, 5, 8
- Node 16: 6, 9, 13, 2
- Node 17: 0, 19
- Node 18: 1
- Node 19: 0, 5, 14, 17

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 4 neighbors
- Node 16: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 0 3-stars (as they need at least 3 neighbors to form a 3-star).
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each of these nodes.
- For node 6 (with 5 neighbors): \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
The total number of 3-stars is \( 4*3 + 10 = 22 \), which we should put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <6, 1, 10>
- <6, 1, 16>
- <6, 1, 12>
- <6, 10, 16>
- <6, 10, 12>
- <1, 10, 16>
- <4, 5, 15>
- <4, 5, 19>
- <4, 15, 19>
- <5, 15, 19>
- <12, 4, 2>
- <12, 4, 16>
- <12, 2, 16>
- <16, 4, 2>
- <16, 4, 13>
- <16, 2, 13>
- <19, 5, 14>
- <19, 5, 17>
- <19, 15, 5>
- <19, 15, 17>
- <19, 5, 17>
- <19, 15, 17>
All of these are inside <> and listed only once.
