Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 2) (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 4) (5, 3) (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 13) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 15) (14, 19) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 19) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 1) (12, 17) (12, 19) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 10) (18, 16) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 10) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 8) (6, 11) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 12) 

Response:
The graph described has the following 3-stars:

1. Node 11: <11, (4, 6, 13)>, <11, (4, 7, 11)>, <11, (6, 7, 11)>, <11, (11, 13, 16)>, <11, (13, 16, 17)>
2. Node 16: <16, (2, 11, 17)>, <16, (2, 16, 18)>, <16, (11, 16, 17)>, <16, (16, 17, 18)>
3. Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 3, 5)>
4. Node 15: <15, (4, 14, 19)>
5. Node 13: <13, (9, 13, 17)>, <13, (10, 13, 19)>, <13, (11, 13, 17)>, <13, (13, 17, 19)>, <13, (13, 17, 19)>
6. Node 17: <17, (12, 13, 19)>

Total number of 3-stars: [12]
