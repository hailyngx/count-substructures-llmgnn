Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we first need to find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {8, 11, 10, 12}
- Node 1: neighbors {13, 4, 2 12}
- Node 2: neighbors {8, 13, 4, 5, 1}
- Node 3: neighbors {13, 11, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors {9, 1, 6, 2}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 11, 10, 14}
- Node 6: neighbors {13, 4, 14, 12}
- Node 7: neighbors {8, 3, 14}
- Node 8: neighbors {13, 2, 0, 12, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {4, 10, 14, 12}
- Node 10: neighbors {5, 0, 9}
- Node 11: neighbors {5, 3, 0}
- Node 12: neighbors {8, 6, 0, 1, 9}
- Node 13: neighbors {8, 2, 3, 1, 6}
- Node 14: neighbors {5, 6, 7, 9}

Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, and 13 have 3 or more neighbors, so they are potential centers for 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

- Node 0: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 60. Thus, the final number of 3-stars is [60].

The unique 3-stars formed are:
- <0, 8, 11, 12>
- <1, 13, 2, 12>
- <2, 4, 5, 6>
- <2, 8, 12, 13>
- <2, 8, 12, 7>
- <4, 6, 9, 14>
- <5, 9, 10, 14>
- <5, 11, 0, 10>
- <8, 12, 0, 7>
- <9, 12, 14, 6>
- <9, 12, 14, 5>
- <9, 14, 5, 6>
- <12, 8, 0, 7>
- <12, 8, 7, 6>
- <13, 1, 6, 4>
