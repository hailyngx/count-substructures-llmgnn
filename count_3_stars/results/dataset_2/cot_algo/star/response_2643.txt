Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 12}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 13, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 4, 11, 10}
- Node 10: Neighbors {3, 6, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 11: Neighbors {9, 10, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {7, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 11}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: No 3-stars formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 94

Therefore, the final answer is [94], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 14>
<1, 4, 12>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 8, 14>
<3, 9, 10>
<4, 8, 14>
<6, 8, 14>
<6, 10, 14>
<8, 10, 11>
<10, 11, 14>
<10, 12, 14>
<12, 1, 13>
<12, 4, 13>
<12, 5, 13>
<12, 3, 13>
<14, 6, 7>
