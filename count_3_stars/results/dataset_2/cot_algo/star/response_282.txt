Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 7}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20 + 10 + 10] = [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
