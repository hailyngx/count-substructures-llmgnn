Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 19) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 12) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 8) (15, 9) (15, 1) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 10) (19, 16) (19, 7) (19, 0) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (12, 3) (12, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 11) (5, 4) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (18, 12) (18, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 18) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 10, 16, 19}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 13, 15, 17}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 11}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 7, 11, 13, 14, 19}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 10, 17}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 15}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 4, 8}
- Node 11: Neighbors {5, 7, 16}
- Node 12: Neighbors {3, 18}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 7, 18}
- Node 14: Neighbors {2, 6, 7}
- Node 15: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 16: Neighbors {0, 11, 17, 19}
- Node 17: Neighbors {1, 8, 16}
- Node 18: Neighbors {12, 13}
- Node 19: Neighbors {0, 7, 16}

Now we will count the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 1: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 6: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 7: 3-stars = inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 8: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 16: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 17: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 18: 3-stars = inom{2}{3} = 0

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [39]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 4, 10> 
<1, 3, 13> 
<1, 3, 15> 
<1, 13, 18> 
<4, 7, 14> 
<6, 8, 17> 
<7, 11, 16> 
<7, 13, 18> 
<7, 14, 19>
