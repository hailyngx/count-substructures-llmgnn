Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 10) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 19) (8, 4) (13, 16) (13, 6) (4, 8) (4, 11) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 19) (12, 9) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 15) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 15) (5, 1) (5, 17) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 15) (19, 3) (19, 0) (19, 12) (17, 0) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 5) (17, 9) (9, 12) (9, 17) (9, 14) (15, 12) (15, 16) (15, 2) (15, 11) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 6) (14, 1) (14, 9) (18, 11) (18, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {7, 17, 19}
- Node 1: {5, 10, 14}
- Node 2: {7, 15, 17}
- Node 3: {6, 10, 19}
- Node 4: {8, 11}
- Node 5: {1, 17}
- Node 6: {3, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 2}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {12, 14, 17}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 6, 18}
- Node 11: {4, 15, 18}
- Node 12: {6, 9, 15, 16, 19}
- Node 13: {6, 16}
- Node 14: {1, 9}
- Node 15: {2, 11, 12, 16}
- Node 16: {12, 13, 15, 17}
- Node 17: {0, 2, 5, 9, 16}
- Node 18: {10, 11}
- Node 19: {0, 3, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 37

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [37].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (7, 17, 19)>, <1, (5, 10, 14)>, <2, (7, 15, 17)>, <3, (6, 10, 19)>, <9, (12, 14, 17)>, <10, (1, 3, 6)>, <12, (6, 9, 15)>, <15, (2, 11, 16)>, <16, (12, 13, 15)>, <17, (5, 9, 16)>
