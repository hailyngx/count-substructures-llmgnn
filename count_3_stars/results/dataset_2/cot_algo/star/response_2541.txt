Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (15, 18) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 19) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 18) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 19) (16, 0) (16, 5) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 2) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 13) (18, 15) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 8) (19, 12) (19, 0) (19, 2) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 8) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 13) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 13) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 18) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 16, 19}
- Node 1: {9, 11, 14, 18}
- Node 2: {4, 13, 19}
- Node 3: {17}
- Node 4: {2, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 14, 16}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 17}
- Node 7: {6, 14}
- Node 8: {6, 10, 12, 18}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 13, 17, 18}
- Node 10: {8, 17}
- Node 11: {1, 13, 18}
- Node 12: {4, 8, 19}
- Node 13: {2, 9, 11}
- Node 14: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 15: {18}
- Node 16: {0, 5}
- Node 17: {3, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 18: {1, 8, 9, 11, 15}
- Node 19: {0, 2, 12}

From the neighbors, we can see that the nodes that have three or more neighbors are: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19}

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Only 1 3-star)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 9, 11>, <1, 9, 14>, <1, 9, 18>, <1, 11, 18>, <2, 4, 9>, <5, 0, 16>, <7, 6, 17>, <8, 6, 17>, <8, 12, 18>, <8, 18, 19>, <9, 13, 11>, <9, 13, 2>, <9, 18, 15>, <9, 18, 11>, <9, 18, 1>, <17, 6, 7>, <17, 6, 8>, <17, 10, 8>, <17, 9, 1>, <17, 9, 4>, <17, 9, 18>
