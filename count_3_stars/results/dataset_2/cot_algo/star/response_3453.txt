Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 10) (27, 7) (1, 7) (21, 15) (21, 16) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 26) (8, 22) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 28) (13, 14) (20, 15) (20, 22) (4, 23) (4, 5) (4, 29) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 25) (11, 28) (11, 22) (11, 17) (28, 13) (28, 11) (28, 24) (29, 4) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 0) (9, 29) (9, 14) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 26) (10, 7) (0, 29) (0, 16) (0, 3) (16, 21) (16, 0) (16, 24) (16, 14) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 24) (17, 22) (25, 18) (26, 8) (26, 29) (26, 10) (26, 2) (6, 17) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 23) (23, 4) (23, 5) (23, 3) (3, 0) (3, 23) (24, 28) (24, 16) (24, 17) (2, 13) (2, 26) (2, 19) (19, 2) (19, 7) (12, 14) (7, 27) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 19) (22, 8) (22, 20) (22, 11) (22, 17) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 16) (14, 12) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 30 nodes and 90 edges. To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine the neighbor sets for each node.

Node 1 neighbors: {7}
Node 2 neighbors: {13, 26}
Node 3 neighbors: {0, 23}
Node 4 neighbors: {5, 23, 29}
Node 5 neighbors: {4, 18, 23}
Node 6 neighbors: {17}
Node 7 neighbors: {1, 10, 19, 27}
Node 8 neighbors: {10, 13, 15, 18, 21, 22, 26}
Node 9 neighbors: {14, 29}
Node 10 neighbors: {7, 8, 15, 26, 27}
Node 11 neighbors: {17, 22, 28}
Node 12 neighbors: {14}
Node 13 neighbors: {2, 8, 14, 28}
Node 14 neighbors: {9, 12, 13, 16}
Node 15 neighbors: {8, 10, 20, 21, 27}
Node 16 neighbors: {0, 14, 21, 24}
Node 17 neighbors: {6, 11, 22, 24}
Node 18 neighbors: {5, 8, 25}
Node 19 neighbors: {2, 7}
Node 20 neighbors: {15, 22}
Node 21 neighbors: {8, 15, 16}
Node 22 neighbors: {8, 11, 17, 20}
Node 23 neighbors: {3, 4, 5}
Node 24 neighbors: {16, 17, 28}
Node 25 neighbors: {18}
Node 26 neighbors: {2, 8, 10, 29}
Node 27 neighbors: {7, 10, 15}
Node 28 neighbors: {11, 13, 24}
Node 29 neighbors: {0, 4, 9, 26}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 8 forms inom{7}{3} = 35 3-stars
- Node 10 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 15 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 22 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 23 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 26 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 27 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 28 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 35 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 66

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [66].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<8, 10, 27>, <8, 13, 28>, <8, 15, 21>, <8, 15, 27>, <10, 15, 27>, <14, 16, 24>, <4, 5, 23>, <23, 3, 4>, <22, 17, 24>.
