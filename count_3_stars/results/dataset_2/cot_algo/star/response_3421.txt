Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 29) (13, 10) (22, 29) (5, 25) (5, 4) (5, 28) (9, 20) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 24) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 21) (15, 11) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 0) (1, 27) (1, 7) (8, 23) (8, 29) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 21) (23, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 26) (18, 6) (18, 24) (18, 12) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 29) (20, 9) (20, 15) (20, 17) (20, 7) (7, 1) (7, 20) (7, 11) (12, 18) (12, 14) (19, 25) (19, 14) (19, 24) (17, 20) (17, 4) (21, 3) (21, 15) (21, 23) (21, 14) (16, 13) (16, 24) (11, 15) (11, 7) (24, 3) (24, 18) (24, 19) (24, 16) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 6) (28, 5) (28, 10) (0, 15) (0, 1) (29, 13) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 26) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 21) (14, 27) (27, 1) (27, 14) (27, 6) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 25) (6, 27) (4, 5) (4, 23) (4, 17) (10, 13) (10, 23) (10, 28) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 15}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 7, 26, 27}
- Node 2: {6, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 15, 21, 24}
- Node 4: {5, 17, 23}
- Node 5: {4, 25, 28}
- Node 6: {2, 25, 27}
- Node 7: {1, 11, 20}
- Node 8: {10, 23, 29}
- Node 9: {15, 20}
- Node 10: {8, 13, 23, 28}
- Node 11: {7, 15}
- Node 12: {14, 18}
- Node 13: {10, 16, 29}
- Node 14: {2, 12, 19, 21, 27}
- Node 15: {0, 3, 9, 11, 20, 21}
- Node 16: {13, 24}
- Node 17: {4, 20}
- Node 18: {6, 12, 24, 26}
- Node 19: {14, 24, 25}
- Node 20: {7, 9, 15, 17}
- Node 21: {3, 14, 15, 23}
- Node 22: {29}
- Node 23: {4, 8, 10, 21, 29}
- Node 24: {3, 16, 18, 19}
- Node 25: {5, 6, 19}
- Node 26: {1, 18, 29}
- Node 27: {1, 6, 14}
- Node 28: {5, 10}
- Node 29: {8, 13, 22, 26}

Node 1, 3, 14, 15, 20, 24, and 29 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with these nodes.

Now, calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- \( inom{5}{3} \) for Node 1 = 10
- \( inom{4}{3} \) for Node 3 = 4
- \( inom{5}{3} \) for Node 14 = 10
- \( inom{6}{3} \) for Node 15 = 20
- \( inom{4}{3} \) for Node 20 = 4
- \( inom{4}{3} \) for Node 24 = 4
- \( inom{4}{3} \) for Node 29 = 4

Adding these up gives a total of 56 3-stars: [56]

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 7, 26)>
- <1, (3, 7, 27)>
- <1, (3, 26, 27)>
- <1, (7, 26, 27)>
- <3, (15, 21, 24)>
- <14, (6, 19, 27)>
- <15, (9, 11, 20)>
- <15, (11, 20, 21)>
- <15, (20, 21, 23)>
- <20, (7, 17, 21)>
- <24, (16, 18, 19)>
- <24, (18, 19, 25)>
- <24, (19, 25, 26)>
- <24, (19, 25, 27)>
- <29, (13, 26, 29)>
