Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 20) (9, 16) (9, 23) (1, 3) (1, 29) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 0) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 25) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 28) (12, 29) (19, 29) (19, 25) (19, 24) (26, 13) (26, 20) (13, 26) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 15) (17, 20) (17, 23) (17, 8) (20, 9) (20, 26) (20, 17) (20, 28) (16, 9) (16, 28) (16, 29) (28, 3) (28, 12) (28, 20) (28, 16) (28, 23) (5, 23) (5, 27) (29, 1) (29, 12) (29, 19) (29, 16) (29, 21) (0, 3) (0, 22) (23, 9) (23, 17) (23, 28) (23, 5) (11, 13) (11, 15) (15, 7) (15, 13) (15, 11) (15, 24) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 21) (21, 29) (21, 4) (21, 22) (27, 5) (27, 8) (24, 19) (24, 15) (24, 10) (10, 24) (25, 18) (25, 19) (25, 8) (8, 17) (8, 27) (8, 25) (8, 22) (22, 0) (22, 21) (22, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: Neighbors {3, 22}
Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 12, 29}
Node 2: Neighbors {18}
Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 28}
Node 4: Neighbors {1, 9, 13, 21}
Node 5: Neighbors {23, 27}
Node 6: Neighbors {7, 12}
Node 7: Neighbors {6, 12, 15}
Node 8: Neighbors {17, 22, 25, 27}
Node 9: Neighbors {1, 16, 20, 23}
Node 10: Neighbors {24}
Node 11: Neighbors {13, 15}
Node 12: Neighbors {1, 6, 7, 28, 29}
Node 13: Neighbors {4, 11, 15, 26}
Node 15: Neighbors {7, 11, 13, 24}
Node 16: Neighbors {9, 20, 28, 29}
Node 17: Neighbors {8, 20, 23}
Node 18: Neighbors {2, 25}
Node 19: Neighbors {25, 24, 29}
Node 20: Neighbors {9, 16, 17, 26, 28}
Node 21: Neighbors {4, 22, 29}
Node 22: Neighbors {0, 8, 21}
Node 23: Neighbors {5, 9, 17, 28}
Node 24: Neighbors {10, 15, 19}
Node 25: Neighbors {8, 18, 19}
Node 26: Neighbors {13, 20}
Node 27: Neighbors {5, 8}
Node 28: Neighbors {3, 12, 16, 20, 23}
Node 29: Neighbors {1, 12, 16, 19, 21}

Now, we'll identify the 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 12, 29}
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 13, 21}
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {17, 25, 27}
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {16, 20, 23}
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 7, 29}
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with neighbors {11, 13, 24}
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 20, 29}
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with neighbors {16, 28, 29}
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 22, 29}
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with neighbors {8, 21, 29}
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with neighbors {17, 28, 5}
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with neighbors {15, 19, 10}

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are 11 in total. Therefore, the final number to put inside brackets is [11].
