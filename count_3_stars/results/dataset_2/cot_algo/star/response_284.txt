Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 13) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 5) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 7) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 1) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {9, 8, 14, 3, 13}
Node 1: {10, 12, 7}
Node 2: {8, 12, 5, 7}
Node 3: {11, 0, 14}
Node 4: {9, 8, 5}
Node 5: {11, 4, 2, 13}
Node 6: {7, 11, 12, 13}
Node 7: {6, 10, 2, 14, 1}
Node 8: {9, 4, 2, 0, 12}
Node 9: {4, 11, 10, 0}
Node 10: {9, 11, 7, 1}
Node 11: {6, 9, 10, 3, 13, 5}
Node 12: {6, 8, 2, 1}
Node 13: {6, 11, 0, 5}
Node 14: {0, 3, 7}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and determine the number of 3-stars formed with each node:

Node 0: 5 neighbors, so [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 2: 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 4: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star
Node 5: 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 7: 5 neighbors, so [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 8: 5 neighbors, so [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 9: 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 10: 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 11: 6 neighbors, so [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
Node 12: 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 13: 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 14: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 72
Therefore, the final answer is [72], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 8, 9, 14>, <0, 8, 9, 3>, <0, 8, 14, 3>, <0, 9, 10, 11>, <0, 9, 11, 13>, <0, 9, 13, 5>, <2, 5, 7, 14>, <2, 5, 11, 13>, <2, 5, 13, 6>, <2, 7, 10, 1>, <2, 7, 10, 11>, <2, 7, 11, 6>, <4, 5, 11, 13>, <4, 5, 13, 6>, <4, 8, 9, 11>, <4, 8, 11, 13>, <5, 11, 13, 6>, <6, 7, 10, 11>, <7, 10, 1, 12>, <9, 10, 11, 13>, <10, 11, 3, 14>, <12, 1, 10, 7>
