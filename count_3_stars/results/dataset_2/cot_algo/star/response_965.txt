Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 5) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 2) (13, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 12) (1, 16) (1, 14) (17, 6) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 14) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 6) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 15) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 6) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 3) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (15, 14) (15, 5) (10, 19) (10, 6) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 15) 

Response:
First, let's construct a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 12, 18}
- Node 1: {14, 16}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 19}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 19}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 15, 16}
- Node 6: {3, 10, 12, 17, 19}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 11, 16}
- Node 9: {7, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {6, 19}
- Node 11: {8, 9, 16}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 14}
- Node 13: {9}
- Node 14: {1, 12, 15, 18}
- Node 15: {5, 14}
- Node 16: {1, 5, 8, 11}
- Node 17: {6}
- Node 18: {0, 14, 19}
- Node 19: {3, 4, 6, 10, 18}

Now, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 19 have three or more neighbors.

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get:

\[ 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 52 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 2, 12>
- <0, 2, 18>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 3, 19>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <5, 7, 15>
- <5, 14, 15>
- <6, 10, 19>
- <6, 12, 14>
- <11, 8, 16>
- <14, 1, 16>
- <14, 12, 15>
- <16, 5, 15>
- <19, 4, 6>
