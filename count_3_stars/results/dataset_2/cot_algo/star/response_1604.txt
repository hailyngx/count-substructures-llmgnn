Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 2) (26, 9) (26, 22) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 17) (21, 7) (21, 16) (21, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 24) (10, 29) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 29) (22, 26) (22, 23) (22, 6) (23, 11) (23, 22) (0, 21) (0, 8) (0, 13) (20, 4) (20, 6) (15, 2) (15, 13) (12, 7) (12, 28) (12, 14) (12, 19) (19, 11) (19, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 15) (2, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 13) (8, 25) (28, 3) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 6) (28, 16) (13, 0) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 6) (6, 22) (6, 20) (6, 28) (6, 13) (6, 27) (16, 21) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 27) (14, 12) (14, 5) (17, 7) (25, 8) (25, 29) (4, 10) (4, 20) (4, 24) (18, 16) (27, 6) (27, 16) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 29) (24, 10) (24, 4) (29, 10) (29, 11) (29, 25) (29, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {21, 8, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 2, 10}
- Node 2: {1, 9, 15, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 28, 5}
- Node 4: {10, 20, 24}
- Node 5: {3, 14, 29}
- Node 6: {22, 28, 13, 20, 27}
- Node 7: {21, 12, 17}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 13, 25}
- Node 9: {26, 2}
- Node 10: {1, 11, 4, 24, 29}
- Node 11: {10, 28, 23, 19, 29}
- Node 12: {7, 28, 14, 19}
- Node 13: {0, 15, 8, 6}
- Node 14: {12, 5}
- Node 15: {2, 13}
- Node 16: {21, 28, 18, 27}
- Node 17: {7}
- Node 18: {16}
- Node 19: {11, 12}
- Node 20: {4, 6}
- Node 21: {7, 16, 0}
- Node 22: {26, 23, 6}
- Node 23: {11, 22}
- Node 24: {10, 4}
- Node 25: {8, 29}
- Node 26: {9, 22}
- Node 27: {6, 16}
- Node 28: {3, 12, 6, 16}
- Node 29: {10, 11, 25, 5}

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each such node:

- Node 0, 2, 8, 10, 11, 13, 16, 21, 28, 29 have 4 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
\<0, (8, 13, 21)>, \<2, (1, 15, 8)>, \<2, (9, 8, 15)>, \<2, (9, 8, 2)>, <2, (1, 15, 2)>, \<8, (0, 25, 13)>, \<8, (2, 25, 13)>, \<8, (2, 15, 13)>, \<8, (2, 15, 8)>, \<10, (1, 4, 24)>, \<10, (1, 29, 24)>, \<10, (1, 4, 29)>, \<10, (11, 4, 29)>, \<10, (11, 19, 29)>, \<10, (11, 24, 29)>, \<10, (11, 4, 24)>, \<10, (11, 19, 24)>, \<11, (10, 23, 29)>, \<13, (0, 6, 15)>, \<13, (0, 8, 6)>, \<13, (2, 6, 15)>, \<13, (2, 8, 6)>, \<16, (27, 21, 28)>, \<16, (27, 18, 28)>, \<16, (27, 6, 28)>, \<16, (27, 21, 18)>, \<28, (12, 16, 6)>, \<28, (12, 16, 21)>, \<28, (12, 16, 27)>, \<28, (12, 6, 21)>, \<28, (12, 21, 27)>, \<29, (5, 25, 10)>, \<29, (5, 25, 11)>, \<29, (5, 25, 29)>, \<29, (5, 10, 11)>
