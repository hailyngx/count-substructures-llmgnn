Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
