Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 5, 9, 10, 13, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 17: inom{3}{2} = 3 3-stars
- Node 18: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 21: 1 3-star
- Node 23: 3 3-stars
- Node 24: 5 3-stars
- Node 25: 1 3-star
- Node 26: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 3 3-stars
- Node 28: 1 3-star
- Node 29: 3 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 10 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
