Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 5, 4, 2, 7, 3
- Node 1: 5, 6, 2
- Node 2: 4, 1, 3, 0
- Node 3: 5, 6, 4, 8, 2, 0
- Node 4: 9, 8, 2, 0, 3
- Node 5: 9, 1, 0, 3
- Node 6: 9, 1, 3
- Node 7: 9, 8, 0
- Node 8: 4, 8, 7, 3
- Node 9: 5, 6, 4, 7

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 3, and 4 have more than three neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed around these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 2, 7)>
<0, (4, 2, 3)>
<0, (4, 7, 3)>
<0, (2, 7, 3)>
<0, (5, 4, 3)>
<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<3, (5, 4, 8)>
<3, (5, 2, 0)>
<3, (6, 4, 8)>
<3, (6, 2, 0)>
<4, (9, 8, 7)>
<4, (9, 2, 0)>
<7, (9, 8, 6)>
<7, (9, 2, 0)>
<8, (4, 2, 3)>
<8, (4, 7, 3)>
<8, (4, 0, 3)>
<8, (8, 7, 0)>
<8, (2, 7, 3)>
<8, (2, 0, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 1, 2)>
<9, (6, 1, 3)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
