Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Next, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 8 have 4 or more neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 32

Therefore, the final answer is [32] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>
