Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 12) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 4) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (7, 12) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 12) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 4) (9, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 2) (13, 1) (13, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 8, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {8, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 6, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 11}
- Node 7: {12}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 9, 12}
- Node 9: {4, 8, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {2, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {4, 6}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 9}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 5, 10}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0 and Node 12 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars each.
Node 1 and Node 4 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form 5C3 = 10 3-stars each.
Node 3 and Node 5 have 6 neighbors each, so they can form 6C3 = 20 3-stars each.
Node 8 and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars each.
Node 10 and Node 14 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars each.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 76

Therefore, the final answer is [76].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 12>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 3, 14>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 4, 14>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 12>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 14>, <4, 6, 11>, <8, 9, 12>, <8, 9, 13>, <8, 9, 4>, <9, 10, 12>, <9, 10, 14>, <9, 10, 13>
