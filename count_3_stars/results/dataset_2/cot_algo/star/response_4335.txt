Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 24) (0, 23) (27, 17) (3, 2) (3, 19) (25, 9) (25, 15) (23, 0) (23, 14) (23, 16) (10, 21) (10, 16) (10, 29) (11, 14) (11, 24) (11, 26) (7, 13) (7, 21) (7, 6) (7, 9) (21, 10) (21, 7) (21, 16) (21, 8) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 17) (15, 25) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 28) (20, 15) (20, 17) (20, 4) (26, 11) (26, 28) (26, 4) (28, 15) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 1) (17, 27) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 20) (5, 24) (5, 14) (19, 3) (19, 29) (16, 23) (16, 10) (16, 21) (16, 18) (16, 28) (9, 25) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 1) (29, 10) (29, 19) (4, 20) (4, 26) (4, 12) (12, 13) (12, 4) (1, 2) (1, 28) (1, 9) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 24) (14, 23) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 5) (24, 0) (24, 11) (24, 5) (24, 6) (8, 21) (8, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 neighbors: 13, 23, 24
- Node 1 neighbors: 2, 8, 9, 28
- Node 2 neighbors: 1, 3, 18
- Node 3 neighbors: 2, 19
- Node 4 neighbors: 12, 20, 26
- Node 5 neighbors: 14, 24
- Node 6 neighbors: 7, 24
- Node 7 neighbors: 6, 9, 13, 21
- Node 8 neighbors: 1, 21
- Node 9 neighbors: 1, 7, 15, 25
- Node 10 neighbors: 16, 21, 29
- Node 11 neighbors: 14, 24, 26
- Node 12 neighbors: 4, 13
- Node 13 neighbors: 0, 7, 12
- Node 14 neighbors: 5, 11, 18, 23
- Node 15 neighbors: 9, 17, 20, 25, 28
- Node 16 neighbors: 10, 18, 21, 23, 28
- Node 17 neighbors: 15, 18, 20, 27
- Node 18 neighbors: 2, 14, 16, 17
- Node 19 neighbors: 3, 29
- Node 20 neighbors: 4, 15, 17
- Node 21 neighbors: 7, 8, 10, 16
- Node 23 neighbors: 0, 14, 16
- Node 24 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 11
- Node 25 neighbors: 9, 15
- Node 26 neighbors: 4, 11, 28
- Node 27 neighbors: 17
- Node 28 neighbors: 1, 15, 16, 26
- Node 29 neighbors: 10, 19

Now, let's check which nodes can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 7, 21, 9, 15, and 16 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 15: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 16: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 21: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 13, 23, 24>
- <7, 13, 21, 1>
- <9, 1, 25, 15>
- <15, 25, 17, 20>
- <16, 28, 1, 9>
- <21, 7, 16, 10>
