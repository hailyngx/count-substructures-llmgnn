Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 18) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (17, 5) (17, 3) (17, 4) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 15) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 2) (16, 0) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 4) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 4) (6, 18) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 0) (14, 8) (14, 10) (9, 12) (9, 1) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 11, 5, 16, 2, 15
- Node 1: 10, 5, 9
- Node 2: 10, 11, 5, 0
- Node 3: 7, 17, 4
- Node 4: 17, 15, 3
- Node 5: 13, 2, 1, 17, 0
- Node 6: 18
- Node 7: 8, 12, 3
- Node 8: 19, 14, 7
- Node 9: 12, 1
- Node 10: 12, 1, 14, 2
- Node 11: 19, 0, 2
- Node 12: 10, 7, 9
- Node 13: 5, 18
- Node 14: 8, 10
- Node 15: 19, 0, 4
- Node 16: 0
- Node 17: 5, 3, 4
- Node 18: 13, 19, 6
- Node 19: 8, 11, 18, 15

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 5, 10, 12, and 19 have 5 or more neighbors, so we need to count the number of 3-stars from these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 39 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [39], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (11, 5, 16)>
<0, (11, 5, 2)>
<0, (11, 5, 15)>
<0, (5, 2, 15)>
<0, (5, 16, 15)>
<2, (10, 1, 5)>
<2, (10, 1, 0)>
<2, (10, 5, 0)>
<2, (11, 1, 5)>
<2, (11, 1, 0)>
<2, (11, 5, 0)>
<5, (13, 2, 17)>
<5, (13, 1, 0)>
<5, (13, 1, 17)>
<5, (13, 0, 17)>
<5, (2, 1, 0)>
<5, (2, 1, 17)>
<5, (2, 0, 17)>
<5, (1, 0, 17)>
<10, (12, 1, 9)>
<12, (10, 1, 9)>
<19, (11, 18, 15)>
<19, (11, 18, 0)>
<19, (11, 15, 0)>
<19, (18, 15, 0)>
