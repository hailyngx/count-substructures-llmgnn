Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 14) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 18) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 17) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 15) (8, 19) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 16) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 12) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 15) (18, 5) (18, 14) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 9) (16, 14) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 12) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 16) (0, 11) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

1. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9, and 14: <4, (7, 9, 14)>
2. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 3, and 14: <7, (4, 3, 14)>
3. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 3, and 0: <11, (10, 3, 0)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 19, and 18: <5, (13, 19, 18)>
5. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 17, and 2: <13, (5, 17, 2)>
6. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 11, and 17: <3, (7, 11, 17)>
7. Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 15: <19, (5, 8, 15)>
8. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 19, 9, and 1: <8, (19, 9, 1)>
9. Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 3, and 12: <17, (13, 3, 12)>
10. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 17, and 15: <12, (4, 17, 15)>
11. Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 14, and 16: <18, (5, 14, 16)>
12. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 6, and 2: <1, (8, 6, 2)>
13. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 10: <6, (1, 2, 10)>
14. Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 10, and 14: <16, (7, 10, 14)>

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in the given graph. Since there are 14 unique 3-stars identified, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
