Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 10) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 5) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 18) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 10) (2, 11) (2, 19) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 15) (0, 9) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 5) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 15) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 6) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 4) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 15) 

Response:
The central nodes that have at least 3 neighbors are nodes 4, 11, 13, 16, 17, and 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 11, 16, 8, 10. Therefore, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 16, 3, 9, 4, 2. Therefore, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 8, 19, 9, 18. Therefore, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 11, 4, 10. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 9, 19, 5. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 17, 13, 2, 5. Therefore, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from the central nodes, we get a total of 20 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (11, 16, 8)>
<4, (11, 16, 10)>
<4, (11, 8, 10)>
<11, (16, 4, 10)>
<13, (8, 19, 9)>
<19, (17, 13, 2)>
<19, (17, 13, 5)>
<19, (17, 2, 5)>
<19, (13, 2, 5)>
