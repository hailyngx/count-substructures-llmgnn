Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 3, 4, 2, 8
- Node 1: 5, 6, 3, 2
- Node 2: 5, 9, 1, 0
- Node 3: 9, 1, 0
- Node 4: 6, 7, 0
- Node 5: 9, 2, 8, 1, 7
- Node 6: 1, 7, 4, 8, 0
- Node 7: 5, 6, 4, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7, 0
- Node 9: 5, 2, 3

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8
For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 46
So, the final answer is [46].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
