Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}

Now, we can see that nodes 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 have 5 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding them up, we get the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 48, which we represent as [48].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>
