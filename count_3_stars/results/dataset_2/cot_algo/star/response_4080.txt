Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 4) (13, 1) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {5, 9, 11, 12}
Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 13}
Node 2: {1, 8, 10, 12}
Node 3: {4, 8}
Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 6, 14}
Node 5: {0, 4, 7, 12}
Node 6: {1, 4, 7, 12, 13}
Node 7: {5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 14}
Node 8: {1, 2, 3}
Node 9: {0, 1, 7, 14}
Node 10: {7, 11, 14}
Node 11: {0, 7, 10}
Node 12: {0, 2, 5, 6}
Node 13: {1, 6}
Node 14: {4, 7, 9, 10}

Now, nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, and 14 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 80

So, the final answer is [80].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 12, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 7, 12)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 10)>
<9, (0, 1, 14)>
<12, (0, 2, 5)>
<14, (4, 7, 10)>
