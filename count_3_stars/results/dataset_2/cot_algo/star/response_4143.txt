Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 13) (15, 2) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 8) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 10) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 1) (7, 13) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 17) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 13) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 19) (14, 18) (14, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 10) (10, 18) (10, 1) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 6) (19, 12) (19, 17) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 7, 10}
- Node 2: {8, 15, 18}
- Node 3: {0, 13, 18}
- Node 4: {9, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {1, 9, 18}
- Node 6: {8, 13, 14, 17}
- Node 7: {1, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 6, 11}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 11}
- Node 10: {1, 18}
- Node 11: {8, 9, 12, 17}
- Node 12: {4, 11, 19}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 6, 7, 15}
- Node 14: {6, 18}
- Node 15: {2, 13}
- Node 17: {6, 11, 19}
- Node 18: {2, 3, 5, 10, 14}
- Node 19: {12, 17}

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1: {0, 5, 7, 10} -> \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 3: {0, 13, 18} -> \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 4: {9, 12, 13} -> \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 6: {8, 13, 14, 17} -> \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 8: {0, 2, 6, 11} -> \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 11: {8, 9, 12, 17} -> \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 13: {3, 4, 6, 7, 15} -> \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 18: {2, 3, 5, 10, 14} -> \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <3, (0, 13, 18)>
- <4, (9, 12, 13)>
- <6, (8, 13, 14)>
- <8, (0, 2, 6)>
- <11, (8, 9, 12)>
- <13, (3, 6, 15)>
- <18, (2, 5, 10)>
