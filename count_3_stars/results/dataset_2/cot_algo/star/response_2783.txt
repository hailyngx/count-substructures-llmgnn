Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 17) (9, 5) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 0) (18, 6) (18, 17) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 8) (12, 15) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 17) (8, 7) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 15) (13, 10) (13, 6) (15, 12) (15, 13) (15, 11) (16, 1) (16, 2) (16, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 15) (11, 19) (11, 17) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 11) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 0) (17, 11) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 2, 8, 17, 6            
Node 1: 3, 16, 19              
Node 2: 16, 11, 0               
Node 3: 1, 10, 4                
Node 4: 3, 8, 10, 6, 17         
Node 5: 9, 17                  
Node 6: 18, 4, 13, 0            
Node 7: 16, 19, 8              
Node 8: 7, 4, 11, 0            
Node 9: 5                    
Node 10: 3, 4, 13              
Node 11: 2, 8, 15, 19, 17        
Node 12: 15                  
Node 13: 15, 10, 6              
Node 15: 12, 13, 11            
Node 16: 1, 2, 7               
Node 17: 5, 18, 4, 0, 11         
Node 18: 6                    
Node 19: 1, 7, 11               

Next, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 0, and 17
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 0, and 17

Total number of 3-stars = 2

Therefore, the final result is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <4, (8, 0, 17)> and <11, (8, 0, 17)>.
