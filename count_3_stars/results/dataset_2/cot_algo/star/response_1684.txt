Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 7) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 11) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 12) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 10, 1}
- Node 1: {6, 0, 9, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 10, 8, 1}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {8, 10, 11, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 13, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 1, 3, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {12, 0, 14, 13}
- Node 8: {4, 10, 2}
- Node 9: {5, 11, 10, 1, 12}
- Node 10: {9, 4, 0, 8, 2}
- Node 11: {9, 4, 3, 13}
- Node 12: {9, 7, 6, 3}
- Node 13: {5, 7, 6, 11}
- Node 14: {7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars formed
- Node 1: Only has 4 neighbors
- Node 2: Only has 3 neighbors
- Node 3: Only has 4 neighbors
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars formed
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars formed
- Node 6: Only has 5 neighbors
- Node 7: Only has 4 neighbors
- Node 8: Only has 3 neighbors
- Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars formed
- Node 10: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars formed
- Node 11: Only has 4 neighbors
- Node 12: Only has 4 neighbors
- Node 13: Only has 4 neighbors
- Node 14: Only has 1 neighbor

Total 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 7, 10)>, <0, (4, 7, 1)>, <0, (4, 10, 1)>, <0, (7, 10, 1)>, 
<5, (9, 13, 2)>, <5, (9, 13, 3)>, <5, (9, 2, 3)>, <5, (13, 2, 3)>, <9, (5, 2, 3)>, 
<9, (5, 10, 12)>, <9, (5, 1, 12)>, <9, (10, 1, 12)>, <5, (6, 13, 2)>, <5, (6, 13, 3)>, <5, (6, 2, 3)>, <5, (13, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 3, 12)>, 
<9, (10, 4, 8)>, <9, (10, 4, 11)>, <9, (10, 8, 11)>, <10, (4, 8, 11)>
