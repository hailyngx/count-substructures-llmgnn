Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (3, 1) (3, 4) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 12) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 19) (8, 5) (8, 15) (13, 17) (13, 0) (6, 7) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 19) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 9) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 9) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 5) (14, 19) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 15) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (12, 18) (12, 14) (12, 15) (9, 7) (9, 16) (9, 11) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 12) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 13, 11, 19
- Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 11
- Node 2 has neighbors: 17, 18, 5, 4
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 4
- Node 4 has neighbors: 3, 2, 19
- Node 5 has neighbors: 10, 2, 8, 11
- Node 6 has neighbors: 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 17, 6, 16, 9
- Node 8 has neighbors: 5, 15
- Node 9 has neighbors: 7, 16, 11
- Node 10 has neighbors: 17, 5
- Node 11 has neighbors: 1, 0, 14, 9, 5
- Node 12 has neighbors: 18, 14, 15
- Node 13 has neighbors: 17, 0
- Node 14 has neighbors: 19, 11, 12, 15
- Node 15 has neighbors: 8, 14, 12
- Node 16 has neighbors: 18, 7, 9
- Node 17 has neighbors: 10, 13, 2, 7
- Node 18 has neighbors: 2, 16, 12
- Node 19 has neighbors: 4, 0, 14

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 17, 18, and 5: <2, (17, 18, 5)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 2, and 19: <4, (3, 2, 19)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 10, 2, and 8: <5, (10, 2, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors 17, 6, and 9: <7, (17, 6, 9)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 0, and 14: <11, (1, 0, 14)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors 19, 11, and 12: <14, (19, 11, 12)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with neighbors 8, 14, and 12: <15, (8, 14, 12)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors 18, 7, and 9: <16, (18, 7, 9)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with neighbors 10, 13, and 2: <17, (10, 13, 2)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with neighbors 16, 7, and 12: <18, (16, 7, 12)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 0, and 14: <19, (4, 0, 14)>

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars, so the final answer is [10].
