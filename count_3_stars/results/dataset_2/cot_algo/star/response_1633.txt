Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 12) (2, 17) (2, 7) (18, 0) (18, 17) (18, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 3) (12, 7) (8, 18) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 15) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 19) (11, 15) (15, 13) (15, 11) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 6) (0, 18) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (6, 8) (6, 17) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 16) (14, 4) (14, 16) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 14) (16, 9) (16, 3) (16, 19) (16, 14) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's find the 3-stars in the graph.

First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 4, 10, 18
- Node 1: Neighbors are 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 7, 17
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 11, 12, 16
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 1, 14
- Node 5: Neighbors are 7, 9, 13
- Node 6: Neighbors are 8, 17
- Node 7: Neighbors are 2, 5, 10, 12, 19
- Node 8: Neighbors are 6, 18
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 5, 16
- Node 10: Neighbors are 0, 7
- Node 11: Neighbors are 3, 13, 15, 19
- Node 12: Neighbors are 3, 7
- Node 13: Neighbors are 5, 11, 15, 17
- Node 14: Neighbors are 4, 16
- Node 15: Neighbors are 11, 13
- Node 16: Neighbors are 3, 9, 14, 19
- Node 17: Neighbors are 2, 6, 13, 18
- Node 18: Neighbors are 0, 8, 17
- Node 19: Neighbors are 7, 11, 16

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 3, 7, 13, and 16 have 4 or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22 \).

Therefore, the final answer, placed inside brackets, is [22].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (1, 11, 15)>
<7, (2, 5, 10)>
<13, (5, 11, 15)>
<16, (3, 9, 14)>
