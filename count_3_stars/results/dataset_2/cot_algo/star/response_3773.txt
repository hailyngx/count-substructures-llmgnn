Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 0, 1, 5}
- Node 3: {9, 8, 7, 5}
- Node 4: {6, 2, 1}
- Node 5: {8, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 4, 0, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 8, 0, 3}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {6, 1, 3, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 5: 0 (has only 3 neighbors)
Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 9: 0 (has only 4 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
