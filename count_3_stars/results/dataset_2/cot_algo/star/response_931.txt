Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we need to determine the number of 3-stars formed in the graph.

First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 4, 6, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {9, 2}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 0, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 8, 1}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 4, 7, 1}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 2}
- Node 8: {5, 0, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 3, 0}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 0) + 10 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 2) + 10 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 5) + 10 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 8) + 10 (from node 9) = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <0, 4, 9>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <5, 6, 9>
