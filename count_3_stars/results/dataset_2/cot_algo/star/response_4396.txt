Response:
This graph has a total of 30 nodes and 90 edges. 

Let's first find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 7, 15, 16}
- Node 1: {2, 16, 17, 23}
- Node 2: {1, 12, 23}
- Node 3: {13, 20, 24, 28}
- Node 4: {8, 12, 22, 25, 29}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {9, 20}
- Node 7: {0, 29}
- Node 8: {4, 14, 26}
- Node 9: {6, 19}
- Node 10: {19, 20, 24, 29}
- Node 11: {15, 17, 22, 26}
- Node 12: {2, 4}
- Node 13: {3, 25, 26}
- Node 14: {8, 24, 27}
- Node 15: {0, 11, 28}
- Node 16: {0, 1, 23}
- Node 17: {1, 11}
- Node 18: {27}
- Node 19: {9, 10, 28}
- Node 20: {6, 10, 20}
- Node 21: {25, 26}
- Node 22: {4, 11}
- Node 23: {1, 16, 24}
- Node 24: {10, 14, 23}
- Node 25: {4, 13, 21, 27}
- Node 26: {8, 11, 13, 21}
- Node 27: {14, 18, 25}
- Node 28: {3, 15, 19}
- Node 29: {4, 7, 10}

Since all nodes have at least 3 neighbors, we can count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 1: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 4: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 8: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 9: 2 choose 3 = 0
- Node 10: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 11: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 14: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 15: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 16: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 19: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 20: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 23: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 24: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 25: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 26: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 27: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 28: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 29: 3 choose 3 = 1

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 15, 28>
- <1, 16, 23>
- <4, 14, 27>
- <4, 25, 29>
- <4, 10, 24>
- <8, 11, 26>
