Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 8}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 4, 7, and 8 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <8, (3, 4, 6)>
