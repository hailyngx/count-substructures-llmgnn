Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
The graph described has the following connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 9, 8, and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 9, 8, and 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 3, 5, and 1.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 2, and 1.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 9, 5, 1, 2, and 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 0, 3, and 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 6, 3, and 1.

Now let's check for any 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<1, (4, 6, 5)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (6, 5, 9)>, <1, (6, 5, 2)>, <1, (6, 5, 4)>, <1, (6, 9, 7)>, <1, (6, 9, 1)>, <1, (6, 8, 4)>

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms no 3-stars.

Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
<4, (7, 6, 5)>, <4, (7, 6, 1)>, <4, (7, 6, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 6)>, <4, (7, 9, 1)>, <4, (6, 5, 1)>, <4, (6, 5, 2)>, <4, (6, 5, 1)>, <4, (6, 9, 7)>, <4, (6, 9, 1)>

Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms no 3-stars.

Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
<6, (7, 9, 1)>, <6, (7, 9, 4)>, <6, (7, 9, 1)>, <6, (7, 1, 4)>, <6, (7, 1, 5)>, <6, (7, 1, 9)>, <6, (7, 1, 8)>, <6, (9, 1, 4)>, <6, (9, 1, 5)>, <6, (9, 1, 8)>, <6, (9, 1, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 2)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 2)>, <6, (1, 5, 4)>, <6, (1, 5, 2)>, <6, (1, 5, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>

Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms no 3-stars.

Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms no 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 40.
