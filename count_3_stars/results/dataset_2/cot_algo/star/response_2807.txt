Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 10) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {9, 4, 3, 10}
Node 1: {5, 9, 3, 13, 8}
Node 2: {7, 8, 13}
Node 3: {5, 1, 11, 0, 8}
Node 4: {9, 7, 0, 14}
Node 5: {6, 1, 3, 7}
Node 6: {5, 8, 14, 13}
Node 7: {5, 4, 12, 10, 2, 13}
Node 8: {1, 3, 2, 14, 6}
Node 9: {4, 1, 0, 12}
Node 10: {7, 11, 0}
Node 11: {3, 10, 12}
Node 12: {9, 7, 11}
Node 13: {7, 1, 2, 6}
Node 14: {4, 8, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 7: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 64. 

Therefore, the final answer is [64]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (4, 9, 12)>, <1, (5, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 14)>, <5, (6, 7, 1)>, <6, (5, 8, 14)>, <7, (2, 10, 13)>, <8, (1, 3, 14)>, <9, (0, 4, 12)>, <13, (1, 2, 6)>.
