Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 12) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 1) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 11, 12}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 8, 10}
- Node 6: {0, 9, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 9, 13}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {6, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 11: {1, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 14: {3, 6, 11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \text{{inom}}{n}{3} \) for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: [\( \text{{inom}}{3}{3} = 1 \)]
- For Node 1: [\( \text{{inom}}{4}{3} = 4 \)]
- For Node 3: [\( \text{{inom}}{5}{3} = 10 \)]
- For Node 5: [\( \text{{inom}}{5}{3} = 10 \)]
- For Node 6: [\( \text{{inom}}{5}{3} = 10 \)]
- For Node 8: [\( \text{{inom}}{5}{3} = 10 \)]
- For Node 11: [\( \text{{inom}}{4}{3} = 4 \)]
- For Node 13: [\( \text{{inom}}{5}{3} = 10 \)]
- For Node 14: [\( \text{{inom}}{3}{3} = 1 \)]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 50 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (5, 6, 3)>
- <1, (11, 5, 8)>
- <3, (4, 13, 8)>
- <5, (0, 10, 1)>
- <6, (14, 0, 13)>
- <8, (4, 11, 12)>
- <11, (9, 14, 1)>
- <13, (3, 8, 7)>
- <14, (3, 11, 6)>
