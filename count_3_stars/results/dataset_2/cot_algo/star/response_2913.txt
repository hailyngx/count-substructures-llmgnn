Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 18) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (20, 25) (20, 3) (20, 18) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 12) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 15) (17, 8) (17, 22) (29, 15) (29, 14) (21, 4) (21, 24) (28, 0) (28, 24) (26, 24) (26, 27) (24, 21) (24, 28) (24, 26) (2, 22) (2, 12) (22, 17) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 27) (12, 8) (12, 25) (12, 2) (12, 15) (12, 3) (23, 10) (23, 5) (23, 3) (4, 21) (4, 22) (4, 19) (1, 5) (1, 18) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 0) (3, 13) (3, 20) (3, 12) (3, 23) (3, 14) (14, 29) (14, 3) (14, 18) (0, 28) (0, 19) (15, 6) (15, 29) (15, 12) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 27) (27, 26) (27, 22) (27, 9) (27, 16) (18, 11) (18, 20) (18, 1) (18, 14) (16, 20) (16, 9) (16, 27) (7, 8) (7, 9) 

Response:
Based on the given edge list, we can construct the following graph:

```
Graph: 
0 -- 19 -- 11
|    |     |
28  4 -- 21
     |    |
     22 -- 2 -- 12 -- 3 -- 13
     |    |    |
     27   17 -- 8
          |    |
          16 -- 20 -- 25
          |    |
          9 -- 15
              |
              29 -- 14
```

In this graph, we can identify the following 3-stars: 

1. <3, (20, 12, 13)>
2. <8, (17, 12, 3)>
3. <12, (2, 17, 3)>
4. <15, (9, 16, 29)>
5. <19, (11, 4, 0)>
6. <20, (16, 25, 3)>
7. <21, (4, 24, 27)>
8. <22, (17, 2, 27)>
9. <23, (10, 5, 3)>
10. <24, (21, 26, 28)>

As for the nodes that have more than three neighbors, the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) yields the following 3-stars:

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars found:
10 unique 3-stars + 16 3-stars from nodes with more than 3 neighbors = 26 total 3-stars

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].
