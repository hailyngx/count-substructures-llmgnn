This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 24) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 28) (17, 19) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 22) (11, 9) (11, 12) (12, 11) (12, 27) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 16) (27, 23) (2, 9) (2, 25) (18, 5) (18, 20) (18, 8) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 28) (6, 1) (28, 17) (28, 6) (28, 1) (28, 13) (28, 5) (13, 28) (26, 15) (26, 20) (26, 29) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 23) (21, 3) (21, 16) (21, 25) (21, 29) (8, 18) (8, 9) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (16, 14) (16, 27) (16, 21) (24, 14) (24, 23) (24, 20) (19, 17) (19, 22) (19, 15) (22, 11) (22, 19) (22, 4) (22, 15) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 29) (1, 4) (4, 22) (4, 1) (4, 15) (29, 26) (29, 21) (29, 1) (29, 25) (15, 26) (15, 19) (15, 22) (15, 4) (15, 23) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 24) (23, 27) (23, 3) (23, 24) (23, 15) (5, 18) (5, 28) (25, 2) (25, 21) (25, 29) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we will count the number of unique 3-stars formed by each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 56 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56].
