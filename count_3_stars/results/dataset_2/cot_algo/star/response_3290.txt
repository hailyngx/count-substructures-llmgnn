Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (27, 4) (27, 13) (27, 16) (14, 10) (17, 28) (17, 15) (17, 26) (22, 23) (22, 7) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 15) (6, 13) (6, 20) (28, 17) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 19) (26, 17) (26, 23) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 20) (7, 22) (7, 3) (7, 20) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 25) (4, 0) (4, 27) (4, 16) (4, 25) (4, 2) (10, 14) (10, 21) (10, 13) (21, 22) (21, 10) (21, 29) (8, 19) (8, 11) (19, 28) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 24) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 5) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 12) (11, 29) (29, 21) (29, 11) (29, 16) (29, 12) (1, 24) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 24) (20, 6) (20, 26) (20, 7) (20, 24) (9, 28) (9, 2) (9, 12) (25, 18) (25, 4) (15, 17) (15, 23) (16, 27) (16, 4) (16, 3) (16, 29) (5, 18) (5, 3) (12, 11) (12, 29) (12, 9) (24, 19) (24, 1) (24, 2) (24, 20) (13, 27) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:

Node 0: {4}
Node 1: {24}
Node 2: {4, 9, 24}
Node 3: {5, 7, 16}
Node 4: {0, 2, 16, 25, 27}
Node 5: {3, 18}
Node 6: {13, 20}
Node 7: {3, 20, 22}
Node 8: {11, 19}
Node 9: {2, 12, 28}
Node 10: {13, 14, 21}
Node 11: {8, 12, 19, 29}
Node 12: {9, 11, 29}
Node 13: {6, 10, 27}
Node 14: {10}
Node 15: {17, 23}
Node 16: {3, 4, 27, 29}
Node 17: {15, 26, 28}
Node 18: {5, 25, 26}
Node 19: {8, 11, 24, 28}
Node 20: {6, 7, 24, 26}
Node 21: {10, 22, 29}
Node 22: {7, 21, 23}
Node 23: {15, 22, 26}
Node 24: {1, 2, 19, 20}
Node 25: {4, 18}
Node 26: {17, 18, 20, 23, 28}
Node 27: {4, 13, 16}
Node 28: {9, 17, 19, 26}
Node 29: {11, 16, 21, 12}

Node 2, Node 4, Node 9, Node 11, Node 16, Node 19, Node 20, and Node 24 have 3 or more neighbors, so we check for the 3-stars:

1. Node 2: <2, (4, 24, 9)>
2. Node 4: <4, (0, 16, 27)>
3. Node 9: <9, (2, 12, 28)>
4. Node 11: <11, (8, 19, 29)>
5. Node 16: <16, (3, 27, 29)>
6. Node 19: <19, (8, 24, 28)>
7. Node 20: <20, (6, 24, 26)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [7].
