Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 27) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 24) (9, 3) (18, 9) (18, 22) (18, 23) (22, 18) (22, 12) (8, 9) (8, 23) (8, 24) (23, 18) (23, 8) (23, 1) (23, 29) (5, 6) (5, 17) (5, 10) (2, 24) (2, 28) (2, 25) (4, 20) (4, 29) (11, 28) (11, 14) (11, 1) (28, 2) (28, 11) (28, 14) (17, 5) (17, 20) (17, 21) (20, 4) (20, 17) (20, 27) (20, 14) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 26) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 13) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 24) (14, 11) (14, 28) (14, 20) (14, 12) (12, 22) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 19) (3, 9) (3, 0) (29, 23) (29, 4) (29, 25) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 16) (24, 15) (1, 23) (1, 11) (1, 19) (15, 24) (15, 25) (26, 0) (26, 25) (21, 17) (21, 27) (27, 6) (27, 20) (27, 21) (10, 5) (13, 7) (13, 19) (25, 2) (25, 29) (25, 15) (25, 26) (19, 12) (19, 1) (19, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 7, 26}
- Node 1: {11, 19, 23}
- Node 2: {24, 25, 28}
- Node 3: {0, 9}
- Node 4: {14, 20, 29}
- Node 5: {6, 10, 17}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 27}
- Node 7: {0, 13, 16}
- Node 8: {9, 23, 24}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 8, 18, 24}
- Node 10: {5}
- Node 11: {1, 14, 28}
- Node 12: {14, 16, 19, 22}
- Node 13: {7, 19}
- Node 14: {4, 11, 12, 20}
- Node 15: {24, 25}
- Node 16: {7, 12, 24}
- Node 17: {5, 20, 21}
- Node 18: {9, 22, 23}
- Node 19: {1, 12, 13}
- Node 20: {4, 14, 17, 27}
- Node 21: {17, 27}
- Node 22: {12, 18}
- Node 23: {1, 8, 18, 28, 29}
- Node 24: {8, 9, 15, 16, 2}
- Node 25: {2, 15, 26, 29}
- Node 26: {0, 25, 26}
- Node 27: {5, 6, 20, 21}
- Node 28: {2, 11, 14, 23}
- Node 29: {4, 23, 25}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 6, 8, 18, and 24.
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 11, 12, and 20.
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with neighbors 8, 9, 15, and 16.
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 8, 28, and 29.
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 15, 26, and 29.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \(5 \times \binom{5}{3} = 5 \times 10 = 50\)

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <9, (3, 6, 8, 18, 24)>
- <14, (4, 11, 12, 20)>
- <24, (8, 9, 15, 16)>
- <23, (1, 8, 28, 29)>
- <25, (2, 15, 26, 29)>
