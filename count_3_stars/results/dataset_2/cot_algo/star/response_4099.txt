Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (12, 1) (12, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 2) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 11}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 8, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 5, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {2, 6}
- Node 12: {1, 10}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 14: {0, 5, 6, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 6, Node 9, Node 10, and Node 14 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 56 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [56], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 7, 10, 13>, <1, 3, 7, 8>, <4, 2, 6, 9>, <6, 5, 10, 14>, <9, 0, 4, 13>, <10, 0, 5, 14>
