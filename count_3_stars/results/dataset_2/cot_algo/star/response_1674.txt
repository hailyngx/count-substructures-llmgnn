Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 8) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 14) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (4, 9) (4, 0) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 10) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
Based on the provided edges, we can determine the neighbors for each of the 15 nodes:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 11}
- Node 4: {0, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 9, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 7: {6, 9, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 10: {5, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 11: {3, 7, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {1, 5, 6, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 11, 0}
- Node 14: {5, 7, 8}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 10, and 12. <5, 9, 10, 12>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 8. <9, 5, 7, 8>
Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9, and 13. <11, 7, 9, 13>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3, so the final answer is [3].
