Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 23) (13, 7) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 0) (22, 3) (15, 27) (15, 7) (15, 5) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 24) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 11) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 7) (23, 13) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 25) (1, 26) (1, 4) (1, 18) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 16) (20, 8) (20, 14) (7, 13) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 8) (17, 6) (17, 24) (29, 19) (29, 3) (24, 27) (24, 26) (24, 17) (24, 2) (10, 13) (21, 11) (3, 22) (3, 29) (3, 4) (28, 19) (28, 2) (0, 22) (0, 12) (11, 15) (11, 12) (11, 21) (11, 14) (14, 20) (14, 11) (9, 18) (9, 19) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 6) (2, 24) (2, 28) (2, 5) (2, 25) (5, 15) (5, 12) (5, 2) (6, 17) (6, 18) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 19) (19, 29) (19, 28) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 16) (16, 26) (16, 19) (25, 23) (25, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {12, 22}
- Node 1: {4, 18, 26}
- Node 2: {5, 24, 25, 28}
- Node 3: {4, 22, 29}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 19}
- Node 5: {2, 12, 15}
- Node 6: {17, 18}
- Node 7: {8, 12, 13, 15}
- Node 8: {7, 20, 23}
- Node 9: {18, 19}
- Node 10: {13}
- Node 11: {12, 14, 15, 21}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 7, 11, 15, 22}
- Node 13: {7, 10, 18, 22, 23}
- Node 14: {11, 20}
- Node 15: {5, 7, 11, 12, 27}
- Node 16: {19, 26}
- Node 17: {6, 24}
- Node 18: {1, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 19: {4, 9, 16, 28, 29}
- Node 20: {8, 14}
- Node 21: {11}
- Node 22: {0, 3, 12, 13}
- Node 23: {8, 13, 25, 26}
- Node 24: {2, 17, 26, 27}
- Node 25: {2, 23}
- Node 26: {1, 16, 23, 24}
- Node 27: {15, 24}
- Node 28: {2, 19}
- Node 29: {3, 19}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (7, 12, 13), (7, 12, 15), (7, 13, 15)
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors: (12, 22, 13), (12, 5, 15), (12, 7, 15), (12, 7, 22), (12, 11, 15), (12, 15, 27)
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: (13, 7, 22), (13, 7, 23), (13, 22, 23), (13, 18, 22), (13, 18, 23)
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors: (15, 7, 12), (15, 11, 12), (15, 11, 27), (15, 12, 27), (15, 27, 12)
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: (18, 13, 23), (18, 1, 26), (18, 6, 17), (18, 6, 19)
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors: (19, 4, 28), (19, 9, 18), (19, 16, 26), (19, 28, 29), (19, 29, 3)
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: (26, 1, 16), (26, 16, 19), (26, 16, 24), (26, 23, 24)

Total number of 3-stars = 3 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the final answer is [28], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <7, 12, 13>
- <7, 12, 15>
- <7, 13, 15>
- <12, 22, 13>
- <12, 5, 15>
- <12, 7, 15>
- <12, 7, 22>
- <12, 11, 15>
- <12, 15, 27>
- <13, 7, 22>
- <13, 7, 23>
- <13, 22, 23>
- <13, 18, 22>
- <13, 18, 23>
- <15, 7, 12>
- <15, 11, 12>
- <15, 11, 27>
- <15, 12, 27>
- <15, 27, 12>
- <18, 13, 23>
- <18, 1, 26>
- <18, 6, 17>
- <18, 6, 19>
- <19, 4, 28>
- <19, 9, 18>
- <19, 16, 26>
- <19, 28, 29>
- <19, 29, 3>
- <26, 1, 16>
- <26, 16, 19>
- <26, 16, 24>
- <26, 23, 24>
