Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 29) (27, 22) (27, 26) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (10, 23) (10, 25) (10, 29) (17, 21) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 28) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 14) (18, 8) (5, 11) (5, 28) (5, 20) (6, 7) (6, 4) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 21) (0, 8) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 23) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 26) (28, 2) (28, 5) (28, 16) (28, 23) (22, 27) (22, 7) (22, 25) (26, 27) (26, 18) (26, 21) (26, 24) (24, 26) (24, 20) (8, 18) (8, 0) (8, 12) (9, 3) (9, 4) (11, 5) (11, 23) (23, 10) (23, 14) (23, 28) (23, 11) (16, 2) (16, 28) (16, 19) (25, 10) (25, 22) (25, 13) (19, 16) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 20) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 22) (29, 15) (29, 10) (20, 5) (20, 24) (20, 12) (20, 13) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 13) (13, 25) (13, 20) (13, 4) 

Response:
The graph has the following neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {14, 15, 21, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 12}
- Node 2: {3, 16, 18, 28}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {11, 20, 28}
- Node 6: {4, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 15, 17, 22}
- Node 8: {0, 12, 18}
- Node 9: {3, 4}
- Node 10: {22, 23, 25, 29}
- Node 11: {5, 23}
- Node 12: {1, 8, 20}
- Node 13: {4, 20, 25}
- Node 14: {0, 18, 23}
- Node 15: {0, 7, 29}

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [26].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 14, 21)>
<2, (3, 16, 18)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (11, 20, 28)>
<7, (6, 17, 22)>
<10, (22, 25, 29)>
<12, (1, 8, 20)>
<13, (4, 20, 25)>
<14, (0, 18, 23)>
<15, (0, 7, 29)>
