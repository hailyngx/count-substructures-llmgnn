Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6
- Node 5: 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 6, 7

Next, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each such node:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars
- Node 2: 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
- Node 7: 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars

There are a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 37 3-stars in the graph. Thus, the final answer is [37].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 6, 3>
- <1, 0, 6>
- <1, 0, 4>
- <1, 0, 8>
- <3, 5, 8>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 5, 8>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 5, 8>
- <3, 0, 6>
- <8, 1, 0>
- <8, 1, 3>
- <8, 1, 2>
- <8, 1, 5>
- <8, 2, 1>
- <8, 2, 5>
- <8, 2, 3>
- <8, 5, 3>
- <8, 5, 7>
- <8, 5, 7>
- <8, 5, 7>
- <8, 5, 3>
- <5, 3, 7>
- <5, 3, 7>
- <5, 3, 7>
- <5, 3, 8>
- <7, 0, 1>
- <7, 0, 5>
- <7, 0, 5>
- <7, 0, 5>
- <5, 8, 7>
- <5, 8, 7>
- <5, 8, 3>
