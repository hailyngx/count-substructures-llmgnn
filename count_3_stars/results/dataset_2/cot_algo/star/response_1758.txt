Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node.

| Node | Neighbors |
|------|-----------|
| 0    | 3, 4, 7, 8 |
| 1    | 3, 6, 7, 8 |
| 2    | 5, 6, 8 |
| 3    | 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9 |
| 4    | 0, 3, 5, 9 |
| 5    | 2, 4, 7 |
| 6    | 1, 2, 3, 7 |
| 7    | 0, 1, 5, 6, 8 |
| 8    | 0, 1, 2, 3, 7 |
| 9    | 3, 4 |

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars in the graph. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars 
- Node 1 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars 
- Node 3 can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars 
- Node 4 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 52 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [52].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 3, 7)>,
<1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 3, 7)>,
<3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>,
<4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>,
<7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>,
<8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>.
