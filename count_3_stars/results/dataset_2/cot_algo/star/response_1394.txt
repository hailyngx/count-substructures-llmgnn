Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 20) (26, 14) (26, 25) (26, 8) (1, 2) (1, 24) (21, 0) (21, 18) (21, 29) (15, 27) (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 5) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 22) (8, 26) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 7) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 19) (5, 15) (5, 28) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 23) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 17) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 18) (0, 21) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 22) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 19) (14, 26) (14, 12) (14, 25) (4, 12) (4, 16) (19, 12) (19, 16) (19, 22) (19, 24) (22, 15) (22, 27) (22, 0) (22, 19) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 23) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 23) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) (25, 26) (25, 15) (25, 14) (25, 28) (20, 9) (20, 24) (29, 21) (10, 5) (10, 2) (18, 21) (18, 11) (18, 28) (23, 6) (23, 7) (23, 17) (24, 1) (24, 19) (24, 20) (24, 28) (28, 5) (28, 25) (28, 18) (28, 24) 

Response:
Given that this graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges, we can start by determining the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 21, 3, 16, 17, 22
- Node 1 neighbors: 2, 24
- Node 2 neighbors: 1, 6, 10
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 11, 17
- Node 4 neighbors: 12, 16
- Node 5 neighbors: 10, 15, 28
- Node 6 neighbors: 2, 3, 23
- Node 7 neighbors: 11, 13, 23
- Node 8 neighbors: 13, 26
- Node 9 neighbors: 20
- Node 10 neighbors: 2, 5
- Node 11 neighbors: 3, 7, 18
- Node 12 neighbors: 4, 14, 19, 27
- Node 13 neighbors: 7, 8
- Node 14 neighbors: 12, 25, 26
- Node 15 neighbors: 5, 22, 25, 27
- Node 16 neighbors: 0, 4, 19
- Node 17 neighbors: 0, 3, 11, 23
- Node 18 neighbors: 11, 21, 28
- Node 19 neighbors: 12, 16, 22, 24
- Node 20 neighbors: 9, 24
- Node 21 neighbors: 0, 18, 29
- Node 22 neighbors: 15, 19, 27
- Node 23 neighbors: 6, 7, 17
- Node 24 neighbors: 1, 19, 20, 28
- Node 25 neighbors: 14, 15, 26, 28
- Node 26 neighbors: 8, 14, 25
- Node 27 neighbors: 12, 15, 22
- Node 28 neighbors: 5, 18, 24, 25
- Node 29 neighbors: 21

Now, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0: <0, (3, 16, 17)>, <0, (3, 16, 22)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 17, 23)>
- Node 11: <11, (3, 17, 23)>
- Node 12: <12, (4, 16, 19)>, <12, (14, 25, 27)>, <12, (19, 22, 27)>
- Node 15: <15, (22, 25, 27)>
- Node 16: <16, (0, 4, 19)>, <16, (4, 12, 19)>
- Node 18: <18, (11, 21, 28)>
- Node 19: <19, (12, 16, 22)>, <19, (16, 22, 27)>
- Node 22: <22, (15, 19, 27)>
- Node 24: <24, (19, 20, 28)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find there are 12 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final count to be put inside brackets is [12].
