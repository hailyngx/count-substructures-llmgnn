Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (17, 8) (17, 21) (8, 17) (8, 28) (8, 16) (8, 21) (23, 2) (23, 9) (23, 19) (15, 20) (15, 6) (15, 4) (20, 15) (20, 19) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 27) (26, 13) (26, 2) (26, 27) (26, 0) (26, 12) (1, 4) (1, 19) (0, 26) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 6) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 25) (25, 7) (25, 2) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 4) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 5) (11, 21) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 6) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 3) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 16) (6, 24) (24, 3) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 14) (29, 21) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 13) (21, 11) (21, 29) (2, 23) (2, 26) (2, 25) (2, 16) (2, 9) (9, 23) (9, 2) (9, 12) (12, 26) (12, 9) (12, 14) (27, 13) (27, 26) (27, 24) (14, 24) (14, 12) (22, 11) (4, 15) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (19, 23) (19, 20) (19, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

- Node 0: {26, 7, 28, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 19}
- Node 2: {23, 26, 25, 16, 9}
- Node 3: {10, 11, 28, 24, 4}
- Node 4: {15, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {10, 11}
- Node 6: {15, 0, 16, 24}
- Node 7: {10, 0, 25}
- Node 8: {17, 28, 16, 21}
- Node 9: {23, 2, 12}
- Node 10: {3, 7, 5}
- Node 11: {3, 5, 22, 21}
- Node 12: {26, 9, 14}
- Node 13: {26, 21, 27}
- Node 14: {24, 12}
- Node 15: {20, 6, 4}
- Node 16: {8, 2, 6}
- Node 17: {8, 21}
- Node 19: {23, 20, 1}
- Node 20: {15, 19}
- Node 21: {17, 8, 13, 11, 29}
- Node 22: {11}
- Node 23: {2, 9, 19}
- Node 24: {3, 6, 27, 14}
- Node 25: {2, 7}
- Node 26: {13, 2, 0, 27, 12}
- Node 27: {13, 26, 24}
- Node 28: {8, 0, 3}
- Node 29: {21}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 13: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 15: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 17: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 19: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 20: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 21: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 22: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 23: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 24: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 25: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 26: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 27: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 28: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 29: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 43

Thus, the final answer is [43].
