Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (16, 12) (16, 29) (5, 21) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 20) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 18) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 28) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 22) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 1) (2, 6) (2, 18) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 8) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 26) (1, 17) (1, 27) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 0) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 19) (21, 5) (21, 28) (21, 23) (28, 4) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 19) (15, 10) (15, 20) (20, 9) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 27) (0, 26) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 29) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 24) (17, 22) (25, 9) (22, 7) (22, 17) (23, 26) (23, 21) (8, 18) (8, 28) (8, 0) (8, 3) (19, 12) (19, 28) (19, 14) (19, 24) (29, 16) (29, 26) (29, 14) (13, 4) (13, 20) (13, 27) (24, 17) (24, 19) (27, 1) (27, 20) (27, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 26, 8, 14
- Node 1: 6, 10, 17, 26, 27
- Node 2: 6, 18
- Node 3: 8, 10, 11
- Node 4: 7, 12, 13, 17, 28
- Node 5: 21
- Node 6: 1, 2, 9, 18
- Node 7: 4, 12, 17, 22
- Node 8: 0, 3, 18, 28
- Node 9: 6, 20, 25
- Node 10: 1, 3, 15
- Node 12: 4, 7, 16, 19
- Node 13: 4, 20, 27
- Node 14: 0, 19, 29
- Node 15: 10, 20
- Node 16: 12, 29
- Node 17: 1, 4, 7, 22, 24
- Node 18: 2, 6, 8
- Node 19: 12, 14, 24, 28
- Node 20: 9, 13, 15, 27
- Node 21: 5, 23, 28
- Node 22: 7, 17
- Node 23: 21, 26
- Node 24: 17, 19
- Node 25: 9
- Node 26: 0, 1, 23, 29
- Node 27: 1, 13, 20
- Node 28: 4, 8, 19, 21
- Node 29: 14, 16, 26

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed using the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 54 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (6, 10, 27)>
<4, (7, 12, 17)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 18, 28)>
<12, (4, 7, 19)>
<17, (1, 7, 22)>
<19, (14, 24, 28)>
<20, (9, 13, 27)>
<26, (0, 23, 29)>
<28, (8, 19, 21)>
