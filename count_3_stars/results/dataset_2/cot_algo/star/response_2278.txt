Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 2) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 5) (14, 11) (7, 16) (7, 6) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 15) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 9) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (16, 3) (16, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 18) (18, 9) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (12, 11) (12, 15) (15, 5) (15, 12) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {10, 17, 5}
Node 1: {3, 6, 11, 13, 9}
Node 2: {3, 10, 11}
Node 3: {1, 6, 16, 13, 2}
Node 4: {17, 13}
Node 5: {0, 19, 8, 15}
Node 6: {1, 3, 7}
Node 7: {16, 6}
Node 8: {5, 19, 10, 11}
Node 9: {1, 19, 18}
Node 10: {0, 8, 2}
Node 11: {1, 14, 8, 12, 2}
Node 12: {11, 15}
Node 13: {1, 3, 4}
Node 14: {11}
Node 15: {5, 12}
Node 16: {3, 7}
Node 17: {0, 19, 4}
Node 18: {9}
Node 19: {5, 8, 17, 9}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 36.

Therefore, the final answer inside brackets is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows: 
<1, (3, 6, 11)>, <1, (3, 11, 13)>, <1, (6, 11, 8)>, <1, (6, 11, 2)>, <1, (11, 13, 4)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 16, 13)>, <3, (6, 7, 16)>, <5, (0, 19, 8)>, <8, (5, 19, 17)>, <11, (1, 6, 2)>, <11, (1, 6, 8)>, <11, (1, 8, 12)>, <11, (6, 7, 16)>, <19, (5, 8, 17)>
