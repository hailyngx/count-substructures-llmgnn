Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 14) (9, 18) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 18) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 5) (2, 16) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 2) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 19) (15, 8) (15, 19) (19, 18) (19, 15) (17, 6) (17, 8) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 16) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following structure:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 13.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 12, 14, and 16.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 13.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 16.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 14, 17.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 16, and 18.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 15, and 17.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 12, 13, and 18.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 14, and 18.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10 and 14.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 10, and 11.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 8 and 19.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 6, 8.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 7, 9, 10, and 19.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 15, 18.

Now, let's identify the 3-star structures in this graph by enumerating the possible combinations:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 3: <4, (7, 8, 3)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 16, and 18: <7, (4, 16, 18)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
