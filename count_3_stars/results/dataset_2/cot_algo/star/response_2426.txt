Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 14) (9, 3) (26, 9) (26, 2) (26, 11) (11, 26) (11, 16) (11, 27) (16, 11) (16, 28) (16, 17) (16, 18) (4, 29) (4, 2) (7, 21) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 5) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 20) (21, 22) (18, 16) (18, 22) (18, 12) (18, 3) (22, 21) (22, 18) (22, 27) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 24) (15, 3) (15, 24) (10, 21) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 16) (17, 10) (17, 19) (13, 12) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 27) (28, 16) (28, 6) (28, 8) (20, 21) (20, 1) (29, 4) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 25) (1, 6) (1, 20) (1, 25) (8, 10) (8, 28) (8, 14) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 23) (5, 25) (23, 5) (23, 27) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 25) (24, 3) (24, 15) (24, 0) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (2, 26) (2, 4) (25, 12) (25, 1) (25, 5) (25, 19) (27, 11) (27, 22) (27, 6) (27, 23) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 24}
- Node 1: {6, 20, 25}
- Node 2: {4, 26}
- Node 3: {0, 9, 15, 18, 24}
- Node 4: {2, 29}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 23, 25}
- Node 6: {1, 27, 28}
- Node 7: {5, 14, 19, 21}
- Node 8: {10, 14, 28}
- Node 9: {3, 14, 26}
- Node 10: {8, 17, 21}
- Node 11: {16, 26, 27}
- Node 12: {13, 18, 25}
- Node 13: {12}
- Node 14: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 15: {3, 24}
- Node 16: {11, 17, 18, 28}
- Node 17: {10, 16, 19}
- Node 18: {3, 12, 16, 22}
- Node 19: {7, 17, 25}
- Node 20: {1, 21}
- Node 21: {7, 10, 20, 22}
- Node 22: {18, 21, 27}
- Node 23: {5, 27}
- Node 24: {0, 3, 15}
- Node 25: {1, 5, 12, 19}
- Node 26: {2, 9, 11}
- Node 27: {6, 11, 22, 23}
- Node 28: {6, 8, 16}
- Node 29: {4}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars each node can form:

- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <3, (0, 9, 15)>, <3, (0, 9, 18)>, <3, (0, 9, 24)>, <3, (0, 15, 18)>, <3, (0, 15, 24)>, <3, (0, 18, 24)>, <3, (9, 15, 18)>, <3, (9, 15, 24)>, <3, (9, 18, 24)>, <3, (15, 18, 24)>
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <5, (0, 23, 25)>, <5, (7, 19, 25)>, <5, (7, 23, 25)>, <5, (19, 23, 25)>
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <7, (10, 17, 21)>, <7, (10, 19, 21)>, <7, (17, 19, 21)>, <7, (19, 23, 25)>
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <8, (10, 14, 28)>
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <9, (14, 26, 3)>
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <11, (16, 26, 27)>
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <14, (8, 9, 14)>
- Node 16 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <16, (11, 17, 28)>, <16, (11, 18, 28)>, <16, (17, 18, 28)>, <16, (17, 19, 28)>
- Node 18 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <18, (12, 16, 25)>, <18, (12, 19, 25)>, <18, (16, 19, 22)>, <18, (16, 22, 27)>
- Node 21 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <21, (10, 17, 22)>, <21, (10, 20, 22)>, <21, (10, 20, 21)>, <21, (17, 19, 22)>
- Node 25 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <25, (12, 19, 1)>, <25, (12, 19, 5)>, <25, (1, 19, 5)>, <25, (1, 20, 19)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars gives us: 
10 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) + 1 (from node 11) + 1 (from node 14) + 4 (from node 16) + 4 (from node 18) + 4 (from node 21) + 4 (from node 25) = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].
