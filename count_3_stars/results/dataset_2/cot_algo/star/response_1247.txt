Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: No 3-stars formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: No 3-stars formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-stars formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: No 3-stars formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>
