Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph described, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 8}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 4, 6, 8, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors. Therefore, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- For node 0: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 8: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, and <9, (0, 1, 6)>.
