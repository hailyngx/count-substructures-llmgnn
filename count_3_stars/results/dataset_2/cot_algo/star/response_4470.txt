Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (4, 6) (4, 12) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {13, 7, 14}
- Node 2: {9, 11, 13, 7, 12}
- Node 3: {9, 8, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {6, 12}
- Node 5: {6, 10, 8, 3, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 14, 10, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {12, 3, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {6, 5, 14, 3}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 3, 13, 0}
- Node 10: {6, 13, 5, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 2}
- Node 12: {7, 4, 2}
- Node 13: {9, 10, 2, 1}
- Node 14: {6, 10, 8, 5, 0, 1}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <6, (9, 5, 14)>, <6, (9, 10, 14)>, <6, (9, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 10, 14)>, <6, (5, 10, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 14)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <9, (6, 2, 3)>, <9, (6, 13, 10)>, <9, (6, 5, 14)>, <9, (6, 5, 8)>, <9, (6, 10, 14)>, <9, (5, 13, 10)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <2, (9, 13, 7)>, <2, (9, 11, 13)>, <2, (9, 2, 7)>, <2, (9, 2, 12)>, <2, (11, 2, 7)>, <2, (13, 2, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <5, (6, 10, 14)>, <5, (6, 10, 8)>, <5, (6, 5, 8)>, <5, (6, 5, 14)>, <5, (8, 3, 14)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <8, (6, 5, 14)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <10, (6, 13, 5)>, <10, (6, 13, 10)>, <10, (6, 5, 14)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <14, (6, 10, 8)>

Counting up the unique 3-stars formed, we have a total of [18] 3-stars.
