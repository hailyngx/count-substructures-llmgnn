Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 9, 4, 2}
- Node 1: {5, 3, 2}
- Node 2: {6, 1, 3, 4, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 8, 0, 2}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {9, 3, 2}
- Node 7: {5, 4}
- Node 8: {9, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8, 0}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0, Node 5, Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 2, Node 3, Node 8, Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each

Total 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 5, 9>
<(2, 3, 4)>
<(2, 3, 8)>
<(2, 4, 8)>
<(3, 4, 8)>
