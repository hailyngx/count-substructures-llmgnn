Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 13) (0, 12) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 1) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 2) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 9) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 9) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 3) (4, 5) (4, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:

For node 10: (10, 11), (10, 6), (10, 8), (10, 9) → 4 neighbors
For node 11: (11, 10), (11, 3), (11, 14), (11, 2) → 4 neighbors
For node 7: (7, 12), (7, 2), (7, 13), (7, 1), (7, 8) → 5 neighbors
For node 12: (12, 7), (12, 2), (12, 14), (12, 0), (12, 3), (12, 9) → 6 neighbors
For node 14: (14, 11), (14, 12), (14, 8), (14, 4), (14, 13) → 5 neighbors
For node 13: (13, 7), (13, 5), (13, 6), (13, 14), (13, 1) → 5 neighbors
For node 3: (3, 11), (3, 12), (3, 5), (3, 2) → 4 neighbors
For node 8: (8, 10), (8, 7), (8, 5), (8, 14), (8, 9) → 5 neighbors
For node 9: (9, 10), (9, 12), (9, 8), (9, 1) → 4 neighbors
For node 1: (1, 7), (1, 13), (1, 9) → 3 neighbors
For node 2: (2, 11), (2, 7), (2, 12), (2, 6), (2, 3) → 5 neighbors

Only nodes 7, 12, and 14 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in.

For node 7: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<7, (12, 2, 13)>, <7, (12, 2, 1)>, <7, (12, 2, 8)>, <7, (12, 13, 1)>, <7, (12, 13, 8)>, <7, (12, 1, 8)>, <7, (2, 13, 1)>, <7, (2, 13, 8)>, <7, (2, 1, 8)>, <7, (13, 1, 8)>

For node 12: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
<12, (7, 2, 14)>, <12, (7, 2, 0)>, <12, (7, 2, 3)>, <12, (7, 2, 9)>, <12, (7, 14, 0)>, <12, (7, 14, 3)>, <12, (7, 14, 9)>, <12, (7, 0, 3)>, <12, (7, 0, 9)>, <12, (7, 3, 9)>, <12, (2, 14, 0)>, <12, (2, 14, 3)>, <12, (2, 14, 9)>, <12, (2, 0, 3)>, <12, (2, 0, 9)>, <12, (2, 3, 9)>, <12, (14, 0, 3)>, <12, (14, 0, 9)>, <12, (14, 3, 9)>, <12, (0, 3, 9)>

For node 14: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<14, (11, 12, 8)>, <14, (11, 12, 4)>, <14, (11, 12, 13)>, <14, (11, 8, 4)>, <14, (11, 8, 13)>, <14, (11, 4, 13)>, <14, (12, 8, 4)>, <14, (12, 8, 13)>, <14, (12, 4, 13)>, <14, (8, 4, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40].
