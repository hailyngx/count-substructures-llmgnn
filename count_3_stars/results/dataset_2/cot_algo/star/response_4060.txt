Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 10, 11, 7, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 10, 11, 8, 14, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 13, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8, 12, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 10, 2, 12}
- Node 6: Neighbors {14, 10, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {11, 0, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {11, 4, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {13, 0, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {6, 0, 13, 2, 5}
- Node 11: Neighbors {7, 0, 8, 2}
- Node 12: Neighbors {9, 4, 14, 13, 5}
- Node 13: Neighbors {6, 9, 3, 10, 7, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {6, 4, 0, 12, 2}

Now let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (9, 10, 11)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 10, 11)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (3, 10, 2)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (6, 13, 0)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (9, 13, 4)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (6, 9, 3)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (6, 4, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
