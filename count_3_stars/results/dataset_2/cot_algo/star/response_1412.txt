Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 13) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 2) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first find the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {2, 9, 13}
- Node 1 neighbors: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 2 neighbors: {0, 7, 14}
- Node 3 neighbors: {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4 neighbors: {6, 7, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 5 neighbors: {3, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 6 neighbors: {1, 4, 10, 11}
- Node 7 neighbors: {1, 2, 4, 5, 12, 14}
- Node 8 neighbors: {3, 4, 9, 14}
- Node 9 neighbors: {0, 3, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 10 neighbors: {4, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 11 neighbors: {5, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 12 neighbors: {7, 10, 13}
- Node 13 neighbors: {0, 5, 9, 12}
- Node 14 neighbors: {2, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 4 forms 1 3-star <4, (6, 7, 14)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star <7, (1, 4, 14)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star <9, (0, 13, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
