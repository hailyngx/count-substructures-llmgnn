Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the neighborhood of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6, 2}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}

Now let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, which can potentially form 3-stars:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) to determine the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 56

Therefore, the final answer is [56]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 

- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <4, 8, 9>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <6, 8, 9>
