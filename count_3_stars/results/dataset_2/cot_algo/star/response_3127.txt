Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 18) (15, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (10, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 2) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 8) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 12) (4, 15) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (9, 17) (9, 4) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 17) (12, 11) (19, 7) (19, 16) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 16) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 8) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 2) (14, 5) (14, 7) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 18) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges based on each node:
- Node 0: {17, 11, 18, 2}
- Node 1: {11, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {13, 0, 7, 16}
- Node 3: {18}
- Node 4: {15, 5, 1, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 13, 4, 16, 14}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {6, 19, 14, 18, 2}
- Node 8: {6, 17, 1, 18}
- Node 9: {17, 4}
- Node 10: {16}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 12}
- Node 12: {17, 11}
- Node 13: {5, 2}
- Node 14: {5, 7}
- Node 15: {4}
- Node 16: {5, 2, 19, 10}
- Node 17: {0, 9, 12, 8}
- Node 18: {3, 0, 7, 8}
- Node 19: {7, 16}

Next, we'll identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 5, 7, 8, and 16 have 4 neighbors.
- Node 11, 17 have 3 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 34 \).
Therefore, the final answer is [34], and the unique 3-stars found is <0, (2, 11, 12), (4, 8, 9), (5, 13, 14), (7, 16, 19)>.
