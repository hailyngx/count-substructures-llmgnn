Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 11) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (10, 6) (10, 9) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by exploring the neighbor set for each node and applying the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Here is the calculation for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {8, 3, 5, 1}, can form 4 3-stars
Node 1: Neighbors {6, 13, 0, 14, 5}, can form 5 3-stars
Node 2: Neighbors {14, 5, 11}, can form 1 3-star
Node 3: Neighbors {7, 8, 12, 0, 5}, can form 5 3-stars
Node 4: Neighbors {5, 14}, can form 1 3-star
Node 5: Neighbors {4, 8, 0, 2, 1, 3}, can form 6 3-stars
Node 6: Neighbors {9, 1, 10}, can form 1 3-star
Node 7: Neighbors {12, 3, 11, 13}, can form 1 3-star
Node 8: Neighbors {13, 5, 0, 12, 3}, can form 1 3-star
Node 9: Neighbors {6, 11, 10, 13}, can form 1 3-star
Node 10: Neighbors {6, 9}, can form 0 3-star
Node 11: Neighbors {9, 7, 13, 2}, can form 1 3-star
Node 12: Neighbors {7, 8, 3}, can form 0 3-star
Node 13: Neighbors {9, 7, 8, 11, 1, 14}, can form 5 3-stars
Node 14: Neighbors {4, 13, 1, 2}, can form 1 3-star

After summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [25].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 3, 5)>
<1, (6, 13, 0)>
<1, (6, 13, 5)>
<1, (13, 0, 14)>

<3, (7, 8, 12)>
<3, (7, 8, 3)>
<3, (8, 12, 5)>
<3, (8, 3, 5)>
<3, (12, 3, 7)>
<4, (5, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
