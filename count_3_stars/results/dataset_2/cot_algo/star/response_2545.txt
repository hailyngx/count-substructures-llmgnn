Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {5, 8, 13, 7, 2}
Node 1 neighbors: {6, 10, 13}
Node 2 neighbors: {5, 9, 0, 10, 14}
Node 3 neighbors: {9, 7, 12}
Node 4 neighbors: {8, 10, 14}
Node 5 neighbors: {6, 2, 0, 7, 14}
Node 6 neighbors: {5, 9, 1, 14, 12}
Node 7 neighbors: {5, 3, 11, 0}
Node 8 neighbors: {4, 11, 0}
Node 9 neighbors: {6, 2, 3}
Node 10 neighbors: {1, 13, 4, 2, 14}
Node 11 neighbors: {8, 13, 7, 12}
Node 12 neighbors: {6, 3, 11}
Node 13 neighbors: {1, 11, 10, 0}
Node 14 neighbors: {5, 6, 4, 2, 10}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least three neighbors:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from the above calculations: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 5, 8, 13>, <0, 5, 8, 7>, <0, 5, 13, 7>, <0, 8, 13, 7>, <0, 2, 5, 14>, <0, 2, 5, 10>, <0, 2, 14, 10>, <0, 5, 7, 14>, <0, 5, 2, 14>, <2, 5, 6, 14>, <2, 5, 10, 14>, <2, 5, 14, 10>, <2, 6, 10, 14>, <2, 10, 14, 10>, <2, 10, 14, 14>, <5, 6, 14, 4>, <5, 6, 14, 2>, <5, 14, 4, 2>, <5, 14, 4, 10>, <5, 14, 2, 10>, <6, 9, 1, 14>, <6, 9, 14, 12>, <6, 1, 14, 12>, <9, 1, 13, 11>, <4, 8, 11, 7>, <4, 8, 11, 12>, <4, 11, 7, 12>, <8, 11, 7, 0>, <8, 0, 13, 7>, <11, 7, 0, 12>, <0, 13, 7, 11>, <2, 14, 10, 4>, <10, 4, 14, 2>
