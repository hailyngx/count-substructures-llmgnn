Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: {5, 9, 2, 8, 11}
	Node 0 forms [1] 3-star with neighbors: <0, (5, 2, 9)>, <0, (5, 2, 8)>, <0, (5, 2, 11)>, <0, (5, 9, 8)>, <0, (5, 9, 11)>, <0, (5, 2, 8)>, <0, (9, 2, 8)>, <0, (9, 2, 11)>, <0, (9, 8, 11)>, <0, (2, 8, 11)>

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {8, 11, 14}

Node 2 has 5 neighbors: {5, 13, 14, 11, 0}

Node 3 has 5 neighbors: {4, 14, 10, 13}
	Node 3 forms [1] 3-star with neighbors: <3, (4, 14, 10)>, <3, (4, 14, 13)>, <3, (4, 10, 13)>, <3, (14, 10, 13)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {12, 10, 3, 13}
	Node 4 forms [1] 3-star with neighbors: <4, (12, 10, 3)>, <4, (12, 10, 13)>, <4, (12, 3, 13)>, <4, (10, 3, 13)>

Node 5 has 2 neighbors: {2, 0}

Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {7, 14, 13}

Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {12, 6, 14, 8}
	Node 7 forms [1] 3-star with neighbors: <7, (12, 6, 14)>, <7, (12, 6, 8)>, <7, (12, 14, 8)>, <7, (6, 14, 8)>

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {7, 0, 1}
	Node 8 forms [1] 3-star with neighbors: <8, (7, 0, 1)>, <8, (7, 0, 11)>, <8, (7, 1, 11)>, <8, (0, 1, 11)>

Node 9 has 5 neighbors: {11, 10, 0, 12}
	Node 9 forms [1] 3-star with neighbors: <9, (11, 0, 10)>, <9, (11, 0, 12)>, <9, (11, 10, 12)>, <9, (0, 10, 12)>

Node 10 has 5 neighbors: {9, 12, 4, 3, 13}
	Node 10 forms [1] 3-star with neighbors: <10, (9, 4, 12)>, <10, (9, 4, 3)>, <10, (9, 4, 13)>, <10, (9, 3, 13)>, <10, (4, 3, 13)>, <10, (4, 12, 13)>, <10, (3, 12, 13)>

Node 11 has 4 neighbors: {9, 2, 0, 1}

Node 12 has 5 neighbors: {9, 7, 4, 13, 10}
	Node 12 forms [1] 3-star with neighbors: <12, (9, 4, 13)>, <12, (9, 4, 10)>, <12, (9, 4, 3)>, <12, (9, 13, 10)>

Node 13 has 5 neighbors: {12, 2, 3, 6, 10}

Node 14 has 5 neighbors: {7, 2, 3, 1, 6}

After considering all nodes, we found a total of [26] 3-stars in the given graph.
