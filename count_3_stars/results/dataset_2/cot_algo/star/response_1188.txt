Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 8) (29, 3) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 12) (20, 26) (20, 11) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 16) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 3) (11, 1) (28, 11) (28, 23) (3, 29) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 19) (4, 27) (4, 12) (4, 15) (27, 25) (27, 4) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 17) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 12) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 5) (22, 2) (22, 8) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 23) (14, 27) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 7) (10, 24) (26, 20) (26, 10) (26, 7) (18, 9) (18, 27) (16, 6) (16, 25) (16, 17) (16, 23) (24, 10) (7, 29) (7, 10) (7, 26) (17, 27) (17, 16) (17, 21) (23, 28) (23, 12) (23, 16) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (19, 3) (19, 0) (13, 25) (13, 3) (13, 15) (5, 15) (5, 21) (8, 29) (8, 6) (8, 22) (8, 0) (21, 17) (21, 5) 

Response:
In this graph, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 15, 19, 8}
- Node 1: {11, 12, 15}
- Node 2: {29, 22, 10}
- Node 3: {29, 11, 13, 19}
- Node 4: {27, 12, 15}
- Node 5: {15, 21}
- Node 6: {8, 16}
- Node 7: {29, 10, 26}
- Node 8: {29, 6, 22, 0}
- Node 9: {18, 0, 12}
- Node 10: {2, 26, 7, 24}
- Node 11: {20, 28, 3, 1}
- Node 12: {9, 4, 1, 23}
- Node 13: {25, 3, 15}
- Node 14: {27}
- Node 15: {1, 4, 13, 0, 5}
- Node 16: {6, 25, 17, 23}
- Node 17: {27, 16, 21}
- Node 18: {9, 27}
- Node 19: {3, 0}
- Node 20: {26, 11}
- Node 21: {17, 5}
- Node 22: {2, 29, 8}
- Node 23: {28, 12, 16}
- Node 24: {10}
- Node 25: {27, 13, 16}
- Node 26: {20, 10, 7}
- Node 27: {25, 4, 18, 14, 17}
- Node 28: {11, 23}
- Node 29: {2, 7, 8, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each central node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: [1] - <0, (9, 15, 19)>
- Node 1: [3] - <1, (11, 12, 15)>, <1, (12, 4, 15)>, <1, (1, 15, 0)>
- Node 3: [1] - <3, (29, 11, 13)>
- Node 7: [0]
- Node 8: [1] - <8, (29, 6, 22)>
- Node 10: [0]
- Node 11: [0]
- Node 12: [1] - <12, (9, 4, 1)>
- Node 15: [0]
- Node 16: [0]
- Node 17: [0]
- Node 22: [0]
- Node 25: [2] - <25, (27, 13, 15)>, <25, (27, 16, 25)>
- Node 26: [0]
- Node 27: [1] - <27, (25, 4, 15)>

Total number of 3-stars: [9]
