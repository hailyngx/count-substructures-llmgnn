Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 4) (16, 18) (16, 19) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 8) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (19, 16) (19, 2) (15, 8) (15, 14) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 0) (12, 2) (3, 0) (17, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 14) (8, 18) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 8) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 8) (13, 9) (13, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 17) 

Response:
First, we need to find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 7, 3, 12, 8
Node 1: 6, 9, 5, 14, 4
Node 2: 9, 5, 19, 12, 13
Node 3: 0
Node 4: 11, 10, 5, 1, 17
Node 5: 2, 1, 4
Node 6: 9, 1
Node 7: 11, 0, 8
Node 8: 0, 7, 15, 14, 18
Node 9: 6, 2, 1, 13
Node 10: 11, 18, 4
Node 11: 10, 7, 4
Node 12: 0, 2
Node 13: 9, 2
Node 14: 15, 1, 8
Node 15: 8, 14
Node 16: 18, 19
Node 17: 4
Node 18: 16, 10, 8
Node 19: 16, 2

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 18, and 19 have three or more neighbors. 

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19 has \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 43

Therefore, we have found 43 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (7, 3, 12)>, <0, (7, 3, 8)>, <0, (7, 12, 8)>, <0, (3, 12, 8)>,
<1, (6, 9, 5)>, <1, (6, 9, 14)>, <1, (6, 5, 14)>, <1, (9, 5, 14)>, <1, (9, 5, 4)>,
<2, (9, 5, 19)>, <2, (9, 5, 12)>, <2, (9, 5, 13)>, <2, (5, 19, 12)>, <2, (5, 19, 13)>,
<4, (11, 10, 5)>, <4, (11, 10, 1)>, <4, (11, 5, 1)>, <4, (10, 5, 1)>, <4, (10, 5, 17)>,
<5, (2, 1, 4)>,
<8, (0, 7, 15)>, <8, (0, 7, 14)>, <8, (0, 7, 18)>, <8, (0, 15, 14)>, <8, (15, 14, 18)>,
<9, (6, 2, 1)>, <9, (6, 2, 5)>, <9, (6, 2, 13)>, <9, (2, 5, 13)>,
<10, (11, 18, 4)>,
<11, (7, 0, 4)>,
<14, (15, 1, 8)>,
<18, (16, 10, 8)>
