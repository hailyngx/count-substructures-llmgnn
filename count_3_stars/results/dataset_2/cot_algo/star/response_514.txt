Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

From the given edges, we can determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 6, 9, 5
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 3, 5
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 1, 2
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 0, 3
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 6, 8, 2, 0
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 9, 5, 0
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 0, 3, 9, 5, 2
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 5
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 6, 8, 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of \(10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 50\) 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 5)>
<0, (4, 7, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (7, 5, 6)>
<5, (7, 6, 2)>
<7, (4, 3, 1)>
<7, (4, 3, 2)>
<7, (3, 1, 2)>
<7, (6, 1, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 2)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
