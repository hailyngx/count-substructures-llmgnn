Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 14) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 10) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 10) 

Response:
Based on the given information, here are the steps to find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. For each node, determine its neighbors:
   - Node 0: {5, 9}
   - Node 1: {5, 6, 8, 11, 14}
   - Node 2: {3, 6, 8, 10}
   - Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 9, 11}
   - Node 4: {3, 6, 8, 10, 12}
   - Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 10}
   - Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 8, 10}
   - Node 7: {9}
   - Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 6, 14}
   - Node 9: {0, 3, 7, 10, 11, 12}
   - Node 10: {2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
   - Node 11: {1, 3, 9, 12}
   - Node 12: {4, 9, 11, 13}
   - Node 13: {12, 14}
   - Node 14: {1, 8, 13}

2. Identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12.

3. Calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors using \( \binom{n}{3} \):
   - Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
   - Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

4. Sum up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 88

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [88].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 8, 11)>
<1, (5, 8, 14)>
<1, (5, 11, 14)>
<1, (8, 11, 14)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 10)>
<6, (1, 8, 10)>
<8, (1, 6, 14)>
<9, (3, 10, 11)>
<9, (3, 10, 12)>
<9, (3, 11, 12)>
<9, (10, 11, 12)>
<12, (9, 11, 13)>
<12, (9, 11, 14)>
<12, (9, 13, 14)>
