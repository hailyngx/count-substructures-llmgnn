Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, we will represent the graph in an adjacency list format:

Node 0: {9, 4, 8}
Node 1: {5, 4, 7, 3, 6, 2}
Node 2: {5, 9, 7, 1}
Node 3: {1, 6}
Node 4: {9, 7, 0, 1}
Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 1}
Node 6: {5, 9, 1, 3, 8}
Node 7: {4, 2, 1, 8}
Node 8: {7, 6, 0}
Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 2, 0}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-star configurations.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star configurations.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there are no 3-star configurations.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star configurations.

Adding these up, we get a total of 48 3-star configurations. 

Therefore, the final answer is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 3)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 2)>
<4, (1, 7, 4)>
<4, (1, 7, 6)>
<6, (1, 6, 5)>
<6, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 6, 4)>
<6, (1, 6, 2)>
<7, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 7, 2)>
<7, (4, 7, 1)>
<7, (4, 7, 6)>
<9, (5, 9, 6)>
