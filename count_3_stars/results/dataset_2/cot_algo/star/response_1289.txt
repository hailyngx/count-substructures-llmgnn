Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 12) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 7) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (12, 14) (12, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 7, 13}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 4, 10}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 7, 12}
- Node 10: {5, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 10}
- Node 12: {9, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 6, 10, 12}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2: has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10: has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11: has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14: has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 75.

So, the final total number of 3-stars is [75].

And the unique 3-stars found are:
