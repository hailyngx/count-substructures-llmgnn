Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 17) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 18) (10, 4) (11, 8) (11, 12) (17, 7) (17, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 16) (1, 0) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 16) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 0) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 18) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 15) (16, 18) (16, 14) (14, 16) (14, 3) (9, 2) (9, 18) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 14) (12, 11) (12, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

For node 0: Neighbors {1, 6, 18}
For node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 13, 16}
For node 2: Neighbors {8, 17, 9}
For node 3: Neighbors {5, 8, 14}
For node 4: Neighbors {1, 7, 10, 15}
For node 5: Neighbors {3, 12}
For node 6: Neighbors {0, 15, 19}
For node 7: Neighbors {4, 16, 17, 19}
For node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 11, 13}
For node 9: Neighbors {2, 18}
For node 10: Neighbors {4}
For node 11: Neighbors {8, 12}
For node 12: Neighbors {5, 11}
For node 13: Neighbors {1, 8, 18}
For node 14: Neighbors {3, 16}
For node 15: Neighbors {4, 6, 16}
For node 16: Neighbors {1, 7, 15, 18, 14}
For node 17: Neighbors {2, 7}
For node 18: Neighbors {0, 1, 16, 19, 9}
For node 19: Neighbors {6, 7, 18}


Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 8, 13, 16, and 18 have 4 or more neighbors.

We will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, there's only 1 unique 3-star.  
For nodes with 4 or more neighbors, we will calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars, where \( n \) is the number of neighbors.

Calculating for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30].

Unique 3-stars:
<a, b, c>
<0, 1, 16>, <0, 1, 18>, <0, 1, 19>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 19>, <1, 7, 16>, <1, 13, 16>, <1, 16, 18>, <2, 8, 17>, <3, 8, 14>, <6, 15, 16>, <6, 15, 19>, <7, 16, 17>, <8, 13, 18>, <8, 16, 18>, <11, 12, 5>, <16, 14, 3>, <16, 18, 19>, <16, 18, 0>, <16, 18, 14>
