Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 14) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) 

Response:
Starting with the given information:
- Total nodes: 15
- Total edges: 60

Let's create the adjacency list based on the edges provided:
1: {3, 4, 10, 12}
2: {3, 4, 12, 13, 14}
3: {1, 2, 8, 11}
4: {1, 2, 6, 8, 14}
5: {6, 11, 12}
6: {4, 5, 8, 11}
7: {0, 10, 13, 14}
8: {3, 4, 6, 9, 12}
9: {0, 8, 14}
10: {1, 7, 12, 13}
11: {3, 5, 6, 7}
12: {1, 2, 5, 8, 10}
13: {2, 7, 10}
14: {2, 4, 7, 9}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 1:
- Neighbors: 3, 4, 10, 12
- No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 2:
- Neighbors: 3, 4, 12, 13, 14
- No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 3:
- Neighbors: 1, 2, 8, 11
- No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 4:
- Neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 8, 14
- No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 5:
- Neighbors: 6, 11, 12
- [1] 3-star can be formed: <5, (6, 11, 12)>

Node 6:
- Neighbors: 4, 5, 8, 11
- [1] 3-star can be formed: <6, (4, 5, 11)>

Node 7:
- Neighbors: 0, 10, 13, 14
- No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 8:
- Neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 9, 12
- [1] 3-star can be formed: <8, (3, 4, 6)>

Node 9:
- Neighbors: 0, 8, 14
- No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 10:
- Neighbors: 1, 7, 12, 13
- No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 11:
- Neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 7
- No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 12:
- Neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 8, 10
- No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 13:
- Neighbors: 2, 7, 10
- No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 14:
- Neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 9
- No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
- <5, (6, 11, 12)>
- <6, (4, 5, 11)>
- <8, (3, 4, 6)>
