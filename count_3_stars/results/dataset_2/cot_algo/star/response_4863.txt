Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 4) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 18) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 4) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 7) (15, 2) (17, 11) (17, 0) (18, 16) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 14) (0, 15) (0, 17) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 3) (3, 6) (3, 14) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 3) (14, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 15) (2, 19) (2, 4) (4, 16) (4, 1) (4, 2) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 15, 17}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 8, 11, 15}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 9, 15, 19}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 16}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7, 11}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 18}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 8, 14, 15}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 7, 13, 15}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 8, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 5, 16, 17}
- Node 13: Neighbors {8, 16, 18}
- Node 14: Neighbors {3, 7, 9, 19}
- Node 15: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 16: Neighbors {4, 11, 13, 18}
- Node 17: Neighbors {0, 11}
- Node 18: Neighbors {6, 13, 16, 19}
- Node 19: Neighbors {2, 14, 18}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1, 8, 15, and 16 have 6 neighbors each, so we have \( \binom{6}{3} \) 3-stars for each of these nodes.
- Node 2, 7, 9, 13, and 14 have 4 neighbors each, so no 3-stars can be formed from these nodes.
- The other nodes have fewer than 3 neighbors and thus do not form any 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars, we get: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \), so the final answer is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 7, 15)>, <15, (1, 7, 8)>, <16, (11, 13, 18)>.
