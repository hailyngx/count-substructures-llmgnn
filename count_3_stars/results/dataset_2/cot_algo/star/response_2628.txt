Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 2) (15, 8) (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 11) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (13, 8) (10, 17) (10, 19) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 19) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 11) (12, 9) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 19) (4, 1) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 16) (19, 10) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 9) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 18) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 18) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 19) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

1. Node 0: {14, 7, 11, 9}
2. Node 1: {16, 4, 19}
3. Node 2: {15, 17, 5}
4. Node 3: {15, 8}
5. Node 4: {1}
6. Node 5: {8, 2}
7. Node 6: {8, 19}
8. Node 7: {0, 12, 16}
9. Node 8: {3, 15, 13, 5, 6}
10. Node 9: {0, 12, 19}
11. Node 10: {17, 19}
12. Node 11: {17, 0, 12, 18}
13. Node 12: {7, 16, 11, 9}
14. Node 13: {8}
15. Node 14: {17, 0}
16. Node 15: {2, 3, 8}
17. Node 16: {1, 7, 12, 18}
18. Node 17: {14, 2, 10, 11}
19. Node 18: {16, 11, 19}
20. Node 19: {10, 6, 1, 18, 9}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 7, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 29 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [29], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (14, 7, 11)>
<7, (0, 12, 16)>
<11, (17, 0, 12)>
<12, (7, 16, 11)>
<15, (2, 3, 8)>
<16, (1, 7, 12)>
<17, (14, 2, 10)>
<18, (16, 11, 19)>
<19, (10, 6, 1)>
