Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 15) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 0) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 5) (15, 4) (15, 10) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 1) (18, 16) (18, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 17) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 19) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 3) (17, 19) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 5) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (19, 0) (19, 17) (19, 16) (5, 10) (5, 1) (5, 11) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 19) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 19}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 11}
- Node 2: {0, 8, 17}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 17}
- Node 4: {9, 10, 15}
- Node 5: {1, 10, 11}
- Node 6: {10, 11, 12, 18}
- Node 7: {3, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {2, 12, 13, 17}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 16}
- Node 10: {4, 5, 6, 7, 15}
- Node 11: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 12: {6, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {7, 8, 12}
- Node 15: {4, 10}
- Node 16: {9, 18, 19}
- Node 17: {2, 3, 8, 19}
- Node 18: {6, 16}
- Node 19: {0, 16, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, Node 8, Node 10, Node 12, Node 13, Node 16, Node 17, and Node 19

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 3, 19)>
<2, (0, 8, 17)>
<3, (0, 7, 17)>
<6, (10, 11, 12)>
<8, (2, 12, 13)>
<10, (4, 5, 6)>
<12, (6, 8, 13)>
<13, (7, 8, 12)>
<16, (9, 18, 19)>
<17, (2, 3, 8)>
