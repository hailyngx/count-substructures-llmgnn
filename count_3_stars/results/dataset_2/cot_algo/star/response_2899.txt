Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 29) (27, 6) (27, 8) (1, 15) (1, 20) (1, 19) (3, 16) (3, 2) (22, 2) (22, 17) (23, 5) (23, 20) (23, 28) (8, 27) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 18) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 9) (6, 27) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 7) (6, 12) (28, 23) (28, 6) (28, 7) (28, 19) (20, 1) (20, 23) (20, 14) (29, 15) (29, 25) (29, 24) (19, 1) (19, 28) (19, 9) (2, 3) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 15) (0, 16) (0, 26) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 25) (24, 6) (24, 29) (24, 4) (24, 5) (14, 20) (14, 9) (26, 0) (5, 23) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 24) (17, 22) (17, 12) (4, 24) (4, 9) (9, 11) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 7) (7, 6) (7, 28) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 18) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 21) (25, 29) (25, 16) (25, 18) (21, 12) (18, 13) (18, 7) (18, 25) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighborhood set for each node:

1: {0, 15, 19, 20}
2: {3, 5, 7, 22}
3: {2, 16}
4: {9, 24}
5: {2, 5, 10, 23, 24}
6: {7, 12, 27, 28, 24}
7: {2, 6, 9, 18, 28}
8: {13, 16, 27}
9: {4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 19}
10: {5, 11}
11: {9, 10}
12: {6, 17, 21}
13: {8, 16, 18}
14: {9, 20}
15: {0, 1, 29}
16: {0, 3, 8, 13, 25}
17: {2, 12}
18: {7, 13, 25}
19: {1, 9, 28}
20: {1, 14, 23}
21: {12}
22: {2, 17}
23: {5, 20, 28}
24: {4, 5, 6, 29}
25: {16, 18, 29}
26: {0}
27: {6, 8}
28: {6, 7, 19, 23}
29: {15, 24, 25}

Now, let's identify nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 1: {0, 15, 19, 20} => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 22} => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 5: {2, 5, 10, 23, 24} => [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 6: {7, 12, 27, 28, 24} => [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 7: {2, 6, 9, 18, 28} => [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 9: {4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 19} => [inom{6}{3}] = 20
Node 13: {8, 16, 18} => [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 16: {0, 3, 8, 13, 25} => [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 18: {7, 13, 25} => [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 19: {1, 9, 28} => [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 20: {1, 14, 23} => [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 24: {4, 5, 6, 29} => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 25: {16, 18, 29} => [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 28: {6, 7, 19, 23} => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 29: {15, 24, 25} => [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Total number of unique 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 67

Therefore, the final answer is [67].
