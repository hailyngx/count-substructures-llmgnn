Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 7) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 12, 2, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 10}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 4, 7, 10, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 5, 11, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8, 2, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 12, 11, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 5, 14, 11}
- Node 7: Neighbors {11, 10, 14, 2, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 10, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 2, 10, 3, 0}
- Node 10: Neighbors {9, 8, 7, 1, 2}
- Node 11: Neighbors {6, 5, 3, 7}
- Node 12: Neighbors {8, 5, 13, 14, 0}
- Node 13: Neighbors {3, 12, 0}
- Node 14: Neighbors {6, 4, 12, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 62

Therefore, the final answer is [62], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 12, 2)>, <2, (9, 4, 10)>, <3, (9, 5, 11)>, <5, (6, 12, 11)>, <7, (11, 10, 14)>, <9, (6, 10, 3)>, <10, (9, 8, 7)>, <12, (8, 5, 14)>
