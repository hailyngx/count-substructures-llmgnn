Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges described by the provided edge list, let's find the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: (3, 9)
- Node 1: (3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 2: (4)
- Node 3: (0, 1, 5, 6)
- Node 4: (1, 2, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 5: (1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 6: (1, 3, 4, 5, 8)
- Node 7: (1, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 8: (4, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 9: (0, 5, 7, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars involving node 1 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars involving node 4 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars involving node 5 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars involving node 6 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars involving node 9 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8)>
