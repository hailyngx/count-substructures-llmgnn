Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
Node 1: {5, 7, 8, 9}
Node 2: {0, 7, 9}
Node 3: {0, 4, 7, 8}
Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 6, 9}
Node 5: {1, 4, 9}
Node 6: {0, 4, 7, 8}
Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 6}
Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the final result is [52].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 9, 2)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
