Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 5) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 2) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 3) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 12) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {9, 6, 13}
- Node 1: {11, 7, 8, 2}
- Node 2: {13, 12, 1}
- Node 3: {8, 14, 6}
- Node 4: {7, 5, 14, 11}
- Node 5: {4, 11, 8, 12}
- Node 6: {10, 13, 0, 3}
- Node 7: {4, 11, 14, 1}
- Node 8: {11, 13, 9, 5, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {10, 8, 13, 0, 12}
- Node 10: {11, 6, 9}
- Node 11: {4, 7, 10, 1, 5, 8}
- Node 12: {9, 2, 5}
- Node 13: {8, 9, 0, 6, 2}
- Node 14: {4, 7, 3}

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 4, 8, 9, 11, 13

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <1, (11, 7, 8)>
- <4, (7, 5, 14)>
- <8, (11, 5, 1)>
- <9, (13, 0, 6)>
- <11, (4, 7, 5)>
- <13, (8, 9, 0)>
