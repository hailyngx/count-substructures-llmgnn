Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 12) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 15) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 15) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 10) (4, 0) (4, 15) (12, 16) (12, 1) (12, 17) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 18) (7, 11) (7, 2) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 2) (15, 4) (18, 6) (18, 10) (18, 17) (10, 19) (10, 18) (17, 5) (17, 12) (17, 18) 

Response:
The 3-star configuration for each node is as follows:

- Node 0: 3-star count = 1
- Node 1: 3-star count = 1
- Node 2: 3-star count = 1
- Node 3: 3-star count = 0
- Node 4: 3-star count = 0
- Node 5: 3-star count = 1
- Node 6: 3-star count = 1
- Node 7: 3-star count = 0
- Node 8: 3-star count = 3
- Node 9: 3-star count = 0
- Node 10: 3-star count = 0
- Node 11: 3-star count = 1
- Node 12: 3-star count = 0
- Node 13: 3-star count = 0
- Node 14: 3-star count = 0
- Node 15: 3-star count = 1
- Node 16: 3-star count = 0
- Node 17: 3-star count = 0
- Node 18: 3-star count = 0
- Node 19: 3-star count = 1

Total 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 3, 14>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 7, 15>
<5, 0, 19>
<6, 1, 11>
<8, 13, 19>
<15, 2, 4>
<1, 12, 17>
<5, 17, 18>
<11, 16, 12>
<8, 14, 19>
