Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 11) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {1, 9, 14}
Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
Node 2: {1, 4, 12}
Node 3: {1, 4, 6, 10}
Node 4: {2, 3, 6, 8, 11}
Node 5: {1, 11, 12}
Node 6: {3, 4, 7, 9}
Node 7: {1, 4, 6, 8, 11}
Node 8: {4, 7, 13}
Node 9: {0, 6, 10, 11, 13}
Node 10: {3, 9, 12, 14}
Node 11: {4, 5, 7, 9, 13}
Node 12: {2, 5, 10, 14}
Node 13: {8, 9, 11, 14}
Node 14: {0, 10, 12, 13}

Next, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
Nodes 1, 4, 11, and 12 have exactly 3 neighbors so we can form 1 3-star with each of them.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by nodes with more than 3 neighbors:

Node 0: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
Node 3: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
Node 6: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
Node 7: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$
Node 9: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$
Node 10: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
Node 13: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is $1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 40$.

Thus, the final number of 3-stars is [40].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<11, (5, 7, 9)>
<12, (5, 10, 14)>
<0, (1, 9, 14)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (4, 8, 11)>
<9, (6, 10, 13)>
<10, (9, 12, 14)>
<13, (8, 11, 14)>
