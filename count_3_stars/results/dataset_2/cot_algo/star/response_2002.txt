Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 4: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives: \([4 + 20 + 4] = [28]\)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
