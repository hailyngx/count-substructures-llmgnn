Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (14, 10) (14, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in this network are:

<6, (1, 3, 2)>
<9, (8, 4, 3)>
<10, (5, 13, 14)>
<11, (8, 6, 12)>
<11, (10, 12, 8)>
<12, (0, 8, 13)>
<13, (5, 7, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in this network is [7].
