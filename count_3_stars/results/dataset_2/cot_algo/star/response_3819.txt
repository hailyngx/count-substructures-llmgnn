Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 1) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 1) (10, 13) (10, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 11) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first list out the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 14, 11, 4}
- Node 1: {12, 5, 2, 10, 11}
- Node 2: {9, 8, 14, 1}
- Node 3: {6, 7, 12, 5, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 11}
- Node 5: {13, 1, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 3, 0}
- Node 7: {6, 8, 3, 14}
- Node 8: {9, 13, 2, 7, 12}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 2, 14, 12}
- Node 10: {13, 1}
- Node 11: {13, 0, 1, 4}
- Node 12: {9, 8, 3, 1}
- Node 13: {8, 5, 11, 10}
- Node 14: {9, 7, 0, 2}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 56 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (6, 14, 11)>
- <1, (12, 5, 2)>
- <2, (9, 8, 14)>
- <3, (6, 7, 12)>
- <4, (3, 0, 11)>
- <5, (13, 1, 3)>
- <6, (9, 7, 3)>
- <7, (8, 6, 3)>
- <8, (9, 13, 2)>
- <9, (12, 8, 14)>
- <12, (9, 8, 3)>
- <13, (8, 5, 11)>
- <14, (9, 7, 2)>
