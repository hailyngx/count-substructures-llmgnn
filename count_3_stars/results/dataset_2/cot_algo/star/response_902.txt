Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 23) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 0) (9, 28) (9, 27) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 27) (3, 13) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 21) (25, 3) (25, 10) (25, 8) (28, 9) (28, 8) (29, 9) (0, 9) (0, 4) (7, 20) (7, 2) (15, 1) (15, 26) (15, 2) (6, 21) (6, 27) (6, 16) (21, 11) (21, 6) (23, 5) (23, 11) (26, 5) (26, 15) (26, 20) (26, 12) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 15) (2, 12) (12, 26) (12, 2) (12, 24) (22, 4) (22, 14) (8, 25) (8, 28) (8, 20) (8, 16) (4, 0) (4, 22) (16, 6) (16, 8) (16, 24) (16, 13) (16, 20) (24, 12) (24, 16) (24, 13) (24, 18) (14, 22) (14, 20) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 8) (20, 16) (20, 14) (18, 24) (18, 27) (18, 13) (27, 9) (27, 3) (27, 6) (27, 18) (27, 13) (13, 3) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 18) (13, 27) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4, 9
- Node 1: 3, 10, 15
- Node 2: 5, 7, 12, 15
- Node 3: 1, 13, 25, 27
- Node 4: 0, 22
- Node 5: 2, 9, 12, 15, 23, 26
- Node 6: 16, 21, 27
- Node 7: 2, 20
- Node 8: 16, 20, 25, 28
- Node 9: 0, 5, 9, 27, 28, 29
- Node 10: 1, 11, 25
- Node 11: 10, 21, 23
- Node 12: 2, 5, 12, 15, 26
- Node 13: 3, 16, 18, 24, 27
- Node 14: 20, 22
- Node 15: 1, 2, 5, 12, 26
- Node 16: 6, 8, 13, 16, 20, 24
- Node 18: 13, 24, 27
- Node 20: 7, 8, 14, 16, 20, 26
- Node 21: 6, 11
- Node 22: 4, 14
- Node 23: 5, 11
- Node 24: 12, 13, 16, 18
- Node 25: 3, 8, 10
- Node 26: 5, 12, 15, 20
- Node 27: 3, 6, 9, 13, 18, 27
- Node 28: 8, 9
- Node 29: 9

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 20, 24, 25, 27

For each of these nodes, we will calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars they participate in. 

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 128

Therefore, the final answer is [128]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 3, 10>
- <3, 25, 27>
- <5, 12, 15>
- <5, 9, 27>
- <9, 27, 28>
- <10, 11, 25>
- <12, 15, 26>
- <13, 16, 18>
- <13, 27, 18>
- <16, 18, 27>
- <16, 20, 24>
- <20, 24, 16>
