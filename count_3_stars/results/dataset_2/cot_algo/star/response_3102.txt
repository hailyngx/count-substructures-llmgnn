Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 1) (12, 4) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 1) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 10) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8, 14, 3}
- Node 1: {7, 5, 10}
- Node 2: {7, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {9, 0, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 12, 13, 0, 5, 11}
- Node 5: {4, 14, 1}
- Node 6: {7, 2, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 10, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {14, 11, 0, 12}
- Node 9: {2, 14, 10, 3, 12}
- Node 10: {7, 9, 13, 1}
- Node 11: {4, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {4, 9, 8, 11}
- Node 13: {4, 6, 10}
- Node 14: {9, 8, 0, 3, 5}

Next, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the total 3-stars:
- Node 0, 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1, 3-stars: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 2, 3-stars: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 3, 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4, 3-stars: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 5, 3-stars: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 6, 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7, 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8, 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9, 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 10, 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 11, 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 12, 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 13, 3-stars: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 14, 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 75
