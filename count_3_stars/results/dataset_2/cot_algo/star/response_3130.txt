Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 27) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 20) (4, 15) (7, 19) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 23) (3, 22) (8, 1) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 15) (18, 9) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 28) (22, 3) (22, 18) (22, 5) (22, 15) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 20) (29, 16) (29, 23) (29, 12) (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 24) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 19) (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 20) (17, 7) (17, 14) (17, 28) (17, 21) (21, 13) (21, 17) (21, 0) (28, 18) (28, 14) (28, 17) (28, 10) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 6) (23, 3) (23, 29) (11, 15) (12, 4) (12, 29) (12, 6) (12, 10) (25, 9) (25, 16) (27, 9) (27, 24) (27, 20) (10, 3) (10, 28) (10, 12) (24, 5) (24, 27) (0, 3) (0, 21) (0, 15) (20, 4) (20, 2) (20, 14) (20, 27) (16, 2) (16, 29) (16, 25) (15, 4) (15, 13) (15, 22) (15, 11) (15, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0 neighbors: 3, 21, 15
- Node 1 neighbors: 3, 8
- Node 2 neighbors: 4, 16, 18, 20
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 8, 10, 22, 23
- Node 4 neighbors: 2, 12, 15, 19, 20
- Node 5 neighbors: 6, 22, 24
- Node 6 neighbors: 5, 12, 19
- Node 7 neighbors: 14, 17, 19
- Node 8 neighbors: 1, 3, 13
- Node 9 neighbors: 18, 25, 27
- Node 10 neighbors: 3, 12, 28
- Node 11 neighbors: 15
- Node 12 neighbors: 4, 6, 10, 29
- Node 13 neighbors: 8, 15, 21
- Node 14 neighbors: 7, 17, 20, 28
- Node 15 neighbors: 0, 4, 11, 13, 22
- Node 16 neighbors: 2, 25, 29
- Node 17 neighbors: 7, 14, 21, 28
- Node 18 neighbors: 2, 9, 22, 28
- Node 19 neighbors: 4, 6, 7
- Node 20 neighbors: 2, 4, 14, 27
- Node 21 neighbors: 0, 13, 17
- Node 22 neighbors: 3, 5, 15, 18
- Node 23 neighbors: 3, 29
- Node 24 neighbors: 5, 27
- Node 25 neighbors: 9, 16
- Node 27 neighbors: 9, 20, 24
- Node 28 neighbors: 10, 14, 17, 18
- Node 29 neighbors: 12, 16, 23

Next, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star configuration:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (4, 20, 14)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 8, 22)>, <3, (0, 21, 15)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (12, 15, 19)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (22, 6, 24)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (19, 14, 17)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (18, 25, 27)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (4, 6, 10)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (8, 15, 21)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (0, 4, 22)>, <15, (13, 11, 0)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star: <16, (2, 25, 29)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star: <17, (7, 14, 28)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star: <18, (2, 22, 28)>
- Node 20 forms a 3-star: <20, (4, 14, 27)>

Finally, count the total number of unique 3-stars to obtain the final answer:

Total = 14, so the answer is [14].
