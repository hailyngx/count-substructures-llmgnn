Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 8, and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each.

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 42 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
