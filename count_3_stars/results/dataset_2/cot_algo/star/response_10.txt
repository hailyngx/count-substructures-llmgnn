Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 19) (9, 17) (9, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (18, 16) (5, 4) (5, 16) (13, 7) (3, 11) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 15) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 16) (12, 2) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 19) (1, 11) (1, 8) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 17) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 16) (14, 8) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 13) (7, 8) (7, 17) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 8) (0, 8) (17, 9) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 7) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {8}
- Node 1: {8, 11}
- Node 2: {6, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 3: {11}
- Node 4: {5, 10, 12, 16}
- Node 5: {4, 16}
- Node 6: {2, 15, 19}
- Node 7: {8, 13, 17}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 9: {10, 17}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 3, 15}
- Node 12: {2, 4, 10, 17, 19}
- Node 13: {7}
- Node 14: {8}
- Node 15: {6, 11, 16, 19}
- Node 16: {4, 5, 15, 18}
- Node 17: {7, 9, 12, 19}
- Node 18: {16}
- Node 19: {6, 12, 15, 17}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (10, 12, 4)>, <8, (10, 12, 4)>, <8, (10, 12, 17)>, <8, (10, 12, 4)>, <8, (10, 17, 12)>, <8, (10, 17, 4)>, <8, (10, 4, 12)>, <8, (10, 4, 17)>, <10, (2, 12, 4)>, <10, (8, 12, 4)>, <10, (8, 12, 17)>, <10, (8, 12, 4)>, <10, (8, 17, 12)>, <10, (8, 17, 4)>, <10, (8, 4, 12)>, <10, (8, 4, 17)>, <12, (2, 10, 4)>, <12, (8, 10, 4)>, <12, (8, 10, 17)>, <12, (8, 10, 4)>, <12, (8, 17, 10)>, <12, (8, 4, 10)>, <12, (8, 4, 17)>, <15, (11, 16, 6)>, <15, (11, 16, 19)>, <15, (6, 16, 11)>, <15, (6, 18, 16)>, <16, (15, 4, 18)>, <16, (15, 5, 4)>, <16, (15, 5, 18)>, <16, (4, 15, 5)>, <16, (4, 15, 18)>, <16, (4, 5, 15)>, <16, (4, 5, 18)>, <16, (5, 15, 4)>, <16, (5, 15, 18)>, <16, (5, 4, 15)>, <16, (5, 4, 18)>, <17, (7, 12, 19)>, <17, (7, 19, 12)>, <17, (12, 7, 19)>, <17, (12, 19, 7)>.
