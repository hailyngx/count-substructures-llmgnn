Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3}

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- For Node 0: It has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 1: It has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 2: It has 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 3: It has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 5: It has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 7: It has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 8: It has 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 9: It has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 44

So, the final number inside brackets is [44].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
