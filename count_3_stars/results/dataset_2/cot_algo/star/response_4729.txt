Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 16) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 12) (10, 15) (10, 2) (11, 18) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 3) (4, 9) (8, 19) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 9) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 6) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 0) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 0) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 1) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 6) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 9) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 15) (6, 16) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 19) (0, 12) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 12, 17, 19}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 10, 15, 18}
- Node 3: {7, 9, 17, 18}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {1, 12}
- Node 6: {15, 16}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 14}
- Node 8: {19}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 13}
- Node 10: {2, 15}
- Node 11: {18}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 17}
- Node 13: {9, 15, 19}
- Node 14: {7, 16}
- Node 15: {2, 6, 10, 13, 18}
- Node 16: {6, 14, 19}
- Node 17: {0, 3, 12}
- Node 18: {2, 3, 11, 15}
- Node 19: {0, 8, 13, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0, Node 12, Node 15, Node 18, and Node 19 can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 15 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 29 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [29].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 17)>
- <0, (1, 19, 12)>
- <0, (2, 12, 17)>
- <0, (12, 17, 19)>
- <0, (1, 19, 17)>
- <12, (0, 5, 17)>
- <12, (0, 17, 19)>
- <15, (2, 6, 10)>
- <15, (2, 13, 18)>
- <15, (6, 16, 19)>
- <15, (2, 10, 18)>
- <18, (2, 3, 15)>
- <18, (3, 15, 18)>
- <19, (8, 16, 13)>
- <19, (8, 16, 0)>
- <19, (13, 16, 0)>
- <19, (13, 16, 6)>
