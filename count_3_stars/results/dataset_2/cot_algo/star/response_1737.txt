Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1, 2, 10, 12, and 29 each have 3 neighbors, so each contributes 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is $10+10+10+4+4+4+4+4+4+1+1+1+1+1 = 53$. Hence, the final number inside brackets is [53].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <11, 16, 18>
- <5, 9, 16>
- <13, 18, 25>
- <14, 17, 22>
- <1, 5, 16>
- <1, 11, 29>
- <2, 7, 11>
- <2, 10, 12>
- <4, 13, 18>
- <8, 9, 25>
- <16, 24, 29>
- <20, 7, 15>
