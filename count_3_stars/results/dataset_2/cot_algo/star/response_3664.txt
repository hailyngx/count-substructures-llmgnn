Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 6) (27, 15) (27, 11) (27, 9) (27, 6) (6, 15) (6, 27) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 27) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 0) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 26) (13, 11) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 14) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 28) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 16) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 23) (14, 0) (14, 21) (1, 26) (1, 5) (1, 22) (26, 8) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 17) (20, 15) (20, 18) (20, 2) (20, 28) (4, 18) (4, 28) (4, 21) (4, 3) (18, 7) (18, 20) (18, 4) (18, 25) (22, 1) (22, 26) (22, 5) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 3) (2, 20) (16, 12) (16, 5) (17, 26) (17, 25) (17, 3) (25, 9) (25, 18) (25, 17) (25, 19) (25, 29) (29, 7) (29, 25) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 17) (11, 27) (11, 13) (5, 1) (5, 22) (5, 16) (19, 6) (19, 25) (19, 28) (28, 7) (28, 20) (28, 4) (28, 19) (21, 14) (21, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {9, 10, 14}
- Node 1: {5, 22, 26}
- Node 2: {20}
- Node 3: {4, 10, 17}
- Node 4: {3, 18, 21, 28}
- Node 5: {1, 16, 22}
- Node 6: {9, 15, 19, 27}
- Node 7: {12, 18, 28, 29}
- Node 8: {10, 23, 26}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 25, 27}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 11: {13, 27}
- Node 12: {7, 16}
- Node 13: {11}
- Node 14: {0, 21, 23}
- Node 15: {6, 20, 27}
- Node 16: {5, 12}
- Node 17: {3, 25, 26}
- Node 18: {4, 7, 20, 25}
- Node 19: {6, 25, 28}
- Node 20: {2, 15, 18, 28}
- Node 21: {4, 14}
- Node 22: {1, 5, 26}
- Node 23: {8, 14, 26}
- Node 25: {9, 17, 18, 19, 29}
- Node 26: {1, 8, 17, 22, 23}
- Node 27: {6, 9, 11, 15}
- Node 28: {4, 7, 19, 20}
- Node 29: {7, 25}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 10: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 11: [inom{2}{3}] = [0]
- Node 12: [inom{2}{3}] = [0]
- Node 13: [inom{1}{3}] = [0]
- Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 15: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 16: [inom{2}{3}] = [0]
- Node 17: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 18: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 19: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 20: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 21: [inom{2}{3}] = [0]
- Node 22: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 23: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 25: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 26: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 27: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 28: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 29: [inom{2}{3}] = [0]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives: [55]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 9, 10>
- <0, 9, 14>
- <0, 10, 14>
- <0, 14, 21>
- <1, 5, 22>
- <3, 4, 18>
- <3, 10, 17>
- <3, 17, 25>
- <4, 18, 25>
- <6, 9, 27>
- <7, 18, 28>
- <8, 10, 26>
- <9, 19, 25>
- <15, 20, 27>
- <20, 18, 28>
- <25, 18, 29>
- <26, 17, 25>
- <26, 22, 1>
- <26, 23, 8>
- <27, 6, 15>
