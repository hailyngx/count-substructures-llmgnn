Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 0) (22, 4) (22, 17) (22, 25) (2, 18) (2, 28) (2, 12) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 20) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 21) (5, 28) (8, 25) (8, 1) (19, 25) (19, 24) (19, 16) (4, 22) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 29) (12, 2) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 27) (7, 3) (16, 19) (16, 7) (16, 14) (16, 15) (17, 22) (17, 5) (17, 25) (17, 28) (25, 22) (25, 8) (25, 19) (25, 17) (25, 26) (23, 26) (23, 1) (26, 25) (26, 23) (26, 0) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (1, 8) (1, 23) (1, 29) (29, 4) (29, 1) (29, 11) (11, 18) (11, 7) (11, 29) (11, 14) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 26) (0, 10) (0, 3) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (14, 16) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 15) (15, 16) (15, 14) (21, 5) (21, 24) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 27) (28, 2) (28, 5) (28, 17) (28, 27) (20, 18) (24, 19) (24, 21) (27, 7) (27, 9) (27, 28) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's identify the 3-star configurations:

1. Node 2 has neighbors: {18, 28, 12}. By applying \( \binom{3}{3} \), we find 1 3-star.
   Unique 3-star: <2, (18, 28, 12)>

2. Node 4 has neighbors: {22, 9, 0, 29}. By applying \( \binom{4}{3} \), we find 4 3-stars.
   Unique 3-stars: <4, (22, 9, 0)>, <4, (22, 9, 29)>, <4, (22, 0, 29)>, <4, (9, 0, 29)>

3. Node 5 has neighbors: {13, 17, 21, 28}. By applying \( \binom{4}{3} \), we find 4 3-stars.
   Unique 3-stars: <5, (13, 17, 21)>, <5, (13, 17, 28)>, <5, (13, 21, 28)>, <5, (17, 21, 28)>

4. Node 7 has neighbors: {16, 11, 27, 3}. By applying \( \binom{4}{3} \), we find 4 3-stars.
   Unique 3-stars: <7, (16, 11, 27)>, <7, (16, 11, 3)>, <7, (16, 27, 3)>, <7, (11, 27, 3)>

5. Node 9 has neighbors: {4, 10, 3, 27}. By applying \( \binom{4}{3} \), we find 4 3-stars.
   Unique 3-stars: <9, (4, 10, 3)>, <9, (4, 10, 27)>, <9, (4, 3, 27)>, <9, (10, 3, 27)>

6. Node 11 has neighbors: {18, 7, 29, 14}. By applying \( \binom{4}{3} \), we find 4 3-stars.
   Unique 3-stars: <11, (18, 7, 29)>, <11, (18, 7, 14)>, <11, (18, 29, 14)>, <11, (7, 29, 14)>

7. Node 16 has neighbors: {19, 7, 14, 15}. By applying \( \binom{4}{3} \), we find 4 3-stars.
   Unique 3-stars: <16, (19, 7, 14)>, <16, (19, 7, 15)>, <16, (19, 14, 15)>, <16, (7, 14, 15)>

8. Node 17 has neighbors: {22, 5, 25, 28}. By applying \( \binom{4}{3} \), we find 4 3-stars.
   Unique 3-stars: <17, (22, 5, 25)>, <17, (22, 5, 28)>, <17, (22, 25, 28)>, <17, (5, 25, 28)>

9. Node 18 has neighbors: {2, 11, 20}. By applying \( \binom{3}{3} \), we find 1 3-star.
   Unique 3-star: <18, (2, 11, 20)>

10. Node 25 has neighbors: {22, 8, 19, 17, 26}. By applying \( \binom{5}{3} \), we find 10 3-stars.
    Unique 3-stars: <25, (22, 8, 19)>, <25, (22, 8, 17)>, <25, (22, 8, 26)>, <25, (22, 19, 17)>, <25, (22, 19, 26)>, <25, (22, 17, 26)>, <25, (8, 19, 17)>, <25, (8, 19, 26)>, <25, (8, 17, 26)>, <25, (19, 17, 26)>

Summing up the total number of unique 3-stars, we get 32. So, the final answer is [32].
