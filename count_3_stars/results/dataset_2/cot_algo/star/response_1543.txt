Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 14) (8, 10) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 18) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 17) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 17) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 14) (19, 2) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 16) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (16, 7) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 18) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 15) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 7) (2, 3) (2, 19) (15, 0) (15, 7) (15, 17) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 9) (9, 17) (9, 10) (18, 13) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 17) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighborhood sets for each node:

1: {3, 5, 13}
2: {3, 19}
3: {1, 2, 5, 12}
4: {10, 12, 16}
5: {1, 3, 6, 14}
6: {5, 17}
7: {0, 14, 15, 16}
8: {10, 14}
9: {10, 17}
10: {4, 8, 13, 9}
12: {3, 4, 16, 18}
13: {1, 10, 18}
14: {5, 7, 8}
15: {0, 7, 17}
16: {4, 7, 12, 18}
17: {0, 6, 9, 15, 18}
18: {12, 13, 16, 17}
19: {2}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 5, and 13: <1, (3, 5, 13)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 2, and 5: <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 3, and 6: <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 15, and 17: <7, (0, 15, 17)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 8, and 13: <10, (4, 8, 13)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 16, and 18: <12, (4, 16, 18)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 7, and 8: <14, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with leaves 7, 12, and 18: <16, (7, 12, 18)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 6, and 9: <17, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with leaves 12, 13, and 16: <18, (12, 13, 16)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are 9 of them. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
