Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 9) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 26) (14, 26) (14, 23) (17, 10) (10, 17) (10, 0) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 13) (20, 18) (20, 4) (25, 20) (25, 0) (25, 24) (23, 14) (23, 24) (23, 28) (23, 27) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 21) (12, 22) (12, 19) (28, 11) (28, 23) (28, 19) (28, 15) (4, 16) (4, 20) (4, 27) (4, 1) (27, 23) (27, 4) (27, 21) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 24) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 3) (26, 16) (26, 14) (26, 20) (0, 10) (0, 25) (0, 1) (3, 7) (3, 29) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 24) (6, 22) (6, 15) (21, 12) (21, 27) (21, 5) (13, 20) (13, 29) (13, 2) (5, 12) (5, 21) (18, 16) (18, 20) (18, 29) (22, 12) (22, 6) (24, 25) (24, 23) (24, 9) (24, 2) (24, 1) (15, 11) (15, 28) (15, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 24) (19, 12) (19, 28) 

Response:
There are multiple steps to solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 10, 25, 1
- Node 1: 4, 24, 0
- Node 2: 9, 3, 13, 24
- Node 3: 7, 29, 2
- Node 4: 16, 20, 27, 1
- Node 5: 12, 21
- Node 6: 22, 15
- Node 7: 12, 3
- Node 9: 11, 2, 24
- Node 10: 17, 0
- Node 11: 16, 28, 9, 15
- Node 12: 7, 5, 21, 19, 22
- Node 13: 20, 29, 2
- Node 14: 26, 23
- Node 15: 11, 28, 6
- Node 16: 11, 18, 4, 26
- Node 17: 10
- Node 18: 16, 20, 29
- Node 19: 12, 28
- Node 20: 25, 26, 13, 18, 4
- Node 21: 12, 27, 5
- Node 22: 12, 6
- Node 23: 14, 24, 28, 27
- Node 24: 25, 23, 9, 2, 1
- Node 25: 20, 0, 24
- Node 26: 16, 14, 20
- Node 27: 4, 23, 21
- Node 28: 11, 23, 19, 15
- Node 29: 13, 18, 3

2. Identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Total 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

Unique 3-stars found:
<12, (5, 21, 22)>
<12, (7, 19, 22)>
<12, (5, 19, 21)>
<12, (5, 19, 22)>
<12, (5, 19, 21)>
<23, (14, 28, 27)>
<23, (24, 28, 27)>
<23, (24, 28, 27)>
<23, (24, 28, 27)>
<24, (9, 2, 1)>
<24, (23, 9, 1)>
<24, (23, 2, 1)>
<24, (23, 9, 2)>
<24, (23, 9, 2)>
<24, (23, 9, 1)>
<24, (23, 9, 2)>
<24, (23, 9, 1)>
<24, (23, 2, 1)>
<24, (23, 9, 2)>
<24, (23, 9, 1)>
