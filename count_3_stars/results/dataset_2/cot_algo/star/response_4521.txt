Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 5, 9, 2, 8, 4
- Node 1: 5, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 9, 8, 4, 0
- Node 3: 9, 1, 8, 4
- Node 4: 1, 3, 2, 0
- Node 5: 6, 1, 0, 7
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6, 1, 8
- Node 8: 9, 3, 2, 0, 7
- Node 9: 8, 2, 3, 0

Next, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors in order to potentially form 3-stars. Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 8 satisfy this criterion.

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 1 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 32 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <3, 4, 8>
