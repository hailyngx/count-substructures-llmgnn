Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 3, 8, 2}
- Node 1: {5, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 8, 0}
- Node 3: {9, 7, 0}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 8, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 8, 1}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {5, 4, 6, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 3, 1, 0}

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: [inom{5}{3} = 10]
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3} = 10]
- Node 9: [inom{6}{3} = 20]

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 56

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
