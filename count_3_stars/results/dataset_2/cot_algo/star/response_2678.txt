Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 13) (10, 7) (10, 1) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 13) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 16) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 12) (0, 3) (0, 18) (16, 13) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 0) (7, 10) (7, 11) (14, 5) (14, 15) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 15) (4, 17) (4, 1) (4, 19) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 14) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can construct the following adjacency list for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 18}
- Node 1: {4, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {9, 15}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 11}
- Node 4: {1, 17, 19}
- Node 5: {3, 13, 14, 18}
- Node 6: {8, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {10, 11}
- Node 8: {6, 12}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 13, 17}
- Node 10: {1, 7}
- Node 11: {3, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 12: {1, 8, 14, 19}
- Node 13: {5, 9, 11, 16}
- Node 14: {5, 12, 15}
- Node 15: {2, 14, 19}
- Node 16: {13}
- Node 17: {4, 9, 18}
- Node 18: {0, 5, 17, 19}
- Node 19: {4, 12, 15, 18}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph by examining each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 5: <5, (3, 13, 18)>
- Node 9: <9, (2, 13, 17)>
- Node 12: <12, (1, 14, 19)>
- Node 13: <13, (5, 9, 11)>
- Node 18: <18, (0, 17, 19)>, <18, (5, 17, 19)>
- Node 19: <19, (4, 12, 15)>, <19, (12, 15, 18)>

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the answer is [9].
