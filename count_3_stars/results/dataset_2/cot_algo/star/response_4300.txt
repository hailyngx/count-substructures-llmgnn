Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 2) (2, 17) (2, 1) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 0) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 8) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 11) (5, 15) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 19) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 10) (0, 18) (0, 16) (0, 13) (8, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (19, 6) (19, 3) (16, 0) (16, 13) (11, 18) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 19) (9, 11) (9, 15) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 9) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 8) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 16) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {18, 16, 13}
- Node 1: {17, 2, 12, 10}
- Node 2: {17, 1}
- Node 3: {14, 17, 5, 19}
- Node 4: {14, 18, 13, 11}
- Node 5: {15, 3, 10, 6}
- Node 6: {10, 15, 19}
- Node 8: {12, 10, 11}
- Node 9: {11, 15}
- Node 10: {12, 5, 6, 1, 8}
- Node 11: {18, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 12: {10, 1, 8}
- Node 13: {14, 4, 0, 16}
- Node 14: {3, 4, 13}
- Node 15: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 16: {0, 13}
- Node 17: {1, 3, 2}
- Node 18: {4, 11, 0}
- Node 19: {6, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: Can form a 3-star with (18, 16, 13)
- Node 1: Can form a 3-star with (17, 2, 12), (17, 2, 10), (17, 12, 10)
- Node 3: Can form a 3-star with (14, 17, 5), (14, 17, 19), (14, 5, 19), (17, 5, 19)
- Node 4: Can form a 3-star with (14, 18, 13), (18, 13, 16)
- Node 5: Can form a 3-star with (15, 3, 6), (15, 3, 10), (15, 6, 10)
- Node 6: Can form a 3-star with (15, 3, 19), (15, 5, 19)
- Node 10: Can form a 3-star with (12, 1, 8), (12, 1, 10), (12, 8, 10), (1, 8, 10), (5, 6, 10), (5, 10, 1), (5, 10, 8), (6, 10, 1), (6, 10, 8), (10, 1, 8)
- Node 11: Can form a 3-star with (18, 4, 8)
- Node 12: Can form a 3-star with (10, 1, 8)
- Node 13: Can form a 3-star with (14, 4, 0)
- Node 14: Can form a 3-star with (3, 4, 13)
- Node 15: Can form a 3-star with (5, 6, 9)
- Node 16: Can form a 3-star with (0, 13, 18)

Counting them all up, we get a total of 19 unique 3-stars. 
Thus, the final answer is [19]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 13, 16>
<0, 13, 18>
<0, 13, 4>
<0, 16, 13>
<10, 1, 12>
<10, 1, 8>
<10, 1, 8>
<10, 5, 6>
<10, 5, 6>
<10, 5, 15>
<10, 6, 15>
<11, 18, 4>
<12, 1, 10>
<14, 3, 4>
<15, 5, 6>
<15, 5, 9>
<15, 6, 9>
<17, 12, 2>
<17, 2, 1>
<17, 2, 10>
