Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 13) (2, 4) (29, 2) (29, 4) (29, 24) (29, 21) (18, 27) (18, 24) (22, 5) (22, 15) (22, 3) (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 19) (20, 23) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 26) (10, 17) (10, 15) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 11) (8, 19) (8, 26) (8, 12) (23, 20) (23, 14) (1, 15) (1, 5) (26, 25) (26, 8) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 19) (21, 29) (21, 28) (21, 13) (21, 27) (28, 21) (28, 11) (28, 12) (11, 20) (11, 17) (11, 28) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 9) (13, 2) (13, 21) (15, 22) (15, 10) (15, 1) (9, 7) (9, 16) (9, 19) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 9) (19, 6) (14, 20) (14, 23) (16, 9) (16, 27) (5, 22) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 27) (3, 22) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 12) (24, 29) (24, 18) (27, 18) (27, 21) (27, 16) (27, 5) (12, 8) (12, 28) (12, 3) (6, 19) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 2) (4, 29) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {17, 7, 19}
- Node 1: {15, 5}
- Node 2: {29, 13, 4}
- Node 3: {22, 5, 12, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 29, 6}
- Node 5: {22, 1, 27, 3}
- Node 6: {19, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {17, 0, 9}
- Node 8: {19, 26, 12}
- Node 9: {7, 16, 19}
- Node 10: {17, 15}
- Node 11: {20, 17, 28}
- Node 12: {8, 28, 3}
- Node 13: {2, 21}
- Node 14: {20, 23}
- Node 15: {22, 1, 10}
- Node 16: {9, 27}
- Node 17: {10, 0, 7, 11}
- Node 18: {27, 24}
- Node 19: {20, 8, 0, 6, 9}
- Node 20: {25, 14, 19, 11, 23}
- Node 21: {29, 28, 13, 27}
- Node 22: {5, 15, 3}
- Node 23: {20, 14}
- Node 24: {29, 18}
- Node 25: {20, 26}
- Node 26: {25, 8}
- Node 27: {18, 21, 16, 5}
- Node 28: {21, 11, 12}
- Node 29: {2, 4, 24, 21}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 2: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 19: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 20: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 21: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 27: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 29: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (29, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 29, 6)>
<5, (22, 1, 27)>
<6, (19, 3, 4)>
<12, (8, 28, 3)>
<19, (20, 8, 0)>
<20, (25, 14, 19)>
<21, (29, 28, 27)>
<27, (18, 21, 16)>
<29, (2, 4, 24)>
