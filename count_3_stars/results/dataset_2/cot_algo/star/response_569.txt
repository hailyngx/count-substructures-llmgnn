Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 19) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 19) (14, 2) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 4) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 19) (2, 14) (2, 3) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 15) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (12, 9) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 15) (0, 3) (0, 19) (0, 13) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 0) (8, 5) (8, 15) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 1
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 1
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 4

Based on the degrees, we can now identify the 3-stars:

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: <4, (10, 9, 18)>
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: <9, (4, 12, 15)>
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: <16, (9, 11, 19)>
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: <17, (4, 6, 18)>
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: <18, (4, 9, 17)>
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: <19, (0, 10, 16)>

The total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [8].
