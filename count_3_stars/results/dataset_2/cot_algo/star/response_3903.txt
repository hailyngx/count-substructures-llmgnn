Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 17) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 24) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 25) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 28) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 0) (18, 15) (22, 4) (17, 3) (17, 20) (17, 21) (29, 9) (29, 6) (21, 17) (21, 28) (21, 25) (28, 7) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 27) (28, 13) (6, 15) (6, 29) (6, 24) (20, 17) (20, 14) (20, 16) (25, 4) (25, 7) (25, 21) (25, 27) (13, 15) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 28) (10, 19) (14, 20) (14, 8) (14, 2) (26, 2) (27, 28) (27, 25) (27, 11) (24, 15) (24, 6) (24, 5) (24, 19) (11, 7) (11, 27) (11, 0) (11, 23) (5, 24) (5, 23) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 12) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 28) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 19) (2, 14) (2, 26) (2, 16) (8, 14) (8, 9) (12, 23) (12, 19) (19, 10) (19, 24) (19, 0) (19, 12) (16, 20) (16, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 11, 19, 28}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 13}
- Node 2: {14, 16, 26}
- Node 3: {1, 15, 17}
- Node 4: {1, 13, 22, 25}
- Node 5: {23, 24}
- Node 6: {15, 24, 29}
- Node 7: {11, 25, 27, 28}
- Node 8: {9, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 8, 19, 29}
- Node 10: {19}
- Node 11: {0, 7, 23, 27}
- Node 12: {19, 23}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 13, 15, 28}
- Node 14: {2, 8, 16, 20}
- Node 15: {3, 6, 13, 24}
- Node 16: {2, 14, 20}
- Node 17: {3, 20, 21}
- Node 18: {15}
- Node 19: {0, 9, 10, 12, 24}
- Node 20: {14, 16, 17}
- Node 21: {17, 25, 28}
- Node 22: {4}
- Node 23: {5, 11, 12}
- Node 24: {5, 6, 15, 19}
- Node 25: {4, 7, 21, 27}
- Node 26: {2}
- Node 27: {7, 11, 25, 28}
- Node 28: {0, 7, 13, 21, 27}
- Node 29: {6, 9}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 13: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 15: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 19: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 20: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 21: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 23: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 24: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 25: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 27: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [45].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 11, 28)>
<1, (0, 4, 13)>
<4, (1, 13, 25)>
<7, (11, 21, 27)>
<13, (1, 15, 28)>
<14, (8, 16, 20)>
<15, (6, 24, 19)>
<19, (0, 9, 24)>
<20, (14, 16, 17)>
<21, (17, 25, 28)>
<23, (5, 11, 12)>
<24, (5, 6, 19)>
<25, (4, 7, 27)>
