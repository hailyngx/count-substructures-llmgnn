Now let's find the 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 19, 24, 28

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, 10, 11>, <3, 9, 15>, <3, 9, 13>, <3, 9, 14>, <10, 11, 7>, <10, 11, 3>, <10, 11, 8>, <10, 11, 25>, <10, 3, 11>, <11, 3, 10>, <12, 19, 4>, <12, 19, 18>, <12, 19, 1>, <12, 19, 14>, <12, 18, 10>, <13, 0, 9>, <13, 0, 14>, <13, 9, 15>, <13, 9, 21>, <15, 2, 3>, <15, 2, 24>, <15, 3, 4>, <15, 3, 10>, <19, 1, 12>, <19, 1, 17>, <19, 1, 24>, <19, 1, 14>, <19, 4, 12>, <24, 1, 13>, <24, 1, 2>, <24, 2, 6>, <28, 12, 27>, <28, 12, 15>, <28, 12, 16>, <28, 12, 26>, <28, 15, 2>, <28, 15, 9>, <28, 15, 16>, <28, 15, 27>, <28, 16, 0>, <28, 16, 27>, <28, 16, 15>, <28, 27, 12>, <28, 27, 16>
