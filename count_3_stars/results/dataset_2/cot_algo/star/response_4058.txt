Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 14) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 15) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 3) (7, 10) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 18) (16, 7) (2, 3) (12, 14) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 1) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 6) (1, 18) (1, 6) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 14) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 15) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 13) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 15) 

Response:
There are \( \binom{20}{3} = 1140 \) possible 3-stars in this graph. 

After analyzing the given edges, here is the list of unique 3-stars found: 
<18, (10, 7, 1)>
<7, (10, 16, 11)>
<4, (17, 8, 13)>
<8, (9, 4, 11)>
<15, (0, 18, 13)>
<11, (8, 7, 13)>
<3, (9, 8, 2)>
<6, (17, 19, 1)> 

There are 8 unique 3-stars found in this graph, so the final answer is [8].
