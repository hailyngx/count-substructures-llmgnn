Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 2 has neighbors {18, 9, 11}
- Node 4 has neighbors {18, 19, 24}
- Node 9 has neighbors {2, 18, 28, 0, 13}
- Node 11 has neighbors {2, 27, 14}
- Node 12 has neighbors {16, 29, 8}
- Node 14 has neighbors {23, 28, 25, 11, 5}
- Node 15 has neighbors {19, 13, 16}
- Node 16 has neighbors {15, 12, 24}
- Node 18 has neighbors {2, 4, 9, 17, 25}
- Node 19 has neighbors {23, 4, 21, 15, 24}
- Node 23 has neighbors {26, 14, 19, 28}
- Node 24 has neighbors {4, 21, 16, 5, 19}
- Node 25 has neighbors {18, 1, 28, 14}
- Node 26 has neighbors {23, 1, 10}
- Node 28 has neighbors {23, 9, 14, 25}
- Node 29 has neighbors {0, 12, 3}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2, 3 neighbors -> 0 3-stars
- Node 4, 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 9, 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11, 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 12, 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14, 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15, 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 16, 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18, 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19, 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 23, 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24, 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 25, 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26, 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 28, 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29, 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].
