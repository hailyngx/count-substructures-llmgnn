Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 3}

We see that nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 72

So, the final answer is [72].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
