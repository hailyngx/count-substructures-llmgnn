Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (7, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 10) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 6) 

Response:
In this graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we need to find the number of 3-stars.

First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 9, 4, 14, 6, 12}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 8, 14, 11}
- Node 2: {14, 11, 6}
- Node 3: {5, 4, 6, 12}
- Node 4: {8, 0, 10, 3}
- Node 5: {1, 11, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {8, 0, 3, 2}
- Node 7: {14}
- Node 8: {13, 9, 4, 6, 12, 1}
- Node 9: {10, 1, 13, 0}
- Node 10: {9, 13, 4, 12}
- Node 11: {5, 2, 1}
- Node 12: {8, 13, 0, 3, 10}
- Node 13: {9, 8, 12, 10}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 7, 2}

Now, identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 14 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 80 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 80 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 5, 14>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <1, 5, 11>
- <1, 8, 12>
- <4, 0, 10>
- <8, 0, 4>
- <8, 1, 12>
- <8, 12, 13>
- <8, 12, 3>
- <8, 13, 10>
- <9, 0, 10>
- <12, 10, 13>
- <14, 0, 1>
- <14, 1, 2>
