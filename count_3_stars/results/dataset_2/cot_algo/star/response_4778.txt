The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 9) (10, 20) (11, 27) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 2) (1, 2) (1, 23) (1, 13) (1, 4) (26, 29) (26, 12) (28, 5) (28, 2) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 18) (6, 21) (6, 29) (6, 4) (21, 6) (21, 8) (8, 21) (8, 9) (8, 7) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 15) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 24) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 23) (16, 13) (16, 7) (16, 25) (16, 20) (24, 15) (24, 0) (19, 15) (22, 20) (18, 13) (18, 27) (18, 0) (29, 26) (29, 6) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 3) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 28) (20, 10) (20, 16) (20, 22) (27, 11) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 23) (0, 24) (0, 18) (0, 29) (14, 27) (14, 12) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 23) (4, 25) (23, 1) (23, 7) (23, 27) (23, 4) (12, 17) (12, 26) (12, 14) (12, 25) (12, 3) (25, 16) (25, 4) (25, 12) (3, 29) (3, 12) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and a total of 90 edges. 

Let's first list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {24, 18, 29}
- Node 1: {2, 23, 13, 4}
- Node 2: {17, 1, 28}
- Node 3: {29, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 23, 25}
- Node 5: {28, 13, 7}
- Node 6: {21, 29, 4}
- Node 7: {5, 8, 16, 29, 23}
- Node 8: {21, 9, 7}
- Node 9: {10, 8, 15}
- Node 10: {17, 9, 20}
- Node 11: {27}
- Node 12: {17, 26, 14, 25, 3}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 16, 18}
- Node 14: {27, 12}
- Node 15: {9, 19, 24}
- Node 16: {13, 20, 25, 7}
- Node 17: {10, 12, 2}
- Node 18: {13, 27, 0}
- Node 19: {15}
- Node 20: {10, 16, 22}
- Node 21: {6, 8}
- Node 22: {20}
- Node 23: {1, 4, 27, 7}
- Node 24: {0, 15}
- Node 25: {16, 4, 12}
- Node 26: {29, 12}
- Node 27: {11, 18, 14, 23}
- Node 28: {5, 2}
- Node 29: {26, 6, 7, 0, 3}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 53

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [53].
