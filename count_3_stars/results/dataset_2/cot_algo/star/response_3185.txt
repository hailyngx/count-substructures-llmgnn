Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 17) (7, 8) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 16) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 0) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 0) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 9) (15, 12) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 5) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (16, 2) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 10) (18, 5) (18, 16) (13, 10) (13, 6) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 9) (6, 13) 

Response:
From the given information, we can construct the following neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 17}
- Node 1: {0, 11, 16, 17}
- Node 2: {8, 9, 16}
- Node 3: {7, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 4: {7, 11}
- Node 5: {0, 18, 19}
- Node 6: {13}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 8, 17, 19}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 11, 13, 18}
- Node 11: {1, 4, 10}
- Node 12: {9, 14, 15}
- Node 13: {6, 10}
- Node 14: {9, 12, 19}
- Node 15: {12}
- Node 16: {1, 2, 18}
- Node 17: {1, 7, 0}
- Node 18: {5, 10, 16}
- Node 19: {5, 7, 14}

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we see that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 32 3-stars. So, the final answer is [32].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 1, 17>

- <1, 16, 17>
- <1, 16, 18>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <3, 8, 9>
- <3, 9, 10>
- <7, 4, 11>
- <7, 8, 17>
- <7, 14, 19>
- <9, 12, 14>
- <10, 11, 3>
- <10, 13, 6>
- <10, 13, 18>
