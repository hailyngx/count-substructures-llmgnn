Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 5) (11, 12) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 9) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 5) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 8, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 10, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 11: {5, 12}
- Node 12: {4, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 5}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {6, 7, 8}.  Total: 1
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {4, 9, 14}.  Total: 1
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {10, 11, 14}.  Total: 1
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {2, 10, 13}.  Total: 1
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {8, 12, 13}.  Total: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, 6, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 9, 14>, <5, 10, 11, 14>, <6, 2, 10, 13>, <7, 8, 12, 13>.
