Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: Node 0, Node 7
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: Node 1

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 20 (from Node 0) + 20 (from Node 7) + 10 (from Node 1) = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
