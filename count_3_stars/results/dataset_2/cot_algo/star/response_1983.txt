Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, we list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 3, 6
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8, 2
- Node 2: 5, 9, 1, 3
- Node 3: 9, 0, 2
- Node 4: 9, 7, 8, 0
- Node 5: 9, 2, 8, 1, 7
- Node 6: 7, 0
- Node 7: 5, 4, 0, 6, 1
- Node 8: 5, 9, 4, 1
- Node 9: 5, 9, 4, 2, 3

Next, we identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9

For each of these nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed.
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 42, so the final answer is [42].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (4, 7, 3)>
- <4, (9, 7, 8)>
- <5, (9, 2, 8)>
- <7, (5, 4, 1)>
- <8, (5, 9, 1)>
- <9, (5, 4, 2)>
