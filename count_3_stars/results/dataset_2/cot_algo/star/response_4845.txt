Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
The central node and its neighbors are as follows:
- Node 6 has neighbors: 9, 1, 4, 8
- Node 9 has neighbors: 6, 8, 2, 3, 1, 7
- Node 1 has neighbors: 6, 9, 3, 5, 0
- Node 3 has neighbors: 9, 1, 0, 2, 8, 4
- Node 4 has neighbors: 6, 3, 7, 0
- Node 7 has neighbors: 9, 4, 5
- Node 8 has neighbors: 6, 9, 3
- Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 7, 2
- Node 2 has neighbors: 9, 3, 5
- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4

We now count the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has at least three neighbors:

Node 6 does not form any 3-star as it has only 4 neighbors.
Node 9 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 does not form any 3-star as it has only 4 neighbors.
Node 7 does not form any 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors.
Node 8 does not form any 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors.
Node 5 does not form any 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors.
Node 2 does not form any 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors.
Node 0 does not form any 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 20 + 10 + 20 = 50, which can be represented as [50].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<9, (6, 8, 7)>, <9, (6, 1, 3)>, <9, (6, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 0)>, <9, (1, 5, 0)>, <6, (9, 8, 2)>, <6, (9, 8, 3)>, <6, (9, 2, 3)>, <6, (9, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 0)>, <3, (9, 1, 0)>, <3, (9, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 0)>, <3, (1, 0, 4)>.
