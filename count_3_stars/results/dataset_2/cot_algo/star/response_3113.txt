Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 3) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 14) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 9) 

Response:
First, we will go ahead and list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {10, 11, 12, 9, 2}
- Node 1: {7, 8, 13, 9}
- Node 2: {7, 13, 6, 0, 12}
- Node 3: {4, 10, 14}
- Node 4: {8, 9, 5, 3}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {10, 5, 2}
- Node 7: {11, 9, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {4, 13, 14, 11, 1}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 0, 1}
- Node 10: {11, 0, 6, 3}
- Node 11: {7, 8, 10, 0}
- Node 12: {5, 0, 2}
- Node 13: {8, 2, 1, 14}
- Node 14: {8, 13, 5, 3}

Next, we'll determine the total number of 3-stars:
Since all the nodes have at least 3 neighbors, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \).

Calculating this for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up all the combinations: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 65 \)

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [65].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 9, 10>, <0, 9, 11>, <0, 9, 2>, <0, 10, 11>, <0, 10, 2>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 13>, <2, 7, 13>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 14>, <6, 5, 12>, <8, 11, 13>, <8, 11, 14>, <8, 13, 14>, <0, 10, 6>, <1, 8, 13>, <0, 2, 12>
