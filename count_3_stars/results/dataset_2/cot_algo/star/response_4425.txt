Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 4) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 13) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 8, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 12}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 13}
- Node 4: {2, 9, 11}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 9, 13}
- Node 13: {3, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 14: {6, 7, 9, 10}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 66 3-stars. So the final answer is [66].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 11)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 8, 11)>, <6, (7, 8, 14)>, <7, (0, 5, 13)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 14)>, <8, (0, 7, 14)>, <8, (2, 4, 12)>, <8, (2, 12, 13)>, <8, (3, 5, 13)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (5, 7, 13)>, <8, (6, 7, 14)>, <9, (1, 11, 14)>, <9, (4, 11, 14)>, <12, (0, 13, 14)>, <12, (2, 4, 9)>, <13, (7, 10, 12)>, <14, (6, 9, 10)>.
