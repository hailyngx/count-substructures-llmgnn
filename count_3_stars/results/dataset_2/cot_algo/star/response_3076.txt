Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 9, 4, 8, 2, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 8, 0, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 7, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 1, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 0, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 7, 2, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 3, 2, 0}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 4, 2, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 8, 1, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is: \( 20 + 4 = 24 \).

Therefore, the answer is [24] and the unique 3-stars found are <(0, 2, 8), (0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 7), (0, 8, 4), (0, 8, 7), (2, 8, 4), (2, 8, 7), (2, 4, 7), (8, 4, 7)>
