Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 19) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 18) (10, 19) (17, 8) (17, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 15) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 11) (18, 16) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 12) (12, 2) (12, 4) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 15) (7, 3) (7, 6) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 16) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: {8, 6, 19}
- Node 1: {11, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 12, 15}
- Node 3: {7, 19, 18}
- Node 4: {8, 13, 17, 12}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 15}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 0}
- Node 7: {3, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 17, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 14, 16, 19}
- Node 10: {19}
- Node 11: {1, 13, 18, 14}
- Node 12: {2, 4}
- Node 13: {11, 4, 18}
- Node 14: {9, 1, 11}
- Node 15: {5, 2, 16}
- Node 16: {9, 18, 15}
- Node 17: {8, 4}
- Node 18: {3, 13, 11, 16}
- Node 19: {9, 3, 10, 0}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes, we get a total of \([4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [20]\).

The unique 3-stars formed by the nodes are:
- <5, 2, 15>
- <5, 9, 16>
- <5, 9, 19>
- <5, 6, 2>
- <9, 14, 1>
- <9, 14, 11>
- <9, 16, 18>
- <9, 19, 10>
- <4, 8, 17>
- <4, 13, 11>
- <4, 13, 18>
- <4, 17, 8>
- <11, 13, 18>
- <19, 9, 16>
- <19, 9, 10>
- <0, 8, 17>
