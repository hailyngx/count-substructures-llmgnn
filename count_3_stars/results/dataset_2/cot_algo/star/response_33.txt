Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 10) (13, 4) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 3) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 9) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 2) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 1) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we'll create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0 neighbors: {7, 4, 5, 9}
Node 1 neighbors: {11, 12, 14, 9}
Node 2 neighbors: {8, 12, 5, 6}
Node 3 neighbors: {10, 8, 7, 4, 5, 9}
Node 4 neighbors: {11, 13, 12, 0, 3}
Node 5 neighbors: {10, 2, 0, 3}
Node 6 neighbors: {8, 12, 2}
Node 7 neighbors: {11, 12, 0, 3}
Node 8 neighbors: {2, 14, 6, 3}
Node 9 neighbors: {0, 1, 3}
Node 10 neighbors: {11, 3, 13, 5, 14}
Node 11 neighbors: {10, 7, 1, 4}
Node 12 neighbors: {7, 4, 2, 6, 1}
Node 13 neighbors: {10, 4}
Node 14 neighbors: {10, 8, 1}

Now, we will examine the nodes with three or more neighbors to identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [C(4, 3) = 4] 3-stars.
Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form [C(6, 3) = 20] 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form [C(5, 3) = 10] 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [C(4, 3) = 4] 3-stars.
Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form [C(5, 3) = 10] 3-stars.
Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form [C(5, 3) = 10] 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 58

Unique 3-stars found:
