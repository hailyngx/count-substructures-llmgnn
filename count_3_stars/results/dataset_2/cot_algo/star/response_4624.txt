Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 28) (26, 7) (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 25) (16, 14) (0, 27) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 10) (18, 22) (18, 23) (18, 5) (18, 1) (22, 18) (22, 7) (22, 12) (22, 3) (10, 27) (10, 23) (20, 8) (20, 14) (2, 8) (8, 20) (8, 2) (8, 24) (8, 3) (21, 28) (21, 25) (21, 17) (28, 26) (28, 21) (17, 21) (17, 1) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 13) (23, 18) (23, 10) (23, 15) (23, 3) (12, 22) (12, 24) (5, 11) (5, 18) (3, 22) (3, 8) (3, 23) (3, 6) (24, 8) (24, 12) (24, 29) (24, 4) (29, 24) (29, 6) (29, 25) (15, 23) (15, 6) (15, 4) (6, 3) (6, 29) (6, 15) (6, 19) (7, 26) (7, 22) (7, 14) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 19) (4, 24) (4, 15) (4, 25) (25, 16) (25, 21) (25, 29) (25, 4) (25, 14) (14, 16) (14, 20) (14, 7) (14, 25) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 6) (19, 13) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {27, 19}
- Node 1: {18, 17, 13}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {22, 8, 23, 6}
- Node 4: {24, 15, 25}
- Node 5: {11, 18}
- Node 6: {3, 15, 29, 19}
- Node 7: {26, 22, 14}
- Node 8: {20, 2, 24, 3}
- Node 9: {26, 19}
- Node 10: {27, 23}
- Node 11: {5, 16}
- Node 12: {22, 24}
- Node 13: {16, 1, 19}
- Node 14: {16, 7, 25, 20}
- Node 15: {23, 6, 4}
- Node 16: {11, 13, 25, 14}
- Node 17: {21, 1}
- Node 18: {22, 5, 1, 23}
- Node 19: {9, 0, 6, 13}
- Node 20: {8, 14}
- Node 21: {28, 25, 17}
- Node 22: {18, 7, 12, 3}
- Node 23: {18, 10, 15, 3}
- Node 24: {8, 4, 29, 12}
- Node 25: {16, 21, 29, 4, 14}
- Node 26: {9, 28, 7}
- Node 27: {0, 10}
- Node 28: {26, 21}
- Node 29: {24, 6, 25}

Next, we'll focus on nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of those nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 45

Therefore, the final answer is [45], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (17, 13, 18)>
- <3, (22, 23, 8)>
- <4, (24, 15, 25)>
- <6, (29, 3, 15)>
- <8, (20, 24, 14)>
- <13, (1, 19, 16)>
- <14, (7, 16, 25, 20)>
- <16, (11, 25, 14, 21)>
- <18, (23, 22, 1, 5)>
- <19, (0, 13, 6, 9)>
- <22, (3, 12, 7, 24)>
- <23, (18, 10, 15, 3)>
- <24, (4, 29, 12, 8)>
- <25, (16, 29, 4, 14, 21)>
- <26, (7, 9, 28)>
- <29, (6, 24, 25)>
