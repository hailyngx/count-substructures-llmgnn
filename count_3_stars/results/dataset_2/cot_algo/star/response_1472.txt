Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 12) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 4) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 13) (13, 0) (13, 9) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {12, 4, 13, 9}
- Node 1: {11, 6, 2, 7, 4}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 12, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {5, 2, 12, 14, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 2, 8, 3, 14}
- Node 6: {10, 5, 1, 14, 8}
- Node 7: {8, 12, 9, 1}
- Node 8: {11, 5, 6, 2, 7}
- Node 9: {11, 7, 0, 4, 13}
- Node 10: {6}
- Node 11: {1, 9, 8}
- Node 12: {2, 7, 0, 3}
- Node 13: {0, 9}
- Node 14: {5, 6, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, and Node 9

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 78

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [78].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (12, 4, 13)>
- <1, (11, 2, 7)>
- <2, (5, 8, 12)>
- <3, (5, 2, 12)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <5, (6, 8, 14)>
- <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (11, 5, 7)>
- <9, (11, 4, 13)>
