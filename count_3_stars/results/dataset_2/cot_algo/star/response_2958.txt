Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4
- Node 6: 1, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 8

Now, let's check each node that has three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars are formed:

- Node 0: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 1: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 48

So, the final answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 7, 4>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 7, 3>, <7, 1, 0>, <7, 1, 6>, <7, 3, 1>, <7, 3, 4>, <7, 3, 8>, <8, 0, 9>, <8, 3, 4>.
