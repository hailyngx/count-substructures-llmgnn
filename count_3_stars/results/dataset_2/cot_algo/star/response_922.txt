Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 13) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 9) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first identify the neighbor nodes for each of the 15 nodes:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {5, 9, 13, 14}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {5, 8, 9, 14}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {7, 9, 12, 14}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {9, 12, 13}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 11}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {5, 10, 11}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 8, 13}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4, 7, 10, 11}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 13}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {6, 8, 11, 14}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {5, 6, 8, 10, 13}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {3, 9, 13}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {0, 3, 7, 9, 11, 12}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 10}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node:

1. Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
2. Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
3. Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
4. Node 3: Node has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
5. Node 4: Node has exactly 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
6. Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
7. Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) (Unique 3-star: <6, (5, 10, 11)>)
8. Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
9. Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) (Unique 3-stars: <8, (4, 7, 10)>, <8, (4, 7, 11)>, <8, (4, 10, 11)>, <8, (7, 10, 11)>, <8, (10, 11, 14)>)
10. Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) (Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 2, 13)>, <9, (0, 3, 13)>, <9, (0, 9, 13)>, <9, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (9, 12, 13)>)
11. Node 10: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
12. Node 11: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) (Unique 3-stars: <11, (5, 6, 8)>, <11, (5, 8, 10)>, <11, (5, 8, 14)>, <11, (6, 8, 10)>, <11, (8, 10, 14)>)
13. Node 12: Node has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
14. Node 13: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) (Unique 3-stars: <13, (0, 9, 12)>, <13, (0, 9, 13)>, <13, (0, 11, 13)>, <13, (3, 9, 12)>, <13, (3, 9, 13)>, <13, (9, 11, 13)>)
15. Node 14: Node has exactly 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 63
Therefore, the final answer is [63].
