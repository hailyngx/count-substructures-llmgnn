Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors (5, 3)
Node 1: Neighbors (7, 3, 6)
Node 2: Neighbors (5, 8, 6)
Node 3: Neighbors (5, 4, 1, 0, 8)
Node 4: Neighbors (9, 3, 6)
Node 5: Neighbors (9, 2, 8, 0, 3, 7)
Node 6: Neighbors (4, 7, 1, 2, 8)
Node 7: Neighbors (5, 9, 6, 1)
Node 8: Neighbors (5, 9, 3, 2, 6)
Node 9: Neighbors (5, 8, 4, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star formations for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 56

Therefore, the final answer is [56], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 6, 7), (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 8), (1, 5, 8), (6, 7, 9), (7, 8, 9), (5, 8, 9), (3, 5, 8), (5, 7, 9), (3, 5, 9), (4, 6, 9), (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 8, 9), (7, 8, 9), (3, 7, 8), (5, 7, 8), (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 7), (2, 8, 9), (1, 3, 5), (1, 6, 7), (2, 6, 8), (2, 6, 9), (1, 6, 8), (3, 4, 6), (3, 6, 7), (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 9), (4, 6, 7), (5, 6, 9), (6, 7, 9)>
