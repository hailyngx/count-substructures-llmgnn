Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 6, Node 8, and Node 9 have 4 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 40

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (0, 1, 6)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>
