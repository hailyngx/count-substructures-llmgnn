Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 13) (1, 2) (1, 19) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 7) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 17) (7, 0) (15, 5) (15, 6) (8, 17) (8, 19) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 16) (16, 0) (16, 19) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 18) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 18) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 18) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (18, 12) (18, 14) (18, 3) (10, 12) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given edges in a more readable format:

- Nodes with neighbors: 
    - Node 0: {2, 3, 7, 16}
    - Node 1: {2, 19}
    - Node 2: {0, 1, 4}
    - Node 3: {0, 9, 18}
    - Node 4: {2, 9, 11}
    - Node 5: {9, 14, 15}
    - Node 6: {9, 11, 13, 15, 19}
    - Node 7: {0, 17}
    - Node 8: {17, 19}
    - Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 6}
    - Node 10: {12}
    - Node 11: {4, 6, 13, 14}
    - Node 12: {10, 13, 18}
    - Node 13: {6, 11, 12}
    - Node 14: {5, 11, 18}
    - Node 15: {5, 6}
    - Node 16: {0, 19}
    - Node 17: {7, 8, 19}
    - Node 18: {3, 12, 14}
    - Node 19: {1, 6, 8, 16, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the number of 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 19

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of unique 3-stars they form:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 19: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (3, 7, 16)>, <0, (2, 7, 16)>, <0, (2, 3, 16)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 4)>, 
<3, (0, 4, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 3, 9)>, 
<6, (9, 13, 15)>, <6, (11, 13, 15)>, <6, (9, 13, 19)>, <6, (11, 13, 19)>, <6, (9, 15, 19)>, <6, (11, 15, 19)>, <6, (9, 13, 11)>, <6, (13, 15, 19)>, <6, (11, 15, 19)>, <6, (9, 11, 15)>, 
<7, (0, 16, 17)>, 
<11, (4, 14, 18)>, <11, (6, 13, 14)>, <11, (13, 14, 18)>, <11, (6, 13, 18)>, 
<12, (10, 13, 18)>, 
<13, (6, 11, 12)>, 
<14, (11, 5, 18)>, 
<19, (6, 8, 17)>, <19, (13, 17, 18)>, <19, (14, 17, 18)>, <19, (7, 8, 17)>, <19, (7, 13, 17)>, <19, (14, 18, 16)>, <19, (8, 17, 16)>, <19, (13, 17, 16)>.
