Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 3-stars: <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 5 forms 3-stars: <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 4, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 7, so we put this final number inside brackets [], resulting in [7].
