Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 21) (15, 3) (15, 18) (27, 29) (27, 20) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 8) (1, 3) (1, 28) (1, 7) (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 29) (5, 0) (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 7) (22, 26) (22, 13) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 17) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 3) (8, 12) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 28) (4, 21) (4, 16) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 19) (0, 5) (0, 25) (0, 18) (10, 6) (23, 9) (23, 26) (23, 4) (11, 2) (11, 24) (24, 11) (24, 25) (6, 22) (6, 10) (17, 22) (17, 16) (17, 28) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 29) (7, 19) (29, 26) (29, 27) (29, 5) (29, 7) (16, 4) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 20) (28, 1) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 17) (28, 20) (25, 5) (25, 0) (25, 24) (14, 20) (18, 15) (18, 0) (19, 12) (19, 7) (19, 16) (20, 27) (20, 16) (20, 28) (20, 14) (21, 26) (21, 4) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 18, 25}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 28}
- Node 2: {11, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 8, 15}
- Node 4: {12, 16, 21, 23, 28}
- Node 5: {0, 9, 25, 29}
- Node 6: {10, 22}
- Node 7: {1, 7, 13, 19, 29}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 12}
- Node 9: {5, 9, 23, 26}
- Node 10: {6}
- Node 11: {2, 24}
- Node 12: {4, 8, 19}
- Node 13: {2, 7, 22}
- Node 14: {20}
- Node 15: {3, 18}
- Node 16: {4, 16, 17, 19, 20}
- Node 17: {16, 22, 28}
- Node 18: {0, 15}
- Node 19: {12, 16, 19}
- Node 20: {14, 16, 20, 27, 28}
- Node 21: {4, 26}
- Node 22: {6, 13, 16, 17, 28}
- Node 23: {4, 9, 26}
- Node 24: {11, 25}
- Node 25: {0, 5, 24}
- Node 26: {9, 21, 22, 23, 29}
- Node 27: {20, 29}
- Node 28: {1, 4, 17, 20, 22}
- Node 29: {5, 7, 26, 27}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 70 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (16, 21, 23)>
<7, (1, 13, 29)>
<16, (4, 17, 20)>
<20, (16, 27, 28)>
<22, (6, 17, 28)>
<26, (22, 29, 27)>
<28, (17, 20, 22)>
