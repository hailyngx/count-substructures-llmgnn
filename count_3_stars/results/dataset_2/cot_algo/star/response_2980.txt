Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 15) (5, 17) (5, 11) (5, 16) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 3) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 19) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 16) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 15) (1, 17) (1, 18) (1, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 2) (11, 5) (11, 18) (11, 19) (11, 15) (19, 12) (19, 11) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, the graph is connected and does not contain any isolated nodes. 

Next, I'll list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {14, 10, 15}
- Node 1: {17, 18, 2}
- Node 2: {8, 1, 13, 16}
- Node 3: {6, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {18, 13, 16, 3}
- Node 5: {17, 11, 16}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {12, 15}
- Node 8: {9, 2, 3}
- Node 9: {8, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {9, 0}
- Node 11: {5, 18, 19, 15}
- Node 12: {9, 7, 19}
- Node 13: {4, 18, 2}
- Node 14: {17, 0}
- Node 15: {17, 7, 0, 11}
- Node 16: {5, 4, 2}
- Node 17: {14, 1, 5, 15}
- Node 18: {4, 11, 1, 13}
- Node 19: {12, 11}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [1]
    - <0, 14, 15, 17>
- Node 1: [1]
    - <1, 17, 18, 2>
- Node 2: [1]
    - <2, 8, 13, 16>
- Node 3: [0]
- Node 4: [1]
    - <4, 18, 13, 16>
- Node 5: [1]
    - <5, 17, 11, 16>
- Node 7: [0]
- Node 8: [0]
- Node 9: [1]
    - <9, 8, 10, 12>
- Node 10: [0]
- Node 11: [1]
    - <11, 5, 18, 15>
- Node 12: [1]
    - <12, 9, 7, 19>
- Node 13: [1]
    - <13, 4, 18, 2>
- Node 14: [0]
- Node 15: [1]
    - <15, 17, 7, 0>
- Node 16: [1]
    - <16, 5, 4, 2>
- Node 17: [1]
    - <17, 14, 1, 15>
- Node 18: [1]
    - <18, 4, 11, 13>
- Node 19: [0]

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us [8].
