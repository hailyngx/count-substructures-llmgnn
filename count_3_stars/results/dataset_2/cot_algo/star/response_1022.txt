Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (18, 19) (18, 7) (5, 17) (5, 15) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 12) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 18) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 14) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 14) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 10) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 17) (3, 4) (3, 14) (17, 8) (17, 5) (17, 19) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 3) (14, 10) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 15) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node: 

1: 8, 9
2: 4, 11, 14
3: 4, 14
4: 2, 3, 8
5: 0, 15, 17
6: 7, 10, 12
7: 14, 16, 18, 12
8: 1, 4, 17
9: 1, 12, 15
10: 6, 14, 16
11: 0, 2, 13
12: 6, 7, 9, 16
13: 0, 11, 19
14: 2, 3, 7, 10, 15
15: 5, 9, 14
16: 7, 10, 12
17: 5, 8, 19
18: 7, 19
19: 13, 17, 18

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

2, 4, 7, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 18: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 23 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (4, 11, 14)>, <4, (2, 8, 3)>, <7, (12, 14, 16)>, <12, (6, 7, 9)>, <14, (2, 7, 3)>, <15, (5, 9, 14)>, <16, (6, 10, 12)>, <17, (5, 8, 19)>, <19, (13, 17, 18)>
