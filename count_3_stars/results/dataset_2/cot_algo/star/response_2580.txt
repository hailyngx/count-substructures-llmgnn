Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 6) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 14
- Node 1: 4, 7, 11, 12, 14
- Node 2: 13, 14
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6, 9, 12
- Node 4: 1, 10, 11, 12, 13
- Node 5: 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 11, 13
- Node 7: 1, 8, 10, 12
- Node 8: 7, 9, 14
- Node 9: 3, 5, 8, 11
- Node 10: 4, 7, 12
- Node 11: 1, 4, 6, 9, 14
- Node 12: 1, 3, 4, 7, 10
- Node 13: 2, 4, 6, 14
- Node 14: 0, 1, 2, 8, 11, 13

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 11, 14)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 11, 12)
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes (8, 10, 12)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes (9, 11, 14)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes (5, 8, 11)
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 4, 14)
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 7, 10)
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 6, 14)
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 8, 11)

So, there are a total of 9 unique 3-stars formed. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
