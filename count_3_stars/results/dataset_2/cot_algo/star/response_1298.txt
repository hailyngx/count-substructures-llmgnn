Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 6, 2, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {9, 4, 8, 2}
- Node 2: {4, 0, 1, 7}
- Node 3: {9, 4, 8, 0}
- Node 4: {3, 1, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 0, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 7, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {6, 3, 1}

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 7 have 5, 4, 5, and 4 neighbors respectively, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 28 \) 3-stars formed with these nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
