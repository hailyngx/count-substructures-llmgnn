Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 7) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 13) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 12) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 18) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (17, 18) (17, 16) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 19) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 15) (7, 11) (7, 19) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 12) (16, 8) (16, 17) (4, 1) (4, 19) (4, 15) (9, 15) (9, 19) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 4) (19, 9) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 12) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 15) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {10, 3, 15}
- Node 1: {18, 6, 14, 4}
- Node 2: {18, 8, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 0}
- Node 4: {1, 19, 15}
- Node 6: {8, 1, 14}
- Node 7: {11, 19}
- Node 8: {2, 18, 6, 16, 12}
- Node 9: {15, 19}
- Node 10: {0, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {7}
- Node 12: {10, 18, 8, 14, 15}
- Node 13: {10, 18, 19}
- Node 14: {10, 1, 6, 12}
- Node 15: {0, 4, 9, 12}
- Node 16: {8, 17}
- Node 17: {18, 16}
- Node 18: {2, 12, 17, 1, 13}
- Node 19: {13, 7, 4, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 10: Forms a 3-star <10, (0, 12, 13)>
- Node 12: Forms a 3-star <12, (10, 14, 15)>
- Node 13: Forms a 3-star <13, (10, 18, 19)>
- Node 14: Forms a 3-star <14, (10, 6, 12)>
- Node 18: Forms a 3-star <18, (2, 12, 13)>

The total number of 3-stars is 5, so the final answer is [5].
