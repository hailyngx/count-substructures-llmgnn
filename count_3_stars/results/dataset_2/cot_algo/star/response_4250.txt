Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 2, 6, 8: <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 4, 5: <8, (1, 4, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
