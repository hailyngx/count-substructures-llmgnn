Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 12) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 27) (26, 7) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 24) (3, 11) (3, 27) (3, 22) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 21) (11, 15) (6, 21) (6, 27) (21, 11) (21, 6) (21, 27) (21, 12) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 19) (28, 1) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 23) (19, 22) (23, 19) (23, 7) (23, 10) (17, 9) (17, 25) (17, 27) (17, 15) (25, 26) (25, 17) (25, 15) (25, 18) (22, 3) (22, 19) (18, 25) (18, 20) (18, 12) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 24) (8, 29) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 10) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 0) (4, 29) (0, 4) (0, 2) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 25) (15, 14) (27, 26) (27, 3) (27, 6) (27, 21) (27, 17) (10, 23) (10, 14) (10, 1) (1, 28) (1, 14) (1, 10) (7, 26) (7, 23) (24, 13) (24, 5) (20, 18) (2, 16) (2, 0) (29, 8) (29, 4) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 18) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph as follows:

1. Calculate the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4}
- Node 1: {10, 14, 28}
- Node 2: {0, 16}
- Node 3: {11, 22, 27}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 9, 14, 29}
- Node 5: {4, 11, 24}
- Node 6: {21, 27}
- Node 7: {23, 26}
- Node 8: {29}
- Node 9: {4, 12, 17}
- Node 10: {1, 14, 23}
- Node 11: {3, 5, 15, 19, 21}
- Node 12: {9, 18, 21}
- Node 13: {16, 24, 26}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 10, 15}
- Node 15: {11, 14, 17, 25}
- Node 16: {2, 13, 19}
- Node 17: {9, 15, 25, 27}
- Node 18: {12, 18, 20}
- Node 19: {11, 16, 19, 22, 23}
- Node 20: {18}
- Node 21: {6, 11, 12, 27}
- Node 22: {3, 19}
- Node 23: {7, 10, 19}
- Node 24: {5, 13}
- Node 25: {15, 17, 18, 26}
- Node 26: {7, 13, 17, 25, 27}
- Node 27: {3, 6, 17, 21, 26}
- Node 28: {1}
- Node 29: {4, 8}

2. Identify nodes with at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 5, 9} <4, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 15, 21} <11, (5, 15, 21)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors {10, 15, 1} <14, (10, 15, 1)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with neighbors {16, 22, 23} <19, (16, 22, 23)>
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with neighbors {17, 21, 26} <27, (17, 21, 26)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
