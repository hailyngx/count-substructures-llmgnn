Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 4) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 9, 10, 14, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 3}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 10}
- Node 5: {4, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {3, 8, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 4, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {5, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {5, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {6, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 8, 10}

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each such node:

- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 10: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 72

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [72]. 

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, 7, 14>
- <0, 7, 2>
- <0, 10, 2>
- <0, 10, 14>
- <0, 14, 8>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <2, 4, 10>
- <3, 6, 8>
- <4, 10, 2>
- <6, 8, 13>
- <8, 13, 12>
- <10, 14, 2>
- <11, 5, 12>
