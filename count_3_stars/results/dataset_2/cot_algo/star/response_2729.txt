Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 7}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 20 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 9, 6)>
<1, (9, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 4, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 3)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 2, 8)>
<7, (3, 8, 6)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 8, 3)>
<7, (6, 4, 8)>
<7, (8, 3, 6)>
