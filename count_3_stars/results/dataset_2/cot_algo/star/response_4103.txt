Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 10) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 19) (13, 5) (13, 19) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 18) (6, 1) (6, 5) (0, 11) (0, 3) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 17) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 12) (17, 7) (17, 4) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 13) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 12) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 12) (2, 9) (2, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 2) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 18) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 18) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 11}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 17}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 13, 18}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {14, 16, 17}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 19}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 10, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {9, 15, 16}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 16, 19}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 9, 15, 18}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 19}
- Node 14: Neighbors {3, 7, 18}
- Node 15: Neighbors {10, 12}
- Node 16: Neighbors {7, 10, 11, 19}
- Node 17: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 18: Neighbors {5, 12, 14}
- Node 19: Neighbors {8, 11, 13, 16}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph. We can see that nodes 1, 3, 4, 12, and 16 have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

There are 20 3-stars in total in this graph. Thus, the final answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, 4, 12>
<3, 4, 14>
<4, 7, 17>
<12, 15, 18>
<16, 11, 19>
