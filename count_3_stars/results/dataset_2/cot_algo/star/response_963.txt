Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 2) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 23) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 4) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 9) (20, 22) (17, 29) (17, 16) (17, 27) (29, 17) (29, 26) (29, 16) (29, 0) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 26) (26, 29) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 23) (16, 17) (16, 29) (16, 21) (16, 22) (21, 16) (21, 27) (21, 5) (21, 11) (5, 1) (5, 26) (5, 21) (5, 14) (11, 21) (11, 18) (14, 5) (14, 4) (23, 13) (23, 26) (23, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 4) (9, 3) (9, 20) (25, 24) (0, 29) (0, 23) (0, 28) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 27) (28, 24) (2, 1) (2, 3) (12, 20) (12, 28) (6, 4) (7, 18) (27, 17) (27, 21) (27, 28) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 7) (22, 20) (22, 16) (22, 24) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 24) (24, 25) (24, 28) (24, 22) (24, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the provided edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors 23, 28, 29
- Node 1: Neighbor 2
- Node 2: Neighbors 1, 3
- Node 3: Neighbors 2, 9, 10, 19
- Node 4: Neighbors 6, 10, 14, 15, 24
- Node 5: Neighbors 1, 14, 21, 26
- Node 6: Neighbor 4
- Node 7: Neighbor 18
- Node 8: Neighbors 10, 13
- Node 9: Neighbors 3, 20
- Node 10: Neighbors 3, 4, 8, 18
- Node 11: Neighbors 18, 21
- Node 12: Neighbors 20, 28
- Node 13: Neighbors 8, 23
- Node 14: Neighbors 4, 5
- Node 15: Neighbors 4, 18, 19, 20
- Node 16: Neighbors 17, 21, 22, 29
- Node 17: Neighbors 16, 27, 29
- Node 18: Neighbors 7, 10, 11, 15
- Node 19: Neighbors 3, 15, 26
- Node 20: Neighbors 9, 12, 15, 22
- Node 21: Neighbors 5, 11, 16, 27
- Node 22: Neighbors 16, 20, 24
- Node 23: Neighbors 0, 13, 26
- Node 24: Neighbors 4, 22, 25, 28
- Node 25: Neighbor 24
- Node 26: Neighbors 5, 19, 23, 29
- Node 27: Neighbors 17, 21, 28
- Node 28: Neighbors 0, 12, 24, 27
- Node 29: Neighbors 0, 16, 17, 26

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, 10, 18>
- <4, 10, 18>
- <5, 21, 11>
- <10, 18, 15>
- <15, 18, 11>
- <18, 10, 4>
- <20, 22, 24>
- <21, 5, 11>
- <22, 16, 24>
- <24, 4, 22>
- <26, 5, 23>
- <28, 27, 0>
