Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 19) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 16) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 1) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 17) (11, 3) (11, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (5, 18) (5, 17) (1, 18) (1, 10) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 19) (14, 16) (14, 10) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 10) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 17) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 15) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 15) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 15) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 16) 

Response:
First, we will determine the list of neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 8, 7
- Node 1 neighbors: 18, 10
- Node 2 neighbors: 18, 19, 9, 3
- Node 3 neighbors: 2, 11, 17
- Node 4 neighbors: 8, 6
- Node 5 neighbors: 18, 17
- Node 6 neighbors: 4, 10, 19
- Node 7 neighbors: 8, 12, 0, 10
- Node 8 neighbors: 13, 4, 0
- Node 9 neighbors: 2, 11, 15
- Node 10 neighbors: 7, 1, 6, 14, 16
- Node 11 neighbors: 3, 9
- Node 12 neighbors: 7, 16
- Node 13 neighbors: 8, 15, 19
- Node 14 neighbors: 16, 10
- Node 15 neighbors: 13, 19, 9, 17
- Node 16 neighbors: 12, 14, 19, 10
- Node 17 neighbors: 3, 5, 15
- Node 18 neighbors: 2, 5, 1
- Node 19 neighbors: 13, 2, 6, 16, 15

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 32 \).

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are:
