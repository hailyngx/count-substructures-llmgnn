Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 29) (13, 7) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 14) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 18) (27, 29) (1, 21) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 17) (18, 22) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 17) (4, 9) (4, 23) (4, 14) (20, 15) (20, 0) (20, 3) (28, 17) (28, 25) (29, 13) (29, 27) (0, 13) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 23) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 0) (3, 21) (3, 20) (3, 16) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 9) (16, 19) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 10) (23, 4) (23, 0) (23, 26) (23, 2) (26, 23) (11, 24) (11, 9) (11, 5) (24, 11) (24, 9) (24, 5) (24, 2) (24, 25) (2, 23) (2, 24) (2, 6) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 11) (9, 24) (9, 12) (25, 28) (25, 24) (17, 21) (17, 18) (17, 28) (17, 19) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 24) (5, 12) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 10) (6, 2) (6, 10) (6, 19) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 6) (19, 16) (19, 17) (19, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 13, 15, 20, 14, 23
- Node 1: 21
- Node 2: 23, 24, 6
- Node 3: 21, 20, 16
- Node 4: 9, 23, 14
- Node 5: 18, 11, 24, 12
- Node 6: 2, 10, 19
- Node 7: 13, 16, 10
- Node 9: 4, 16, 11, 24, 12
- Node 10: 7, 12, 6
- Node 11: 4, 5, 24
- Node 12: 9, 5, 10
- Node 13: 0, 22, 29, 7
- Node 14: 22, 4, 0
- Node 15: 20, 0, 18
- Node 16: 3, 7, 9, 19
- Node 17: 21, 18, 28, 19
- Node 18: 22, 15, 5, 17
- Node 19: 16, 17, 6
- Node 20: 15, 0, 3
- Node 21: 1, 3, 17
- Node 22: 13, 18, 14
- Node 23: 4, 0, 26, 2
- Node 24: 11, 9, 5, 2, 25
- Node 25: 28, 24
- Node 26: 23
- Node 27: 29
- Node 28: 17, 25
- Node 29: 13, 27

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each node:
- Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 18: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 19: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 20: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 21: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 22: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 24: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 28: [inom{2}{3}] = 0

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 56

So, the final answer is [56], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 13, 22>
<3, 16, 21>
<4, 11, 24>
<5, 12, 24>
<9, 16, 24>
<13, 22, 29>
<17, 18, 28>
