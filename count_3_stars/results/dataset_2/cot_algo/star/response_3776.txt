Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 10) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 2) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 2) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 11) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 10, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 8: {3, 7, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {11, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 9, 12}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 9}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 1 (it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 65

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [65].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 10, 14)>
<1, (0, 5, 12)>
<2, (5, 7, 14)>
<3, (8, 11, 12)>
<7, (8, 10, 12)>
<8, (7, 10, 12)>
<9, (11, 13, 14)>
<10, (0, 5, 7)>
<11, (3, 8, 12)>
<12, (1, 5, 7)>
<14, (0, 2, 9)>
