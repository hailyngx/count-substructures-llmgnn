Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 2) (27, 4) (27, 21) (27, 7) (27, 26) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 28) (17, 22) (17, 21) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 29) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 20) (20, 13) (25, 9) (25, 6) (6, 25) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 24) (28, 17) (28, 6) (28, 22) (28, 10) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 16) (22, 17) (22, 28) (22, 26) (22, 7) (22, 12) (26, 27) (26, 13) (26, 22) (26, 10) (4, 27) (4, 0) (4, 24) (21, 27) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 16) (9, 14) (9, 25) (12, 22) (12, 19) (16, 2) (16, 21) (16, 18) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 3) (18, 1) (19, 2) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 3) (24, 6) (24, 4) (24, 0) (24, 10) (10, 28) (10, 26) (10, 19) (10, 24) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 3) (1, 14) (1, 18) (1, 7) (11, 5) (3, 18) (3, 19) (3, 5) (7, 27) (7, 22) (7, 1) (0, 4) (0, 24) (29, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 1 neighbor
- Node 12: 2 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 1 neighbor
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 5 neighbors
- Node 20: 1 neighbor
- Node 21: 4 neighbors
- Node 22: 5 neighbors
- Node 25: 2 neighbors
- Node 26: 4 neighbors
- Node 27: 4 neighbors
- Node 28: 4 neighbors
- Node 29: 1 neighbor

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars formed with these nodes, we get a total of 67 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [67].
