Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 16) (9, 6) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 7) (3, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 13) (17, 13) (17, 4) (17, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 18) (0, 13) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 15) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 18) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 4) (15, 8) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 2) (19, 15) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 15) (12, 6) (12, 8) (18, 13) (18, 7) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 11) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (13, 4, 8)>
<4, (17, 11, 7)>
<7, (11, 1, 18)>
<13, (17, 0, 2)>
<14, (15, 3, 7)>
<15, (16, 19, 14)>
