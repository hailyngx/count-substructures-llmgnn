Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 1) (11, 5) (13, 17) (13, 9) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 27) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 18) (21, 7) (21, 26) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 24) (3, 2) (23, 11) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 12) (12, 23) (12, 27) (12, 20) (12, 14) (27, 22) (27, 12) (27, 29) (28, 11) (28, 29) (29, 27) (29, 28) (29, 14) (15, 23) (15, 20) (15, 25) (15, 5) (20, 12) (20, 15) (20, 24) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 19) (17, 13) (17, 4) (17, 26) (9, 13) (9, 22) (9, 24) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (18, 7) (18, 26) (18, 5) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 18) (26, 2) (8, 14) (8, 25) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 26) (2, 25) (24, 3) (24, 20) (24, 9) (24, 19) (14, 12) (14, 29) (14, 8) (14, 10) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 25) (25, 15) (25, 8) (25, 2) (25, 5) (19, 6) (19, 24) (4, 17) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Nodes:
0: 1, 7, 10, 2
1: 0, 11
2: 0, 3, 25, 26
3: 2, 24
4: 17
5: 11, 15, 18, 25
6: 7, 10, 19
7: 0, 6, 18, 21
8: 14, 25
9: 13, 22, 24
10: 0, 6, 14
11: 1, 5, 23, 28
12: 14, 20, 27
13: 9, 17
14: 10, 12, 29, 8
15: 5, 20, 23, 25
17: 4, 13, 26
18: 5, 7, 26
19: 6, 24
20: 12, 15, 24
21: 7, 26
22: 9, 13, 23, 27
23: 11, 15, 22
24: 3, 9, 19, 20
25: 2, 5, 8, 15
26: 2, 17, 18, 21
27: 12, 22, 29
28: 11, 29
29: 14, 27, 28

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star graphs:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:
0: C(4, 3) = 4
2: C(4, 3) = 4
5: C(4, 3) = 4
6: C(4, 3) = 4
7: C(4, 3) = 4
10: C(4, 3) = 4
11: C(4, 3) = 4
12: C(3, 3) = 1
14: C(4, 3) = 4
15: C(4, 3) = 4
24: C(4, 3) = 4
25: C(4, 3) = 4
26: C(4, 3) = 4
27: C(3, 3) = 1
29: C(3, 3) = 1

Total number of 3-stars: 37
Therefore, the final answer is [37].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 10>
<2, 3, 26>
<5, 11, 18>
<6, 7, 18>
<7, 21, 26>
<10, 14, 29>
<11, 23, 28>
<12, 14, 27>
<14, 29, 8>
<15, 20, 25>
<24, 19, 9>
<25, 2, 8>
<26, 17, 21>
<27, 22, 29>
