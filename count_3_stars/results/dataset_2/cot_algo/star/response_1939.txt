Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 27) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 4) (27, 16) (27, 10) (22, 5) (22, 28) (22, 10) (22, 17) (23, 6) (20, 15) (20, 7) (6, 23) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 12) (28, 22) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 4) (28, 14) (21, 28) (21, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 0) (26, 10) (26, 5) (26, 18) (26, 12) (4, 16) (4, 15) (4, 28) (4, 2) (1, 6) (1, 29) (1, 12) (9, 11) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 3) (7, 20) (7, 24) (25, 11) (25, 29) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 10) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 22) (10, 26) (10, 19) (17, 22) (17, 3) (17, 18) (3, 16) (3, 21) (3, 9) (3, 17) (24, 9) (24, 7) (29, 1) (29, 25) (29, 18) (0, 8) (5, 22) (5, 26) (5, 14) (14, 28) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 5) (12, 6) (12, 26) (12, 1) (18, 26) (18, 17) (18, 29) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {8}
- Node 1: {6, 12, 29}
- Node 2: {4, 8}
- Node 3: {9, 16, 17, 21}
- Node 4: {2, 15, 16, 28}
- Node 5: {14, 22, 26}
- Node 6: {1, 12, 23, 28}
- Node 7: {20, 24}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 14, 19}
- Node 9: {3, 11, 14, 24}
- Node 10: {15, 19, 22, 26, 27}
- Node 11: {9, 16, 19, 25}
- Node 12: {1, 6, 26}
- Node 14: {5, 8, 9, 28}
- Node 15: {4, 10, 20}
- Node 16: {3, 4, 11, 27}
- Node 17: {3, 18, 22}
- Node 18: {17, 26, 29}
- Node 19: {8, 10, 11}
- Node 20: {7, 15}
- Node 21: {3, 28}
- Node 22: {5, 10, 17, 28}
- Node 23: {6}
- Node 24: {7, 9}
- Node 25: {11, 29}
- Node 26: {5, 10, 12, 18}
- Node 27: {16, 10}
- Node 28: {4, 6, 14, 21, 22}
- Node 29: {1, 18, 25}

Now let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors {15, 22, 26}.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 16, 17}.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {14, 19, 28}.
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 6, 26}.
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 8, 28}.
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 11, 27}.

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we have [6]. 

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
