Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 17) (10, 12) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 15) (17, 10) (17, 3) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 7) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 6) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 3) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (0, 4) (0, 18) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 2) (6, 18) (6, 13) (6, 19) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 16) (7, 18) (7, 13) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 16) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 18}
- Node 1: {2, 11, 13}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 9, 16}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 13, 17}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 12, 18}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {13, 18, 19}
- Node 7: {13, 18}
- Node 8: {3, 8, 15, 19}
- Node 9: {2, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {12, 17}
- Node 11: {1, 15, 19}
- Node 12: {4, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 14: {9, 16, 19}
- Node 15: {8, 11, 16}
- Node 16: {2, 14, 15}
- Node 17: {3, 10}
- Node 18: {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 19: {6, 8, 11, 14}

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: In-degree=3
- Node 2: In-degree=4
- Node 3: In-degree=4
- Node 4: In-degree=4
- Node 8: In-degree=4
- Node 9: In-degree=3
- Node 12: In-degree=3
- Node 13: In-degree=4
- Node 14: In-degree=3
- Node 16: In-degree=3
- Node 18: In-degree=4
- Node 19: In-degree=4

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with nodes having 3 or more neighbors:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 33 \]

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

Unique 3-stars found inside <>:
<1, 13, 16>
<2, 9, 14>
<3, 8, 19>
<4, 0, 18>
<8, 11, 15>
<13, 6, 19>
<16, 14, 19>
