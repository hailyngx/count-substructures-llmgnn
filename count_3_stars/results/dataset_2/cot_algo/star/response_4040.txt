Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 2: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6

Next, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 6 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
\[ \binom{0}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{9}{3} = 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 84 = 122 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 122, which can be represented as [122].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 4, 6>, <6, 7, 9>
