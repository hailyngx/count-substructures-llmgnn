Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 16) (9, 7) (14, 18) (14, 4) (17, 1) (17, 15) (10, 7) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 19) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 4) (1, 17) (1, 2) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 4) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 4) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 15) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (3, 12) (3, 18) (18, 14) (18, 11) (18, 5) (18, 3) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 15) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: {11, 8, 5}
- Node 1: {17, 2}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 1, 19, 4}
- Node 3: {12, 18}
- Node 4: {14, 11, 2, 16, 15}
- Node 5: {6, 13, 18, 0, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 2}
- Node 7: {9, 10, 5}
- Node 8: {13, 2, 0, 12}
- Node 9: {16, 7}
- Node 10: {7}
- Node 11: {0, 18, 4}
- Node 12: {8, 16, 3}
- Node 13: {5, 8, 19}
- Node 14: {18, 4}
- Node 15: {17, 19, 4}
- Node 16: {9, 12, 4}
- Node 17: {1, 15}
- Node 18: {14, 11, 5, 3}
- Node 19: {2, 13, 15}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:

- Nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 13, 15, and 18 have 5 neighbors each.
- Nodes 6, 12, and 19 have 3 neighbors each.

Next, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 8 \times 10 + 3 \times 1 = 83 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [83].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (11, 8, 5)>, <2, (6, 8, 19)>, <4, (14, 16, 15)>, <5, (6, 13, 7)>, <8, (13, 12, 0)>, <13, (5, 19, 8)>, <15, (17, 19, 4)>, <18, (14, 11, 5)>.
