Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars possible:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 35. So, the final answer is [35].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 2, 3>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <6, 7, 9>
