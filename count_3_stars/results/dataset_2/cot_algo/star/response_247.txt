Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors, no 3-stars.
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, forms  C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2: 4 neighbors, forms  C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3: 4 neighbors, forms  C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4: 5 neighbors, forms  C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, forms  C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7: 5 neighbors, forms  C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9: 5 neighbors, forms  C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 46

Therefore, the final answer is [46], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (9, 8, 5)>
- <5, (9, 7, 0)>
- <7, (9, 6, 3)>
- <7, (9, 3, 1)>
- <7, (4, 9, 1)>
- <7, (4, 8, 1)>
- <7, (4, 3, 1)>
- <9, (0, 2, 8)>
- <9, (0, 2, 4)>
- <9, (0, 5, 2)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
- <9, (2, 5, 4)>
