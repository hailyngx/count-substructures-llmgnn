Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 2) (18, 22) (18, 4) (22, 18) (22, 29) (22, 21) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 28) (11, 19) (11, 17) (11, 20) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 7) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 17) (21, 3) (21, 22) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 12) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 28) (0, 21) (0, 16) (0, 9) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 25) (14, 26) (26, 10) (26, 14) (26, 20) (26, 29) (26, 25) (2, 15) (2, 27) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 21) (12, 13) (28, 3) (28, 10) (28, 19) (28, 9) (8, 15) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 29) (7, 20) (29, 22) (29, 26) (29, 7) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 13) (1, 9) (20, 11) (20, 26) (20, 7) (23, 1) (23, 25) (25, 16) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 23) (9, 0) (9, 28) (9, 1) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 27) (24, 17) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 24) (27, 3) (27, 2) (27, 13) 

Response:
By observing the given graph, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: {16, 21, 9}
- Node 1: {9, 13, 23}
- Node 2: {7, 15, 27}
- Node 3: {15, 21, 27, 28}
- Node 4: {16, 17, 18}
- Node 5: {7, 12, 19}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 6, 20, 29}
- Node 8: {15}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 28}
- Node 10: {21, 26, 28}
- Node 11: {17, 19, 20}
- Node 12: {5, 13, 21}
- Node 13: {1, 12, 27}
- Node 14: {26}
- Node 15: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 16: {0, 4, 25}
- Node 17: {11, 24, 4}
- Node 18: {4, 22}
- Node 19: {5, 11, 28}
- Node 20: {7, 11, 26}
- Node 21: {0, 3, 10, 12, 22}
- Node 22: {18, 21, 29}
- Node 23: {1, 25}
- Node 24: {17}
- Node 25: {1, 16, 23, 26}
- Node 26: {10, 14, 20, 25, 29}
- Node 27: {2, 3, 13}
- Node 28: {3, 9, 10, 19}
- Node 29: {7, 22, 26}

We can now calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (15, 21, 28)>
- <7, (2, 20, 26)>
- <9, (0, 1, 28)>
- <13, (1, 12, 27)>
- <21, (0, 12, 22)>
- <22, (18, 21, 29)>
- <25, (1, 16, 26)>
- <26, (10, 20, 29)>
- <28, (3, 9, 19)>
