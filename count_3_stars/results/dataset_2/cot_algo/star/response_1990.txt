Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 9) (18, 20) (22, 18) (22, 5) (22, 25) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 26) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 26) (10, 2) (17, 8) (17, 10) (4, 24) (4, 28) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 20) (26, 25) (15, 10) (15, 12) (15, 28) (15, 11) (9, 18) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 21) (0, 9) (0, 21) (0, 24) (0, 23) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 20) (7, 16) (25, 22) (25, 26) (25, 21) (3, 8) (3, 28) (3, 20) (3, 29) (28, 4) (28, 15) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 5) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 2) (24, 4) (24, 0) (24, 5) (24, 23) (1, 19) (1, 12) (29, 3) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 16) (20, 3) (20, 19) (21, 9) (21, 0) (21, 25) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 6) (19, 1) (19, 20) (19, 2) (6, 11) (6, 2) (14, 28) (5, 22) (5, 28) (5, 24) (23, 0) (23, 24) (23, 12) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 23) 

Response:
First, we will construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 21, 24, 23}
- Node 1: {19, 12}
- Node 2: {10, 11, 19, 6}
- Node 3: {8, 28, 20, 29}
- Node 4: {24, 28}
- Node 5: {22, 28, 24}
- Node 6: {11, 2}
- Node 7: {16}
- Node 8: {13, 9, 16, 3, 17}
- Node 9: {18, 8, 0, 21}
- Node 10: {17, 15, 26, 2}
- Node 11: {15, 6, 2}
- Node 12: {15, 1, 23}
- Node 13: {8, 26}
- Node 14: {28}
- Node 15: {10, 11, 28, 12}
- Node 16: {8, 20, 7}
- Node 17: {10, 8}
- Node 18: {22, 20, 9}
- Node 19: {1, 20, 2}
- Node 20: {18, 26, 16, 3, 19}
- Node 21: {9, 0, 25}
- Node 22: {18, 5, 25}
- Node 23: {0, 24, 12}
- Node 24: {4, 28, 0, 23, 5}
- Node 25: {22, 26, 21}
- Node 26: {13, 10, 20, 25}
- Node 28: {4, 15, 3, 14, 5}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 7 has only 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 14 has only 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

For the remaining nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: 2 choose 3 = 0 3-stars
- Node 5: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 8: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 10: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 11: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 12: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 15: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 16: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 17: 2 choose 3 = 0 3-stars
- Node 18: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 19: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 20: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 21: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 22: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 23: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 24: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 25: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 26: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 28: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get:

4 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10
= 77

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [77].
