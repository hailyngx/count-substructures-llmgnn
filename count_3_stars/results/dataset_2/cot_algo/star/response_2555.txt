Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 22) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (20, 25) (20, 12) (20, 22) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 19) (25, 21) (25, 14) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 5) (17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 11) (8, 28) (8, 15) (29, 17) (29, 11) (29, 18) (19, 25) (19, 5) (19, 18) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 28) (9, 21) (9, 24) (9, 0) (22, 4) (22, 20) (22, 28) (22, 0) (1, 4) (1, 15) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 22) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 13) (18, 29) (18, 19) (18, 24) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 14) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 21) (3, 13) (21, 25) (21, 10) (21, 9) (21, 3) (21, 24) (12, 20) (12, 16) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 23) (28, 8) (28, 2) (28, 22) (11, 17) (11, 29) (11, 5) (23, 16) (14, 20) (14, 25) (14, 5) (27, 6) (6, 25) (6, 27) (24, 9) (24, 18) (24, 21) (24, 13) (13, 15) (13, 3) (13, 24) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].
