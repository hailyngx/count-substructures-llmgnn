Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 2) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 26) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 28) (3, 1) (3, 24) (3, 10) (3, 16) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 22) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 26) (11, 25) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 22) (25, 11) (25, 20) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 19) (27, 5) (2, 14) (2, 16) (29, 14) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 24) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 8) (21, 27) (21, 28) (28, 14) (28, 1) (28, 21) (13, 11) (13, 15) (26, 17) (26, 11) (5, 27) (18, 20) (18, 23) (18, 24) (9, 17) (9, 29) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 2) (16, 7) (6, 17) (6, 22) (23, 18) (23, 24) (24, 3) (24, 29) (24, 18) (24, 23) (24, 19) (19, 17) (19, 27) (19, 24) (0, 4) (0, 8) (15, 4) (15, 13) (22, 10) (22, 20) (22, 6) (8, 12) (8, 7) (8, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: {4, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 11, 16, 28}
- Node 2: {14, 16}
- Node 3: {1, 10, 16, 24}
- Node 4: {0, 12, 15}
- Node 5: {27}
- Node 6: {17, 22}
- Node 7: {8, 16}
- Node 8: {0, 7, 12}
- Node 9: {17, 29}
- Node 10: {3, 11, 22}
- Node 11: {1, 10, 13, 25, 26}
- Node 12: {4, 8, 27}
- Node 13: {11, 15}
- Node 14: {2, 17, 28, 29}
- Node 15: {4, 13}
- Node 16: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 17: {6, 9, 14, 19, 26}
- Node 18: {20, 23, 24}
- Node 19: {17, 24, 27}
- Node 20: {18, 22, 25, 29}
- Node 21: {27, 28}
- Node 22: {10, 20, 6}
- Node 23: {18, 24}
- Node 24: {3, 18, 19, 23, 29}
- Node 25: {11, 20}
- Node 26: {11, 17}
- Node 27: {5, 12, 19, 21}
- Node 28: {1, 14, 21}
- Node 29: {14, 20, 24, 9}

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 17, 24, 29
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{17}{3} + \binom{24}{3} + \binom{29}{3} = 680 + 2024 + 3654 = 6358 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6358].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <17, (6, 19, 26)>
- <24, (18, 19, 29)>
- <29, (14, 20, 24)>
