Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 26) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 28) (16, 1) (16, 10) (1, 16) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (8, 1) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 23) (27, 12) (27, 26) (4, 9) (4, 17) (28, 16) (28, 6) (28, 19) (29, 0) (0, 1) (0, 29) (0, 14) (0, 22) (0, 26) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 25) (6, 12) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 15) (6, 26) (5, 24) (19, 28) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 24) (17, 4) (17, 18) (24, 6) (24, 5) (24, 19) (24, 18) (24, 10) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 21) (22, 0) (7, 20) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 7) (21, 20) (21, 25) (21, 2) (21, 15) (26, 11) (26, 27) (26, 0) (26, 6) (2, 13) (2, 21) (23, 12) (23, 25) (10, 16) (10, 19) (10, 24) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 21) (15, 18) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 24) (18, 15) (25, 14) (25, 21) (25, 23) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 14, 22, 26, 29}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 8, 16, 20}
- Node 2: {13, 21}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {9, 17}
- Node 5: {24}
- Node 6: {12, 15, 24, 26, 28}
- Node 7: {9, 20}
- Node 8: {1, 13}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 19}
- Node 10: {16, 19, 24}
- Node 11: {15, 16, 18, 26}
- Node 12: {6, 23, 27}
- Node 13: {2, 8, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 13, 25}
- Node 15: {6, 11, 15, 18, 21}
- Node 16: {1, 10, 11, 28}
- Node 17: {4, 18}
- Node 18: {11, 15, 17, 24}
- Node 19: {9, 10, 19, 24, 28}
- Node 20: {1, 7, 21}
- Node 21: {2, 15, 20, 25}
- Node 22: {0}
- Node 23: {12, 25}
- Node 24: {5, 6, 10, 18, 19}
- Node 25: {14, 21, 23}
- Node 26: {0, 6, 11, 27}
- Node 27: {12, 26}
- Node 28: {6, 16, 19, 24}
- Node 29: {0}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars possible:

- Node 0, 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1, 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6, 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9, 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 10, 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 11, 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13, 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 14, 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 15, 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 16, 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18, 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19, 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 21, 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24, 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 26, 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 80

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [80].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 14>, <0, 1, 22>, <0, 1, 26>, <0, 1, 29>, <0, 14, 22>, <0, 14, 26>, <0, 14, 29>, <0, 22, 26>, <0, 22, 29>, <0, 26, 29>, <1, 6, 15>, <1, 6, 18>, <1, 6, 21>, <1, 6, 28>, <1, 15, 18>, <1, 15, 21>, <1, 15, 28>, <1, 18, 21>, <1, 18, 28>, <1...
