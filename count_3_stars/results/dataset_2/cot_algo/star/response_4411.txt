Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 10) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 10) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 1) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 4) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 1) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 10) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) 

Response:
In this graph, the neighbors for each node are as follows:

Node 0: {14, 2, 10}
Node 1: {5, 14, 13, 6, 11, 4}
Node 2: {0, 8, 6}
Node 3: {5, 12, 10}
Node 4: {5, 9, 13, 1}
Node 5: {9, 13, 1, 4, 3, 7}
Node 6: {14, 2, 1}
Node 7: {5, 12, 10, 13, 8}
Node 8: {2, 7, 10}
Node 9: {5, 4, 11, 14}
Node 10: {7, 12, 0, 8, 3}
Node 11: {9, 13, 1}
Node 12: {7, 10, 3}
Node 13: {5, 7, 4, 11, 1}
Node 14: {9, 0, 6, 1}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:

Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<5, 1, 4, 13>
<5, 1, 4, 7>
<5, 1, 13, 7>
<5, 4, 13, 1>
<13, 11, 1, 4>
<7, 12, 10, 3>
