Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) 

Response:
Given the specified graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 7, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {6, 9, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {6, 9, 4}
- Node 3: {6, 4, 7, 0}
- Node 4: {8, 5, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 1, 0}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 2, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 0, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 4}
- Node 9: {8, 2, 1, 7}

Now, we need to identify the 3-star configurations. Since the total number of nodes is 10, we will focus on nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors (\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars)
  - <0, (3, 5, 7)>
  - <0, (3, 5, 6)>
  - <0, (3, 7, 6)>
  - <0, (5, 7, 6)>

- Node 1: 4 neighbors (\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars)
  - <1, (4, 5, 6)>
  - <1, (4, 5, 9)>
  - <1, (4, 6, 9)>
  - <1, (5, 6, 9)>

- Node 3: 4 neighbors (\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars)
  - <3, (0, 4, 6)>
  - <3, (0, 4, 7)>
  - <3, (0, 6, 7)>
  - <3, (4, 6, 7)>

- Node 4: 5 neighbors (\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars)
  - <4, (1, 3, 5)>
  - <4, (1, 3, 2)>
  - <4, (1, 5, 2)>
  - <4, (1, 3, 8)>
  - <4, (1, 5, 8)>
  - <4, (1, 2, 8)>
  - <4, (3, 5, 2)>
  - <4, (3, 5, 8)>
  - <4, (3, 2, 8)>
  - <4, (5, 2, 8)>

- Node 5: 4 neighbors (\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars)
  - <5, (0, 1, 4)>
  - <5, (0, 1, 7)>
  - <5, (0, 4, 7)>
  - <5, (1, 4, 7)>

In total, there are 24 unique 3-stars formed in this graph, so the final result is [24].
