Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 0) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 4) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 5) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 7) (18, 16) (18, 9) (8, 19) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 6) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 10) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 6) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 13) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 7) (5, 17) (5, 4) (12, 14) (12, 10) (1, 16) (1, 13) (10, 19) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 4) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 4) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (11, 3, 13)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (16, 13)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (15, 9, 7)
- Node 3: 5 neighbors (11, 15, 7, 0, 9)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (16, 5, 10, 13)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (17, 4)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (15, 8, 19, 7)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (3, 14, 2, 6)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (19, 6)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (3, 2, 18, 10)
- Node 10: 4 neighbors (19, 9, 12, 4)
- Node 11: 2 neighbors (3, 0)
- Node 12: 2 neighbors (14, 10)
- Node 13: 3 neighbors (0, 1, 4)
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (17, 7, 12)
- Node 15: 3 neighbors (3, 6, 2)
- Node 16: 3 neighbors (1, 18, 4)
- Node 17: 2 neighbors (14, 5)
- Node 18: 2 neighbors (16, 9)
- Node 19: 3 neighbors (8, 10, 6)

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3, 9, and 10 have 4 or more neighbors, giving us \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 13 have 3 neighbors, giving us 1 3-star each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([4 \times 3 + 6 \times 1] = [12 + 6] = [18]\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (11, 3, 13)>, <2, (15, 9, 7)>, <4, (16, 5, 10)>, <6, (15, 8, 19)>, <7, (3, 14, 2)>, <13, (0, 1, 4)>.

The final number of 3-stars is [18].
