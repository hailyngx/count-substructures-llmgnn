Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 7) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 16) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 13) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 2) (11, 19) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 19) (15, 8) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 12) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 17) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 6) (10, 0) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 3) (17, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 19) (2, 14) (2, 6) (18, 12) (18, 13) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 18) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 18) (6, 16) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 10, 4
- Node 1: 3, 16
- Node 2: 6, 14
- Node 3: 1, 17, 13
- Node 4: 0, 14, 19
- Node 5: 7, 17
- Node 6: 2, 16
- Node 7: 5, 9, 16
- Node 8: 15, 19, 16, 12
- Node 9: 7, 15, 12
- Node 10: 0, 16, 12, 13
- Node 11: 19
- Node 12: 9, 8, 10, 18
- Node 13: 3, 10, 18
- Node 14: 4, 15, 2
- Node 15: 9, 14, 19, 8
- Node 16: 6, 1, 8, 7, 10
- Node 17: 5, 3, 7
- Node 18: 12, 13
- Node 19: 11, 15, 8, 4

Now, we determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors to calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {1, 17, 13} → 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {0, 14, 19} → 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {5, 9, 16, 17} → \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {15, 19, 16, 12} → \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {7, 15, 12} → 1 3-star
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {0, 16, 12, 13} → \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: {9, 8, 10, 18} → \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: {3, 10, 18} → 1 3-star
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: {4, 15, 2} → 1 3-star
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: {9, 14, 19, 8} → \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors: {6, 1, 8, 7, 10} → \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: {5, 3, 7} → 1 3-star
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: {11, 15, 8, 4} → \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [35]. 

The unique 3-stars are: <3, (1, 17, 13)>, <4, (0, 14, 19)>, <7, (5, 9, 16)>, <8, (15, 19, 16)>, <9, (7, 15, 12)>, <10, (0, 16, 12)>, <12, (9, 8, 10)>, <13, (3, 10, 18)>, <14, (4, 15, 2)>, <15, (9, 14, 19)>, <16, (6, 1, 8)>, <17, (5, 3, 7)>, <19, (11, 15, 8)>.
