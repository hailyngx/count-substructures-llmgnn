The edges are as follows: (13, 25) (13, 10) (22, 4) (22, 16) (22, 15) (1, 29) (21, 27) (21, 12) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 27) (3, 25) (3, 23) (25, 13) (25, 3) (25, 15) (25, 11) (14, 6) (14, 16) (17, 24) (17, 19) (8, 19) (23, 3) (23, 5) (12, 21) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 18) (27, 21) (27, 9) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 28) (29, 1) (29, 26) (0, 28) (0, 4) (0, 2) (24, 6) (24, 17) (24, 27) (24, 26) (24, 18) (26, 29) (26, 24) (26, 5) (10, 13) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 28) (10, 20) (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 10) (11, 25) (11, 19) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 16) (7, 16) (7, 28) (16, 22) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 7) (16, 20) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 0) (28, 27) (28, 0) (28, 10) (28, 7) (4, 22) (4, 6) (4, 0) (5, 23) (5, 26) (18, 12) (18, 24) (18, 10) (20, 9) (20, 10) (20, 16) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0 neighbors: 2, 4, 28
Node 1 neighbors: 29
Node 2 neighbors: 0, 6, 12
Node 3 neighbors: 5, 11, 23, 25
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 22
Node 5 neighbors: 3, 23, 26
Node 6 neighbors: 2, 4, 9, 14, 24
Node 7 neighbors: 16, 28
Node 8 neighbors: 19
Node 9 neighbors: 6, 20, 27
Node 10 neighbors: 13, 15, 18, 20, 28
Node 11 neighbors: 3, 19, 25
Node 12 neighbors: 2, 18, 21, 27
Node 13 neighbors: 10, 25
Node 14 neighbors: 6, 16
Node 15 neighbors: 10, 22, 25
Node 16 neighbors: 7, 14, 19, 20, 22
Node 17 neighbors: 19, 24
Node 18 neighbors: 10, 12, 24
Node 19 neighbors: 8, 11, 16, 17
Node 20 neighbors: 9, 10, 16
Node 21 neighbors: 12, 27
Node 22 neighbors: 4, 15, 16
Node 23 neighbors: 3, 5
Node 24 neighbors: 6, 17, 18, 26, 27
Node 25 neighbors: 3, 11, 13, 15
Node 26 neighbors: 5, 24, 29
Node 27 neighbors: 9, 12, 21, 24, 28
Node 28 neighbors: 0, 7, 10, 27
Node 29 neighbors: 1, 26

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors -> no 3-stars
Node 2 has 3 neighbors -> no 3-stars
Node 4 has 3 neighbors -> no 3-stars
Node 6 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 10 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 12 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 16 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 18 has 3 neighbors -> no 3-stars
Node 19 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 24 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 25 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 27 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 28 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 52

Thus, the final number is [52]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 14)>, <6, (2, 4, 24)>, <6, (4, 9, 14)>, <6, (4, 9, 24)>, <6, (9, 14, 24)>, <10, (13, 15, 28)>, <10, (13, 18, 28)>, <10, (13, 20, 28)>, <10, (15, 18, 28)>, <10, (15, 20, 28)>, <10, (18, 20, 28)>, <12, (2, 18, 21)>, <12, (2, 18, 27)>, <12, (2, 21, 27)>, <12, (18, 21, 27)>, <16, (14, 19, 20)>, <16, (16, 19, 20)>, <16, (16, 19, 22)>, <16, (16, 20, 22)>, <16, (19, 20, 22)>, <19, (11, 16, 17)>, <19, (11, 16, 19)>, <19, (11, 17, 19)>, <19, (16, 17, 19)>, <24, (17, 18, 26)>, <24, (17, 18, 27)>, <24, (17, 26, 27)>, <24, (18, 26, 27)>, <27, (21, 24, 28)>
