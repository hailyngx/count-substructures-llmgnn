Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 19) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 17) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 17) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 17) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 19) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 14) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 12) (12, 19) (12, 10) (12, 11) (16, 4) (16, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (10, 2) (10, 12) (17, 18) (17, 5) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 11) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 17) (14, 9) (14, 15) 

Response:
The graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to consider the neighbor sets for each node. 

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {11, 17}
- Node 1: {5, 15, 19}
- Node 2: {10, 11, 18}
- Node 3: {4, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 13, 16, 18}
- Node 5: {1, 13, 17}
- Node 6: {9, 13}
- Node 7: {3, 15, 17}
- Node 8: {9, 19}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 12, 17}
- Node 12: {10, 11, 19}
- Node 13: {4, 5, 6, 9, 16}
- Node 14: {9, 15}
- Node 15: {1, 7, 14}
- Node 16: {4, 13}
- Node 17: {0, 5, 7, 11, 18}
- Node 18: {2, 4, 17}
- Node 19: {1, 8, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
  - Node 0: 1 3-star
  - Node 1: 3-stars with (5, 15, 19)
  - Node 2: 1 3-star
  - Node 3: No 3-star
  - Node 4: 1 3-star
  - Node 5: 1 3-star
  - Node 6: No 3-star
  - Node 7: 1 3-star
  - Node 8: No 3-star
  - Node 9: 1 3-star
  - Node 10: No 3-star
  - Node 11: 1 3-star
  - Node 12: No 3-star
  - Node 13: 1 3-star
  - Node 14: No 3-star
  - Node 15: 1 3-star
  - Node 16: No 3-star
  - Node 17: 1 3-star
  - Node 18: No 3-star
  - Node 19: No 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 9, so the final answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (11, 17)>
<1, (5, 15, 19)>
<2, (10, 11, 18)>
<4, (3, 13, 16)>
<5, (1, 13, 17)>
<7, (3, 15, 17)>
<9, (6, 8, 13)>
<11, (0, 2, 12)>
<13, (4, 5, 16)>
