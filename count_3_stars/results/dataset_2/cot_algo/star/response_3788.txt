Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 6) (8, 3) (8, 11) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 17) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 17) (5, 19) (5, 17) (13, 18) (13, 9) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 9) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 14) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 9) (17, 0) (17, 4) (17, 5) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 4) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 16) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 20 nodes and 60 edges. Let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {16, 15, 17}
Node 1: {3, 14, 19}
Node 2: {18, 6, 11}
Node 3: {1, 8}
Node 4: {11, 6, 17}
Node 5: {19, 17}
Node 6: {2, 12, 4, 16}
Node 7: {12, 10, 14}
Node 8: {3, 11}
Node 9: {13, 19, 14}
Node 10: {18, 7, 12, 16}
Node 11: {2, 8, 4}
Node 12: {7, 10, 6}
Node 13: {18, 9}
Node 14: {1, 7, 15, 9}
Node 15: {0, 16, 14}
Node 16: {0, 15, 10, 6}
Node 17: {0, 4, 5}
Node 18: {2, 10, 13}
Node 19: {1, 5, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 0: {16, 15, 17} -> forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 1: {3, 14, 19} -> forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 2: {18, 6, 11} -> forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 4: {11, 6, 17} -> forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 6: {2, 12, 4, 16} -> forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 7: {12, 10, 14} -> forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 10: {18, 7, 12, 16} -> forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 14: {1, 7, 15, 9} -> forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 16: {0, 15, 10, 6} -> forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 21

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (16, 15, 17)>, <1, (3, 14, 19)>, <2, (18, 6, 11)>, <4, (11, 6, 17)>, <6, (2, 12, 4, 16)>, <7, (12, 10, 14)>, <10, (18, 7, 12, 16)>, <14, (1, 7, 15, 9)>, <16, (0, 15, 10, 6)>
