Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 16) (15, 10) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 0) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 1) (17, 9) (17, 10) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (18, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 11) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 16) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 8) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 19) (16, 3) (16, 6) (16, 14) (16, 13) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 19) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 11) (8, 5) (8, 1) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 2, 14, 11}
- Node 1: {10, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {9, 0, 5}
- Node 3: {10, 16}
- Node 4: {19, 5, 1, 11}
- Node 5: {6, 2, 18, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 7, 16}
- Node 7: {6, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {5, 1}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 17, 0}
- Node 10: {3, 15, 17, 1}
- Node 11: {12, 4, 0, 19}
- Node 12: {7, 11}
- Node 13: {7, 16, 19}
- Node 14: {0, 16}
- Node 15: {10}
- Node 16: {3, 6, 14, 13}
- Node 17: {9, 10}
- Node 18: {5}
- Node 19: {4, 13, 11}

Now, for the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: No 3-stars formed
- Node 2: No 3-stars formed
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: No 3-stars formed 
- Node 9: No 3-stars formed 
- Node 10: No 3-stars formed 
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: No 3-stars formed 
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: No 3-stars formed 

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 26 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found are:
