Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 10) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 19) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 18) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 13) (17, 19) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 2) (4, 11) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 2) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 0) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 9) (13, 10) (13, 7) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 2) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 2) (8, 7) (9, 15) 

Response:
First, we need to create an adjacency list based on the given edges:

Node 0: 3, 18, 19, 2
Node 1: 16, 5, 19
Node 2: 6, 12, 14, 0
Node 3: 0, 10, 6, 18
Node 4: 11
Node 5: 11, 16, 1, 6, 19
Node 6: 3, 5, 15, 2
Node 7: 14, 13, 8
Node 8: 7
Node 9: 15
Node 10: 16, 3, 13
Node 11: 4, 16, 5
Node 12: 2
Node 13: 10, 7
Node 14: 18, 7, 2
Node 15: 16, 6, 9
Node 16: 11, 15, 1, 5, 10
Node 17: 19
Node 18: 3, 19, 14, 0
Node 19: 1, 17, 5, 18, 0

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of them:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 27 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars are:
