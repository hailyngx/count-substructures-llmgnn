Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 5) (6, 9) (6, 19) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 10) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 5) (17, 9) (17, 18) (12, 4) (12, 7) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 16) (14, 0) (14, 13) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 18) (19, 6) (19, 4) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 8) (2, 10) (2, 13) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated as follows:
For each node with three or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node.

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {14, 18, 1, 8}
   - Number of 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {15, 0, 8}
   - There is exactly 1 3-star with this node: <1, (15, 0, 8)>
   
3. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {15, 7, 9, 8}
   - Number of 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   
4. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {6, 7, 12, 19, 10}
   - Number of 3-stars formed = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - The 3-stars are <4, (6, 7, 12)>, <4, (6, 7, 19)>, <4, (6, 7, 10)>, <4, (6, 12, 19)>, <4, (6, 12, 10)>, <4, (6, 19, 10)>, <4, (7, 12, 19)>, <4, (7, 12, 10)>, <4, (7, 19, 10)>, <4, (12, 19, 10)>

5. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {9, 19, 4, 13}
   - Number of 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

6. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {3, 0, 1, 18}
   - Number of 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

7. Node 13 has 3 neighbors: {6, 14, 2}
   - There is exactly 1 3-star with this node: <13, (6, 14, 2)>

8. Node 14 has 3 neighbors: {16, 0, 13}
   - There is exactly 1 3-star with this node: <14, (16, 0, 13)>

9. Node 15 has 3 neighbors: {3, 1, 5}
   - There is exactly 1 3-star with this node: <15, (3, 1, 5)>

10. Node 16 has 3 neighbors: {11, 7, 14}
    - There is exactly 1 3-star with this node: <16, (11, 7, 14)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 27

Therefore, the final total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27].
