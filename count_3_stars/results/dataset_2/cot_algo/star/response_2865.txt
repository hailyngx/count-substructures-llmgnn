Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from these nodes, we get 46. 

Therefore, the final answer is [46], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 5, 8>
<1, 4, 7, 9>
<1, 5, 7, 9>
<1, 7, 8, 9>
<2, 4, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
