Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the provided edges:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 9 each have 4 or more neighbors.

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up these results, we get a total of 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 52 3-stars. 
Therefore, the final answer is [52].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
