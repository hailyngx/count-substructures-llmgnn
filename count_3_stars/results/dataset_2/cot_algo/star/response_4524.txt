Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 17) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 3) (19, 5) (19, 7) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 17) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 15) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 1) (16, 8) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 10) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 11) (18, 14) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 3) (7, 15) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 12) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 17, 18}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 11, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 8, 10}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 11, 19}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 15, 19}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 9, 13, 15, 16}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8, 17, 18}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 5, 12, 18}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 11, 17}
- Node 13: Neighbors {8, 17}
- Node 14: Neighbors {3, 10, 18}
- Node 15: Neighbors {7, 8, 17}
- Node 16: Neighbors {8}
- Node 17: Neighbors {0, 9, 12, 13, 15}
- Node 18: Neighbors {0, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 19: Neighbors {5, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so \[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \] 3-star.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so \[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \] 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so \[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \] 3-star.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so \[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \] 3-star.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so \[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \] 3-star.
Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
