Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 17) (10, 3) (10, 16) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 19) (2, 11) (2, 15) (18, 14) (18, 15) (7, 16) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 15) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 3) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 17) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 15) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 15) (14, 18) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 4) (0, 11) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 19) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 16) (15, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {11}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 13}
- Node 2: {11, 15}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 4: {1, 11, 13, 15}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 17, 19}
- Node 6: {3, 9, 12, 16}
- Node 7: {3, 16}
- Node 8: {3, 8, 13, 16}
- Node 9: {6, 17}
- Node 10: {3, 16}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 12: {6, 15}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 8, 19}
- Node 14: {18}
- Node 15: {2, 4, 12, 16, 18}
- Node 16: {6, 7, 8, 10, 15}
- Node 17: {5, 9, 19}
- Node 18: {14, 15}
- Node 19: {1, 5, 13, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 16, 19

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 10)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 10)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 10)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (8, 13, 19)>, <3, (5, 8, 13)>, <3, (7, 8, 13)>

- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <4, (1, 13, 15)>, <4, (1, 5, 13)>, <4, (1, 5, 15)>, <4, (13, 15, 19)>

- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <5, (1, 13, 19)>, <5, (1, 4, 15)>, <5, (13, 17, 19)>, <5, (17, 19, 13)>

- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <6, (9, 12, 16)>, <6, (3, 7, 16)>, <6, (3, 8, 16)>, <6, (3, 10, 16)>

- For node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <16, (6, 7, 8)>, <16, (6, 7, 10)>, <16, (6, 8, 10)>, <16, (3, 7, 8)>, <16, (3, 7, 10)>, <16, (3, 8, 10)>, <16, (15, 18, 4)>, <16, (15, 12, 18)>, <16, (12, 15, 4)>, <16, (15, 4, 18)>

- For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <19, (5, 13, 17)>, <19, (1, 13, 5)>, <19, (1, 4, 13)>, <19, (1, 4, 15)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the final answer is [36].
