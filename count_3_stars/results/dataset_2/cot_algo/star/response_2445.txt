Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 10) (26, 16) (26, 27) (5, 19) (5, 16) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 28) (17, 23) (17, 2) (17, 4) (18, 22) (18, 29) (18, 3) (22, 9) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 8) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 21) (29, 18) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 3) (12, 27) (12, 25) (12, 23) (27, 26) (27, 22) (27, 12) (27, 24) (0, 20) (0, 7) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 8) (20, 28) (20, 11) (15, 20) (15, 4) (7, 14) (7, 0) (19, 5) (11, 20) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 25) (23, 17) (23, 12) (16, 26) (16, 5) (16, 6) (21, 2) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 15) (8, 22) (8, 20) (8, 10) (28, 9) (28, 17) (28, 20) (1, 29) (1, 11) (1, 24) (1, 13) (13, 1) (13, 10) (3, 18) (3, 29) (6, 29) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 25) (24, 27) (24, 1) (24, 25) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 13) (25, 12) (25, 11) (25, 6) (25, 24) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 7, 20
Node 1 neighbors: 11, 13, 24, 29
Node 2 neighbors: 14, 17, 21
Node 3 neighbors: 18, 29
Node 4 neighbors: 14, 15, 17
Node 5 neighbors: 16, 19
Node 6 neighbors: 11, 16, 25, 29
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 14
Node 8 neighbors: 10, 20, 22
Node 9 neighbors: 10, 22, 28
Node 10 neighbors: 8, 9, 13
Node 11 neighbors: 1, 6, 20, 25
Node 12 neighbors: 23, 25, 27
Node 13 neighbors: 1, 10
Node 14 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 17
Node 15 neighbors: 4, 20
Node 16 neighbors: 5, 6, 26
Node 17 neighbors: 2, 4, 14, 23, 28
Node 18 neighbors: 3, 22, 29
Node 19 neighbors: 5
Node 20 neighbors: 0, 8, 11, 15, 28
Node 21 neighbors: 2
Node 22 neighbors: 8, 9, 18, 27
Node 23 neighbors: 12, 17
Node 24 neighbors: 1, 25, 27
Node 25 neighbors: 6, 11, 12, 24
Node 26 neighbors: 16, 27
Node 27 neighbors: 12, 22, 24, 26
Node 28 neighbors: 9, 17, 20
Node 29 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 18

Now, we check nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to see if they form 3-stars:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 13, and 29: <1, (11, 13, 29)>. 
Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 16, and 25: <6, (11, 16, 25)>.
Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 17: <14, (2, 4, 17)>.
Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 14: <17, (2, 4, 14)>.
Node 20 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 11, and 28: <20, (8, 11, 28)>.
Node 22 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 18, and 27: <22, (9, 18, 27)>.
Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 24, and 6: <25, (11, 24, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 6, and this number should be inside brackets, so the final answer is [6].
