Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (26, 23) (26, 3) (5, 6) (5, 29) (5, 11) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 28) (17, 21) (0, 27) (0, 22) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 1) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 29) (6, 13) (28, 17) (28, 6) (28, 16) (28, 24) (28, 2) (2, 28) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 21) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 21) (7, 2) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 4) (1, 17) (1, 27) (1, 20) (1, 22) (16, 28) (16, 8) (16, 3) (20, 1) (20, 19) (29, 5) (29, 14) (29, 6) (4, 12) (4, 10) (23, 26) (23, 0) (11, 5) (11, 25) (19, 20) (19, 25) (19, 10) (25, 11) (25, 19) (25, 21) (25, 18) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 21) (22, 0) (22, 1) (22, 3) (24, 28) (24, 13) (18, 14) (18, 25) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 3) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 18) (3, 26) (3, 16) (3, 22) (3, 18) (13, 6) (13, 24) (21, 17) (21, 2) (21, 8) (21, 25) (21, 15) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 27, 22, 23
- Node 1: 17, 27, 20, 22
- Node 2: 28, 8, 7, 21
- Node 3: 26, 16, 22, 18
- Node 4: 12, 10
- Node 5: 6, 29, 11
- Node 6: 5, 28, 29, 13
- Node 7: 2, 12
- Node 8: 2, 16, 21
- Node 10: 4, 19, 18
- Node 11: 5, 25
- Node 12: 7, 4
- Node 13: 6, 24
- Node 14: 17, 18, 15, 29
- Node 15: 14, 18, 21
- Node 16: 28, 8, 3
- Node 17: 14, 1, 28, 21
- Node 18: 14, 25, 15, 3, 10
- Node 19: 20, 25, 10
- Node 20: 1, 19
- Node 21: 17, 2, 8, 25, 15
- Node 22: 0, 1, 3
- Node 23: 26, 0
- Node 24: 28, 13
- Node 25: 11, 19, 21, 18
- Node 26: 23, 3
- Node 27: 0, 1
- Node 28: 17, 6, 16, 24, 2
- Node 29: 5, 14, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 5, 6, 29, 14, 18, 28, 21, 25 have at least 3 neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes.
- Node 5 has exactly 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 43

Therefore, the final answer is [43], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<5, (11, 29, 6)>
<6, (5, 28, 29)>
<14, (17, 18, 29)>
<18, (14, 25, 15)>
<28, (17, 16, 24)>
<21, (17, 25, 15)>
