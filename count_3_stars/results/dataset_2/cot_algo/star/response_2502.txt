Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 9) (29, 12) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 26) (15, 0) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 21) (6, 22) (6, 19) (28, 7) (28, 22) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 23) (4, 14) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 16) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 5) (21, 20) (9, 29) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 23) (8, 27) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 1) (12, 29) (12, 3) (12, 16) (12, 5) (16, 18) (16, 12) (16, 13) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 5) (26, 15) (26, 10) (26, 17) (7, 28) (7, 19) (7, 14) (0, 15) (0, 23) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 16) (1, 20) (1, 19) (25, 5) (25, 23) (25, 14) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 25) (24, 2) (24, 14) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 11) (23, 4) (23, 9) (23, 0) (23, 25) (23, 14) (27, 8) (27, 17) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 25) (14, 24) (14, 23) (17, 26) (17, 27) 

Response:
The central idea is to determine the neighbor set for each node in the graph. Then, for each node that has three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed with that node at the center.

Let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {15, 23}
- Node 1: {19, 20}
- Node 2: {10, 13, 24, 29}
- Node 3: {11, 12}
- Node 4: {9, 13, 14, 18, 23}
- Node 5: {10, 11, 12, 25}
- Node 6: {19, 22}
- Node 7: {14, 19, 28}
- Node 8: {27}
- Node 9: {4, 18, 23, 29}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 10, 26}
- Node 11: {3, 5, 11, 22}
- Node 12: {3, 5, 12, 16, 29}
- Node 13: {2, 4, 13, 16}
- Node 14: {4, 7, 14, 23, 24, 25}
- Node 15: {0, 19, 20, 26}
- Node 16: {12, 13, 16, 18}
- Node 17: {26, 27}
- Node 18: {4, 9, 16, 18}
- Node 19: {1, 6, 7, 15, 19}
- Node 20: {1, 15, 20, 21}
- Node 21: {20}
- Node 22: {6, 11, 22, 28}
- Node 23: {0, 4, 9, 14, 23, 25}
- Node 24: {2, 14, 24}
- Node 25: {5, 14, 23, 25}
- Node 26: {10, 15, 17, 26}
- Node 27: {8, 17, 27}
- Node 28: {7, 22, 28}
- Node 29: {2, 9, 12, 29}

Now, we will calculate the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed with each node that has three or more neighbors. 

- Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. 
- Node 9 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 10 can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 11 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 12 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. 
- Node 13 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 14 can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars. 
- Node 15 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 18 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 19 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 22 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 23 can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars. 
- Node 26 can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 80. 

Therefore, the final answer is [80]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, 4, 13>
- <2, 4, 24>
- <2, 4, 29>
- <2, 13, 16>
- <2, 13, 29>
- <4, 9, 23>
- <4, 13, 16>
- <4, 13, 29>
- <4, 14, 23>
- <9, 18, 23>
- <9, 18, 29>
- <11, 12, 29>
- <12, 16, 18>
- <12, 16, 29>
- <12, 18, 29>
- <14, 23, 25>
- <14, 24, 25>
- <16, 18, 29>
- <19, 23, 25>
- <23, 25, 14>
