Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 9) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 15) (6, 17) (6, 19) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 14) (8, 17) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 18) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 7) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 13) (10, 0) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 9) (7, 19) (7, 17) (7, 9) (15, 5) (15, 13) (13, 16) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 9) (18, 5) (18, 14) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) 

Response:
First, we will create a representation of the graph to help visualize the connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 14.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 16.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 14, and 16.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 9, and 14.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 11, and 12.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 15, 17, 18, and 19.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 17 and 19.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 17, and 19.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 17.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 9, 11, and 16.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 0 and 13.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 16.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4 and 13.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 10, 12, 13, 15, and 16.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 18.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 5 and 13.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 2, 9, 11, and 13.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 5 and 14.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 17.

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors.

For each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding all these up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 10, 14)>, <4, (0, 11, 12)>, <5, (15, 17, 18)>, <9, (3, 7, 13)>, <13, (10, 12, 15)>, <14, (0, 2, 18)>, <16, (2, 9, 13)>, <17, (5, 6, 7)>, <19, (6, 7, 17)>.
