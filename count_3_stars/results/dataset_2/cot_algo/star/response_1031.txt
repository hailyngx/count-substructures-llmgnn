Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 5) (15, 18) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 17) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 16) (18, 15) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 8) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 16) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 10) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 1) (5, 3) (5, 19) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 11) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (12, 18) (12, 1) (13, 7) (13, 11) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 1) (16, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 19) (6, 3) (6, 16) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes of each node:

Node 0: {9}
Node 1: {10, 12, 16, 17}
Node 2: {8, 15, 16, 18}
Node 3: {5, 6}
Node 4: {7, 16, 17}
Node 5: {3, 19}
Node 6: {3, 16}
Node 7: {4, 9, 13, 17}
Node 8: {2, 9, 10, 18, 19}
Node 9: {0, 7, 8, 11}
Node 10: {1, 8, 19}
Node 11: {9, 13, 14}
Node 12: {1, 18}
Node 13: {7, 11}
Node 14: {11, 16}
Node 15: {2, 18}
Node 16: {1, 2, 4, 6, 14}
Node 17: {1, 4, 7}
Node 18: {2, 8, 12, 15}
Node 19: {5, 8, 10}

Now, let's look at the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the total number of 3-stars:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star
<1, (10, 12, 16)>, <1, (10, 17, 16)>, <1, (12, 16, 17)>, <1, (10, 12, 17)>
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star
<2, (8, 16, 18)>, <2, (8, 15, 18)>, <2, (8, 15, 2)>, <2, (8, 18, 2)>
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<4, (7, 16, 17)>
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star
<7, (9, 13, 17)>, <7, (9, 13, 11)>, <7, (9, 11, 13)>, <7, (9, 11, 14)>
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star
<8, (9, 10, 19)>, <8, (9, 10, 1)>, <8, (9, 10, 8)>, <8, (9, 19, 10)>, <8, (9, 19, 8)>, <8, (9, 1, 10)>, <8, (9, 1, 12)>, <8, (9, 8, 10)>, <8, (9, 8, 19)>, <8, (9, 11, 13)>
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star
<9, (7, 11, 13)>, <9, (7, 11, 14)>, <9, (7, 13, 11)>, <9, (11, 13, 14)>
Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<11, (13, 14, 16)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 28

Therefore, the final answer is [28].
