Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 4) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 1) (4, 17) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 16) (13, 19) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 3) (15, 8) (15, 6) (16, 5) (16, 19) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 3) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 1) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 19) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 6) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 1) 

Response:
First, we'll create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 10, 2, 18, 14
- Node 1: 18, 12, 7
- Node 2: 10, 14, 0, 12
- Node 3: 14, 9, 19
- Node 4: 17, 8
- Node 5: 18, 11, 16
- Node 6: 17, 15, 11
- Node 7: 8, 14, 1
- Node 8: 4, 9, 15, 7
- Node 9: 17, 8, 3
- Node 10: 17, 0, 14
- Node 11: 5, 12, 6
- Node 12: 2, 11, 1
- Node 13: 19
- Node 14: 10, 2, 0, 3, 7
- Node 15: 8, 6
- Node 16: 5, 19
- Node 17: 10, 6, 9, 4
- Node 18: 5, 0, 1
- Node 19: 13, 16, 3

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with more than 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up gives us a total of 27 3-stars. 

So, the final answer is [27], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 10, 14, 2>
- <0, 10, 14, 7>
- <0, 10, 2, 14>
- <0, 14, 2, 10>
- <2, 10, 14, 0>
- <2, 10, 14, 7>
- <2, 10, 0, 14>
- <2, 14, 0, 10>
- <5, 11, 16>
- <8, 15, 6>
- <8, 4, 9>
- <8, 4, 17>
- <8, 9, 17>
- <14, 3, 7>
- <14, 3, 9>
- <14, 3, 19>
- <14, 7, 1>
- <17, 4, 8>
- <17, 4, 9>
- <17, 4, 6>
- <17, 6, 15>
- <18, 0, 5>
- <18, 0, 1>
- <18, 5, 1>
- <18, 5, 11>
- <19, 3, 16>
- <19, 3, 13>
