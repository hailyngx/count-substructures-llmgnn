Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 25) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 15) (3, 29) (25, 11) (25, 6) (25, 8) (8, 16) (8, 25) (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 20) (13, 28) (12, 1) (12, 26) (27, 10) (27, 28) (2, 13) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 17) (1, 12) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 28) (26, 12) (26, 1) (26, 20) (26, 29) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 20) (20, 13) (20, 26) (20, 17) (4, 14) (4, 21) (29, 3) (29, 26) (29, 22) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 24) (23, 19) (5, 18) (5, 10) (19, 23) (19, 0) (6, 25) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 16) (9, 15) (21, 13) (21, 2) (21, 4) (21, 22) (14, 4) (14, 23) (14, 22) (14, 7) (22, 29) (22, 21) (22, 14) (22, 15) (24, 23) (24, 0) (0, 19) (0, 6) (0, 24) (0, 15) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 22) (15, 0) (7, 14) (10, 27) (10, 2) (10, 5) (28, 13) (28, 27) (28, 1) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {19, 6, 24, 15}
- Node 1: {12, 26, 6, 28}
- Node 2: {13, 18, 10, 17, 21}
- Node 3: {29}
- Node 4: {14, 21}
- Node 5: {18, 10}
- Node 6: {25, 1, 0}
- Node 7: {14}
- Node 8: {16, 25}
- Node 9: {16, 15}
- Node 10: {27, 2, 5}
- Node 11: {23, 25}
- Node 12: {1, 26}
- Node 13: {21, 2, 20, 28}
- Node 14: {4, 23, 22, 7}
- Node 15: {16, 9, 22, 0}
- Node 16: {17, 8, 9, 15}
- Node 17: {16, 2, 18, 20}
- Node 18: {17, 2, 5}
- Node 19: {23, 0}
- Node 20: {13, 26, 17}
- Node 21: {13, 2, 4, 22}
- Node 22: {29, 21, 14, 15}
- Node 23: {11, 14, 24, 19}
- Node 24: {23, 0}
- Node 25: {11, 6, 8}
- Node 26: {12, 1, 20, 29}
- Node 27: {10, 28}
- Node 28: {13, 27, 1}
- Node 29: {3, 26, 22}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 21, and 28: <2, 13, 21, 28>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 23, and 22: <14, 4, 23, 22>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
