Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 13) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 12) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 10) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 6) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 6, 3, 4, 14, 5, 2
- Node 1: 6, 14, 4
- Node 2: 0, 14, 5, 12
- Node 3: 9, 7, 0, 8
- Node 4: 6, 1, 8, 0, 10, 5
- Node 5: 4, 0, 11, 2, 12
- Node 6: 1, 4, 0, 13
- Node 7: 3, 8, 10
- Node 8: 3, 4, 10, 12, 7
- Node 9: 10, 3
- Node 10: 9, 4, 8, 7
- Node 11: 14, 5, 12
- Node 12: 8, 11, 2, 5
- Node 13: 6, 14
- Node 14: 1, 0, 11, 2, 13

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 0: 6, 3, 4, 14, 5, 2 (6 neighbors) => \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 6, 1, 8, 0, 10, 5 (6 neighbors) => \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 4, 0, 11, 2, 12 (5 neighbors) => 0 3-stars
- Node 8: 3, 4, 10, 12, 7 (5 neighbors) => 0 3-stars
- Node 12: 8, 11, 2, 5 (4 neighbors) => 0 3-stars
- Node 14: 1, 0, 11, 2, 13 (5 neighbors) => 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 20 = 40

Therefore, the final answer is [40] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (6, 3, 4)>, <0, (6, 3, 14)>, <0, (6, 4, 14)>, <0, (3, 4, 14)>, <4, (6, 1, 8)>.
