Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 8, 3, 1, 2
- Node 1: 5, 9, 4, 8, 0, 2
- Node 2: 9, 6, 3, 0, 1
- Node 3: 9, 6, 0, 2
- Node 4: 8, 1, 6
- Node 5: 9, 1
- Node 6: 4, 3, 2
- Node 7: 9, 8
- Node 8: 9, 4, 0, 7, 1
- Node 9: 5, 1, 8, 2, 3, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 8, 3, 1, 2 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1: 5, 9, 4, 8, 0, 2 (6 neighbors)
- Node 2: 9, 6, 3, 0, 1 (5 neighbors)
- Node 3: 9, 6, 0, 2 (4 neighbors)
- Node 8: 9, 4, 0, 7, 1 (5 neighbors)
- Node 9: 5, 1, 8, 2, 3, 7 (6 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 64

Therefore, the final answer is [64], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 8, 3)>
- <1, (0, 8, 2)>
- <1, (5, 9, 2)>
- <1, (5, 9, 8)>
