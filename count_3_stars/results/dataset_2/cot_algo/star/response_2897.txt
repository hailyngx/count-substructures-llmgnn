Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 10) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 9) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 6: {1, 2}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 8, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 7, 10}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {5, 9, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 3, 4, 11}
- Node 13: {7, 9, 10}
- Node 14: {2, 7, 10}

In this graph, nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 14 have 3 or more neighbors. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 85

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars is [85], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (3, 4, 12)>, <0, (4, 12, 11)>, <0, (1, 7, 5)>, <1, (0, 6, 2)>, <1, (6, 2, 14)>, <1, (10, 14, 7)>, <2, (5, 11, 12)>, <3, (0, 8, 5)>, <5, (7, 9, 13)>, <7, (1, 8, 10)>, <7, (5, 8, 10)>, <7, (8, 10, 13)>, <7, (9, 13, 10)>, <9, (2, 4, 12)>, <9, (4, 12, 11)>, <9, (7, 13, 10)>, <12, (3, 4, 11)>
