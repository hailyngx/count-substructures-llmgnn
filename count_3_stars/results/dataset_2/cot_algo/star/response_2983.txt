Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 12) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 8) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {7, 10, 14, 2, 12}
- Node 2: {11, 8, 13, 1}
- Node 3: {6, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 0, 6}
- Node 5: {7, 6, 11, 13, 12}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 3, 12}
- Node 7: {4, 14, 5, 1}
- Node 8: {4, 13, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {14, 3, 0}
- Node 10: {11, 1}
- Node 11: {10, 3, 13, 5, 2}
- Node 12: {6, 13, 5, 1}
- Node 13: {8, 11, 5, 3, 12}
- Node 14: {7, 9, 1}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 10: Node only has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed
- Node 11: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 12: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 14: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 48

Therefore, the final answer is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (7, 12, 5)>, <3, (6, 13, 5)>, <5, (7, 13, 11)>, <7, (1, 4, 14)>, <12, (1, 5, 6)>, <13, (3, 5, 11)>
