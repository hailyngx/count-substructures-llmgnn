Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 11) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 12) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 0) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 14) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 9) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {11, 7, 10, 12, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 9, 12}
- Node 2: {3, 13, 7, 10, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 11, 2}
- Node 4: {1, 8, 11}
- Node 5: {8, 6, 12, 10, 7, 14}
- Node 6: {13, 5, 12}
- Node 7: {13, 5, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 0, 2, 14}
- Node 10: {13, 5, 0, 2}
- Node 11: {3, 4, 0}
- Node 12: {1, 8, 5, 6, 0, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 10, 7, 6}
- Node 14: {5, 9, 12}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14 (total: 10)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 0, 1, 4, 8, 11, 13, and 14: 0 3-stars.
- For nodes 2, 6: 1 3-star each.
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 20 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [22].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (13, 7, 10)>
<6, (13, 5, 12)>
<3, (1, 11, 2)>
<12, (1, 8, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 11)>
<8, (4, 5, 12)>
<13, (2, 10, 7)>
<14, (5, 9, 12)>
