Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 0) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 7) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 15) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (15, 10) (15, 18) (19, 8) (19, 13) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 4) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 11) (6, 3) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 16) 

Response:
The graph has the following neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {4, 13}
- Node 2: {8, 18}
- Node 3: {6, 18}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 16}
- Node 5: {4, 9, 18}
- Node 6: {3, 12}
- Node 7: {9, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {2, 8, 13, 16, 19}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 7, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 11, 15}
- Node 11: {7, 8, 10}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 8, 19}
- Node 14: {0, 7, 12, 17}
- Node 15: {10, 18}
- Node 16: {4, 8, 17}
- Node 17: {14, 16}
- Node 18: {2, 3, 5, 15}
- Node 19: {8, 13}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors that can form 3-stars are: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (9, 10, 12)>, <4, (1, 16, 5)>, <5, (4, 9, 18)>, <8, (19, 13, 2)>, <9, (12, 0, 5)>, <12, (0, 9, 6)>, <14, (17, 7, 0)>, <16, (8, 4, 17)>, <18, (2, 15, 3)>
