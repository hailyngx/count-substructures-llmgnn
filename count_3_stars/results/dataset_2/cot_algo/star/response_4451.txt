Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 18) (22, 4) (22, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 10) (9, 16) (9, 7) (3, 22) (3, 15) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 25) (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 17) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 6) (21, 11) (21, 25) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 2) (6, 16) (26, 1) (26, 14) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 0) (18, 13) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 20) (17, 1) (17, 8) (17, 11) (20, 18) (14, 26) (14, 24) (14, 25) (12, 4) (12, 28) (2, 6) (2, 11) (16, 5) (16, 9) (16, 6) (16, 24) (16, 8) (24, 14) (24, 16) (24, 27) (24, 29) (7, 9) (7, 29) (7, 10) (29, 24) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 25) (23, 4) (23, 28) (23, 27) (28, 12) (28, 23) (27, 24) (27, 23) (27, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (19, 1) (25, 15) (25, 21) (25, 14) (25, 29) (0, 4) (0, 29) (11, 5) (11, 21) (11, 17) (11, 2) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 16) (8, 27) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 29}
- Node 1: {17, 19, 21, 26}
- Node 2: {6, 11}
- Node 3: {15, 18, 22}
- Node 4: {12, 18, 22, 0}
- Node 5: {6, 10, 11, 16}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 16, 21}
- Node 7: {9, 10, 29}
- Node 8: {15, 16, 17, 27}
- Node 9: {7, 16}
- Node 10: {5, 7}
- Node 11: {2, 5, 17, 21}
- Node 12: {4, 28}
- Node 13: {18}
- Node 14: {25, 26, 24}
- Node 15: {3, 8, 25}
- Node 16: {5, 6, 8, 9, 24}
- Node 17: {1, 8, 11}
- Node 18: {3, 4, 13, 20}
- Node 19: {1}
- Node 20: {18}
- Node 21: {1, 5, 11, 25}
- Node 22: {3, 4}
- Node 23: {4, 27, 28}
- Node 24: {16, 25, 27, 29, 14}
- Node 25: {14, 15, 21, 25, 29}
- Node 26: {1, 14}
- Node 27: {8, 23, 24}
- Node 28: {12, 23}
- Node 29: {0, 25, 7, 24}

Now we can find the 3-stars based on the neighbor sets. 

From the neighbor sets, we can see that only nodes 5, 14, 16, 24, and 25 have 3 or more neighbors. 

Let's calculate the 3-stars for these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 35 \), which we will denote as [35].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, (6, 10, 11)>
- <5, (6, 11, 21)>
- <5, (6, 11, 16)>
- <5, (10, 11, 16)>
- <14, (25, 24, 29)>
- <16, (5, 6, 8)>
- <16, (5, 6, 24)>
- <16, (5, 9, 24)>
- <16, (6, 8, 24)>
- <16, (8, 9, 24)>
- <24, (25, 27, 29)>
