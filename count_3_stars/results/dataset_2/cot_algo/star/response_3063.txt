Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 29) (15, 24) (27, 24) (27, 2) (27, 17) (27, 1) (6, 28) (6, 3) (6, 16) (9, 25) (9, 28) (9, 20) (5, 19) (5, 17) (17, 27) (17, 5) (17, 29) (17, 21) (29, 15) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 11) (7, 20) (7, 2) (12, 16) (12, 11) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 22) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 24) (13, 15) (13, 24) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 8) (19, 5) (19, 29) (19, 18) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 21) (10, 21) (10, 8) (10, 23) (21, 17) (21, 18) (21, 10) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 23) (16, 20) (3, 6) (3, 28) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 22) (25, 2) (22, 14) (22, 25) (22, 1) (20, 9) (20, 7) (20, 16) (23, 10) (23, 16) (1, 27) (1, 25) (1, 22) (1, 4) (24, 15) (24, 27) (24, 28) (24, 13) (8, 15) (8, 26) (8, 10) (11, 29) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 1) (2, 27) (2, 7) (2, 25) (2, 11) 

Response:
First, let's explore the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: [14]
- Node 1: [4, 22, 25, 27]
- Node 2: [7, 11, 25, 27]
- Node 3: [6, 28]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 5: [17, 19]
- Node 6: [3, 16, 28]
- Node 7: [2, 20]
- Node 8: [10, 15, 26]
- Node 9: [20, 25, 28]
- Node 10: [8, 18, 21, 23]
- Node 11: [2, 12, 29]
- Node 12: [11, 16]
- Node 13: [15, 24]
- Node 14: [0, 22]
- Node 15: [8, 13, 24, 29]
- Node 16: [3, 6, 12, 20, 23]
- Node 17: [5, 21, 27, 29]
- Node 18: [10, 19, 21, 26]
- Node 19: [5, 18, 29]
- Node 20: [7, 9, 16]
- Node 21: [17, 18, 10]
- Node 22: [1, 14, 25]
- Node 23: [10, 16]
- Node 24: [13, 15, 27, 28]
- Node 25: [1, 2, 9, 22]
- Node 26: [8, 18]
- Node 27: [1, 2, 17, 24]
- Node 28: [3, 6, 9, 24, 26]
- Node 29: [11, 15, 17, 19]

Notice that nodes 1, 15, 17, 18, 21, 24, 25, and 29 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 29 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars is 29, and we represent it as [29]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (4, 22, 25)>
- <15, (8, 13, 24)>
- <17, (5, 21, 29)>
- <18, (10, 19, 26)>
- <21, (17, 18, 10)>
- <24, (13, 15, 28)>
- <25, (1, 22, 27)>
- <29, (11, 17, 19)>
