Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 14) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 3) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 3) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 14) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) 

Response:
In this graph, we start by finding the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {9, 8, 5, 10, 3}
- Node 1: {9, 7, 14}
- Node 2: {13, 4, 7, 10}
- Node 3: {5, 0, 11}
- Node 4: {8, 12, 5, 14, 2}
- Node 5: {4, 0, 3, 10}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 7: {6, 12, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {6, 4, 9, 11}
- Node 9: {6, 11, 10, 1, 0}
- Node 10: {9, 5, 0, 2}
- Node 11: {9, 8, 14, 3}
- Node 12: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 13: {6, 2, 14}
- Node 14: {13, 4, 11, 1}

Based on the above neighbor sets, we find the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 10: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 11: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 14: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: \(10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 59\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [59].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (3, 5, 10)>
- <1, (9, 7, 14)>
- <2, (4, 7, 10)>
- <4, (12, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 10)>
- <6, (13, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 12, 2)>
- <8, (6, 9, 11)>
- <9, (1, 0, 10)>
- <10, (9, 2, 5)>
- <11, (8, 14, 3)>
- <14, (1, 11, 4)>
