Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 16) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 18) (2, 1) (2, 12) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 8) (7, 1) (7, 17) (12, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 17) (19, 17) (19, 10) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 15) (8, 11) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 15) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 19) (17, 13) (17, 11) (4, 16) (4, 14) (0, 18) (0, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 10) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 15) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 14) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {18, 16}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 8, 14, 18}
- Node 4: {14, 16}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 11, 17}
- Node 6: {9, 10}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 17}
- Node 8: {3, 9, 11, 15, 18}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 10, 16}
- Node 10: {6, 13, 16, 19}
- Node 11: {5, 8, 17}
- Node 12: {2}
- Node 13: {10, 15, 17}
- Node 14: {3, 4, 15}
- Node 15: {8, 13, 14}
- Node 16: {0, 4, 9, 10}
- Node 17: {5, 7, 11, 13, 19}
- Node 18: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 19: {10, 17}

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 3, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7, 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 8, 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13, 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 14, 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 15, 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 16, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17, 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18, 3 neighbors: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 44

So, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<3, 8, 18>
<5, 7, 17>
<8, 11, 15>
<9, 10, 16>
<10, 13, 17>
