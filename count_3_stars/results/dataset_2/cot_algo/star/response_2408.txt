Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 29) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 11) (21, 25) (21, 29) (6, 15) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 27) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 1) (22, 11) (22, 24) (26, 13) (26, 20) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 15) (28, 16) (28, 14) (28, 23) (25, 7) (25, 21) (25, 11) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 1) (17, 12) (17, 23) (17, 2) (5, 19) (5, 10) (5, 27) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 0) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 27) (11, 7) (11, 22) (11, 25) (11, 2) (20, 26) (20, 27) (20, 10) (24, 8) (24, 22) (24, 23) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 11) (2, 14) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 19) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 16) (15, 18) (29, 4) (29, 21) (29, 16) (29, 19) (27, 13) (27, 5) (27, 3) (27, 20) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 20) (14, 28) (14, 18) (14, 2) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 18) (23, 28) (23, 17) (23, 24) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we can first identify the neighbor nodes for each node and then count the number of unique 3-stars.

Based on the given edges, the graph can be represented in the following adjacency list format:

1: 9, 12, 18

2: 17, 19, 11, 14

3: 9, 10, 27

4: 29, 15

5: 19, 10, 27

6: 15

7: 12, 25, 11

8: 13, 24, 0

9: 3, 1, 0

10: 5, 3, 20

11: 7, 22, 25, 2

12: 7, 17, 1

13: 8, 26, 27

14: 28, 18, 2

15: 4, 6, 16, 18

16: 28, 29, 15

17: 12, 23, 2

18: 14, 15, 1

19: 5, 2, 29, 0

20: 26, 27, 10

21: 29, 25

22: 11, 24

23: 28, 17, 24

24: 8, 22, 23

25: 21, 7, 11

26: 13, 20

27: 13, 5, 3, 20

28: 16, 14, 23

29: 4, 21, 16, 19

Now, we can identify the 3-stars by counting the number of triangles formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors. Below are the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (9, 12, 18)>

<2, (17, 19, 11)>

<3, (9, 10, 27)>

<7, (12, 25, 11)>

<11, (7, 22, 25)>

<12, (7, 17, 1)>

<13, (8, 26, 27)>

<14, (28, 18, 2)>

<15, (4, 6, 16)>

<16, (28, 29, 15)>

<17, (12, 23, 24)>

<18, (14, 15, 1)>

<19, (5, 29, 2)>

<20, (26, 27, 10)>

<21, (29, 25, 4)>

<23, (28, 17, 24)>

<25, (21, 7, 11)>

<26, (13, 20, 27)>

<27, (13, 5, 3)>

<28, (16, 14, 23)>

<4, (15, 29, 6)>

This gives a total of [20] unique 3-stars in the graph.
