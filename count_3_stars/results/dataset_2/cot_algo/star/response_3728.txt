Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (12, 27) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 9) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 16) (8, 12) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 26) (8, 3) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 10) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 17) (28, 1) (28, 10) (9, 12) (9, 24) (9, 20) (22, 15) (22, 0) (4, 1) (4, 25) (18, 27) (18, 21) (26, 8) (5, 19) (5, 25) (5, 21) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (29, 7) (29, 25) (29, 10) (17, 11) (17, 20) (17, 6) (17, 24) (20, 9) (20, 17) (16, 27) (16, 21) (16, 15) (21, 18) (21, 5) (21, 16) (21, 2) (15, 22) (15, 19) (15, 16) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 0) (7, 19) (7, 29) (7, 24) (7, 14) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 8) (3, 2) (24, 8) (24, 9) (24, 17) (24, 7) (1, 28) (1, 4) (1, 2) (2, 21) (2, 3) (2, 1) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 6) (0, 25) (25, 4) (25, 5) (25, 29) (25, 0) (10, 23) (10, 28) (10, 29) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 11, 22, 25}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 28}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 21}
- Node 3: {2, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 25}
- Node 5: {19, 21, 25}
- Node 6: {0, 14, 17}
- Node 7: {14, 19, 24, 29}
- Node 8: {3, 12, 23, 24, 26}
- Node 9: {12, 20, 24}
- Node 10: {14, 23, 28, 29}
- Node 11: {0, 17, 23}
- Node 12: {8, 9, 14, 27}
- Node 14: {6, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 15: {16, 19, 22}
- Node 16: {15, 21, 27}
- Node 17: {6, 11, 20, 24}
- Node 18: {21, 27}
- Node 19: {5, 7, 15}
- Node 20: {9, 17}
- Node 21: {2, 5, 16, 18}
- Node 22: {0, 15}
- Node 23: {8, 10, 11}
- Node 24: {7, 8, 9, 17}
- Node 25: {0, 4, 5, 29}
- Node 26: {8}
- Node 27: {12, 16, 18}
- Node 28: {1, 10}
- Node 29: {7, 10, 25}

After evaluating the number of 3-stars for each node, we find the following unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 6, 22)>
- <1, (2, 4, 28)>
- <2, (0, 1, 21)>
- <5, (19, 21, 25)>
- <7, (14, 19, 24)>
- <8, (3, 12, 23)>
- <10, (14, 23, 28)>
- <11, (0, 17, 23)>
- <12, (8, 9, 27)>
- <14, (6, 7, 10)>
- <15, (16, 19, 22)>
- <17, (6, 20, 24)>
- <25, (0, 5, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
