Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 11) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 3, 9, 10, 14
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 11, 12, 14
- Node 2: Neighbors are 3, 9, 12, 13
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 2, 6, 10, 14
- Node 4: Neighbors are 5, 7, 10, 13
- Node 5: Neighbors are 4, 9, 11
- Node 6: Neighbors are 3, 7, 9, 13
- Node 7: Neighbors are 4, 6, 12
- Node 8: Neighbors are 9, 11, 12
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 10: Neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 14
- Node 11: Neighbors are 1, 5, 8
- Node 12: Neighbors are 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 13: Neighbors are 2, 4, 6, 14
- Node 14: Neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 10, 13

Based on the neighbor sets above, the total number of 3-stars can be calculated by summing up \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with three or more neighbors.

- For Node 0:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 1:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 2:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 3:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 4:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 6:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 12:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 13:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 14:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding them up, we get a total of 64 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [64].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 1, 10>
- <0, 1, 14>
- <0, 3, 14>
- <0, 10, 14>
- <1, 11, 8>
- <2, 3, 14>
- <4, 6, 13>
- <5, 9, 11>
- <9, 12, 8>
