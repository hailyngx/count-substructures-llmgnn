Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 12) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 10) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 2) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 0) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {8, 10, 11, 14, 2, 5}
Node 1 neighbors: {3, 14}
Node 2 neighbors: {13, 0, 14}
Node 3 neighbors: {4, 1, 9, 12}
Node 4 neighbors: {7, 13, 11, 3}
Node 5 neighbors: {7, 0, 10}
Node 6 neighbors: {9, 11, 12}
Node 7 neighbors: {4, 10, 8, 5}
Node 8 neighbors: {7, 9, 10, 0, 12}
Node 9 neighbors: {3, 8, 6, 11, 14}
Node 10 neighbors: {7, 8, 13, 0, 5}
Node 11 neighbors: {4, 6, 9, 12, 0}
Node 12 neighbors: {3, 8, 6, 11}
Node 13 neighbors: {4, 2, 10}
Node 14 neighbors: {1, 9, 0, 2}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node:

Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 70 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final number to be put inside brackets is [70].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (8, 10, 11)>
<0, (8, 10, 14)>
<0, (8, 11, 14)>
<0, (10, 11, 14)>
<3, (1, 9, 12)>
<4, (7, 11, 13)>
<8, (7, 9, 10)>
<9, (6, 11, 14)>
<10, (0, 7, 13)>
<11, (0, 6, 9)>
<12, (3, 6, 8)>
<14, (0, 2, 9)>
