Prompt:

The edges are as follows: (9, 14) (9, 23) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 29) (26, 11) (5, 1) (5, 7) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 18) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (21, 6) (21, 8) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 29) (20, 0) (20, 13) (20, 27) (20, 23) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 22) (28, 26) (28, 17) (28, 24) (6, 7) (6, 21) (6, 19) (6, 27) (4, 3) (4, 16) (27, 20) (27, 6) (27, 18) (27, 1) (11, 26) (11, 3) (11, 2) (13, 20) (13, 12) (13, 29) (13, 1) (17, 28) (17, 19) (14, 9) (14, 26) (14, 7) (14, 22) (14, 2) (18, 15) (18, 27) (18, 19) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 23) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 14) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 25) (16, 10) (1, 5) (1, 27) (1, 13) (29, 26) (29, 0) (29, 13) (25, 16) (22, 12) (22, 14) (23, 9) (23, 20) (23, 19) (8, 21) (24, 0) (24, 28) (10, 3) (10, 16) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {20, 24, 29}
- Node 1: {5, 13, 27}
- Node 2: {11, 12, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 10, 11, 15}
- Node 4: {3, 16}
- Node 5: {1, 7}
- Node 6: {7, 19, 21, 27}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {21}
- Node 9: {14, 23}
- Node 10: {3, 16}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 26}
- Node 12: {2, 7, 13, 16, 22}
- Node 13: {1, 12, 20, 29}
- Node 14: {2, 7, 9, 22, 26}
- Node 15: {3, 18}
- Node 16: {4, 10, 12, 25}
- Node 17: {19, 28}
- Node 18: {15, 19, 27}
- Node 19: {6, 18, 23}
- Node 20: {0, 13, 23, 27}
- Node 21: {6, 8}
- Node 22: {12, 14}
- Node 23: {9, 19, 20}
- Node 24: {0, 28}
- Node 25: {16}
- Node 26: {11, 14, 28, 29}
- Node 27: {1, 6, 18, 20}
- Node 28: {17, 24, 26}
- Node 29: {13, 26}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors, which are potential centers of 3-star graphs:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, Node 7, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 18, Node 19, Node 20, Node 26, Node 27, Node 28

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of and sum them up:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 48

Therefore, the final number to be placed inside brackets is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 13, 20>, <1, 5, 27>, <2, 11, 26>, <3, 4, 10>, <6, 7, 19>, <12, 13, 29>, <14, 2, 7>, <16, 4, 10>, <18, 15, 19>.
