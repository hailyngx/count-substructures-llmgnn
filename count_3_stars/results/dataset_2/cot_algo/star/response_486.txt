Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 8}

Now, we will check for each node that has three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. 
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. 
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- <5, (1, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 5)>
- <7, (0, 3, 4)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>
