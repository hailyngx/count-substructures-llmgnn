Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 14) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 1) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph: node 1, node 3, node 4, node 8, and node 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1:
- Neighbors: 9, 2, 0, 5, 11, 10
- Total = inom{6}{3} = 20

For node 3:
- Neighbors: 6, 5, 11, 10
- Total = inom{4}{3} = 4

For node 4:
- Neighbors: 8, 13, 14
- Total = inom{3}{3} = 1

For node 8:
- Neighbors: 4, 2, 14, 10, 11
- Total = inom{5}{3} = 10

For node 14:
- Neighbors: 9, 4, 8, 12, 13
- Total = inom{5}{3} = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 45. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 2, 5, 11>
<1, 0, 7, 11>
<1, 0, 10, 11>
<1, 0, 5, 11>
<1, 5, 6, 11>
<1, 5, 10, 11>
<3, 5, 6, 10>
<4, 8, 13, 14>
<8, 10, 11, 2>
<8, 10, 11, 4>
<8, 10, 11, 14>
<8, 10, 2, 4>
<8, 10, 2, 14>
<14, 9, 4, 12>
<14, 9, 4, 13>
<14, 9, 12, 13> 

Therefore, the final answer is [45].
