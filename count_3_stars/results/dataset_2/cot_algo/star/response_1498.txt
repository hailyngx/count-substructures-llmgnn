Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 3, 6, 5, 2 (degree = 4)
- Node 1: Neighbors are 7, 3, 5, 9, 8 (degree = 5)
- Node 2: Neighbors are 4, 3, 6, 0 (degree = 4)
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 0, 2, 8 (degree = 4)
- Node 4: Neighbors are 7, 8, 9, 2 (degree = 4)
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 6, 8, 0 (degree = 4)
- Node 6: Neighbors are 5, 2, 0 (degree = 3)
- Node 7: Neighbors are 4, 1, 8 (degree = 3)
- Node 8: Neighbors are 4, 7, 1, 3, 9, 5 (degree = 6)
- Node 9: Neighbors are 4, 1, 8 (degree = 3)

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, 1, and 2 have 4, 5, and 4 neighbors respectively, so no 3-stars can be formed with them.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <3, (1, 8, 0)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <5, (1, 8, 0)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed with it.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed with it.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed with it.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) + 20 (from node 8) = 23

Therefore, the final answer is [23].
