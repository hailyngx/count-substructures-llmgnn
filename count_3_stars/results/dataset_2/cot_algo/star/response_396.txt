Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges based on the nodes they connect:
- Node 0: {9, 1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 3, 4, 0, 7}
- Node 2: {6, 8}
- Node 3: {9, 6, 1, 0}
- Node 4: {6, 1, 7, 0}
- Node 5: {6, 1, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 7, 3, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 1, 4}
- Node 8: {9, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 3, 0}

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 1, 3, 4, 8} => 5 neighbors
- Node 1: {5, 3, 4, 0, 7} => 5 neighbors
- Node 2: {6, 8} => 2 neighbors
- Node 3: {9, 6, 1, 0} => 4 neighbors
- Node 4: {6, 1, 7, 0} => 4 neighbors
- Node 5: {6, 1, 7} => 3 neighbors
- Node 6: {5, 9, 7, 3, 2, 4} => 6 neighbors
- Node 7: {5, 6, 1, 4} => 4 neighbors
- Node 8: {9, 2, 0} => 3 neighbors
- Node 9: {6, 8, 3, 0} => 4 neighbors

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- For Node 0, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 1, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 3, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 4, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 6, we have \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 9, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

Unique 3-stars:

- <0, 1, 4, 8>
