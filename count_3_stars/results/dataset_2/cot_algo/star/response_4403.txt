Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 11) (4, 29) (4, 6) (7, 11) (7, 24) (7, 2) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 10) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 8) (20, 28) (18, 11) (18, 21) (22, 0) (22, 29) (22, 21) (22, 8) (8, 20) (8, 22) (8, 29) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 1) (14, 23) (14, 17) (14, 28) (17, 14) (17, 28) (17, 9) (5, 25) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 10) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 23) (11, 24) (16, 13) (16, 6) (16, 27) (26, 20) (26, 21) (26, 27) (26, 12) (24, 7) (24, 11) (24, 1) (21, 18) (21, 22) (21, 26) (28, 20) (28, 14) (28, 17) (28, 27) (28, 10) (6, 4) (6, 16) (6, 29) (29, 4) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 6) (12, 26) (12, 0) (9, 17) (1, 23) (1, 24) (27, 16) (27, 26) (27, 28) (27, 10) (10, 25) (10, 13) (10, 28) (10, 27) (10, 2) (0, 22) (0, 12) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 12, 22}
- Node 1: {23, 24}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 10}
- Node 3: {15}
- Node 4: {6, 11, 15, 29}
- Node 5: {10, 13, 25}
- Node 6: {4, 16, 29}
- Node 7: {2, 11, 24}
- Node 8: {20, 22, 29}
- Node 9: {17}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 13, 25, 27, 28}
- Node 11: {4, 7, 18, 23, 24}
- Node 12: {0, 26}
- Node 13: {5, 10, 16}
- Node 14: {17, 23, 28}
- Node 15: {3, 4}
- Node 16: {6, 13, 27}
- Node 17: {9, 14, 28}
- Node 18: {11, 21}
- Node 20: {8, 26, 28, 25}
- Node 21: {18, 22, 26}
- Node 22: {0, 8, 21, 29}
- Node 23: {1, 11, 14}
- Node 24: {1, 7, 11}
- Node 25: {5, 10, 20}
- Node 26: {12, 20, 21, 27}
- Node 27: {10, 16, 26, 28}
- Node 28: {10, 17, 20, 27}
- Node 29: {4, 6, 8, 22}

Now, we will identify the 3-star subgraphs:

- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 27, and 28: <10, (2, 27, 28)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with neighbors 7, 23, and 24: <11, (7, 23, 24)>
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with neighbors 8, 26, and 28: <20, (8, 26, 28)>

Counting these unique 3-stars gives a total of [3].
