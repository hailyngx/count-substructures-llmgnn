Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 11) (0, 13) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 18) (27, 5) (7, 21) (7, 1) (7, 13) (21, 27) (21, 7) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 4) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 23) (8, 5) (8, 26) (23, 9) (23, 12) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 1) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 5) (5, 27) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 3) (19, 22) (19, 2) (15, 25) (15, 29) (13, 0) (13, 7) (4, 21) (4, 9) (12, 23) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 28) (22, 21) (22, 19) (22, 24) (22, 25) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 24) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 25) (26, 8) (26, 20) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 12) (14, 6) (28, 0) (28, 2) (28, 24) (20, 21) (20, 26) (20, 24) (29, 15) (29, 16) (16, 29) (16, 18) (18, 27) (18, 16) (24, 22) (24, 1) (24, 28) (24, 20) (24, 25) (25, 15) (25, 22) (25, 11) (25, 24) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 29.

Let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {11, 13, 27, 28}
- Node 1: {7, 10, 11, 24}
- Node 2: {6, 12, 19, 28}
- Node 3: {5, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {9, 12, 21}
- Node 5: {3, 5, 8, 17, 27}
- Node 6: {2, 9, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 13, 21}
- Node 8: {5, 26}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 23}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 17}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 25}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 4, 17, 23}
- Node 13: {0, 7}
- Node 14: {6}
- Node 15: {25, 29}
- Node 16: {18, 29}
- Node 17: {5, 10, 12}
- Node 18: {16, 27}
- Node 19: {2, 22}
- Node 20: {21, 24, 26}
- Node 21: {4, 7, 20, 22, 27}
- Node 22: {19, 21, 24, 25}
- Node 23: {9, 12}
- Node 24: {1, 20, 22, 25, 28}
- Node 25: {11, 15, 22, 24}
- Node 26: {8, 20}
- Node 27: {0, 18, 21, 27}
- Node 28: {0, 2, 24}
- Node 29: {15, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 1: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 2: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 5: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 12: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 17: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 21: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 22: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 24: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 25: [4 choose 3] = 4

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [51].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
