Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 28) (1, 27) (21, 10) (21, 16) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 29) (12, 8) (12, 27) (12, 17) (12, 11) (27, 1) (27, 12) (28, 1) (28, 3) (28, 14) (29, 23) (29, 25) (29, 4) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (22, 0) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 24) (13, 20) (13, 15) (18, 26) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 17) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 16) (3, 28) (3, 20) (3, 6) (6, 26) (6, 3) (6, 24) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 7) (16, 21) (16, 10) (16, 14) (11, 12) (11, 5) (0, 8) (0, 22) (0, 25) (2, 23) (2, 9) (2, 25) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 15) (14, 8) (14, 28) (14, 16) (14, 7) (4, 29) (4, 5) (4, 20) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 17) (20, 13) (20, 3) (20, 4) (20, 19) (7, 24) (7, 14) (19, 10) (19, 20) (25, 29) (25, 0) (25, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 26, 27, and 28: <1, (26, 27, 28)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 12, and 23: <8, (0, 12, 23)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 18, and 21: <10, (16, 18, 21)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 13, and 17: <15, (9, 13, 17)>
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 13: <20, (3, 4, 13)>
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 29: <25, (0, 2, 29)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
