Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of its adjacency list:

Node 0: 6, 7  
Node 1: 2, 3, 6, 7, 8  
Node 2: 1, 3, 6  
Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9  
Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9  
Node 5: 3, 4, 7, 8  
Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8  
Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5  
Node 8: 1, 5, 6  
Node 9: 3, 4  

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed in this graph. We'll iterate through each node to see how many 3-stars it can be a part of:

For Node 3:  
- Neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9  
- \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars  
   
For Node 4:  
- Neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9  
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars   

No other node has three or more neighbors, so the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 30.  

Therefore, the final answer is [30].  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>  
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
