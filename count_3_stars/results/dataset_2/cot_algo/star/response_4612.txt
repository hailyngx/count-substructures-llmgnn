Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 19) (8, 3) (8, 18) (13, 2) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 17) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 10) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 15) (9, 12) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 5) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 4) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (5, 15) (5, 2) (0, 11) (0, 15) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 18) (10, 3) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 2) (4, 16) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 11, 15
- Node 1: 6, 10, 14
- Node 2: 4, 5, 13, 14
- Node 3: 4, 8, 10
- Node 4: 2, 3, 16, 17
- Node 5: 2, 15
- Node 6: 1, 16, 17
- Node 7: 12
- Node 8: 3, 18
- Node 9: 12
- Node 10: 1, 3, 12, 18
- Node 11: 0, 16, 17
- Node 12: 7, 9, 10, 14
- Node 13: 2
- Node 14: 1, 2, 12, 15
- Node 15: 0, 5, 14, 19
- Node 16: 4, 6, 11, 17, 19
- Node 17: 4, 6, 11, 16
- Node 18: 8, 10, 19
- Node 19: 15, 16, 18

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 14, 15, 18

Summing up the 3-stars formed by these nodes:

\[ \binom{1}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{9}{3} + \binom{14}{3} + \binom{15}{3} + \binom{18}{3} = 0 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 56 + 84 + 364 + 455 + 816 = 1806 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1806].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <12, (7, 9, 10)>
- <14, (1, 2, 15)>
- <15, (0, 5, 19)>
- <18, (3, 10, 19)>
- <6, (1, 16, 17)>
- <8, (3, 18, 10)>
- <1, (6, 10, 14)>
- <3, (4, 10, 1)>
- <5, (2, 15, 0)>
