Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 15) (16, 0) (16, 14) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 16) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 10) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 13) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 5) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 18) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 19) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 19) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 5) (18, 9) (18, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 10) (19, 7) (19, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

The neighbors for each node are:
Node 0: {3, 7, 16, 18}
Node 1: {2, 8, 19}
Node 2: {1, 8}
Node 3: {0, 4, 9, 11}
Node 4: {3, 6, 9, 10}
Node 5: {7, 12, 13}
Node 6: {4, 8}
Node 7: {0, 5, 10, 19}
Node 8: {1, 2, 6, 15}
Node 9: {3, 4, 13, 18}
Node 10: {4, 7, 12, 17}
Node 11: {3, 12, 15}
Node 12: {5, 10, 11, 15}
Node 13: {5, 9}
Node 14: {16, 17}
Node 15: {8, 11, 12}
Node 16: {0, 14}
Node 17: {10, 14}
Node 18: {0, 9}
Node 19: {1, 7}

Now, let's find the nodes that can form a 3-star:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
Node 0: 4 neighbors - [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 3: 4 neighbors - [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 4: 4 neighbors - [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 7: 4 neighbors - [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 8: 4 neighbors - [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 9: 4 neighbors - [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 10: 4 neighbors - [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 11: 3 neighbors - 1 3-star = [1]
Node 12: 4 neighbors - [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 14: 2 neighbors - No 3-star
Node 15: 3 neighbors - 1 3-star = [1]
Node 16: 2 neighbors - No 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 30

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 3, 18>, <3, 0, 9>, <4, 3, 9>, <7, 0, 19>, <8, 1, 2>, <9, 3, 18>, <10, 4, 7>, <11, 3, 15>, <12, 5, 11>, <12, 5, 15>, <15, 8, 11> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [30].
