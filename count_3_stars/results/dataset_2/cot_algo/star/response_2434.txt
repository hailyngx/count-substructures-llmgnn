Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 11) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 14) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {6, 3, 8, 5}
- Node 1: {5, 12, 8, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 12, 14, 4}
- Node 3: {9, 11, 7, 0}
- Node 4: {13, 11, 14, 2}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 11, 12, 0}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 14}
- Node 8: {9, 1, 13, 0}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 14, 3}
- Node 10: {11}
- Node 11: {6, 3, 13, 10, 12, 4}
- Node 12: {1, 6, 11, 2}
- Node 13: {9, 8, 4, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {9, 13, 4, 2, 7}

Next, let's identify the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 10 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 22

Rewriting the unique 3-stars found:

<0, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 12>, <2, 5, 14>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 11, 13>, <6, 9, 11>, <8, 0, 9>, <11, 4, 13>, <11, 6, 12>, <11, 3, 13>, <12, 1, 11>

Therefore, the final answer is [22].
