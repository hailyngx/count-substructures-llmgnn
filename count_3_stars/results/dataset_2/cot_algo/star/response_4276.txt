Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8, 2, 9, 4
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 4, 3, 8, 0
- Node 3: 6, 7, 2
- Node 4: 8, 0, 2, 6
- Node 5: 9, 6, 7, 0
- Node 6: 5, 9, 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 5, 9, 3, 1
- Node 8: 9, 6, 4, 2, 0
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8, 7, 0

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes: <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes: <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes: <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes: <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes: <7, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes: <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes: <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we have a total of [7] 3-stars in this graph.
