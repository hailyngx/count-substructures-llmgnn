Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 4) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 13) (21, 7) (21, 17) (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 24) (5, 3) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (7, 21) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 27) (6, 28) (6, 19) (6, 4) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 18) (19, 6) (19, 26) (19, 12) (26, 19) (26, 2) (26, 8) (24, 5) (24, 29) (17, 1) (17, 21) (17, 2) (8, 9) (8, 26) (8, 20) (8, 18) (8, 27) (3, 5) (25, 5) (25, 22) (25, 14) (0, 28) (0, 4) (2, 1) (2, 26) (2, 17) (20, 5) (20, 8) (20, 14) (15, 11) (15, 22) (15, 23) (15, 14) (4, 16) (4, 6) (4, 0) (29, 16) (29, 24) (18, 28) (18, 8) (18, 27) (18, 10) (27, 23) (27, 8) (27, 18) (27, 13) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 12) (10, 13) (12, 28) (12, 19) (12, 10) (14, 25) (14, 20) (14, 15) (13, 1) (13, 27) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {28, 4}
- Node 1: {17, 2, 13}
- Node 2: {1, 26, 17}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 4: {16, 6, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 24, 25, 3, 20}
- Node 6: {28, 19, 4}
- Node 7: {21}
- Node 8: {9, 26, 20, 18, 27}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 10}
- Node 10: {9, 18, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {16, 15}
- Node 12: {28, 19, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 27, 10}
- Node 14: {25, 20, 15}
- Node 15: {11, 22, 23, 14}
- Node 16: {11, 29, 4}
- Node 17: {1, 21, 2}
- Node 18: {28, 8, 27, 10}
- Node 19: {6, 26, 12}
- Node 20: {5, 8, 14}
- Node 21: {7, 17}
- Node 22: {21, 23, 15, 25}
- Node 23: {22, 15, 27}
- Node 24: {5, 29}
- Node 25: {5, 22, 14}
- Node 26: {19, 2, 8}
- Node 27: {23, 8, 18, 13}
- Node 28: {6, 0, 12, 18}
- Node 29: {16, 24}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 50

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars is [50].
