Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, we can represent the given graph in adjacency list format to better visualize the connections:

```
0: 6, 9, 5, 8
1: 6, 4, 8
2: 6, 3, 7, 8
3: 7, 2, 4
4: 9, 1, 3, 7, 5
5: 6, 4, 0
6: 9, 5, 1, 2, 0
7: 9, 3, 4, 2
8: 9, 1, 2, 0
9: 6, 8, 4, 7, 0
```

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 6, 9, 5, 8. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 0 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Thus, we have 4 additional 3-stars.

2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 6, 4, 8. As it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star formed with node 1.

3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 6, 3, 7, 8. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 2 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Additionally, node 8 makes a 3-star with nodes 1 and 2 as well. 

4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 7, 2, 4. As it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star formed with node 3.

5. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 9, 1, 3, 7, 5. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 4 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). Thus, we have 10 additional 3-stars.

6. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 6, 4, 0. As it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star formed with node 5.

7. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 9, 5, 1, 2, 0. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 6 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). Thus, we have 10 additional 3-stars.

8. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 9, 3, 4, 2. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 7 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

9. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 9, 1, 2, 0. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 8 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

10. Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 6, 8, 4, 7, 0. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 9 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). Thus, we have 10 additional 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars found, we get a total of 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 49 additional 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 49. So, the final answer to the problem is [49]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 9, 5)>, <2, (6, 3, 7)>, <4, (9, 1, 3)>, <6, (9, 5, 1)>, <9, (8, 4, 7)>
