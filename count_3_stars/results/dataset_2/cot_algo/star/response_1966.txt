Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 12) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 13) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (10, 12) (10, 9) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 11) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 2, 14, 7, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 14, 5, 12, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {8, 9, 7, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 11, 13, 5, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 0, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 14, 11, 4, 0, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 2, 0, 12}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 2, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 8, 4, 10}
- Node 10: Neighbors {12, 9}
- Node 11: Neighbors {3, 6, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 7, 10}
- Node 13: Neighbors {3, 6, 11}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 0}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [C(5, 3)] = 10 3-stars, unique 3-star pairs: <0, (2, 6, 14)>, <0, (4, 6, 14)>, <0, (4, 6, 0)>, <0, (4, 9, 6)>, <0, (4, 9, 0)>, <0, (9, 2, 4)>, <0, (9, 2, 14)>, <0, (9, 4, 14)>, <0, (9, 4, 6)>, <0, (9, 6, 14)>
- Node 1: [C(5, 3)] = 10 3-stars, unique 3-star pairs: <1, (3, 5, 14)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 8, 5)>, <1, (5, 14, 1)>, <1, (5, 14, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 3)>, <1, (5, 6, 14)>, <1, (6, 14, 0)>, <1, (6, 14, 5)>, <1, (6, 0, 5)>
- Node 3: [C(5, 3)] = 10 3-stars, unique 3-star pairs: <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 5)>, <3, (5, 14, 1)>, <3, (5, 14, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 1)>, <3, (5, 6, 14)>, <3, (6, 14, 0)>, <3, (6, 14, 5)>, <3, (6, 0, 5)>, <3, (8, 1, 5)>
- Node 5: [C(5, 3)] = 10 3-stars, unique 3-star pairs: <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 3)>, <5, (3, 8, 1)>, <5, (3, 8, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 1)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 14, 1)>, <5, (6, 14, 3)>, <5, (6, 1, 3)>
- Node 6: [C(6, 3)] = 20 3-stars, unique 3-star pairs: <6, (0, 13, 14)>, <6, (4, 9, 0)>, <6, (4, 9, 6)>, <6, (4, 0, 13)>, <6, (4, 0, 14)>, <6, (4, 0, 9)>, <6, (4, 6, 13)>, <6, (4, 6, 0)>, <6, (4, 6, 14)>, <6, (9, 2, 0)>, <6, (9, 2, 7)>, <6, (9, 2, 14)>, <6, (9, 2, 4)>, <6, (9, 2, 10)>, <6, (9, 7, 14)>, <6, (9, 4, 10)>, <6, (9, 10, 2)>, <6, (9, 10, 4)>, <6, (9, 10, 14)>, <6, (9, 10, 7)>
- Node 7: [C(4, 3)] = 4 3-stars, unique 3-star pairs:  <7, (0, 5, 2)>, <7, (0, 5, 12)>, <7, (5, 12, 0)>, <7, (12, 10, 0)>
- Node 8: [C(4, 3)] = 4 3-stars, unique 3-star pairs:  <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 2)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (3, 9, 1)>
- Node 9: [C(4, 3)] = 4 3-stars, unique 3-star pairs:  <9, (2, 8, 4)>, <9, (2, 8, 10)>, <9, (2, 4, 10)>, <9, (8, 10, 2)>

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 72

Therefore, the final answer is [72]
