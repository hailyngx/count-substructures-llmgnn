Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3, 5, 6, 13}
Node 1: {2, 3, 7, 10}
Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}
Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
Node 4: {2, 7, 10, 14}
Node 5: {0, 8, 13}
Node 6: {0, 3, 8, 11, 13}
Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 12, 14}
Node 8: {2, 5, 6, 10, 11}
Node 9: {2, 3, 11}
Node 10: {1, 4, 8, 13}
Node 11: {6, 8, 9}
Node 12: {7, 13}
Node 13: {0, 5, 6, 10, 12}
Node 14: {4, 7}

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 2, 7, 8, 13
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, 10

For nodes with 4 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 66

Therefore, the final answer is [66], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 6, 11)>
<13, (0, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 13)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 8, 13)>
<10, (1, 8, 13)>
