Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-star graphs in this given graph, we need to first find the neighbors of each node. Here is the list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {1, 3, 7}
Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 9}
Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 8}
Node 3: {0, 2, 5}
Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 8}
Node 7: {0, 5, 9}
Node 8: {2, 4, 6, 9}
Node 9: {1, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star graphs:

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star graphs.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-star graphs.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star graphs.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is 10 + 20 + 4 = 34, which we can represent as [34].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (2, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>.
