Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 2) (16, 8) (16, 9) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 17) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 10) (3, 15) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 17) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 13) (7, 17) (10, 11) (10, 9) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 18) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 8) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 14) (2, 11) (2, 18) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 2) (8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 6) (19, 1) (19, 0) (0, 19) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (13, 7) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {19}
- Node 1: {12, 18, 19}
- Node 2: {11, 18}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 12, 15}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 9, 17}
- Node 5: {9, 12, 17, 18}
- Node 6: {8, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 13, 14, 15, 17}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 14, 16}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 10, 15, 16}
- Node 10: {9, 11}
- Node 11: {2, 10}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 13: {6, 7}
- Node 14: {6, 7, 8, 17}
- Node 15: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 16: {8, 9}
- Node 17: {4, 5, 7, 14}
- Node 18: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 19: {0, 1}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 18 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (1, 12, and 18), each forms only 1 unique 3-star.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15, and 17), we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to count the number of unique 3-stars. 
- The total count can be summed up as follows:

\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 61 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [61]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 12, 18>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <4, 7, 14>
- <4, 9, 15>
- <5, 7, 17>
- <5, 9, 12>
- <7, 14, 17>
- <9, 15, 17>
- <15, 7, 17>
