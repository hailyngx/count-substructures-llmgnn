Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 0) (11, 2) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 12) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8, 10, 13
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12
- Node 2: 1, 11, 13, 14
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 8, 13
- Node 5: 1, 7, 14
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 10
- Node 7: 4, 5, 8, 9, 14
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9, 13
- Node 9: 1, 7, 8, 12
- Node 10: 0, 6, 14
- Node 11: 2
- Node 12: 1, 9
- Node 13: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 14: 2, 5, 7, 10

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 13.

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 76

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [76].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (1, 8, 13)>
- <0, (1, 10, 14)>
- <0, (6, 10, 14)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <1, (0, 5, 12)>
- <1, (2, 9, 12)>
- <1, (5, 7, 14)>
- <2, (13, 14, 2)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- <8, (4, 7, 14)>
- <8, (4, 9, 13)>
- <8, (7, 9, 13)>
