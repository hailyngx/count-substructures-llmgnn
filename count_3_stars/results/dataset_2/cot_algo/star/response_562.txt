Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 12) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graph is as follows:
- Node 5 has neighbors 9, 6, 4, and 7
- Node 9 has neighbors 5, 14, 3, 1, and 12
- Node 4 has neighbors 5, 7, 12, and 3
- Node 7 has neighbors 5, 4, 10, 1, and 8
- Node 6 has neighbors 5, 2, and 12
- Node 2 has neighbors 6, 13, 10, and 0
- Node 13 has neighbors 2, 3, 14, and 0
- Node 12 has neighbors 9, 4, 6, and 0
- Node 0 has neighbors 6, 2, 13, and 12
- Node 10 has neighbors 7, 2, 8, 3, and 14
- Node 8 has neighbors 7, 10, and 1
- Node 1 neighbor 9, 7, and 8
- Node 14 has neighbors 9, 13, 10, and 11
- Node 3 has neighbors 9, 4, 13, and 10
- Node 11 has neighbors 4 and 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star
- Node 12 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 44, represented as [44].
