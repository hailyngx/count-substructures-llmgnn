Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 12) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {3, 13}
Node 1: {2, 7, 12}
Node 2: {1, 3, 8, 10}
Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 7, 14}
Node 4: {3, 5, 7, 11, 12}
Node 5: {4, 8, 10, 12}
Node 6: {8, 10, 11}
Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 13}
Node 8: {2, 5, 6, 9, 14}
Node 9: {8, 11, 12, 13}
Node 10: {2, 5, 6, 11}
Node 11: {4, 6, 9, 10, 14}
Node 12: {1, 4, 5, 9}
Node 13: {0, 7, 9, 14}
Node 14: {3, 8, 11, 13}

Next, we will go through each node to determine if any 3-star configurations can be formed:

Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, and Node 14 each have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up these results: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].
