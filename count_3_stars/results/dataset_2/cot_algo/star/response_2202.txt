Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 2) (16, 9) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 11) (17, 14) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 15) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 13) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 10) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 15) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 13) (15, 12) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 8) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 2) (2, 16) (2, 12) (3, 16) (3, 5) (1, 5) (1, 13) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 1) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star formations:

1. Node 16: <16, (11, 17, 12)>, <16, (11, 3, 2)>, <16, (11, 2, 9)>, <16, (17, 14, 9)>, <16, (12, 14, 2)>, <16, (12, 14, 15)>, <16, (12, 4, 2)>, <16, (12, 4, 15)>, <16, (3, 5, 2)>, <16, (2, 5, 9)>
2. Node 14: <14, (17, 11, 6)>, <14, (17, 12, 13)>, <14, (11, 17, 6)>, <14, (12, 6, 13)>, <14, (12, 6, 15)>, <14, (12, 4, 13)>, <14, (12, 4, 15)>, <14, (17, 6, 13)>, <14, (17, 6, 12)>, <14, (17, 12, 13)>, <14, (12, 13, 6)>, <14, (13, 6, 15)>
3. Node 4: <4, (12, 9, 15)>, <4, (12, 9, 14)>, <4, (9, 8, 15)>, <4, (9, 8, 6)>, <4, (15, 13, 9)>, <4, (12, 13, 9)>
4. Node 6: <6, (14, 8, 5)>, <6, (14, 8, 10)>, <6, (8, 10, 0)>, <6, (5, 8, 19)>, <6, (5, 19, 7)>, <6, (5, 19, 10)>, <6, (10, 19, 5)>
5. Node 15: <15, (4, 12, 10)>, <15, (4, 12, 13)>, <15, (12, 13, 14)>, <15, (10, 13, 7)>, <15, (10, 13, 1)>
6. Node 13: <13, (14, 7, 1)>, <13, (14, 15, 1)>, <13, (7, 15, 1)>
7. Node 12: <12, (4, 15, 9)>, <12, (2, 16, 14)>, <12, (2, 16, 4)>, <12, (9, 16, 4)>, <12, (15, 16, 14)>
8. Node 2: <2, (16, 12, 14)>
9. Node 5: <5, (6, 8, 19)>, <5, (6, 10, 19)>, <5, (1, 13, 7)>, <5, (1, 13, 15)>
10. Node 7: <7, (0, 19, 13)>
11. Node 10: <10, (6, 19, 0)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars gives us a total of 39.
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39].
