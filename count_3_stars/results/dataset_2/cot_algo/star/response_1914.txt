Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 16) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 11) (17, 15) (17, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 28) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 12) (22, 23) (22, 18) (22, 4) (22, 16) (22, 5) (23, 22) (23, 0) (23, 20) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 19) (4, 22) (4, 9) (4, 29) (4, 26) (8, 6) (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 28) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 23) (0, 10) (28, 1) (28, 6) (28, 24) (28, 13) (24, 28) (24, 26) (24, 9) (26, 18) (26, 4) (26, 24) (21, 20) (21, 12) (21, 11) (7, 29) (7, 10) (7, 9) (25, 19) (9, 4) (9, 24) (9, 7) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 25) (19, 10) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 21) (11, 13) (2, 15) (29, 4) (29, 7) (29, 13) (20, 23) (20, 21) (13, 28) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 29) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 21) (16, 27) (16, 22) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can determine the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors (14, 17, 23, 10)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (3, 11, 28, 19)
- Node 2: 1 neighbor (15)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (1, 12)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (22, 9, 26, 29)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (22, 6, 12)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (8, 5, 28)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (29, 10, 9)
- Node 8: 1 neighbor (6)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (4, 24, 7)
- Node 10: 4 neighbors (0, 7, 19, 13)
- Node 11: 4 neighbors (14, 1, 21, 13)
- Node 12: 3 neighbors (3, 5, 21)
- Node 13: 4 neighbors (28, 10, 11, 29)
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (15, 0, 11)
- Node 15: 3 neighbors (27, 14, 17)
- Node 16: 2 neighbors (27, 22)
- Node 17: 2 neighbors (15, 0)
- Node 18: 3 neighbors (22, 26, 19)
- Node 19: 4 neighbors (1, 18, 25, 10)
- Node 20: 2 neighbors (23, 21)
- Node 21: 3 neighbors (22, 11, 20)
- Node 22: 5 neighbors (23, 18, 4, 5, 16)
- Node 23: 3 neighbors (22, 0, 20)
- Node 24: 3 neighbors (28, 26, 9)
- Node 25: 1 neighbor (19)
- Node 26: 3 neighbors (18, 4, 24)
- Node 27: 2 neighbors (15, 16)
- Node 28: 4 neighbors (1, 6, 24, 13)
- Node 29: 4 neighbors (4, 7, 13, 29)

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors that can form 3-stars are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 22, 24, 26, 28, 29

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
\[ \sum (\text{number of 3-stars each node can form}) = [89] \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (28, 6, 24)>, <4, (29, 7, 9)>, <5, (22, 6, 12)>, <6, (8, 5, 28)>, <7, (10, 9, 29)>, <9, (4, 24, 7)>, <10, (0, 19, 13)>, <11, (1, 21, 13)>, <13, (28, 11, 29)>, <14, (15, 0, 11)>, <15, (27, 14, 17)>, <18, (22, 26, 19)>, <19, (1, 18, 25)>, <22, (18, 5, 16)>, 
<24, (28, 26, 9)>, <26, (18, 4, 24)>, <28, (6, 13, 24)>, <29, (13, 7, 9)>
