Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 13) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 10) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 12) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 8, 10}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {9, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 9, 12}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 8, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 3, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 11: {10, 13}
- Node 12: {3, 5, 6, 10}
- Node 13: {4, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 14: {2, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 4: <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 5, 14)>
- Node 10: <10, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 12: <12, (3, 5, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have 4 unique 3-stars. So, the final answer is [4].
