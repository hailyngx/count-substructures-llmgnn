Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 8) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 4) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 19) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 19) (8, 18) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 18) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 0) (1, 14) (1, 10) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 13) (9, 2) (9, 10) (0, 18) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 15) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 4) (13, 3) (13, 16) (13, 15) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 15) (15, 14) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: [18]
- Node 1: [10, 14]
- Node 2: [3, 9, 15]
- Node 3: [2, 11, 13, 16]
- Node 4: [5, 6, 10, 15]
- Node 5: [4, 6]
- Node 6: [4, 5]
- Node 7: [8, 12, 16]
- Node 8: [7, 12, 17, 18, 19]
- Node 9: [2, 10]
- Node 10: [1, 4, 9, 12]
- Node 11: [3, 12, 19]
- Node 12: [7, 8, 10, 11]
- Node 13: [3, 15, 16]
- Node 14: [1, 15, 17]
- Node 15: [2, 4, 13, 14]
- Node 16: [3, 7, 13]
- Node 17: [8, 14]
- Node 18: [0, 8, 19]
- Node 19: [8, 11, 18]

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 8 (Nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, 13, 15, 19)

Since each of these nodes has exactly 3 neighbors, each forms 1 unique 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 10, 14>
- <3, 2, 16>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <6, 4, 5>
- <10, 1, 4>
- <13, 3, 15>
- <15, 2, 13>
- <19, 11, 8>
