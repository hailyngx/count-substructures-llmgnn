Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 6}

Now, we check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 4, and Node 8 have 4 neighbors.
- Node 1, Node 3, Node 7, and Node 9 have 4 neighbors.

We calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For Node 0, Node 4, and Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
For Node 1, Node 3, Node 7, and Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Total 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (0, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>
- <9, (2, 6, 5)>
