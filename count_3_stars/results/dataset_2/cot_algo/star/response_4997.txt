Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 4) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 0) (26, 7) (5, 9) (5, 23) (2, 29) (2, 20) (2, 7) (29, 9) (29, 2) (29, 25) (7, 26) (7, 2) (21, 19) (21, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 28) (3, 1) (3, 27) (10, 11) (10, 22) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 0) (12, 17) (12, 22) (6, 1) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 15) (6, 8) (28, 1) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 27) (28, 13) (13, 28) (13, 16) (13, 23) (0, 26) (0, 11) (0, 28) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 27) (17, 4) (25, 29) (25, 6) (19, 21) (19, 22) (22, 10) (22, 12) (22, 19) (22, 24) (24, 11) (24, 22) (24, 8) (24, 23) (23, 5) (23, 13) (23, 24) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 24) (8, 15) (4, 9) (4, 21) (4, 17) (18, 20) (27, 9) (27, 3) (27, 28) (27, 17) (16, 13) (16, 20) (16, 15) (20, 2) (20, 18) (20, 16) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 16) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in the form of an adjacency list:

1: [3, 6, 11, 28]
2: [7, 20, 29]
3: [1, 27]
4: [9, 17, 21]
5: [9, 23]
6: [1, 8, 15, 25, 28]
7: [2, 26]
8: [6, 15, 17, 24]
9: [4, 5, 26, 27, 29]
10: [11, 22]
11: [1, 10, 24]
12: [17, 22]
13: [16, 23, 28]
15: [6, 8, 16]
16: [13, 15, 20]
17: [4, 8, 12, 27]
18: [20]
19: [21, 22]
20: [2, 16, 18]
21: [4, 19]
22: [10, 12, 19, 24]
23: [5, 13, 24]
24: [8, 11, 22, 23]
25: [6, 29]
26: [7, 9, 0]
27: [3, 9, 17, 28]
28: [1, 6, 13, 27]
29: [2, 9, 25]

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
From the adjacency list, we see that nodes 9, 6, 8, 1, 27, and 28 have 5 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes.

For node 9:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For node 6:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For node 8:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 1:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 27:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 28:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [36].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, 6, 28>
<1, 6, 13>
<1, 6, 25>
<1, 8, 24>
<1, 27, 28>
<6, 8, 15>
<6, 25, 29>
<6, 15, 16>
<6, 15, 28>
<8, 15, 16>
<8, 15, 16>
<8, 24, 23>
<27, 17, 4>
<27, 17, 8>
<27, 17, 28>
<27, 28, 13>
