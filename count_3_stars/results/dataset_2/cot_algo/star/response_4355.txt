Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 10) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 13) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed in this graph.

First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {6, 10, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {10, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 13}
- Node 4: {2, 8, 11}
- Node 5: {3, 12}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {9, 10, 14}
- Node 8: {4, 9, 11}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 2, 7, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 5, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 7, 10}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 6, 9, 10, 14
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: 11, 12

For each of these nodes, we'll apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to determine how many 3-stars are formed:
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 9 choose 3 = 84
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 10 choose 3 = 120
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: 15 choose 3 = 455

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
84 + 120 + 455 = 659

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [659].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph include:
- <0, 6, 11>
- <0, 6, 12>
- <0, 11, 12>
- <0, 10, 14>
- <1, 10, 14>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <2, 9, 13>
- <3, 5, 12>
- <4, 8, 11>
- <7, 9, 14>
- <11, 12, 13>
