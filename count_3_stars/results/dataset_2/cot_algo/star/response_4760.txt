Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 19) (11, 14) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 7) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (3, 4) (3, 18) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 17) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 9) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 15) (12, 17) (12, 6) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 7) (19, 10) (19, 17) (7, 13) (7, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 1) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 19) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighboring nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 18, 1}
- Node 1: Neighbors {8, 5, 0}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 18, 6, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 18}
- Node 4: Neighbors {11, 8, 3, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {13, 1, 16, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {10, 2, 12}
- Node 7: Neighbors {13, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {13, 4, 0, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {18, 16, 7}
- Node 10: Neighbors {6, 19}
- Node 11: Neighbors {14, 4}
- Node 12: Neighbors {17, 6}
- Node 13: Neighbors {8, 5, 7}
- Node 14: Neighbors {2, 5, 15, 11}
- Node 15: Neighbors {16, 14, 17}
- Node 16: Neighbors {5, 9, 15}
- Node 17: Neighbors {15, 12, 19}
- Node 18: Neighbors {2, 3, 0, 9}
- Node 19: Neighbors {10, 17}

Now, let's identify nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 17 \) 3-stars. So the final answer is [17].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, (1, 8, 13)>
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>
- <13, (7, 8, 5)>
- <14, (2, 5, 15)>
- <18, (0, 2, 9)>
