Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 23) (1, 9) (21, 7) (21, 12) (21, 25) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 17) (6, 22) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 0) (7, 21) (7, 17) (7, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 20) (17, 6) (17, 7) (17, 27) (28, 6) (28, 8) (28, 5) (28, 15) (22, 6) (22, 26) (22, 2) (22, 16) (26, 22) (26, 16) (26, 4) (4, 26) (4, 27) (4, 16) (27, 17) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 5) (25, 21) (25, 19) (25, 18) (20, 10) (20, 29) (20, 24) (29, 20) (29, 16) (29, 24) (8, 7) (8, 28) (8, 19) (19, 25) (19, 8) (19, 23) (2, 22) (2, 27) (2, 5) (2, 11) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 4) (16, 29) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 23) (18, 25) (18, 23) (15, 28) (5, 28) (5, 27) (5, 2) (11, 2) (11, 24) (24, 20) (24, 29) (24, 11) (3, 12) (23, 1) (23, 19) (23, 0) (23, 18) (23, 12) (14, 10) (12, 21) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 23) (13, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 9, 10, 12, 23
- Node 1: 9, 23
- Node 2: 5, 11, 22, 27
- Node 3: 12
- Node 4: 16, 26, 27
- Node 5: 2, 5, 27, 28
- Node 6: 9, 17, 22, 28
- Node 7: 8, 17, 21
- Node 8: 7, 19, 28
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6, 13, 23
- Node 10: 0, 14, 20
- Node 11: 2, 24
- Node 12: 0, 3, 21, 23
- Node 13: 9
- Node 14: 10
- Node 15: 28
- Node 16: 4, 22, 26, 29
- Node 17: 6, 7, 27
- Node 18: 23, 25
- Node 19: 8, 18, 23, 25
- Node 20: 10, 20, 24, 29
- Node 21: 7, 12, 21, 25
- Node 22: 2, 6, 16, 26
- Node 23: 0, 1, 12, 18, 19, 23
- Node 24: 11, 20, 29
- Node 25: 18, 19, 21
- Node 26: 4, 16, 22
- Node 27: 2, 4, 5, 17
- Node 28: 5, 6, 8, 15
- Node 29: 16, 20, 24

Now, let's identify nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes: (9, 10, 23)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes: (2, 27, 28)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes: (9, 17, 22)
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes: (4, 26, 29)

Counting these unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (9, 10, 23)>
<5, (2, 27, 28)>
<6, (9, 17, 22)>
<16, (4, 26, 29)>
