Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 12) (9, 10) (9, 8) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 14) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 10, 11}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 11}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 9: {8, 10}
- Node 10: {1, 8, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 7, 10}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 5, 10, 14}
- Node 13: {5, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 12, 13}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 77

Therefore, the final answer is [77], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 12)>, <0, (3, 4, 14)>, <0, (3, 12, 14)>, <0, (4, 12, 14)>, <4, (5, 12, 13)>, <4, (5, 12, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (12, 13, 5)>, <4, (12, 13, 14)>, <5, (12, 13, 6)>, <5, (12, 13, 7)>, <5, (12, 6, 7)>, <5, (13, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 8, 13)>, <8, (2, 8, 4)>, <8, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (8, 13, 14)>, <8, (8, 13, 5)>, <8, (8, 13, 7)>, <8, (8, 5, 13)>, <10, (1, 10, 11)>, <10, (1, 10, 12)>, <10, (1, 10, 8)>, <10, (11, 10, 12)>, <10, (11, 10, 2)>, <10, (11, 10, 7)>, <10, (11, 2, 7)>, <10, (12, 8, 10)>, <10, (12, 8, 4)>, <10, (12, 8, 5)>, <10, (12, 8, 14)>, <12, (0, 12, 14)>, <12, (5, 12, 0)>, <12, (5, 12, 14)>, <12, (5, 12, 7)>, <12, (12, 0, 14)>, <12, (12, 0, 4)>, <12, (12, 0, 5)>, <12, (12, 0, 14)>, <12, (12, 4, 0)>, <12, (12, 4, 5)>, <12, (12, 4, 14)>, <12, (12, 5, 0)>, <12, (12, 5, 7)>, <12, (12, 5, 14)>, <12, (12, 14, 0)>, <12, (12, 14, 5)>, <14, (0, 14, 3)>
