Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 27) (21, 7) (21, 3) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 28) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 25) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 27) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 5) (26, 23) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (22, 16) (22, 24) (28, 2) (28, 26) (28, 13) (17, 2) (17, 20) (17, 6) (17, 15) (20, 17) (20, 23) (27, 4) (27, 7) (27, 1) (27, 16) (5, 1) (5, 26) (5, 8) (19, 29) (19, 6) (11, 23) (23, 26) (23, 20) (23, 11) (3, 21) (3, 14) (3, 13) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 8) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 15) (16, 7) (16, 22) (16, 27) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 18) (10, 29) (24, 22) (29, 7) (29, 19) (29, 10) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (13, 28) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 25) (25, 18) (25, 13) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: 5, 6, 14, 27, 26
2: 8, 17, 18, 28
3: 13, 14, 21
4: 7, 12, 27
5: 1, 8, 26
6: 1, 15, 17, 19
7: 4, 16, 21, 27, 29
8: 0, 2, 5, 12, 15
10: 18, 29
11: 23
12: 4, 8, 18
13: 0, 3, 14, 25, 28
14: 1, 3, 13
15: 6, 8, 17
16: 7, 22, 27
17: 2, 6, 15, 20
18: 2, 10, 12, 25
19: 6, 29
20: 17, 23
21: 3, 7
22: 16, 24
23: 11, 20, 26
24: 22
25: 13, 18
26: 1, 5, 23, 28
27: 1, 4, 7, 16
28: 2, 13, 26
29: 7, 10, 19

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars each can form:

Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are: 

<1, 5, 26>
<1, 6, 14>
<1, 26, 27>
<1, 6, 15>
<1, 14, 27>
<2, 8, 17>
<2, 8, 18>
<2, 17, 28>
<3, 13, 14>
<4, 7, 27>
<6, 15, 17>
<7, 21, 27>
<8, 12, 18>
<13, 14, 25>
<19, 29, 6>
<25, 13, 18>
