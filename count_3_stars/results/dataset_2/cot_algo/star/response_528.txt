Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 10) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 0) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {8, 4, 5, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 12}
- Node 2: {8, 5, 10}
- Node 3: {1, 11, 10, 13, 5}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 0, 5, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 2, 12, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 12, 8, 4}
- Node 7: {4, 11, 10, 14}
- Node 8: {6, 13, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {6, 11, 14, 12}
- Node 10: {3, 13, 7, 2}
- Node 11: {9, 3, 7, 12}
- Node 12: {6, 9, 1, 5, 11}
- Node 13: {3, 8, 10}
- Node 14: {9, 4, 7, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 14 <0, (4, 5, 14)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 10 <3, (1, 5, 10)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 14 <4, (6, 7, 14)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 12 <5, (3, 4, 12)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 11, and 12 <9, (6, 11, 12)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and 13 <10, (2, 7, 13)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 11, and 6 <12, (1, 11, 6)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
