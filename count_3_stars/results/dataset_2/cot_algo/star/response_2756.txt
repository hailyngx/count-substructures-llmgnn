Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 6, 8, 4, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 8, 9, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 9, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 0, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 6, 2, 8, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 8, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 6, 2, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 2, 0, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0:  inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: ًinom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: ًinom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: ًinom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: ًinom{4}{3} = 4

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 4, 9)>, <0, (8, 5, 6)>, <0, (8, 5, 2)>, <0, (8, 6, 2)>, <0, (8, 6, 5)>, <1, (6, 2, 4)>, <1, (6, 2, 7)>, <1, (6, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 8, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 8, 6)>, <2, (5, 8, 7)>, <2, (8, 0, 6)>, <2, (8, 0, 5)>, <3, (0, 9, 4)>, <3, (0, 9, 5)>, <3, (9, 2, 0)>, <3, (9, 0, 5)>, <5, (6, 1, 7)>, <5, (6, 8, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 2)>, <9, (3, 2, 0)>, <9, (3, 0, 4)>.
