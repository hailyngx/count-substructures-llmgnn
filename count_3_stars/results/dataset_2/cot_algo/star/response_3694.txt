Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 58

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [58], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
