Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 11) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (12, 4) (12, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the set of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 2: {1, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {5, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12}
- Node 8: {4, 9, 11}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 10: {7, 11, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 10}
- Node 12: {4, 7}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 14: {6, 13}

Now we can determine the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 3 neighbors, no 3-stars
- Node 2: 3 neighbors, no 3-stars
- Node 3: 2 neighbors, no 3-stars
- Node 4: 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 6 neighbors, so \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 3 neighbors, no 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: 3 neighbors, no 3-stars
- Node 11: 6 neighbors, so \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: 2 neighbors, no 3-stars
- Node 13: 7 neighbors, so \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: 2 neighbors, no 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 35 = 119

Therefore, the final answer is [119], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 11)>
<6, (5, 9, 13)>
<7, (0, 5, 12)>
<9, (4, 6, 13)>
<13, (0, 6, 2)>
<13, (0, 6, 9)>
<13, (0, 6, 14)>
<13, (2, 6, 9)>
