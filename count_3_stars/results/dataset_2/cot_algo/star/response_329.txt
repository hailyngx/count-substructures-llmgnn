Response:
The given graph has a total of 30 nodes and 90 edges. To find the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we will first identify all the nodes that are connected to each node:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 13 and 14.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 16, and 21.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 13, 20, and 24.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 20 and 21.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 15, 22.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 15, 18, 23, and 28.
- Node 6 is connected to node 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 16, 18, 29.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 25, and 29.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 27, 28.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 12.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 21, 23.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 10, 12, 17, 19, 20, 26.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 2.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 20, 27.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 15, 26, 28.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 21, 22.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 12, 17, 18, 23.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 17.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 12, 19, 24.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 2, 12, 14, 20.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 11, 21, 23.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 4, 16, 22.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 5, 11, 17, 21.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 2, 19.
- Node 25 is connected to node 8.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 12, 15, 27.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 9, 14, 26.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 15, 28, 29.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 15, 28.

From the information above, we can see that the following nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes forms:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 84 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [84].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 2, 16, 21>
- <2, 12, 20, 24>
- <5, 15, 26, 28>
- <12, 17, 19, 23>
- <28, 5, 29, 7>
