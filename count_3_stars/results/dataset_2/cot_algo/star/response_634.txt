Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 24) (22, 16) (22, 5) (1, 29) (1, 28) (21, 12) (21, 2) (21, 15) (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 29) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 12) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 24) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 26) (11, 12) (2, 21) (2, 24) (18, 10) (18, 0) (4, 24) (4, 28) (8, 25) (26, 13) (26, 11) (26, 23) (26, 3) (7, 15) (7, 23) (25, 14) (25, 8) (25, 0) (9, 11) (9, 29) (9, 20) (9, 27) (29, 1) (29, 14) (29, 9) (29, 5) (0, 18) (0, 25) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 12) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 3) (23, 26) (23, 7) (23, 5) (23, 20) (28, 1) (28, 14) (28, 4) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 27) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 23) (3, 17) (3, 26) (3, 16) (3, 12) (27, 9) (27, 6) (20, 9) (20, 23) (15, 21) (15, 7) (15, 0) (12, 21) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 3) (24, 13) (24, 10) (24, 2) (24, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 18, 25, 16, 15, 12
- Node 1: 29, 28, 21
- Node 2: 24, 21
- Node 3: 17, 26, 16, 12
- Node 4: 24, 28
- Node 5: 22, 29, 23
- Node 6: 17, 10, 11, 27
- Node 7: 15, 23
- Node 8: 25
- Node 9: 11, 29, 20, 27
- Node 10: 6, 18, 24
- Node 11: 9, 6, 26, 12
- Node 12: 21, 17, 11, 0, 3
- Node 13: 26, 24
- Node 14: 17, 28, 29, 25
- Node 15: 21, 7, 0
- Node 16: 22, 0, 3
- Node 17: 14, 6, 3, 12
- Node 18: 10, 0
- Node 20: 9, 23
- Node 21: 1, 12, 15, 2
- Node 22: 5, 16
- Node 23: 26, 7, 5, 20
- Node 24: 13, 10, 2, 4
- Node 25: 14, 8, 0
- Node 26: 13, 11, 23, 3
- Node 27: 9, 6
- Node 28: 1, 14, 4
- Node 29: 1, 14, 9, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 12: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 21: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 24: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 26: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 29: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 48

Unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (12, 15, 16)>
2. <1, (21, 28, 29)>
3. <3, (16, 17, 26)>
4. <5, (22, 23, 29)>
5. <9, (11, 20, 27)>
6. <11, (12, 17, 26)>
7. <12, (0, 3, 21), (11, 17, 21)>
8. <14, (17, 25, 28)>
9. <17, (12, 21, 26)>
10. <21, (1, 12, 15), (2, 12, 21)>
11. <24, (2, 4, 10)>
