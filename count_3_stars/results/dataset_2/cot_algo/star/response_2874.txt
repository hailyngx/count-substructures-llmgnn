Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 25) (26, 8) (26, 12) (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 29) (27, 9) (27, 15) (27, 25) (27, 18) (27, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 24) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 28) (17, 23) (17, 22) (6, 2) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 18) (11, 2) (20, 29) (20, 22) (20, 24) (29, 15) (29, 20) (29, 21) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 21) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 23) (7, 18) (16, 22) (16, 14) (4, 23) (12, 26) (19, 10) (19, 22) (19, 0) (22, 17) (22, 11) (22, 20) (22, 16) (22, 19) (8, 26) (8, 27) (8, 3) (8, 28) (8, 0) (28, 10) (28, 8) (14, 3) (14, 16) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (24, 3) (24, 20) (24, 13) (0, 19) (0, 8) (0, 21) (21, 29) (21, 25) (21, 0) (13, 1) (13, 24) (18, 15) (18, 27) (18, 11) (18, 7) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 15 unique 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the answer is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (9, 1, 6)>
<3, (1, 14, 24)>
<7, (9, 18, 23)>
<8, (3, 8, 28)>
<9, (26, 7, 27)>
<10, (7, 19, 28)>
<11, (3, 18, 22)>
<15, (27, 18, 29)>
<16, (22, 14, 16)>
<18, (7, 15, 27)>
<19, (10, 22, 0)>
<20, (24, 22, 29)>
<21, (0, 21, 29)>
<22, (11, 16, 20)>
<26, (9, 8, 12)>
