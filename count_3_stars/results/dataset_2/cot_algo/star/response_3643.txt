Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 7}
Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 7, 8}
Node 2: {3, 5, 8}
Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 9}
Node 6: {0, 1, 4}
Node 7: {0, 1, 9}
Node 8: {1, 2, 4}
Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 1, 8
Nodes with 6 neighbors: 3, 9
Nodes with 7 neighbors: None

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes with 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each

Total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 \times 3 + 10 \times 2 + 20 \times 2 = 8 + 20 + 40 = 68 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 3)>
<4, (5, 9, 4)>
<4, (3, 9, 5)>
<4, (9, 5, 3)>
