Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 9) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 14) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 14) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 13, 14
- Node 2: 4, 8
- Node 3: 5, 8, 11, 12
- Node 4: 0, 2, 13, 14
- Node 5: 3, 14
- Node 6: 0, 1, 10
- Node 7: 1, 13, 14
- Node 8: 2, 3, 9, 11, 12
- Node 9: 8, 11, 12, 14
- Node 10: 6, 11, 12
- Node 11: 3, 8, 9, 10, 12
- Node 12: 3, 8, 9, 10, 11
- Node 13: 1, 4, 7, 14
- Node 14: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 13

Now, we can identify the 3-stars. Nodes with less than 3 neighbors cannot form a 3-star. Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors will form a single 3-star. Nodes with more than 3 neighbors will form multiple 3-stars.

Let's analyze:
- Node 0: Can form 1 3-star <0, 1, 6>
- Node 1: Can form 1 3-star <1, 0, 6>
- Node 4: Can form 1 3-star <4, 13, 14>
- Node 7: Can form 1 3-star <7, 13, 14>
- Node 8: Can form 4 3-stars: <8, 3, 11>, <8, 9, 12>, <8, 12, 3>, <8, 12, 9>
- Node 11: Can form 3 3-stars: <11, 3, 8>, <11, 8, 9>, <11, 9, 12>
- Node 12: Can form 5 3-stars: <12, 3, 8>, <12, 8, 9>, <12, 9, 11>, <12, 11, 3>, <12, 11, 9>
- Node 13: Can form 1 3-star <13, 1, 14>
- Node 14: Can form 4 3-stars: <14, 1, 7>, <14, 1, 13>, <14, 4, 13>, <14, 7, 9>

Total 3-stars: 1 (from nodes with exactly 3 neighbors) + 14 (sum of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 4) = 15

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
