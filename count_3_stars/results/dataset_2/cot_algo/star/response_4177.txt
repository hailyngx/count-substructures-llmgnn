Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 7}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 20 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>
