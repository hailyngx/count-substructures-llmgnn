Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 8) (12, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 5) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 5) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 10, 2, 6}
- Node 1: {8, 7}
- Node 2: {12, 5, 0}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 10, 2, 8, 13}
- Node 6: {3, 0, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 12, 5, 14}
- Node 9: {3, 11, 12, 14, 4}
- Node 10: {11, 0, 5}
- Node 11: {10, 4, 9, 14}
- Node 12: {7, 2, 13, 8, 9}
- Node 13: {7, 5, 12}
- Node 14: {11, 7, 8, 9, 4}

Now, we will calculate how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 3 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 68

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

Unique 3-stars:
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <5, (3, 8, 10)>
- <7, (1, 12, 14)>
- <8, (1, 5, 14)>
- <9, (3, 11, 12)>
- <12, (7, 9, 13)>
- <14, (4, 9, 11)>
