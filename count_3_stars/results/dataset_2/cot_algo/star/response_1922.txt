Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (12, 4) (12, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 14) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {4, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 11}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 3}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 4}
- Node 13: {2, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 14: {0, 7, 9, 10, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star subgraphs:

- Node 4: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 10, 14}

Counting the number of 3-star subgraphs formed:
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star subgraph.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star subgraphs.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star subgraph.

Total number of 3-star subgraphs: 1 + 10 + 1 = 12

Therefore, the final answer is [12], and the unique 3-star subgraphs are:
<4, (0, 6, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 11)>, <7, (1, 4, 13)>, <7, (1, 4, 14)>, <7, (1, 11, 13)>, <7, (1, 11, 14)>, <7, (1, 13, 14)>, <7, (4, 11, 13)>, <7, (4, 11, 14)>, <7, (4, 13, 14)>, <9, (2, 4, 10)>, <9, (2, 4, 14)>
