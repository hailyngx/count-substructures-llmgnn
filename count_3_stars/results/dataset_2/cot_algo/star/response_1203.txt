Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 17) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 18) (14, 12) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 3) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 4) (18, 13) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 3) (13, 18) (13, 5) (13, 19) (1, 15) (1, 2) (17, 11) (17, 2) (15, 10) (15, 1) (15, 16) (15, 6) (8, 16) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 12) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 9) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 12) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 2) (7, 11) (6, 0) (6, 15) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 3) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 19) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph by following these steps:

1. Find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 9}
- Node 1: {15, 2}
- Node 2: {10, 1, 17, 12}
- Node 3: {10, 4, 5, 8, 19}
- Node 4: {18, 5, 3, 19}
- Node 5: {4, 13, 3}
- Node 6: {0, 15}
- Node 7: {11}
- Node 8: {3, 16}
- Node 9: {0, 16, 12}
- Node 10: {15, 3, 19, 2}
- Node 11: {7, 18, 17}
- Node 12: {14, 9, 2}
- Node 13: {18, 5, 19}
- Node 14: {18, 12}
- Node 15: {10, 1, 16, 6}
- Node 16: {15, 8, 9}
- Node 17: {11, 2}
- Node 18: {11, 14, 4, 13}
- Node 19: {10, 4, 13, 3}

2. Identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 5, and 19. <3, (4, 5, 19)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 18, 5, and 19. <4, (18, 5, 19)>
- Node 5 also forms a 3-star with neighbors 13, 3, and 4. <5, (13, 3, 4)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors 15, 19, and 2. <10, (15, 19, 2)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with neighbors 18, 17, and 7. <11, (18, 17, 7)>
- Node 12 also forms a 3-star with neighbors 14, 9, and 2. <12, (14, 9, 2)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with neighbors 18, 5, and 19. <13, (18, 5, 19)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with neighbors 16, 6, and 10. <15, (16, 6, 10)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors 15, 9, and 8. <16, (15, 9, 8)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 13, and 11. <18, (4, 13, 11)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 13, and 10. <19, (3, 13, 10)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [10].
