Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 14) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 2) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 2: {3, 8, 12}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 6, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 5, 13}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 14}
- Node 10: {7, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 4, 7, 10}
- Node 12: {2, 6, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 14: {4, 6, 9, 10}

There are no nodes with less than 3 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars formed is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60 \), so the final answer is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 11, 13)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 12)>
<7, (1, 11, 13)>
<8, (1, 7, 13)>
<11, (1, 7, 13)>
