Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 5) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 14) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 14) 

Response:
There are a few nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify them first to see if any 3-stars can be formed.

Node 10 has 6 neighbors: 11, 0, 12, 2, 5, 14
Node 11 has 6 neighbors: 10, 3, 14, 9, 8
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 11, 13, 6, 1
Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 8, 5, 4, 6
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 10, 13, 4, 0, 3
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 10, 2, 0, 1
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 13, 5, 2, 9, 1
Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 10, 12, 4, 14
Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 10, 11, 2, 9
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 11, 7, 3, 4, 14

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms 3 3-stars: <2, (10, 12, 14)>, <2, (10, 4, 14)>, <2, (12, 4, 14)>.
Node 14 forms 3 3-stars: <14, (10, 2, 11)>, <14, (10, 2, 9)>, <14, (11, 2, 9)>.
Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<10, (0, 12, 2)>
<10, (0, 5, 13)>
<10, (2, 5, 13)>
<10, (0, 5, 3)>
<11, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 13)>
<4, (1, 9, 13)>
<2, (10, 12, 14)>
<2, (10, 4, 14)>
<2, (12, 4, 14)>
<14, (10, 2, 11)>
<14, (10, 2, 9)>
<14, (11, 2, 9)>
<9, (7, 3, 4)>
