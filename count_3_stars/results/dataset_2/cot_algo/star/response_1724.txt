Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 29) (13, 20) (13, 19) (22, 14) (22, 16) (22, 10) (3, 15) (3, 23) (3, 9) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 16) (15, 19) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 20) (2, 7) (29, 13) (29, 2) (29, 16) (25, 27) (25, 17) (25, 16) (25, 12) (7, 2) (7, 0) (21, 6) (21, 26) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 18) (18, 2) (18, 8) (18, 10) (18, 11) (0, 7) (0, 20) (20, 13) (20, 2) (20, 0) (20, 12) (28, 17) (28, 9) (28, 24) (9, 3) (9, 28) (6, 21) (6, 12) (5, 24) (5, 16) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 1) (16, 22) (16, 15) (16, 29) (16, 25) (16, 5) (1, 19) (1, 24) (27, 25) (27, 17) (17, 25) (17, 28) (17, 27) (26, 21) (24, 8) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 1) (10, 22) (10, 18) (10, 23) (10, 14) (11, 18) (11, 12) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 10) (12, 25) (12, 20) (12, 6) (12, 11) (23, 3) (23, 10) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed in this graph.

From the list of edges, we can identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 20}
- Node 1: {19, 24}
- Node 2: {7, 18, 20, 29}
- Node 3: {4, 9, 15, 19, 23}
- Node 4: {3, 8, 14, 19}
- Node 5: {16, 24}
- Node 6: {12, 21}
- Node 7: {0, 2}
- Node 8: {4, 18, 24}
- Node 9: {3, 28}
- Node 10: {12, 14, 18, 22, 23}
- Node 11: {12, 18}
- Node 12: {6, 10, 11, 20, 25}
- Node 13: {19, 20, 29}
- Node 14: {4, 10, 22}
- Node 15: {3, 16, 19}
- Node 16: {5, 15, 22, 25, 29}
- Node 17: {25, 27, 28}
- Node 18: {2, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 19: {1, 3, 4, 13, 15}
- Node 20: {0, 2, 12, 13}
- Node 21: {6, 26}
- Node 22: {10, 14, 16}
- Node 23: {3, 10}
- Node 24: {1, 5, 8, 28}
- Node 25: {12, 16, 17, 27}
- Node 26: {21}
- Node 27: {17, 25}
- Node 28: {8, 17, 24, 9}
- Node 29: {2, 13, 16}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 59

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [59].

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (7, 18, 29)>
<3, (4, 15, 19)>
<4, (3, 14, 19)>
<8, (18, 24, 28)>
<10, (12, 14, 22)>
<12, (10, 20, 25)>
<13, (19, 20, 29)>
<16, (5, 22, 25)>
<18, (8, 10, 11)>
<25, (12, 17, 27)>
<28, (8, 17, 24)>
<29, (2, 13, 16)>
