Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 5, 9, 7, 2, 8
- Node 1: 4, 3
- Node 2: 9, 4, 7, 8, 0
- Node 3: 9, 4, 7, 1, 6
- Node 4: 7, 1, 3, 2
- Node 5: 6, 0
- Node 6: 5, 3, 8
- Node 7: 4, 0, 3, 2, 8
- Node 8: 9, 7, 6, 2, 0
- Node 9: 8, 2, 3, 0

Now let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 7)>.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <9, (2, 3, 8)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 52. So, the final answer is [52], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <0, (5, 9, 7)>
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- <7, (4, 3, 8)>
- <7, (4, 3, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 8)>
- <9, (0, 7, 8)>
- <9, (2, 4, 8)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
- <9, (3, 4, 8)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
- <9, (3, 7, 8)>
- <9, (6, 8, 5)>
