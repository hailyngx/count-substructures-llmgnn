Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5, 6}

Now, we can see that the nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 45 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [45], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>
