Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 7, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {7, 9, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {9, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 9, 10}
- Node 8: {0, 12, 13, 11}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 11: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 12: {3, 5, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 14: {1}

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 14>, <0, 2, 10>, <0, 2, 11>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 12>, <1, 10, 2>, <1, 10, 5>, <1, 13, 5>, <1, 13, 6>, <1, 13, 8>, <1, 14, 1>, <2, 10, 5>, <2, 10, 7>, <2, 11, 8>, <2, 11, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 7, 5>, <3, 7, 10>, <3, 12, 5>, <3, 12, 6>, <3, 12, 8>, <4, 7, 5>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 9, 11>, <4, 9, 5>, <5, 7, 10>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 9, 11>, <5, 9, 6>, <5, 9, 7>, <7, 9, 11>, <7, 9, 5>, <8, 12, 13>, <8, 12, 3>, <8, 13, 12>, <8, 13, 1>, <9, 11, 8>, <9, 11, 2>, <9, 11, 6>, <9, 11, 8>, <9, 11, 2>, <9, 11, 8>, <12, 13, 1>, <12, 13, 5>, <12, 13, 6>, <12, 13, 8>
