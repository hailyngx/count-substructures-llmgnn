Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 10}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 4: {7, 12}
- Node 5: {6, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5, 2}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 9: {8, 10, 11, 2}
- Node 10: {0, 7, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 11: {7, 9, 10, 3, 12}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 14: {1, 7, 2}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 13, 2} <8, (1, 13, 2)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 9, 11} <10, (7, 9, 11)>

There are 2 unique 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [2].
