Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 4) (9, 3) (26, 1) (26, 0) (3, 9) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 25) (15, 5) (0, 26) (0, 27) (0, 17) (27, 0) (27, 17) (2, 6) (2, 14) (29, 7) (29, 13) (29, 14) (29, 4) (20, 25) (20, 13) (20, 18) (20, 5) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 4) (11, 16) (11, 1) (16, 11) (16, 28) (1, 26) (1, 15) (1, 11) (21, 28) (21, 4) (8, 5) (8, 24) (8, 18) (23, 18) (23, 12) (28, 16) (28, 21) (28, 22) (28, 10) (19, 3) (19, 24) (22, 3) (22, 28) (22, 17) (7, 29) (7, 17) (24, 8) (24, 19) (5, 15) (5, 20) (5, 8) (5, 14) (18, 20) (18, 8) (18, 23) (18, 6) (4, 9) (4, 29) (4, 25) (4, 21) (4, 17) (12, 23) (12, 14) (13, 29) (13, 20) (6, 2) (6, 25) (6, 18) (6, 10) (10, 28) (10, 6) (17, 0) (17, 27) (17, 22) (17, 7) (17, 4) (14, 2) (14, 29) (14, 5) (14, 12) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph seem to have varying degrees, so we should start by identifying the neighbor set for each node.

Node 0 neighbors: 26, 27
Node 1 neighbors: 26, 15, 11
Node 2 neighbors: 6, 14
Node 3 neighbors: 9, 15, 19, 22
Node 4 neighbors: 9, 29, 25, 21, 17
Node 5 neighbors: 15, 20, 8, 14
Node 6 neighbors: 2, 25, 18, 10
Node 7 neighbors: 29, 17
Node 8 neighbors: 5, 24, 18
Node 9 neighbors: 4, 3
Node 10 neighbors: 28, 6
Node 11 neighbors: 1, 16
Node 12 neighbors: 23, 14
Node 13 neighbors: 29, 20
Node 14 neighbors: 2, 29, 5, 12
Node 15 neighbors: 3, 1, 25, 5
Node 16 neighbors: 11, 28
Node 17 neighbors: 0, 27, 22, 7, 4
Node 18 neighbors: 20, 8, 23, 6
Node 19 neighbors: 3, 24
Node 20 neighbors: 25, 13, 18, 5
Node 21 neighbors: 28, 4
Node 22 neighbors: 3, 28, 17
Node 23 neighbors: 18, 12
Node 24 neighbors: 8, 19
Node 25 neighbors: 15, 20, 6, 4
Node 26 neighbors: 0, 1
Node 27 neighbors: 0, 17
Node 28 neighbors: 16, 21, 10, 22
Node 29 neighbors: 7, 13, 14, 4

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 3, 28
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 9, 25, 14, 4, 29
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 15, 5

Calculating:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for each node
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each node
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for each node

Adding them up:
3-stars from nodes with 3 neighbors: \( 1 + 1 = 2 \)
3-stars from nodes with 4 neighbors: \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \)
3-stars from nodes with 5 neighbors: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: \( 2 + 20 + 20 = 42 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (9, 15, 19)>
<28, (16, 10, 22)>
<9, (4, 25, 29)>
<25, (15, 20, 6)>
<14, (2, 29, 5)>
<4, (9, 25, 21)>
<15, (3, 1, 5)>
<5, (15, 20, 8)>
