Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 17) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 0) (1, 8) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 8) (5, 16) (5, 7) (19, 11) (19, 16) (10, 18) (10, 15) (10, 2) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 12) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 14) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 13) (0, 18) (0, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 15) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {18, 15}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {7, 10, 6}
- Node 3: {14, 6}
- Node 4: {7, 18, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {16, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 2}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 17, 2}
- Node 8: {1, 17, 15}
- Node 9: {16, 17, 14}
- Node 10: {18, 15, 2}
- Node 11: {16, 19, 12}
- Node 12: {4, 13, 15, 11}
- Node 13: {4, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {4, 13, 3, 9}
- Node 15: {0, 10, 8, 12}
- Node 16: {11, 19, 5, 9}
- Node 17: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 18: {4, 10, 0}
- Node 19: {11, 16}

Following the rules for forming 3-stars:
- Node 4, 7, 12, and 13 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 16 and 17 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 10 and 15 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 (Node \ 4) + 1 (Node \ 7) + 4 (Node \ 12) + 10 (Node \ 13) + 4 (Node \ 16) + 4 (Node \ 17) + 4 (Node \ 10) + 4 (Node \ 15) = 41 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [41].

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 12, 13)>
<16, (11, 17, 19)>
<17, (7, 9, 8)>
<10, (15, 18, 0)>
<15, (8, 12, 10)>
