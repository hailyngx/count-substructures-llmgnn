Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 11) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 6) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 10, 11}
- Node 1: {7, 13}
- Node 2: {9, 7, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 0, 14, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 10, 7}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 4, 6, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {13, 2, 10, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 2, 10, 7, 12}
- Node 10: {5, 9, 3, 8, 0, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 14, 6}
- Node 12: {9, 3, 6, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 8, 2}
- Node 14: {4, 3, 2, 11}

Now, let's check which nodes have at least three neighbors:

- Node 3, 7, 2, 10, 9, 14, and 0 have 5 neighbors (neighbors>=3)
- Node 6 and 12 have 4 neighbors (neighbors>=3)

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 68

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 68. 

Inside brackets: [68]

Unique 3-stars: <2, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 13>, <2, 7, 14>, <2, 9, 10>, <2, 9, 14>, <2, 10, 14>, <3, 5, 10>, <3, 5, 12>, <3, 10, 12>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 14>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 12>
