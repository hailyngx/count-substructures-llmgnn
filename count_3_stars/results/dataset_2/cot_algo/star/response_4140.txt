Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 28) (16, 1) (9, 4) (9, 13) (26, 14) (26, 21) (26, 3) (26, 27) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (29, 3) (29, 10) (3, 26) (3, 29) (3, 25) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 6) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 15) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 19) (27, 26) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 20) (0, 2) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 12) (20, 27) (20, 0) (21, 26) (21, 28) (21, 22) (28, 16) (28, 21) (28, 17) (28, 7) (28, 10) (17, 28) (7, 25) (7, 0) (7, 28) (7, 5) (10, 29) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 28) (10, 18) (14, 26) (14, 6) (14, 1) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 22) (22, 21) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 24) (24, 27) (24, 22) (19, 15) (19, 23) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 22) (6, 25) (6, 14) (18, 10) (18, 23) (18, 1) (23, 19) (23, 18) (23, 12) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 18) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 23) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 12
- Node 1: 14, 16, 18
- Node 2: 4, 5, 0
- Node 3: 25, 26, 29
- Node 4: 2, 9, 22
- Node 5: 2, 7, 11, 22
- Node 6: 14, 25
- Node 7: 0, 5, 25, 28
- Node 8: 11, 12, 13
- Node 9: 4, 13
- Node 10: 15, 18, 27, 28, 29
- Node 11: 5, 8
- Node 12: 0, 8, 23
- Node 13: 8, 9, 15
- Node 14: 1, 6, 26
- Node 15: 10, 13, 19
- Node 16: 1, 28
- Node 17: 28
- Node 18: 1, 10, 23
- Node 19: 15, 23
- Node 20: 0, 27
- Node 21: 22, 26, 28
- Node 22: 4, 5, 21, 24
- Node 23: 12, 18, 19
- Node 24: 22, 27
- Node 25: 3, 6, 7
- Node 26: 3, 14, 21, 27, 28
- Node 27: 3, 10, 20, 24, 26
- Node 28: 7, 10, 16, 17, 21, 26
- Node 29: 3, 10

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes (15, 18, 23)
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes (16, 21, 26)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <10, (15, 18, 23)> and <28, (16, 21, 26)>.
