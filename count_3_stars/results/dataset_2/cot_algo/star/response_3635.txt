Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 13) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (13, 14) (13, 12) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: {6, 10, 11, 12, 14}
Node 1: {8, 9, 12}
Node 2: {4, 7, 8}
Node 3: {4, 5, 7, 10}
Node 4: {2, 3, 8, 14}
Node 5: {3, 6, 11, 12}
Node 6: {0, 5, 11, 12}
Node 7: {2, 3}
Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 14}
Node 9: {0, 10, 11, 1}
Node 10: {0, 3, 9, 12}
Node 11: {0, 5, 6, 9, 14}
Node 12: {0, 1, 5, 6, 10, 13}
Node 13: {12, 14}
Node 14: {0, 4, 8, 11, 13}

Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 11, and 12: <0, (10, 11, 12)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 11: <5, (3, 6, 11)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 14: <8, (1, 4, 14)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 10, and 11: <9, (0, 10, 11)>
Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 6: <12, (1, 5, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
