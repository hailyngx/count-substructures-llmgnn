Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 2, 7}
- Node 1: {9, 3, 5, 2, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 1, 4, 0, 7}
- Node 3: {6, 1, 7, 5, 4}
- Node 4: {9, 3, 5, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 3, 0}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 2, 8, 0}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 2, 1}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors, we don't have any 3-star formed.
- For the nodes with 4 or more neighbors, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars centered at that node.

Calculations:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 57 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [57].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (6, 2, 7)>, <1, (9, 3, 5)>, <2, (9, 1, 4)>, <3, (6, 1, 7)>, <4, (9, 3, 5)>, <5, (6, 1, 3)>, <6, (9, 5, 3)>, <7, (1, 3, 2)>, <9, (6, 4, 2)>
