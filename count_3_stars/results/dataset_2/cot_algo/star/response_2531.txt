Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 14) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 2) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 13}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 3: {6, 10, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 5: {1, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 11}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 10, 11}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 5, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 3, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 12: {3, 6, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 14: {5, 10, 11, 12}

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 63

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [63].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 11)>
<1, (0, 2, 13)>
<2, (6, 9, 13)>
<3, (6, 10, 13)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (7, 12, 13)>
<10, (4, 5, 9)>
<11, (0, 8, 14)>
<14, (11, 12, 14)>
