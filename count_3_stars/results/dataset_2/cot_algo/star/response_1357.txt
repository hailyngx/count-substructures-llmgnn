Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
Graph G = (V, E)
V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
E = {(11, 24), (11, 0), (11, 27), (11, 6), (16, 13), (16, 25), (13, 16), (13, 22), (13, 4), (13, 0), (13, 7), (22, 13), (22, 4), (22, 17), (4, 13), (4, 22), (4, 7), (4, 2), (7, 13), (7, 4), (7, 20), (7, 17), (2, 4), (2, 29), (2, 12), (29, 2), (29, 14), (29, 18), (20, 7), (20, 21), (20, 10), (25, 16), (25, 28), (1, 3), (1, 12), (3, 1), (3, 5), (18, 29), (18, 19), (18, 14), (26, 19), (26, 28), (26, 15), (26, 17), (0, 11), (0, 13), (0, 10), (14, 29), (14, 18), (14, 9), (19, 18), (19, 26), (19, 9), (28, 25), (28, 26), (12, 2), (12, 1), (12, 24), (10, 20), (10, 0), (24, 11), (24, 12), (24, 27), (24, 9), (15, 26), (15, 23), (6, 11), (6, 17), (6, 23), (17, 22), (17, 7), (17, 26), (17, 6), (5, 3), (5, 23), (5, 21), (23, 15), (23, 6), (23, 5), (23, 21), (8, 27), (21, 20), (21, 5), (21, 23), (27, 11), (27, 24), (27, 8), (9, 14), (9, 19), (9, 24)}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {11, 13, 10}
- Node 1: {3, 12}
- Node 2: {4, 29, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 5}
- Node 4: {13, 22, 7, 2}
- Node 5: {3, 23, 21}
- Node 6: {11, 17, 23}
- Node 7: {13, 4, 20, 17}
- Node 8: {27}
- Node 9: {14, 19, 24}
- Node 10: {0, 20}
- Node 11: {24, 0, 27, 6}
- Node 12: {2, 1, 24}
- Node 13: {16, 22, 4, 0, 7}
- Node 14: {29, 18, 9}
- Node 15: {26, 23}
- Node 16: {13, 25}
- Node 17: {22, 7, 26, 6}
- Node 18: {29, 19, 14}
- Node 19: {18, 26, 9}
- Node 20: {7, 10, 21}
- Node 21: {20, 5, 23}
- Node 22: {13, 4, 17}
- Node 23: {15, 6, 5, 21}
- Node 24: {11, 12, 27, 9}
- Node 25: {16, 28}
- Node 26: {19, 28, 15, 17}
- Node 27: {11, 24, 8}
- Node 28: {25, 26}
- Node 29: {2, 14, 18}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: [0]
- Node 7: [3]
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 17: [0]
- Node 19: [0]
- Node 21: [0]
- Node 23: [1]
- Node 26: [0]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [5]

Unique 3-stars found:
- <13, 4, 7>
- <23, 6, 5>
