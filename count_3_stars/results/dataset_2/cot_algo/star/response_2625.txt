Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 7}

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Adding them all together, we have a total of 35 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [35], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 2, 6>, 
<0, 1, 6, 7>, 
<0, 1, 7, 8>, 
<1, 5, 6, 8>, 
<2, 5, 9>, 
<3, 5, 7>, 
<6, 7, 8>, 
<7, 8, 9>, 
<5, 6, 7>, 
<5, 6, 8>.
