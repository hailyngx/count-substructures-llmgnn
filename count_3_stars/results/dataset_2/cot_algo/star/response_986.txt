Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 2) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 9) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 7, 13}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 13, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 9, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 8, 10}
- Node 10: Neighbors {9, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 3, 8, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {2, 5, 7}
- Node 14: Neighbors {5, 6, 8, 10, 12}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 7: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 12: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 14: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get a total of \(10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 89\). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [89].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 1, 11>
- <0, 1, 12>
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 3, 12>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 3, 11>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 11>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <7, 8, 9>
- <7, 8, 12>
- <7, 8, 14>
- <7, 2, 13>
- <8, 9, 12>
- <9, 10, 14>
- <12, 14, 8>
- <14, 10, 9>
- <14, 6, 3>
