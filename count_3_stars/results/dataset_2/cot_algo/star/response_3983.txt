Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars formed in this graph are as follows:

Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 7)>
Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>
Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 8)>
Node 4: <4, (2, 6, 8)>
Node 6: <6, (2, 4, 8)>
Node 7: <7, (0, 2, 9)>
Node 8: <8, (3, 4, 6)>
Node 9: <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [9].
