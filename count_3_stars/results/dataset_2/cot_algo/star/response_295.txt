Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 14) (3, 26) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 25) (13, 9) (13, 23) (10, 1) (11, 24) (11, 12) (11, 29) (12, 11) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 5) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 20) (27, 9) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 26) (20, 27) (20, 0) (20, 25) (5, 12) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 28) (28, 2) (28, 17) (28, 25) (25, 13) (25, 20) (25, 28) (25, 9) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 24) (18, 19) (18, 15) (19, 2) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 24) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 21) (14, 3) (14, 9) (24, 11) (24, 22) (24, 19) (24, 17) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 16) (26, 3) (26, 0) (26, 7) (26, 17) (9, 13) (9, 27) (9, 25) (9, 14) (23, 13) (7, 15) (7, 26) (7, 17) (21, 27) (21, 4) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 29) (29, 11) (29, 16) (17, 0) (17, 28) (17, 24) (17, 26) (17, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {20, 17, 26}
- Node 1: {16, 10}
- Node 2: {8, 22, 19, 28}
- Node 3: {14, 26}
- Node 4: {12, 5, 6, 21}
- Node 5: {12, 6, 4}
- Node 6: {5, 4}
- Node 7: {15, 26, 17}
- Node 8: {2, 16}
- Node 9: {13, 27, 25, 14}
- Node 10: {1}
- Node 11: {24, 12, 29}
- Node 12: {11, 27, 5, 4}
- Node 13: {25, 23, 9}
- Node 14: {3, 9}
- Node 15: {18, 7, 16}
- Node 16: {1, 8, 15, 29}
- Node 17: {0, 28, 24, 26, 7}
- Node 18: {19, 15}
- Node 19: {2, 22, 18, 24}
- Node 20: {0, 25, 27}
- Node 21: {27, 4}
- Node 22: {2, 19, 24}
- Node 23: {13}
- Node 24: {11, 12, 19, 17}
- Node 25: {13, 20, 28, 9}
- Node 26: {3, 0, 7, 17}
- Node 27: {8, 12, 21, 20, 9}
- Node 28: {2, 25, 17}
- Node 29: {11, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 5: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 7: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 12: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 13: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 15: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 16: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 17: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- Node 19: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 20: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 24: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 25: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 26: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 27: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- Node 28: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 53

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 20, 26>
- <2, 8, 16>
- <4, 12, 5>
- <7, 15, 17>
- <9, 13, 25>
- <12, 11, 29>
- <13, 9, 14>
- <15, 16, 29>
- <17, 24, 28>
- <19, 18, 24>
- <20, 0, 27>
- <24, 19, 22>
- <25, 13, 20>
- <27, 8, 21>
