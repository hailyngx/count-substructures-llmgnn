Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 11) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 12) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 12) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, let's first identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {11}
- Node 2: {9, 13}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 14, 12}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 5: {9, 11, 4, 3, 10}
- Node 6: {7, 3, 12}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 8: {10, 11, 0, 12}
- Node 9: {5, 2, 14, 10, 13, 0}
- Node 10: {5, 9, 7, 8}
- Node 11: {5, 1, 8, 13, 12}
- Node 12: {8, 6, 11, 3, 13}
- Node 13: {9, 2, 11, 12}
- Node 14: {9, 4, 7, 3}

Now, let's find the number of unique 3-stars formed in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 66 \]

Therefore, there are 66 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
So, the final answer is [66].
