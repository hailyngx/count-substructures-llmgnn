Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 1) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 14) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 8, 11}
- Node 2: {7, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {7, 10, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {6, 13}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 11}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 4, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 12: {4, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node. 

- Node 0, Node 6, and Node 9 each have 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars for each of them is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 4, Node 7, Node 10, and Node 14 each have 6 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars for each of them is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 \times 3 + 4 \times 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [92].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 9, 13>, <4, 7, 10, 11>, <6, 7, 10, 14>.
