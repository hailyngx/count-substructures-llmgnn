Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 0) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (7, 15) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 1) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 17) (10, 15) (10, 12) (13, 17) (13, 0) (17, 19) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 18) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 18) (0, 16) (0, 13) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 8) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 17) (2, 9) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 18) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {16, 13, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 4, 18}
- Node 2: {5, 19, 17, 9}
- Node 3: {15}
- Node 4: {12, 9, 1}
- Node 5: {6, 19, 2, 1}
- Node 6: {11, 5, 1}
- Node 7: {15, 12}
- Node 8: {12, 0, 14, 18}
- Node 9: {4, 2}
- Node 10: {15, 12}
- Node 11: {16, 14, 6}
- Node 12: {7, 4, 10, 18, 8}
- Node 13: {17, 0}
- Node 14: {11, 8}
- Node 15: {3, 10, 7}
- Node 16: {11, 0}
- Node 17: {19, 13, 2, 18}
- Node 18: {12, 17, 1, 8}
- Node 19: {5, 17, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: {16, 13, 8} - Forms 1 3-star
- Node 1: {5, 6, 4, 18} - Forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: {5, 19, 17, 9} - Forms 1 3-star
- Node 4: {12, 9, 1} - Forms 1 3-star
- Node 5: {6, 19, 2, 1} - Forms 1 3-star
- Node 8: {12, 0, 14, 18} - Forms 1 3-star
- Node 12: {7, 4, 10, 18, 8} - Forms 1 3-star
- Node 17: {19, 13, 2, 18} - Forms 1 3-star

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [7].

So, the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (13, 8, 16)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (17, 18, 19)>
- <4, (1, 9, 12)>
- <5, (1, 2, 19)>
- <8, (0, 12, 14)>
- <12, (7, 8, 10)>
- <17, (2, 13, 18)>
