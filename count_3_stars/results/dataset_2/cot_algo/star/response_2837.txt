Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 16) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 14) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 13) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 7) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 12) (18, 10) (18, 4) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 19) (11, 5) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 16) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 16) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 0) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 16) (16, 6) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 16, 19}
- Node 1: {7, 13, 15}
- Node 2: {8, 10, 19}
- Node 3: {9, 13}
- Node 4: {5, 12, 18}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 11, 16}
- Node 6: {16, 17}
- Node 7: {1, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 8, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 12, 18}
- Node 11: {5}
- Node 12: {4, 10, 16}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 8, 15}
- Node 14: {8, 9, 17, 19}
- Node 15: {1, 13, 16}
- Node 16: {0, 5, 6, 12, 15}
- Node 17: {6, 14}
- Node 18: {4, 10}
- Node 19: {0, 2, 14}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 16, 19
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For nodes with 3 neighbors: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star per node
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars per node

Total number of 3-stars: \(6 \times 1 + 6 \times 4 = 30\)

Therefore, the final answer is: [30]

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, 16, 19>
- <1, 13, 15>
- <3, 9, 13>
- <4, 5, 16>
- <5, 7, 16>
- <8, 9, 14>
