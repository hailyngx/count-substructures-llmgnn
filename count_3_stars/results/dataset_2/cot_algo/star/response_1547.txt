Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (6, 9) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 5) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 11) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {10, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 3: {4, 11}
- Node 4: {0, 3}
- Node 5: {2, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 12}
- Node 7: {9, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 5}

Now, we can see that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: {0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 35 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 118

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [118].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 8, 12)>
- <2, (8, 9, 13)>
- <5, (2, 10, 14)>
- <7, (9, 10, 12)>
- <8, (0, 10, 14)>
- <9, (6, 10, 14)>
- <10, (1, 9, 13)>
- <12, (0, 7, 14)>
- <13, (2, 8, 14)>
- <14, (1, 9, 10)>
