Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
Node 0: 6, 2, 7, 9
Node 1: 6, 5, 7, 9, 4
Node 2: 6, 8, 3, 0
Node 3: 6, 5, 2
Node 4: 9, 5, 1
Node 5: 6, 4, 1, 3
Node 6: 0, 5, 1, 3, 2, 9
Node 7: 9, 8, 0, 1
Node 8: 2, 7
Node 9: 6, 4, 1, 0, 7

Now we check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:
Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 9 have 4 or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 56

Therefore, the final answer is [56], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
