Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 10) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 7) (8, 14) (8, 2) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 18) (10, 11) (10, 16) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 4) (19, 5) (19, 4) (15, 9) (15, 2) (0, 16) (0, 12) (7, 16) (7, 17) (7, 9) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 19) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {16, 12}
- Node 1: {6, 2}
- Node 2: {8, 18, 1, 3, 15}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {9, 13, 5, 19}
- Node 5: {11, 19, 12, 4}
- Node 6: {9, 1}
- Node 7: {16, 17, 9}
- Node 8: {14, 2}
- Node 9: {6, 18, 4, 15, 7}
- Node 10: {11, 16}
- Node 11: {16, 14, 5, 10}
- Node 12: {18, 5, 0}
- Node 13: {14, 4, 18}
- Node 14: {11, 17, 8, 13}
- Node 15: {9, 2}
- Node 16: {11, 10, 7, 0}
- Node 17: {14, 7}
- Node 18: {9, 13, 2, 12}
- Node 19: {5, 4}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, 14, 18

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up these results, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 41 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [41], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<2, (1, 3, 15)>, <4, (9, 13, 5)>, <5, (11, 19, 12)>, <9, (6, 18, 15)>, <11, (16, 14, 5)>, <12, (18, 5, 0)>, <14, (17, 8, 13)>, <18, (13, 2, 12)>
