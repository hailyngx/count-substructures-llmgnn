Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 10) (14, 17) (14, 16) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 1) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 18) (10, 15) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 9) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 11) (4, 12) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 1) (18, 13) (18, 12) (18, 4) (18, 9) (1, 17) (1, 4) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 16) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 9) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 16) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 17}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 10}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 15}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 12, 18}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 11}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 11, 16}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 6, 12}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 13, 16}
- Node 9: Neighbors {10, 16, 18}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 9, 14, 15, 17}
- Node 11: Neighbors {5, 6, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 11, 18}
- Node 13: Neighbors {8, 18}
- Node 14: Neighbors {10, 16, 17}
- Node 15: Neighbors {3, 10}
- Node 16: Neighbors {6, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 17: Neighbors {1, 10, 14}
- Node 18: Neighbors {4, 9, 12, 13}

Now, let's count the 3-stars:
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are:
