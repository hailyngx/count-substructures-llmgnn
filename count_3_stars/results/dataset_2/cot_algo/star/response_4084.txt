Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 16) (22, 21) (22, 8) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 8) (6, 24) (6, 26) (6, 20) (9, 3) (9, 0) (5, 13) (5, 25) (5, 4) (8, 22) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 1) (27, 24) (27, 11) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 7) (1, 15) (1, 8) (1, 26) (1, 4) (26, 6) (26, 1) (26, 10) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 25) (19, 29) (19, 21) (19, 24) (19, 23) (11, 27) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 0) (28, 11) (28, 0) (28, 7) (17, 2) (17, 25) (17, 16) (20, 6) (20, 10) (20, 16) (23, 19) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 16) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 28) (7, 16) (16, 13) (16, 17) (16, 20) (16, 23) (16, 7) (25, 5) (25, 4) (25, 17) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 19) (24, 21) (10, 26) (10, 20) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 23) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 28) (29, 19) (29, 21) (21, 22) (21, 19) (21, 24) (21, 29) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges for each node:
- Node 0: (0, 9), (0, 11), (0, 28)
- Node 1: (1, 15), (1, 8), (1, 26), (1, 4)
- Node 2: (2, 14), (2, 17), (2, 7)
- Node 3: (3, 15), (3, 14), (3, 9)
- Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 25)
- Node 5: (5, 13), (5, 25), (5, 4)
- Node 6: (6, 24), (6, 26), (6, 20)
- Node 7: (7, 15), (7, 2), (7, 28), (7, 16)
- Node 8: (8, 22), (8, 15), (8, 4), (8, 1)
- Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 0)
- Node 10: (10, 26), (10, 20)
- Node 11: (11, 27), (11, 28), (11, 23), (11, 0)
- Node 13: (13, 5), (13, 16)
- Node 14: (14, 3), (14, 2), (14, 23)
- Node 15: (15, 3), (15, 1), (15, 7), (15, 8)
- Node 16: (16, 13), (16, 17), (16, 20), (16, 23), (16, 7)
- Node 17: (17, 2), (17, 25), (17, 16)
- Node 19: (19, 29), (19, 21), (19, 24), (19, 23)
- Node 20: (20, 6), (20, 10), (20, 16)
- Node 21: (21, 22), (21, 19), (21, 24), (21, 29)
- Node 22: (22, 21), (22, 8)
- Node 23: (23, 19), (23, 11), (23, 14), (23, 16)
- Node 24: (24, 6), (24, 27), (24, 19), (24, 21)
- Node 25: (25, 5), (25, 4), (25, 17)
- Node 26: (26, 6), (26, 1), (26, 10)
- Node 27: (27, 24), (27, 11)
- Node 28: (28, 11), (28, 0), (28, 7)
- Node 29: (29, 19), (29, 21)

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Total number of 3-stars = [13]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (4, 8, 15)>, <1, (4, 15, 1)>, <1, (4, 15, 8)>, <1, (8, 15, 1)>, <2, (7, 17, 2)>, <3, (9, 14, 3)>, <4, (1, 8, 15)>, <4, (1, 15, 8)>, <4, (8, 15, 1)>, <7, (16, 17, 2)>, <15, (1, 8, 4)>, <15, (1, 4, 8)>, <15, (4, 8, 1)>, <16, (7, 17, 25)>, <21, (19, 24, 29)>, <23, (14, 16, 19)>, <23, (16, 19, 14)>, <24, (19, 21, 29)>, <25, (4, 17, 5)>, <25, (4, 5, 17)>, <25, (5, 17, 4)>
