Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 29) (5, 7) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 6) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 12) (0, 20) (0, 10) (0, 13) (20, 0) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 7) (18, 8) (6, 22) (6, 2) (6, 28) (6, 14) (28, 6) (28, 27) (19, 26) (26, 23) (26, 19) (26, 17) (26, 3) (3, 2) (3, 26) (3, 21) (21, 3) (21, 17) (21, 14) (8, 9) (8, 18) (8, 24) (8, 10) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 27) (10, 1) (4, 22) (4, 16) (4, 25) (4, 11) (12, 23) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 7) (7, 5) (7, 18) (7, 16) (17, 26) (17, 21) (29, 5) (29, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (11, 4) (11, 29) (11, 1) (11, 13) (15, 24) (14, 6) (14, 21) (14, 25) (24, 8) (24, 15) (24, 25) (25, 5) (25, 4) (25, 14) (25, 24) (27, 5) (27, 28) (27, 10) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {20, 10, 13}
- Node 1: {2, 10, 11}
- Node 2: {18, 1, 6, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 26, 21}
- Node 4: {22, 16, 25, 11}
- Node 5: {9, 25, 29, 7, 27}
- Node 6: {22, 2, 28, 14}
- Node 7: {5, 18, 16}
- Node 8: {9, 18, 24, 10}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 8, 27, 1}
- Node 11: {4, 29, 1, 13}
- Node 12: {23, 16}
- Node 13: {0, 9, 11}
- Node 14: {6, 21, 25}
- Node 15: {24}
- Node 16: {4, 12, 7}
- Node 17: {26, 21}
- Node 18: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 19: {26}
- Node 20: {0}
- Node 21: {3, 17, 14}
- Node 22: {23, 4, 6}
- Node 23: {22, 26, 12}
- Node 24: {8, 15, 25}
- Node 25: {5, 4, 14, 24}
- Node 26: {23, 3, 17, 19}
- Node 27: {5, 28, 10}
- Node 28: {6, 27}
- Node 29: {5, 11}

Now, we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 29}
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with neighbors {24, 14}
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with neighbors {23, 17}

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars is 4, and the final result inside brackets is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, (9, 29)>
- <9, (5, 8)>
- <25, (24, 14)>
- <26, (23, 17)>
