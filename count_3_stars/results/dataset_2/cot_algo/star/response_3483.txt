Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 11) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 8, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 12}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 10}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 5, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 3, 4, 11}

Now, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 11, Node 14 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exact 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exact 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exact 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 59 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [59].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (3, 11, 14)>, <1, (2, 4, 13)>, <2, (0, 11, 14)>, <3, (0, 1, 14)>, <4, (1, 9, 11)>, <5, (6, 7, 12)>, <6, (5, 9, 10)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (3, 9, 10)>, <9, (4, 8, 10)>, <11, (0, 4, 14)>, <14, (2, 4, 11)>
