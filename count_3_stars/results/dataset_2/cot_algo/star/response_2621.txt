Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 6}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
For node 2 and node 5, we can form \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
So, the total number of 3-stars is 20, which we represent as [20].

And the unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 9, 1)>
<2, (5, 7, 1)>
<2, (5, 7, 3)>
<2, (5, 8, 4)>
<2, (7, 1, 3)>
<2, (7, 3, 5)>
<2, (7, 5, 1)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 0, 7)>
<5, (2, 8, 4)>
<5, (3, 1, 9)>
<5, (3, 5, 1)>
<5, (4, 8, 2)>
<5, (5, 1, 3)>
<5, (7, 1, 3)>
<5, (7, 5, 3)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
