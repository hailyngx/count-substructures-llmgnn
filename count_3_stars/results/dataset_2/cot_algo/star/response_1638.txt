Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 1) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 18) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 2) (10, 15) (10, 16) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 15) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 17) (3, 14) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 16) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (19, 17) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 18) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 17, 18}
- Node 1: {0, 11, 13, 18}
- Node 2: {3, 11, 12, 15}
- Node 3: {2, 12, 14, 17}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {6, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 7}
- Node 10: {15, 16}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 13: {1, 5}
- Node 14: {3, 4, 16}
- Node 15: {2, 10, 18}
- Node 16: {10, 14, 17}
- Node 17: {0, 3, 16, 19}
- Node 18: {0, 1, 15}
- Node 19: {17}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

For nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0, 16, and 19: They each form 1 3-star. So, 3 3-stars are formed in total.

For nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 11: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 15: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 18: inom{5}{3} = 10

Summing these up, we get a total of 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 39.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 1, 13>
- <0, 1, 18>
- <0, 17, 19>
- <1, 11, 2>
- <1, 11, 5>
- <1, 18, 15>
- <2, 12, 3>
- <2, 12, 4>
- <2, 12, 11>
- <3, 14, 4>
- <4, 12, 3>
- <4, 12, 14>
- <4, 14, 16>
- <5, 11, 13>
- <6, 4, 12>
- <6, 4, 14>
- <6, 7, 9>
- <15, 10, 16>
- <16, 10, 15>
- <16, 14, 4>
- <16, 14, 3>
- <16, 17, 3>
