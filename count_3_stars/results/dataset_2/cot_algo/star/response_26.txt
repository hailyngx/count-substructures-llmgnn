Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 14) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 12) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (2, 7) (2, 4) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 0) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, we can determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 7, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7, 9, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 9, 10}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 12, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 5, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 8, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {5, 8, 10, 13}

Next, we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 5: Forms a 3-star with nodes {7, 13, 14} <5, (7, 13, 14)>
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with nodes {4, 6, 7} <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 13: Forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 12, 14} <13, (1, 12, 14)>, and a 3-star with nodes {5, 11, 14} <13, (5, 11, 14)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
