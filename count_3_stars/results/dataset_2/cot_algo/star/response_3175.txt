Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 12) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 14) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 8) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 2) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 10) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 6) (1, 8) (1, 19) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 1) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 10) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 12) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

1. Node 0: {2, 3, 15}
2. Node 1: {8, 9, 19}
3. Node 2: {0, 8, 9}
4. Node 3: {0, 5, 7, 15, 19}
5. Node 4: {6, 10, 12}
6. Node 5: {3, 12, 17}
7. Node 6: {4, 7, 10}
8. Node 7: {3, 6, 13, 15}
9. Node 8: {1, 2, 17}
10. Node 9: {1, 2, 10}
11. Node 10: {4, 6, 9, 12, 14}
12. Node 11: {13, 16}
13. Node 12: {4, 5, 10, 16}
14. Node 13: {7, 11}
15. Node 14: {10, 15, 17}
16. Node 15: {0, 3, 7, 14}
17. Node 16: {11, 12}
18. Node 17: {5, 8, 14, 19}
19. Node 18: {19}
20. Node 19: {1, 3, 17, 18}

We can see that nodes 3, 10, and 12 each have 5 or more neighbors, which means they can form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30\]

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [30], and the unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<10, (4, 6, 12)>
<12, (4, 5, 10)>
