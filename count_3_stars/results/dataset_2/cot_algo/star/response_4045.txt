Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 5) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 11) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 5) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 7, 14
- Node 1: 0, 8, 12, 13
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 10
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7, 9, 11, 14
- Node 5: 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 14
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6, 10
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 3, 4, 11
- Node 10: 2, 7, 14
- Node 11: 4, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14
- Node 12: 1, 5, 11
- Node 13: 1, 11, 14
- Node 14: 0, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 13

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, Node 11, and Node 14 have 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 and Node 3 have 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Total 3-stars:
- \( 6 \times 10 = 60 \) 3-stars for nodes with 5 neighbors.
- \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) 3-stars for nodes with 4 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars: 60 + 8 = 68 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [68].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 4, 14)>
- <4, (0, 7, 14)>
- <5, (2, 7, 14)>
- <7, (4, 5, 10)>
- <11, (9, 12, 14)>
