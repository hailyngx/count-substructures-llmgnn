Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 12) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 5) (11, 2) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 2) (3, 12) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: 6, 9, 12, 10
2: 7, 12, 1, 13, 14, 11
3: 12, 5
4: 5, 14
5: 4, 7, 8, 10, 3
6: 9, 1, 14, 8
7: 0, 2, 5, 13
8: 6, 9, 0, 5, 12
9: 6, 8, 14, 1, 0
10: 0, 1, 5
11: 2
12: 8, 2, 13, 1, 3
13: 12, 7, 1, 2
14: 4, 6, 9, 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
1: 4 choose 3 = 4
2: 6 choose 3 = 20
5: 4 choose 3 = 4
8: 5 choose 3 = 10
12: 5 choose 3 = 10
13: 4 choose 3 = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (6, 9, 12)>
<2, (7, 12, 1)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (6, 9, 1)>
<12, (8, 2, 13)>
<13, (12, 7, 1)>
