Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 8, 7, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 2, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 1, 7, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 9, 1, 7, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 3, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 2, 8, 3, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 6, 3, 0, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9, 1, 4, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 9, 8, 3, 0}

Now, we will look for 3-star configurations:

- Node 0:  inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3:  inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5:  inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7:  inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8:  inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9:  inom{5}{3} = 10

Calculating the total: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (9, 8, 7)>
- <3, (5, 1, 7)>
- <5, (9, 8, 3)>
- <7, (2, 6, 0)>
- <8, (9, 1, 4)>
- <9, (5, 8, 3)>
