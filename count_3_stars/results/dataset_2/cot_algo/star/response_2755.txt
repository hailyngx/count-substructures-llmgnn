- Node 28: {0, 3, 6, 20}
- Node 29: {4, 9, 16}

The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are:
- Node 3 (4 neighbors)
- Node 4 (4 neighbors)
- Node 6 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 10 (5 neighbors)
- Node 11 (3 neighbors)
- Node 12 (3 neighbors)
- Node 13 (3 neighbors)
- Node 14 (4 neighbors)
- Node 15 (4 neighbors)
- Node 17 (4 neighbors)
- Node 19 (3 neighbors)
- Node 21 (5 neighbors)
- Node 24 (4 neighbors)
- Node 25 (4 neighbors)
- Node 28 (4 neighbors)
- Node 29 (3 neighbors)

Calculating the total number of unique 3-stars:
\[ \text{Number of unique 3-stars} = \left[\binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \right] = \left[35\right] \]

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is 35. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, 8, 25>
- <4, 8, 25>
- <6, 10, 24>
- <7, 11, 14>
