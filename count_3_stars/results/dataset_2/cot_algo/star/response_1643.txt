Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 3) (27, 7) (3, 27) (3, 24) (3, 10) (7, 27) (7, 17) (12, 15) (6, 21) (6, 17) (6, 29) (6, 19) (21, 6) (21, 13) (21, 2) (4, 27) (4, 28) (4, 20) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 1) (9, 13) (14, 26) (14, 11) (14, 20) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 0) (26, 17) (1, 9) (1, 22) (2, 21) (2, 26) (16, 22) (16, 5) (16, 20) (28, 4) (28, 13) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 13) (29, 6) (29, 18) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 26) (17, 19) (5, 16) (5, 23) (5, 25) (5, 22) (23, 5) (23, 0) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 17) (13, 21) (13, 9) (13, 28) (13, 11) (24, 3) (24, 18) (24, 25) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 24) (25, 0) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 22) (18, 29) (18, 24) (18, 10) (22, 1) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 20) (0, 26) (0, 23) (0, 25) (20, 4) (20, 14) (20, 16) (20, 22) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {26, 23, 25}
- Node 1: {9, 22}
- Node 2: {21, 26}
- Node 3: {27, 24, 10}
- Node 4: {27, 28, 20}
- Node 5: {16, 23, 25, 22}
- Node 6: {21, 17, 29, 19}
- Node 7: {27, 17}
- Node 8: {9}
- Node 9: {8, 1, 13, 25}
- Node 10: {3, 18, 22}
- Node 11: {14, 19, 13}
- Node 12: {15}
- Node 13: {21, 9, 28, 11}
- Node 14: {26, 11, 20}
- Node 15: {27, 12}
- Node 16: {22, 20, 5}
- Node 17: {7, 6, 26, 19}
- Node 18: {10, 24, 29}
- Node 19: {6, 11, 17}
- Node 20: {4, 14, 16, 22}
- Node 21: {6, 13, 2}
- Node 22: {1, 5, 10, 20}
- Node 23: {5, 0}
- Node 24: {3, 18, 25}
- Node 25: {9, 5, 24, 0}
- Node 26: {14, 2, 0, 17}
- Node 27: {15, 3, 7, 4}
- Node 28: {4, 13}
- Node 29: {6, 18}

Now, let's identify which nodes form 3-stars and count how many 3-stars are formed:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (27, 24, 10)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (27, 28, 20)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (16, 23, 25)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (21, 17, 29)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (8, 1, 13)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (3, 18, 22)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (14, 19, 13)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (21, 9, 28)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star: <17, (7, 6, 26)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star: <18, (10, 24, 29)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star: <19, (6, 11, 17)>
- Node 20 forms a 3-star: <20, (4, 14, 16)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star: <22, (1, 5, 10)>
- Node 25 forms a 3-star: <25, (9, 5, 24)>
- Node 26 forms a 3-star: <26, (14, 2, 17)>
- Node 27 forms a 3-star: <27, (15, 3, 7)>
- Node 28 forms a 3-star: <28, (4, 13)>
- Node 29 forms a 3-star: <29, (6, 18)>
- Total number of 3-stars: 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
