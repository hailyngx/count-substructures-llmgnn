Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 14) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 0) (15, 1) (15, 17) (15, 12) (8, 0) (8, 3) (19, 11) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 9) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 18) (16, 13) (16, 1) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 17) (17, 15) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 7) (11, 19) (11, 6) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 9) (7, 2) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 2) (18, 10) (9, 0) (9, 17) (9, 7) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (6, 12) (6, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 8, 10, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 14, 15, 16}
- Node 2: {7, 4, 14, 13}
- Node 3: {8, 10, 17}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 12}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {11, 12}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 9, 17}
- Node 8: {0, 3}
- Node 9: {0, 7, 17}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 18, 5}
- Node 11: {6, 19}
- Node 12: {4, 6, 15}
- Node 13: {2, 5, 14, 16}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 13}
- Node 15: {1, 12, 17}
- Node 16: {13, 1}
- Node 17: {3, 7, 9, 15}
- Node 18: {10}
- Node 19: {11}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 17 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding them up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [29].
