Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 28) (9, 13) (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 29) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 11) (27, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 20) (11, 27) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 24) (11, 29) (20, 10) (20, 18) (20, 5) (25, 23) (25, 4) (25, 28) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 18) (22, 6) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 2) (24, 29) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 4) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 1) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 17) (2, 12) (2, 24) (2, 6) (1, 0) (1, 19) (6, 22) (6, 2) (6, 4) (16, 0) (16, 21) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 19) (23, 25) (23, 29) (21, 15) (21, 16) (21, 4) (13, 9) (13, 16) (17, 7) (17, 28) (17, 19) (28, 9) (28, 25) (28, 17) (14, 19) (18, 20) (18, 12) (18, 16) (5, 20) (5, 4) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 17) (19, 14) (8, 27) (29, 15) (29, 11) (29, 24) (29, 23) (4, 25) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 21) (4, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {1, 7, 15, 16}
Node 1: {0, 19}
Node 2: {6, 12, 24}
Node 3: {4, 10, 11}
Node 4: {3, 5, 6, 21, 25}
Node 5: {4, 20}
Node 6: {2, 4, 22}
Node 7: {0, 17, 19}
Node 8: {27}
Node 9: {13, 28}
Node 10: {3, 11, 20}
Node 11: {3, 10, 24, 27, 29}
Node 12: {2, 18, 27}
Node 13: {9, 16}
Node 14: {19}
Node 15: {0, 16, 21, 27, 29}
Node 16: {0, 13, 15, 18, 19}
Node 17: {7, 19, 28}
Node 18: {16, 20, 12}
Node 19: {1, 7, 14, 16, 17}
Node 20: {5, 10, 18}
Node 21: {4, 15, 16}
Node 22: {6}
Node 23: {25, 29}
Node 24: {2, 4, 11, 29, 27}
Node 25: {4, 23, 28}
Node 27: {8, 11, 12, 15, 24}
Node 28: {9, 17, 25}
Node 29: {11, 15, 23, 24}

Now we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 11, 15, 16, 19, 24, 27, 28, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 0 3-stars
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star
- Node 24: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 1 3-star
- Node 28: 0 3-stars
- Node 29: 0 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 7, 15>
<4, 3, 5, 21>
<11, 10, 24, 27>
<15, 0, 16, 21>
<16, 0, 13, 15>
<19, 1, 7, 17>
<24, 2, 4, 29>
<27, 8, 11, 15>
