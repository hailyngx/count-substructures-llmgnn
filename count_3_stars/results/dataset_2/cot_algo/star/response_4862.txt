Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {6, 9, 8, 2, 5}
- Node 1: {6, 2, 9}
- Node 2: {7, 1, 3, 5, 0}
- Node 3: {7, 9, 2}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 9, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 2, 0}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 6, 0}
- Node 9: {4, 1, 3, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
Node 0 and Node 2 can form a 3-star as they have 5 neighbors each.
Node 4, Node 7, and Node 9 can form a 3-star as they have 5 neighbors each.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 2: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 4: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 7: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 9: inom(5, 3) = 10

Total 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50

So, the total number of 3-stars is [50].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 2, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 8, 9>
<9, 1, 3, 4>
<7, 5, 2, 4>
<0, 6, 1, 8>
