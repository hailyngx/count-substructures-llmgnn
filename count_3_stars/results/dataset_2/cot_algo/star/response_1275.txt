Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 19) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 17) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 12) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 8) (2, 5) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 15) (8, 3) (8, 17) (8, 16) (0, 17) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 10) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 5) (19, 9) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 15) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 5) (15, 9) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 5) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 11) (5, 15) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 17, 5
- Node 1: 11, 4, 12, 19
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 8, 17
- Node 4: 1, 7, 9, 14, 16
- Node 5: 0, 2, 11, 15, 16
- Node 6: 12, 13
- Node 7: 4, 12
- Node 8: 3, 16, 17
- Node 9: 4, 11, 15, 19
- Node 10: 14, 17, 19
- Node 11: 1, 5, 9
- Node 12: 1, 6, 7, 15, 17
- Node 13: 6
- Node 14: 4, 10
- Node 15: 5, 9, 12, 19
- Node 16: 4, 5, 8
- Node 17: 0, 3, 10, 12
- Node 19: 1, 9, 10, 15

Now, we can see which nodes can form a 3-star:
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 10: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 11: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 12: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 19: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the final answer is [52] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 4, 12>, <1, 4, 15>, <1, 4, 19>, <1, 12, 15>, <1, 12, 17>, <1, 15, 19>, <4, 5, 16>, <4, 5, 11>, <4, 5, 15>, <4, 9, 15>, <5, 11, 15>, <10, 14, 17>, <11, 9, 15>, <12, 15, 19>, <17, 10, 14>, <19, 9, 15>
