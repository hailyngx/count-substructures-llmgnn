Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 11) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 10) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 11}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 3: {7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 7, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 8: {3, 7, 13}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 10: {2, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 12: {2, 5, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {8, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13}

Next, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 8, 10
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 1, 9
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: 2, 4, 13
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 11
- Nodes with 7 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 12, 14

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: [0, 3, 8, 10] -> \( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{1}{3} = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 \)
Nodes with 4 neighbors: [1, 9] -> \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 4 + 1 = 5 \)
Nodes with 5 neighbors: [11] -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Nodes with 6 neighbors: [2, 4, 13] -> \( \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 20 + 10 + 1 = 31 \)
Nodes with 7 neighbors: [5, 6, 7, 12, 14] -> \( \binom{7}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} = 35 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 105 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 5 + 10 + 31 + 105 = 152

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [152].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 1, 4, 7>
- <3, 7, 8, 13>
- <10, 2, 14, 4>
- <11, 1, 2, 6>
- <5, 9, 6>
