Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 29) (22, 5) (22, 0) (22, 20) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 29) (3, 25) (3, 18) (25, 3) (0, 22) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (20, 22) (20, 29) (20, 1) (20, 23) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 19) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 27) (28, 23) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 17) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (1, 6) (1, 20) (1, 26) (1, 16) (26, 28) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 21) (5, 13) (5, 22) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 16) (24, 18) (29, 13) (29, 9) (29, 20) (29, 27) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 10) (18, 3) (18, 24) (18, 10) (18, 17) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 18) (10, 2) (11, 0) (11, 24) (11, 14) (14, 11) (17, 6) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 18) (16, 1) (16, 24) (16, 15) (21, 13) (21, 26) (27, 28) (27, 29) (2, 7) (2, 19) (2, 10) (15, 16) (23, 20) (23, 28) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 10, 11, 12, 20, 22}
- Node 1: {6, 16, 20, 26}
- Node 2: {7, 10, 19}
- Node 3: {18, 25}
- Node 4: {8, 12, 17}
- Node 5: {13, 22}
- Node 6: {1, 9, 17, 28}
- Node 7: {2, 12, 17}
- Node 8: {4, 19}
- Node 9: {6, 13, 29}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 18, 19}
- Node 11: {0, 14, 24}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 7, 10}
- Node 13: {5, 21, 29}
- Node 14: {11}
- Node 15: {16}
- Node 16: {1, 15, 24}
- Node 17: {4, 6, 7, 18}
- Node 18: {3, 10, 17, 24}
- Node 19: {2, 8, 10}
- Node 20: {0, 1, 22, 23, 29}
- Node 21: {13, 26}
- Node 22: {0, 5, 20}
- Node 23: {20, 28}
- Node 24: {11, 16, 18, 26}
- Node 25: {3}
- Node 26: {1, 21, 24, 28}
- Node 27: {28, 29}
- Node 28: {6, 23, 26, 27}
- Node 29: {9, 13, 20, 27}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: [inom{6}{3} = 20]
- Node 1: <1, (16, 24, 26)>
- Node 2: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: <4, (12, 17, 18)>
- Node 5: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 7: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3} = 1]
- Node 10: <10, (18, 19, 20)>
- Node 11: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 12: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 13: [inom{3}{3} = 1]
- Node 14: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 15: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 16: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 17: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 18: <18, (10, 17, 24)>
- Node 19: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 20: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 21: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 22: [inom{3}{3} = 1]
- Node 23: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 24: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 25: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 26: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 27: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 28: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 29: [inom{4}{3} = 4]

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30]. The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (10, 11, 12)>
- <1, (16, 24, 26)>
- <4, (12, 17, 18)>
- <9, (13, 29, 6)>
- <10, (18, 19, 20)>
- <18, (10, 17, 24)>
- <22, (0, 5, 20)>
- <29, (9, 13, 20)>
