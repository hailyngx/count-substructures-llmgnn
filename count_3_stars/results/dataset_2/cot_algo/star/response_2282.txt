Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 20) (15, 8) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 28) (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (6, 16) (10, 0) (10, 23) (10, 28) (22, 7) (23, 10) (23, 26) (23, 1) (23, 27) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 13) (27, 23) (27, 12) (27, 16) (27, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 25) (18, 26) (18, 16) (18, 29) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 19) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 14) (21, 7) (21, 26) (26, 23) (26, 18) (26, 21) (26, 17) (29, 9) (29, 18) (29, 19) (29, 0) (8, 15) (8, 27) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 2) (19, 20) (19, 29) (19, 8) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 29) (0, 13) (17, 3) (17, 26) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 24) (1, 9) (1, 23) (1, 20) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 4) (24, 7) (24, 13) (28, 5) (28, 10) (28, 25) (25, 2) (25, 28) (16, 6) (16, 27) (16, 18) 

Response:
The nodes that form 3-stars in this graph are: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. 

By exploring the neighbor set for each node, we find that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for these nodes, we get the following 3-stars:
- <2, (3, 4, 19)>
- <4, (2, 3, 12)>
- <6, (0, 9, 16)>
- <8, (14, 15, 19)>
- <9, (1, 6, 29)>
- <10, (0, 23, 28)>
- <12, (4, 13, 27)>
- <13, (0, 12, 24)>
- <15, (5, 8, 20)>
- <16, (6, 18, 27)>
- <17, (3, 26, 28)>
- <18, (16, 26, 29)>
- <19, (2, 20, 29)>
- <20, (15, 19, 1)>
- <21, (7, 26, 1)>
- <23, (1, 10, 27)>
- <24, (7, 13, 15)>
- <26, (17, 21, 28)>
- <27, (12, 16, 23)>
- <28, (10, 17, 25)>
- <29, (9, 18, 19)>

There are 21 unique 3-stars formed in the graph, so the total number of 3-stars is [21].
