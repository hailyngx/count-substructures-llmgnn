Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 9) (4, 3) (4, 12) (8, 3) (8, 17) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 7) (18, 17) (18, 13) (1, 15) (1, 2) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 19) (10, 5) (13, 18) (13, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 0) (0, 17) (0, 19) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 19) (6, 14) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 18) (7, 14) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 15) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 12) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 12) 

Response:
Given the provided graph, let's first list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {17, 19}
- Node 1: {2, 15}
- Node 2: {1, 10, 11, 17, 18}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 8, 9, 15}
- Node 4: {3, 12}
- Node 5: {3, 10, 12}
- Node 6: {14}
- Node 7: {14, 18}
- Node 8: {3, 17}
- Node 9: {3, 11, 15}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 15, 19}
- Node 11: {2, 9, 16}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 19}
- Node 13: {18, 12}
- Node 14: {6, 7}
- Node 15: {1, 3, 9, 10, 16}
- Node 16: {11, 15}
- Node 17: {0, 2, 8, 18}
- Node 18: {2, 7, 13, 17}
- Node 19: {0, 10, 12}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with them:

- Node 2, 3-stars: 1
- Node 3, 3-stars: 1
- Node 5, 3-stars: 1
- Node 9, 3-stars: 1
- Node 10, 3-stars: 1
- Node 15, 3-stars: 1
- Node 18, 3-stars: 1
- Node 19, 3-stars: 1

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

Hence, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 10, 15)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <5, (3, 10, 12)>, <9, (3, 11, 15)>, <10, (2, 5, 15)>, <15, (1, 3, 9)>, <18, (2, 7, 13)>, <19, (0, 10, 12)>.
