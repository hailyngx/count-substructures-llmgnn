Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 10) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (6, 17) (6, 7) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 18) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (10, 16) (10, 8) (17, 6) (17, 15) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 15) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 2) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 15) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 14) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 15) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

After exploring all the neighbor nodes, we find the nodes' neighbors:

Node 0: {1, 3, 12, 14, 18}
Node 1: {0, 19}
Node 2: {7, 14, 15}
Node 3: {0, 18}
Node 4: {7, 13}
Node 5: {8, 9, 12, 19}
Node 6: {7, 17}
Node 7: {2, 4, 6, 11}
Node 8: {5, 9, 10}
Node 9: {5, 8, 18}
Node 10: {8, 16}
Node 11: {7, 16}
Node 12: {0, 5, 14}
Node 13: {4, 14, 15}
Node 14: {0, 2, 12, 13}
Node 15: {2, 13, 17, 18}
Node 16: {10, 11, 19}
Node 17: {6, 15}
Node 18: {0, 3, 9, 15}
Node 19: {1, 5, 16}

Now, we apply the combinatorial calculation to nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 31, so we put this number inside brackets []: [31].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 18>
<0, 1, 12>
<0, 1, 14>
<0, 3, 18>
<0, 12, 14>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 10>
<5, 9, 18>
<5, 12, 14>
<7, 4, 13>
<7, 6, 17>
<8, 9, 18>
<14, 13, 15>
<15, 17, 18>
<15, 13, 14>
<17, 15, 18>
<17, 15, 13>
<17, 15, 2>
<17, 18, 15>
<18, 15, 13>
<18, 15, 2>
<18, 15, 17>
<18, 15, 0>
<18, 15, 14>
<18, 15, 13>
<18, 15, 2>

<18, 15, 14>
<18, 15, 13>
