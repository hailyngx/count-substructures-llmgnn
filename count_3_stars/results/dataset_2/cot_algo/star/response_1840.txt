Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 2) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 19) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 12) (10, 11) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (1, 18) (1, 2) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 7) (0, 16) (0, 13) (0, 5) (6, 17) (6, 12) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 19) (9, 15) (9, 17) (19, 16) (19, 2) (19, 14) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 6) (14, 5) (14, 19) (7, 13) (7, 18) (7, 17) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 13, 16}
- Node 1: {2, 18}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 11, 19}
- Node 3: {4, 12}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 18}
- Node 5: {0, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {12, 17}
- Node 7: {13, 17, 18}
- Node 8: {5, 13, 16}
- Node 9: {15, 17}
- Node 10: {11}
- Node 11: {2, 5, 10, 18}
- Node 12: {3, 6, 15, 17}
- Node 13: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 14: {5, 19}
- Node 15: {9, 12, 16}
- Node 16: {0, 8, 15, 19}
- Node 17: {6, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 18: {1, 4, 7, 11}
- Node 19: {2, 14, 16}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: [0 3-stars]
- Node 2: [1 3-star]
- Node 4: [0 3-stars]
- Node 5: [1 3-star]
- Node 8: [1 3-star]
- Node 12: [1 3-star]
- Node 13: [0 3-stars]
- Node 15: [1 3-star]
- Node 16: [1 3-star]
- Node 17: [0 3-stars]
- Node 18: [0 3-stars]
- Node 19: [0 3-stars]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (1, 4, 19)>
- <5, (0, 8, 14)>
- <8, (0, 5, 16)>
- <12, (3, 6, 15)>
- <15, (9, 12, 16)>
