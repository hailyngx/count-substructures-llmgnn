Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 0) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 5) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 7, 12}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 10}
- Node 10: {1, 9}
- Node 11: {2, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 8, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 6, 7}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 13 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
  - Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 10>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 10>, <1, 6, 13>, <1, 8, 10>, <1, 8, 13>, <1, 10, 13>
  - Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <4, 1, 6>
  - Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <6, 1, 4>, <6, 1, 8>, <6, 1, 13>, <6, 4, 8>
  - Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
    - <7, 2, 4>, <7, 2, 5>, <7, 2, 11>, <7, 2, 14>, <7, 4, 5>, <7, 4, 11>, <7, 4, 12>, <7, 4, 14>, <7, 5, 11>, <7, 5, 12>, <7, 5, 14>, <7, 11, 12>, <7, 11, 14>, <7, 12, 14>, <7, 2, 14>, <7, 2, 11>, <7, 2, 5>, <7, 11, 12>, <7, 11, 14>, <7, 12, 14>
  - Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <13, 1, 8>, <13, 1, 12>, <13, 1, 0>, <13, 8, 12>

Adding up the 3-stars from each node: 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the given graph is [39].
