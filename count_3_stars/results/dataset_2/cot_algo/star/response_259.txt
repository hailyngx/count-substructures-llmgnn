The edges are as follows: (0, 24) (0, 1) (0, 23) (27, 25) (27, 11) (22, 23) (22, 14) (23, 0) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 29) (23, 13) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 1) (2, 18) (2, 26) (2, 13) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 12) (14, 22) (14, 26) (4, 10) (4, 3) (16, 8) (16, 24) (16, 20) (16, 5) (28, 9) (28, 12) (28, 15) (26, 2) (26, 18) (26, 14) (26, 5) (26, 15) (13, 23) (13, 2) (13, 17) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 21) (17, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 19) (21, 17) (21, 11) (25, 27) (25, 29) (12, 18) (12, 28) (5, 8) (5, 16) (5, 26) (5, 11) (6, 3) (24, 0) (24, 16) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 29) (1, 10) (29, 23) (29, 25) (29, 1) (29, 11) (15, 28) (15, 26) (15, 17) (15, 7) (19, 3) (19, 7) (9, 28) (9, 3) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 19) (20, 16) (10, 4) (10, 1) (11, 27) (11, 21) (11, 5) (11, 29) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 24, 1, 23
- Node 1: 0, 8, 29, 10
- Node 2: 18, 26, 13, 17
- Node 3: 4, 6, 9, 19
- Node 4: 10, 3
- Node 5: 8, 16, 26, 11
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 17, 15, 19
- Node 8: 23, 5, 16, 1
- Node 9: 28, 3
- Node 10: 4, 1
- Node 11: 27, 21, 5, 29
- Node 12: 18, 28
- Node 13: 23, 2, 17
- Node 14: 22, 26
- Node 15: 28, 26, 17, 7
- Node 16: 8, 5, 24, 20
- Node 17: 2, 13, 15, 21, 7
- Node 18: 2, 26, 12
- Node 19: 3, 7
- Node 20: 16
- Node 21: 17, 11
- Node 22: 23, 14
- Node 23: 0, 22, 8, 29, 13
- Node 24: 0, 16
- Node 25: 27, 29
- Node 26: 2, 18, 14, 5, 15
- Node 27: 25, 11
- Node 28: 9, 12, 15
- Node 29: 23, 25, 1, 11

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23, 26, 28, 29

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars. 

There are 16 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 58

Therefore, the final answer is [58]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, 1, 23>, <1, 0, 8>, <1, 0, 29>, <1, 10, 4>, <2, 18, 26>, <2, 18, 12>, <2, 26, 15>, <2, 13, 17>, <3, 4, 10>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 19>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 9, 28>, <5, 8, 16>, <5, 8, 26>, <5, 8, 11>, <5, 16, 24>, <5, 16, 20>, <5, 26, 15>, <5, 26, 15>, <7, 15, ...
