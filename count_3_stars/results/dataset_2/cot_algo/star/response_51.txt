Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 10) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 11) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 13) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 3) (3, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 5) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 5, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {1, 8, 10}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 6, 11}
- Node 6: {5, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {8, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {11, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {4, 7, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 6, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 9, 10}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0:  \(0\) 3-stars
- Node 2:  \(0\) 3-stars
- Node 5:  \(0\) 3-stars
- Node 11:  \(0\) 3-stars
- Node 12:  \(1\) 3-star  <12, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 14:  \(0\) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1, so the final answer is [1].
