Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {9, 7, 2}
Node 1: {9, 4, 6, 2}
Node 2: {6, 8, 1, 3, 0}
Node 3: {5, 9, 8, 2}
Node 4: {1, 6}
Node 5: {9, 8, 3, 7}
Node 6: {9, 4, 7, 1, 2}
Node 7: {5, 0, 6, 8}
Node 8: {5, 7, 2, 3}
Node 9: {5, 6, 3, 1, 0}

Now, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to identify 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 47

Therefore, the final result is [47], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 1>, <3, 5, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>
