Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 11) (8, 23) (8, 19) (23, 8) (23, 25) (23, 20) (23, 27) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 25) (15, 11) (15, 28) (20, 23) (20, 15) (20, 21) (4, 18) (4, 26) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 6) (11, 17) (11, 15) (11, 21) (28, 15) (28, 1) (28, 22) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 24) (7, 14) (25, 23) (25, 15) (25, 19) (10, 14) (10, 5) (21, 20) (21, 11) (21, 9) (19, 8) (19, 25) (19, 9) (5, 10) (26, 4) (26, 3) (0, 17) (0, 16) (0, 22) (0, 1) (0, 9) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 24) (24, 17) (24, 16) (24, 2) (24, 29) (6, 18) (6, 12) (27, 14) (27, 17) (27, 23) (27, 18) (27, 29) (29, 24) (29, 27) (1, 28) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (9, 15) (9, 21) (9, 19) (9, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (3, 26) (3, 2) (22, 28) (22, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {17, 16, 22, 1, 9}
- Node 1: {28, 0, 2, 13}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 24}
- Node 3: {2, 26}
- Node 4: {18, 26}
- Node 5: {10}
- Node 6: {18, 12}
- Node 7: {14}
- Node 8: {23, 19}
- Node 9: {15, 21, 19, 0}
- Node 10: {14, 5}
- Node 11: {17, 15, 21}
- Node 12: {16, 13, 6}
- Node 13: {12, 1}
- Node 14: {17, 27, 7, 10}
- Node 15: {20, 9, 25, 11, 28}
- Node 16: {0, 12, 24}
- Node 17: {14, 0, 24, 27, 11}
- Node 18: {4, 27, 6}
- Node 19: {8, 25, 9}
- Node 20: {23, 15, 21}
- Node 21: {20, 11, 9}
- Node 22: {28, 0}
- Node 23: {8, 25, 20, 27}
- Node 24: {17, 16, 2, 29, 27}
- Node 25: {23, 15, 19}
- Node 26: {4, 3}
- Node 27: {14, 17, 23, 18, 29}
- Node 28: {15, 1, 22}
- Node 29: {24, 27}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 9, Node 15, Node 17, Node 24, and Node 27 have three or more neighbors.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 15: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 17: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 24: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 27: inom{5}{3} = 10

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [54].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (17, 1, 9)>
- <9, (15, 21, 19)>
- <15, (9, 25, 11)>
- <17, (24, 16, 27)>
- <24, (2, 29, 27)>
- <27, (18, 29, 17)>
