Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 1) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 16) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 19) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 15) (10, 17) (10, 0) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 19) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 15) (18, 9) (18, 4) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 16) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 4) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 15) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 16) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 10, 12, 4
- Node 1: 9, 14, 3, 19
- Node 2: 7, 12, 16
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 18, 19, 0, 15
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 7: 5, 12, 19, 2
- Node 8: 9, 14, 13, 16
- Node 9: 8, 18, 15, 1
- Node 10: 17, 0
- Node 12: 7, 2, 19, 0
- Node 13: 17, 8, 15
- Node 14: 9, 17, 8, 1
- Node 15: 9, 13, 4, 16
- Node 16: 17, 8, 2, 15
- Node 17: 14, 10, 13, 16
- Node 18: 9, 4
- Node 19: 1, 7, 12, 4

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.

Nodes with 4 neighbors:
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars formed in this graph:
<[0, 5, 12], [10, 0, 12], [16, 15, 17], [14, 1, 9], [4, 0, 15], [13, 8, 17], [12, 19, 7], [8, 13, 16], [17, 13, 16], [14, 17, 8]>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
