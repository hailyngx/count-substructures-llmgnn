Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 15) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 1) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 18) (11, 14) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 13) (14, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 9) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 17) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 16) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 13) (17, 15) (17, 18) (6, 0) (13, 14) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 19) (18, 12) (18, 0) (18, 17) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 16) (16, 14) (16, 10) (16, 19) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 1, 18, 19, 6}
- Node 1: {8, 0}
- Node 2: {8, 7, 15}
- Node 3: {5, 0, 8, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 12}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {2, 8, 15, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 2, 7, 12, 1}
- Node 9: {7, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {14, 13, 9, 16}
- Node 11: {14}
- Node 12: {8, 4, 18}
- Node 13: {14, 10, 9, 19}
- Node 14: {11, 16, 13, 10}
- Node 15: {2, 7, 17}
- Node 16: {14, 19, 10}
- Node 17: {15, 18}
- Node 18: {12, 0, 17}
- Node 19: {0, 13, 16}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 19 \), which we represent as [19].

The unique 3-stars can be listed as follows:
<0, 1, 8>, <8, 2, 7>, <8, 7, 15>, <8, 12, 18>, <8, 1, 3>, <10, 9, 13>, <10, 13, 14>, <13, 14, 16>, <13, 9, 10>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 6, 19>, <0, 18, 19>, <4, 3, 12>, <7, 2, 15>, <11, 14, 16>, <14, 10, 13>, <15, 7, 17>, <16, 14, 19>, <17, 15, 18>.
