Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 5 and 6.
- Node 1: Neighbors are 9, 7, 3, and 2.
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1 and 8.
- Node 3: Neighbors are 5, 9, 1, and 8.
- Node 4: Neighbors are 9, 7, and 8.
- Node 5: Neighbors are 9, 6, 0, 3, and 7.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 5, 7, 8, and 0.
- Node 7: Neighbors are 5, 4, 6, 1, and 8.
- Node 8: Neighbors are 4, 1, 3, 2, 6, and 7.
- Node 9: Neighbors are 5, 4, 3, and 1.

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in this graph. We'll focus on nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- For node 1: In this case, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars are <1, (9, 7, 3)>, <1, (9, 7, 2)>, <1, (9, 3, 2)>, and <1, (7, 3, 2)>.
- For node 3: Here, we also have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars are <3, (5, 9, 1)>, <3, (5, 9, 8)>, <3, (5, 1, 8)>, and <3, (9, 1, 8)>.
- For node 7: Similarly, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars include <7, (5, 4, 6)>, <7, (5, 4, 8)>, <7, (5, 1, 8)>, <7, (5, 8, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 1, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 6)>, <7, (1, 8, 6)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, and <7, (1, 6, 8)>.
- For node 8: We have \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars are <8, (4, 1, 3)>, <8, (4, 1, 2)>, <8, (4, 3, 2)>, <8, (1, 3, 2)>, <8, (4, 1, 6)>, <8, (4, 3, 6)>, <8, (4, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (3, 2, 6)>, and so on.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 38. Therefore, the final answer is [38].
