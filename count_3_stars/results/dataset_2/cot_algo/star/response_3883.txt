Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 15) (16, 28) (16, 22) (16, 20) (2, 3) (29, 1) (29, 26) (29, 3) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 24) (21, 7) (21, 0) (21, 22) (21, 24) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 24) (10, 20) (3, 2) (3, 29) (3, 6) (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 23) (18, 0) (18, 26) (26, 29) (26, 18) (26, 27) (26, 17) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 23) (15, 17) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 6) (17, 26) (17, 15) (17, 13) (17, 12) (28, 16) (28, 8) (28, 23) (8, 28) (8, 24) (8, 20) (8, 12) (8, 1) (1, 29) (1, 8) (24, 7) (24, 21) (24, 10) (24, 8) (24, 25) (23, 0) (23, 15) (23, 28) (23, 4) (4, 23) (4, 9) (4, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 27) (19, 13) (22, 16) (22, 21) (22, 6) (27, 26) (27, 9) (27, 14) (14, 27) (14, 5) (12, 17) (12, 8) (25, 24) (20, 16) (20, 10) (20, 8) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 22) (5, 4) (5, 14) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {7, 18, 21, 9, 23}
- Node 1: {8, 29}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 29}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 23}
- Node 5: {4, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 13, 22}
- Node 7: {0, 21, 24}
- Node 8: {1, 12, 20, 24, 28}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 27}
- Node 10: {11, 15, 20, 24}
- Node 11: {10, 15}
- Node 12: {8, 17}
- Node 13: {6, 17, 19}
- Node 14: {5, 27}
- Node 15: {10, 11, 17, 23}
- Node 16: {20, 22, 28}
- Node 17: {12, 13, 15, 26}
- Node 18: {0, 26}
- Node 19: {13}
- Node 20: {8, 10, 16}
- Node 21: {7, 22}
- Node 22: {16, 21, 6}
- Node 23: {4, 15, 28}
- Node 24: {7, 8, 10, 25}
- Node 25: {24}
- Node 26: {17, 18, 27, 29}
- Node 27: {9, 14, 26}
- Node 28: {16, 23, 8}
- Node 29: {1, 3, 26}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors (7, 18, 21, 9, 23), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 49

Therefore, the final answer is [49], and the unique 3-stars found are:
