Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 19) (3, 1) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 10) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 17) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 5) (12, 2) (12, 17) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 9) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 15) (13, 4) (13, 17) (15, 5) (15, 9) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 13) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 10) (11, 18) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 4) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 11) (6, 0) (6, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 16) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we have the following neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 1: {2, 3, 19}
- Node 2: {1, 10, 12, 16, 18}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {9, 10, 11, 13, 19}
- Node 5: {7, 15}
- Node 6: {0, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 18, 19}
- Node 8: {6, 10, 11, 16}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 11, 14, 15}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 8, 16}
- Node 11: {4, 8, 9, 18}
- Node 12: {2, 17}
- Node 13: {4, 17}
- Node 14: {9}
- Node 15: {5, 9}
- Node 16: {2, 8, 10}
- Node 17: {12, 13, 18}
- Node 18: {2, 7, 11, 17}
- Node 19: {1, 4, 7}

For each node, we calculate the number of 3-stars it is involved in:

- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, 2, 3>
<2, 10, 16>
<4, 9, 11>
<7, 5, 18>
<10, 2, 16>
<11, 4, 8>
