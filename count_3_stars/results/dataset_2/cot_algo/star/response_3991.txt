Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 4) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 5) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 1) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 9) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors (14, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 1: Neighbors (11, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 2: Neighbors (8, 9, 4)
- Node 3: Neighbors (7, 8, 10, 13, 4)
- Node 4: Neighbors (12, 14, 2, 3, 10, 1)
- Node 5: Neighbors (12, 0, 10, 1)
- Node 7: Neighbors (12, 3, 13)
- Node 8: Neighbors (12, 0, 2, 11, 3)
- Node 9: Neighbors (0, 14, 2, 1, 13)
- Node 10: Neighbors (3, 4, 5)
- Node 11: Neighbors (8, 1, 13)
- Node 12: Neighbors (4, 14, 5, 8)
- Node 13: Neighbors (7, 14, 3, 11, 9)
- Node 14: Neighbors (12, 0, 9, 4, 13)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 4, and Node 9 have \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \) 3-star each.
- Node 0 and Node 14 form a 3-star with Node 9: <0, 9, 14>
- Node 0 and Node 1 form a 3-star with Node 5: <0, 1, 5>
- Node 0 and Node 9 form a 3-star with Node 14: <0, 9, 14>
- Node 3 and Node 8 form a 3-star with Node 13: <3, 8, 13>
- Node 7 and Node 12 form a 3-star with Node 14: <7, 12, 14>
- Node 8 and Node 11 form a 3-star with Node 13: <8, 11, 13>
- Node 4, Node 10, and Node 1 form a 3-star: <1, 4, 10>

The total number of unique 3-stars formed in the graph is 8, so the final answer is [8].
