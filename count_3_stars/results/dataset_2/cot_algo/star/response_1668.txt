Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:  

Node 0: {9, 2}  
Node 1: {9, 3, 2, 5, 8, 7}  
Node 2: {6, 1, 8, 0}  
Node 3: {1, 5}  
Node 4: {6, 8, 5}  
Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 8, 7}  
Node 6: {9, 7, 2, 8, 4}  
Node 7: {6, 9, 1, 5}  
Node 8: {6, 1, 4, 2, 5}  
Node 9: {6, 1, 7, 0}  

Now, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 8  

Calculating \( \binom{3}{3} \) for each of these nodes, we find:  
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star  
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star  
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3  
Therefore, the final answer is [3].  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<1, (9, 2, 3)>  
<5, (4, 7, 8)>  
<8, (6, 2, 1)>
