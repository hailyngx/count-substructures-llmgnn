Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9.

Let's first find the neighborhood set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 7}

Now let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 4: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 9: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <1, (0, 3, 8)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <6, (0, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 6)>
- <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
