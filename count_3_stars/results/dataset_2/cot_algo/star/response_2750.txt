Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 13) (2, 17) (18, 0) (18, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (5, 8) (5, 19) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 9) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 12) (1, 11) (1, 10) (17, 2) (17, 6) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 9) (16, 7) (16, 4) (15, 0) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 12) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 15) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 14) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 4) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 9) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 14) 

Response:
The 3-star structures in this graph can be determined by analyzing the neighbor sets of each node. 

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {11, 15, 18} => [1]
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {10, 11, 14} => [1]
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: {13, 17}
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {6, 11, 18} => [1]
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {11, 14, 16} => [1]
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: {8, 19}
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {3, 12, 17} => [1]
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {9, 11, 14, 16, 19} => [10]
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {5, 10, 12} => [1]
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {7, 12, 13} => [1]
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {1, 8, 13, 14} => [4]
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 4, 7} => [10]
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: {6, 8, 9, 14, 19} => [10]
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: {2, 9, 10} => [1]
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {7, 10, 12, 4} => [4]
- Node 15 has 1 neighbor: {0}
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors: {4, 7}
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors: {2, 6}
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors: {0, 3}
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: {5, 7, 12} => [1]
