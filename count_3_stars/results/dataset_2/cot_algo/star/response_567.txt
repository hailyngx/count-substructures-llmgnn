Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 17) (9, 8) (9, 3) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 15) (4, 7) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 12) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 16) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 18) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (12, 15) (12, 19) (11, 8) (11, 2) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 19) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 16) (13, 14) (13, 1) (19, 14) (19, 12) (19, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 16, 18}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 7, 13}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 11}
- Node 3: {1, 9, 10}
- Node 4: {7, 16}
- Node 5: {8, 17}
- Node 6: {2, 10, 19}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 15}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 9, 11}
- Node 9: {3, 8}
- Node 10: {3, 6, 16, 17}
- Node 11: {2, 8}
- Node 12: {15, 19}
- Node 13: {1, 14}
- Node 14: {13, 17, 19}
- Node 15: {7, 12, 18}
- Node 16: {0, 4, 10, 18}
- Node 17: {5, 10, 14, 15}
- Node 18: {0, 15, 16}
- Node 19: {6, 12, 14}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 7: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 10: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 15: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 16: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 17: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 19: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 24

Therefore, the final answer is [24] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 3, 13)>, <1, (2, 7, 13)>, <1, (3, 7, 13)>, <1, (7, 13, 15)>, 
<3, (1, 9, 10)>, 
<7, (1, 4, 15)>, 
<8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 11)>, <8, (0, 9, 11)>, <8, (5, 9, 11)>, 
<10, (3, 6, 16)>, <10, (3, 10, 17)>, <10, (6, 16, 17)>, <10, (16, 17, 10)>, 
<15, (7, 12, 18)>, 
<16, (0, 4, 10)>, <16, (0, 4, 18)>, <16, (0, 10, 18)>, <16, (4, 10, 18)>, 
<17, (5, 14, 15)>, <17, (10, 14, 15)>, <17, (14, 15, 19)>, <17, (10, 15, 17)>, 
<19, (6, 12, 14)>
