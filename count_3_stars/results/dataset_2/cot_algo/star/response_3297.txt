Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 13) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (19, 8) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (13, 14) (0, 17) (0, 10) (0, 6) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 9) (12, 1) (12, 5) (10, 1) (10, 0) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 5) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (4, 16) (4, 1) (4, 15) (15, 16) (15, 17) (15, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 10, 17
- Node 1: 3, 4, 10, 12
- Node 2: 3, 9, 11
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 15, 16
- Node 5: 12, 18
- Node 6: 0, 7, 8, 16
- Node 7: 6, 9
- Node 8: 3, 6, 9, 19
- Node 9: 3, 7, 8, 2
- Node 10: 0, 1
- Node 11: 16, 17, 18, 2
- Node 12: 1, 5
- Node 13: 14
- Node 14: 13, 17, 18
- Node 15: 4, 16, 17
- Node 16: 11, 15, 4, 6
- Node 17: 0, 11, 14, 15
- Node 18: 5, 11, 14

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 11: 4, 16, 18
- Node 16: 4, 6, 15

Counting the number of 3-stars:
- For node 11, we have \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 16, we have \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 2, which can be represented as [2]. The unique 3-stars found are:
- <11, (4, 16, 18)>
- <16, (4, 6, 15)>
