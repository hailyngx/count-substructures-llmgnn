Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 10) (4, 10) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
1. First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 7, 10}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 8, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 10, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 4, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {2, 3, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 5, 9, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbor {10}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10}

2. Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

3. Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 88

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [88].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 14>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 5, 12>
- <0, 8, 14>
- <1, 6, 14>
- <2, 8, 10>
- <2, 9, 14>
- <2, 11, 12>
- <5, 8, 14>
- <6, 7, 9>
- <8, 10, 14>
- <9, 10, 14>
