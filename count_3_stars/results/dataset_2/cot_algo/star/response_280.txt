Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 3) (27, 17) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 13) (14, 21) (17, 27) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 23) (2, 15) (2, 29) (29, 2) (29, 5) (29, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 27) (3, 1) (3, 16) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 23) (28, 6) (28, 7) (28, 20) (20, 28) (20, 13) (20, 22) (20, 4) (6, 28) (9, 18) (9, 19) (22, 14) (22, 20) (22, 24) (4, 27) (4, 20) (4, 26) (18, 9) (18, 26) (26, 4) (26, 18) (26, 0) (5, 29) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 5) (11, 1) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 25) (23, 17) (23, 10) (23, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 24) (24, 22) (24, 16) (25, 11) (25, 8) (8, 14) (8, 25) (8, 21) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 28) (7, 5) (7, 8) (12, 10) (0, 29) (0, 26) (0, 11) (13, 14) (13, 20) (21, 14) (21, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's first determine the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (29, 26, 11)
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (3, 11, 16, 10, 7)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (15, 29)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (27, 1, 16)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (27, 20, 26)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (29, 19, 7)
- Node 6: 1 neighbor (28)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (1, 28, 5, 8)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (14, 25, 21, 7)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (18, 19)
- Node 10: 4 neighbors (17, 1, 12, 23)
- Node 11: 4 neighbors (1, 23, 0, 25)
- Node 12: 1 neighbor (10)
- Node 13: 2 neighbors (14, 20)
- Node 14: 5 neighbors (17, 8, 22, 13, 21)
- Node 15: 3 neighbors (27, 19, 2)
- Node 16: 3 neighbors (3, 1, 24)
- Node 17: 4 neighbors (27, 14, 10, 23)
- Node 18: 2 neighbors (9, 26)
- Node 19: 3 neighbors (15, 5, 9)
- Node 20: 4 neighbors (28, 13, 22, 4)
- Node 21: 2 neighbors (14, 8)
- Node 22: 3 neighbors (14, 20, 24)
- Node 23: 3 neighbors (17, 10, 11)
- Node 24: 2 neighbors (16, 22)
- Node 25: 2 neighbors (11, 8)
- Node 26: 3 neighbors (4, 18, 0)
- Node 27: 4 neighbors (15, 3, 17, 4)
- Node 28: 3 neighbors (6, 7, 20)
- Node 29: 2 neighbors (2, 5)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 15 nodes (0, 3, 4, 5, 15, 16, 19, 22, 24, 26, 28)
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{15}{3} = 455 \)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [455]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 11, 26>
- <0, 11, 29>
- <0, 26, 29>
- <1, 10, 23>
- <1, 10, 7>
- <1, 11, 23>
- <1, 11, 25>
- <1, 16, 3>
- <1, 16, 24>
- <2, 15, 29>
- <4, 20, 26>
- <5, 19, 29>
- <7, 28, 5>
- <8, 21, 14>
- <10, 17, 23>
- <11, 23, 25>
- <14, 17, 27>
- <14, 21, 8>
- <14, 22, 20>
- <16, 24, 22>
- <19, 5, 7>
- <20, 4, 26>
- <20, 13, 14>
- <23, 10, 17>
