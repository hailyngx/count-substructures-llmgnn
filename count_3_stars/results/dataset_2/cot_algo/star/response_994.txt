Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 11) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 7) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 7) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 12) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 13) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 7) (14, 9) (14, 3) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 1) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 4, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 6, 8, 2, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors {8, 1, 13, 10, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 14, 10}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 9, 8, 0, 3, 11}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 13, 8, 1, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 1, 12, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 13, 10}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 4, 2, 10, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 4, 14, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {8, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {9, 6, 11, 1}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 2, 0, 7}
- Node 14: Neighbors {9, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <0, (6, 4, 13)>
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 2)>, <1, (5, 8, 2)>, <1, (5, 2, 12)>, <1, (6, 8, 2)>, <1, (6, 8, 12)>, <1, (6, 2, 12)>, <1, (8, 2, 12)>, <1, (5, 8, 1)>, <1, (5, 2, 1)>
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars. <2, (8, 1, 13)>, <2, (8, 1, 10)>, <2, (8, 1, 7)>, <2, (8, 13, 10)>, <2, (8, 13, 7)>, <2, (8, 10, 7)>, <2, (1, 13, 10)>, <2, (1, 13, 7)>, <2, (1, 10, 7)>, <2, (8, 1, 2)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <3, (4, 14, 10)>
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars. <4, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (5, 9, 0)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>, <4, (9, 8, 0)>, <4, (5, 8, 3)>, <4, (5, 8, 11)>, <4, (9, 8, 3)>, <4, (9, 8, 11)>, <4, (9, 5, 4)>, <4, (5, 0, 3)>, <4, (5, 0, 11)>, <4, (9, 0, 3)>, <4, (9, 0, 11)>, <4, (9, 5, 11)>, <4, (5, 3, 11)>, <4, (8, 0, 3)>, <4, (8, 0, 11)>, <4, (8, 3, 11)>, <4, (5, 4, 11)>, <4, (8, 2, 10)>
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars. <5, (9, 8, 1)>, <5, (9, 8, 13)>, <5, (9, 1, 13)>, <5, (8, 1, 13)>, <5, (9, 1, 4)>, <5, (8, 1, 4)>, <5, (9, 4, 8)>, <5, (9, 4, 3)>, <5, (9, 4, 11)>, <5, (1, 13, 2)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <6, (9, 12, 1)>, <6, (9, 12, 0)>, <6, (9, 1, 0)>, <6, (12, 1, 0)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <7, (2, 13, 10)>
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars. <8, (5, 4, 0)>, <8, (5, 4, 3)>, <8, (5, 4, 11)>, <8, (4, 0, 3)>, <8, (4, 0, 11)>, <8, (4, 3, 11)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 0, 13)>,  <8, (5, 3, 10)>, <8, (5, 11, 2)>
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars. <9, (5, 8, 14)>, <9, (5, 12, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 12)>, <9, (8, 14, 12)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <9, (5, 4, 12)>, <9, (8, 4, 12)>, <9, (5, 4, 11)>, <9, (8, 12, 6)>, <9, (4, 12, 11)>
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <10, (2, 3, 7)>, <10, (2, 8, 7)>, <10, (2, 8, 13)>, <10, (3, 7, 14)>
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors, hence no 3-stars form.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <12, (9, 6, 1)>, <12, (9, 6, 11)>, <12, (9, 1, 11)>, <12, (6, 1, 11)>
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <13, (5, 0, 7)>, <13, (5, 7, 2)>, <13, (0, 7, 2)>, <13, (0, 7, 10)>
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, hence no 3-stars form.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 75

Therefore, the final result is [75].
