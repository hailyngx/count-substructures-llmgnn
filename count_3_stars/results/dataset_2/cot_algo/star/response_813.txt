Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 10) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (14, 11) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 11) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 7, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 10}
- Node 7: {3, 9, 10}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 7, 10}
- Node 10: {3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 11: {1, 4, 5, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {3, 4, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 11}
- Node 14: {11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star and calculate how many 3-stars can be formed. 

- Node 1, 3-stars: 1
- Node 10, 3-stars: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 2, so the final answer is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<1, (2, 9, 11)>
<10, (3, 7, 12)>
