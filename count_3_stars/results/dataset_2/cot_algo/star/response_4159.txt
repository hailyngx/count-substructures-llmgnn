Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 6) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 19) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 10) (17, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 19) (18, 4) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 14) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 7) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 1) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 7) (14, 6) (2, 17) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 18) 

Response:
The first step is to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: neighbors = {1, 5, 7, 18}
- Node 1: neighbors = {0, 12}
- Node 2: neighbor = {17}
- Node 3: neighbors = {6, 15}
- Node 4: neighbors = {8, 9, 12, 18}
- Node 5: neighbors = {0, 7, 8, 16}
- Node 6: neighbors = {3, 10, 11, 14, 15}
- Node 7: neighbors = {0, 5, 14, 19}
- Node 8: neighbors = {4, 5, 8, 16, 19}
- Node 9: neighbors = {4, 19}
- Node 10: neighbors = {6, 17}
- Node 11: neighbors = {6, 13, 16}
- Node 12: neighbors = {1, 4, 18}
- Node 13: neighbors = {11, 16, 18}
- Node 14: neighbors = {6, 7}
- Node 15: neighbors = {3, 6}
- Node 16: neighbors = {5, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 17: neighbors = {2, 10}
- Node 18: neighbors = {4, 12, 13}
- Node 19: neighbors = {7, 8, 9}

Next, we will identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
Nodes with 4 or more neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 18, 19

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 4 or more neighbors using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Only 3 neighbors)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Only 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is [34], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 18>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 5, 18>
- <4, 12, 18>
- <4, 18, 13>
- <4, 18, 0>
- <4, 18, 1>
- <5, 7, 19>
- <5, 8, 16>
- <5, 8, 19>
- <5, 16, 13>
- <6, 10, 17>
- <6, 11, 16>
- <6, 14, 7>
- <6, 15, 3>
- <6, 15, 6>
- <8, 16, 11>
- <8, 16, 13>
- <8, 16, 5>
- <8, 16, 8>
- <19, 7, 14>
