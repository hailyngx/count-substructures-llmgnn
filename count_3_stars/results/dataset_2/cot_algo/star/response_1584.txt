Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 29) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 6) (27, 13) (27, 0) (18, 1) (1, 18) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 20) (3, 6) (3, 19) (6, 0) (6, 3) (9, 29) (9, 20) (9, 16) (12, 21) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 29) (23, 8) (23, 25) (23, 10) (23, 19) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 20) (14, 2) (21, 3) (21, 12) (21, 17) (28, 17) (26, 22) (26, 10) (11, 14) (11, 15) (11, 17) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 4) (29, 22) (29, 9) (29, 8) (7, 15) (25, 23) (25, 5) (25, 10) (24, 4) (24, 20) (10, 23) (10, 26) (10, 25) (5, 2) (5, 25) (5, 16) (15, 1) (15, 11) (15, 7) (16, 9) (16, 5) (16, 17) (17, 21) (17, 28) (17, 11) (17, 16) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 24) (19, 3) (19, 23) (19, 14) (20, 3) (20, 9) (20, 8) (20, 14) (20, 24) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {27, 6, 14}
- Node 1: {18, 3, 15, 4}
- Node 2: {13, 14, 5, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 21, 20, 6, 19}
- Node 4: {13, 1, 2, 24}
- Node 5: {2, 25, 16}
- Node 6: {0, 3}
- Node 7: {15}
- Node 8: {23, 20, 29}
- Node 9: {29, 20, 16}
- Node 10: {23, 26, 25}
- Node 11: {14, 15, 17}
- Node 12: {21}
- Node 13: {22, 4, 2, 27}
- Node 14: {0, 11, 19, 20, 2}
- Node 15: {1, 11, 7}
- Node 16: {9, 5, 17}
- Node 17: {21, 28, 11, 16}
- Node 18: {1}
- Node 19: {3, 23, 14}
- Node 20: {3, 9, 8, 14, 24}
- Node 21: {3, 12, 17}
- Node 22: {13, 26, 29}
- Node 23: {8, 25, 10, 19}
- Node 24: {4, 20}
- Node 25: {23, 5, 10}
- Node 26: {22, 10}
- Node 27: {13, 0}
- Node 28: {17}
- Node 29: {22, 9, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 23, 25, 26, 29 (total 17 nodes)
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{17}{3} = 680 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [680].

Unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (27, 6, 14)>
2. <1, (18, 3, 15)>
3. <2, (13, 14, 5)>
4. <3, (1, 21, 20)>
5. <8, (23, 20, 29)>
6. <9, (29, 20, 16)>
7. <10, (23, 26, 25)>
8. <11, (14, 15, 17)>
9. <14, (0, 11, 19)>
10. <16, (9, 5, 17)>
11. <19, (3, 23, 14)>
12. <20, (3, 9, 8)>
13. <21, (3, 12, 17)>
14. <23, (8, 25, 10)>
15. <25, (23, 5, 10)>
16. <26, (22, 10)>
17. <29, (22, 9, 8)>
