Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 9) (1, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 14) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 8, 3, 5, 13
Node 1: 9, 11
Node 2: 6, 9, 4, 8, 12, 14
Node 3: 6, 0, 12
Node 4: 9, 7, 8, 13, 10, 2
Node 5: 8, 0, 12, 11, 14
Node 6: 9, 3, 2
Node 7: 4, 11, 14
Node 8: 4, 2, 5, 11, 0
Node 9: 6, 4, 2, 1
Node 10: 4, 12, 14
Node 11: 7, 8, 1, 13, 5
Node 12: 2, 5, 10, 3
Node 13: 4, 0, 11
Node 14: 7, 2, 5, 10

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14
Nodes with more than 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 8, 11

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed per node
For nodes with more than 4 neighbors: \( \binom{n}{3} \) 3-stars formed per node, where n is the number of neighbors of the node

Total 3-stars = 9 * 4 + 4 * 6 = 36 + 24 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (8, 3, 5)>
<1, (9, 11, 8)>
<5, (8, 12, 11)>
<6, (9, 3, 2)>
<7, (11, 14, 4)>
<10, (12, 14, 4)>
<12, (2, 10, 14)>
<13, (11, 0, 4)>
<14, (7, 5, 2)>
