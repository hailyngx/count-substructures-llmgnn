Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 7, 9, 2, 3}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {5, 4, 0, 6}
- Node 3: {9, 0, 8}
- Node 4: {9, 8, 2, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 8, 0, 7}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 8, 2}
- Node 7: {5, 0, 6}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 4, 6, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 4, 3, 1, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 5: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 7: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 9: Forms 1 3-star

Now, we sum up the total number of 3-stars, which is 7. Therefore, the final answer is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <2, (5, 4, 6)>
- <4, (9, 8, 6)>
- <5, (9, 8, 7)>
- <7, (5, 0, 6)>
- <8, (5, 9, 4)>
- <9, (5, 8, 4)>
