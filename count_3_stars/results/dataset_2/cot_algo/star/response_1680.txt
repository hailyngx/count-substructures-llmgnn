Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 9) (6, 18) (6, 4) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 18) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 15) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 14) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 10) (7, 14) (0, 17) (0, 18) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 19) (10, 12) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 7) (12, 16) (12, 10) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 0) (15, 17) (15, 19) (2, 13) (2, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {17, 18}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 9, 10, 17}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 13}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 17, 18}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {10, 14, 17}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 18}
- Node 7: Neighbor {14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {13, 14, 16, 19}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 4, 16, 18}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 5, 12, 19}
- Node 12: Neighbors {10, 16}
- Node 13: Neighbors {2, 8, 18}
- Node 14: Neighbors {5, 7, 8}
- Node 15: Neighbors {17, 19}
- Node 16: Neighbors {8, 9, 12}
- Node 17: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 15}
- Node 18: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 19: Neighbors {8, 10, 15}

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 (Node 0)
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 4 (Nodes 1, 3, 17, 18)
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 11 (Nodes 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19)

Total 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{11}{3} \) = 4 + 165 = 169

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [169].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 9, 17)>, <2, (3, 4, 13)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (10, 14, 17)>, <6, (4, 9, 18)>, <7, (8, 14, 19)>, <10, (1, 5, 12)>, <12, (10, 16, 19)>, <13, (8, 18, 19)>, <14, (5, 8, 10)>, <15, (17, 19, 0)>, <16, (8, 9, 12)>.
