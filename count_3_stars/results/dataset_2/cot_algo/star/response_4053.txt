Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 72

Therefore, the final answer is [72], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
