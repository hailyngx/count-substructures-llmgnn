Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 12) (2, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 3) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:  
Node 0: 8, 3, 11, 5, 9  
Node 1: 6, 13, 7  
Node 2: 12, 11  
Node 3: 0, 14, 11, 10, 12  
Node 4: 8, 9, 13, 10, 6  
Node 5: 8, 0, 7  
Node 6: 4, 14, 11, 1, 7  
Node 7: 8, 1, 6, 5  
Node 8: 4, 5, 0, 7  
Node 9: 4, 0, 11, 12  
Node 10: 4, 14, 3  
Node 11: 0, 2, 3, 9, 6, 12  
Node 12: 2, 3, 11, 9  
Node 13: 4, 14, 1  
Node 14: 6, 4, 13, 10  

Node 0, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 12, and 14 have 5 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 68, which we'll put inside brackets: [68].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 11>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 11>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 11>, <3, 10, 14>, <3, 11, 6>, <3, 11, 12>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 8, 5>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 13, 14>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 11, 12>, <8, 5, 7>, <11, 9, 12>
