Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 5) (21, 29) (21, 14) (3, 22) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 28) (5, 21) (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 0) (9, 23) (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 2) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 10) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 23) (8, 23) (8, 26) (23, 9) (23, 12) (23, 8) (23, 18) (23, 2) (6, 2) (28, 15) (28, 22) (28, 19) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 14) (19, 0) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 10) (22, 3) (22, 28) (22, 7) (13, 26) (4, 3) (4, 12) (17, 20) (17, 24) (17, 11) (29, 21) (29, 9) (29, 11) (16, 21) (16, 2) (16, 14) (10, 25) (10, 26) (10, 7) (24, 17) (24, 0) (14, 21) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 16) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 7) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 24) (0, 11) (7, 15) (7, 22) (7, 10) (7, 18) (2, 20) (2, 23) (2, 6) (2, 16) (11, 20) (11, 17) (11, 29) (11, 0) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 1: {15, 21}
- Node 3: {4, 18, 22}
- Node 5: {9, 15, 21}
- Node 8: {23, 26}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 23, 29}
- Node 10: {7, 25, 26}
- Node 11: {0, 17, 20, 29}
- Node 12: {4, 14, 23}
- Node 13: {26}
- Node 14: {12, 16, 19, 21}
- Node 15: {1, 7, 28}
- Node 16: {2, 14, 21}
- Node 17: {11, 20, 24}
- Node 18: {3, 7, 23}
- Node 19: {0, 14, 28, 26}
- Node 20: {11, 17, 25}
- Node 21: {1, 5, 14, 16, 29}
- Node 22: {3, 7, 28}
- Node 23: {2, 8, 9, 12, 18}
- Node 24: {0, 17}
- Node 25: {10, 20}
- Node 26: {8, 10, 13, 19}
- Node 28: {15, 19, 22}
- Node 29: {9, 11, 21}

Based on the neighbor sets, we can determine the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 4 = 18. 

Thus, the final answer is [18], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

1. <21, (1, 5, 14)>
2. <21, (1, 5, 16)>
3. <21, (1, 14, 16)>
4. <21, (5, 14, 16)>
5. <14, (4, 12, 23)>
6. <9, (0, 23, 29)>
7. <9, (5, 23, 29)>
