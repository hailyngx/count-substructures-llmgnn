Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {7, 8, 9}
Node 1: {4, 5, 6, 9}
Node 2: {5, 7, 8, 9}
Node 3: {6, 7, 8}
Node 4: {1, 6, 9}
Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 8}
Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 5}
Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 49

Therefore, the final answer is [49].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
