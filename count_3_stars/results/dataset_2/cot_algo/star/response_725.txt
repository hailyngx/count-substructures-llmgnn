Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 13) (21, 16) (21, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 29) (7, 19) (7, 5) (20, 18) (20, 23) (20, 24) (25, 27) (25, 17) (25, 6) (12, 27) (12, 26) (12, 23) (27, 25) (27, 12) (27, 11) (0, 11) (0, 23) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 9) (17, 15) (29, 7) (29, 5) (29, 15) (16, 21) (16, 28) (16, 9) (28, 16) (28, 22) (28, 24) (28, 10) (18, 20) (26, 12) (26, 14) (23, 20) (23, 12) (23, 0) (23, 2) (14, 26) (14, 6) (6, 4) (6, 25) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (8, 24) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 3) (24, 20) (24, 28) (24, 8) (2, 23) (2, 3) (19, 7) (19, 13) (9, 21) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 16) (10, 28) (10, 6) (10, 8) (11, 27) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 22) (22, 28) (22, 11) (22, 15) (5, 7) (5, 29) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 19) (13, 3) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 13) (15, 17) (15, 29) (15, 22) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 11, 23
- Node 1: 13, 17
- Node 2: 3, 23
- Node 3: 2, 8, 13
- Node 4: 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 7, 29
- Node 6: 4, 10, 13, 14, 25
- Node 7: 4, 5, 19, 29
- Node 8: 3, 11, 24
- Node 9: 4, 16, 17, 21
- Node 10: 6, 8, 28
- Node 11: 0, 8, 22, 27
- Node 12: 23, 26, 27
- Node 13: 1, 3, 6, 19
- Node 14: 6, 26
- Node 15: 17, 22, 29
- Node 16: 9, 21, 28
- Node 17: 1, 9, 15, 25
- Node 18: 20
- Node 19: 7, 13
- Node 20: 18, 23, 24
- Node 21: 9, 16
- Node 22: 11, 15, 28
- Node 23: 0, 2, 12, 20
- Node 24: 8, 20, 28
- Node 25: 6, 17, 27
- Node 26: 12, 14
- Node 27: 11, 12, 25
- Node 28: 10, 16, 22, 24
- Node 29: 5, 7, 15

Now, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star:

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 9 -> 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 4, 10, 13, 14, 25 -> 10 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 19, 29 -> 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 3, 11, 24 -> 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 4, 16, 17, 21 -> 4 3-stars
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 0, 8, 22, 27 -> 4 3-stars
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 19 -> 4 3-stars
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 17, 22, 29 -> 1 3-star
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 9, 21, 28 -> 1 3-star
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 1, 9, 15, 25 -> 4 3-stars
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: 11, 15, 28 -> 1 3-star
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 12, 20 -> 4 3-stars
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors: 8, 20, 28 -> 1 3-star
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: 6, 17, 27 -> 1 3-star
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: 10, 16, 22, 24 -> 4 3-stars
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 15 -> 1 3-star

Summing up all the 3-stars identified, we have a total of 37 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [37].
