Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 8) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (0, 14) (0, 15) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 7) (15, 0) (15, 1) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 10) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 7) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 10) (3, 16) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 14, 15
- Node 1: 7, 15, 16
- Node 2: 12, 13
- Node 3: 9, 16, 18
- Node 4: 11, 17, 18
- Node 5: 10, 14, 19
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 1, 9, 10, 11
- Node 8: 6, 11, 13
- Node 9: 3, 7, 16
- Node 10: 5, 7, 12, 13
- Node 11: 4, 7, 8, 18
- Node 12: 2, 10
- Node 13: 2, 8, 10, 11
- Node 14: 0, 5, 17
- Node 15: 0, 1
- Node 16: 1, 3, 9
- Node 17: 4, 14, 18
- Node 18: 3, 4, 11, 17
- Node 19: 5

Based on the defined criteria, we need to find nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \text{inom}{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \) (<1, (7, 15, 16)>)
- Node 3: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \) (<3, (9, 16, 18)>)
- Node 4: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \) (<4, (11, 17, 18)>)
- Node 5: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \) (<5, (10, 14, 19)>)
- Node 7: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) (<7, (1, 9, 16)>, <7, (10, 13, 11)>, <7, (10, 12, 13)>, <7, (10, 3, 7)>)
- Node 10: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) (<10, (5, 7, 19)>, <10, (7, 11, 18)>, <10, (7, 10, 13)>, <10, (4, 10, 11)>, <10, (5, 10, 14)>, <10, (10, 12, 13)>, <10, (10, 13, 11)>, <10, (10, 3, 7)>, <10, (3, 10, 16)>, <10, (10, 12, 2)>)
- Node 11: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) (<11, (4, 7, 18)>, <11, (8, 11, 13)>, <11, (11, 13, 2)>, <11, (11, 18, 3)>, <11, (13, 11, 7)>, <11, (7, 11, 10)>, <11, (11, 18, 17)>, <11, (11, 8, 13)>, <11, (11, 16, 9)>, <11, (11, 18, 4)>)
- Node 13: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) (<13, (2, 11, 18)>, <13, (8, 10, 13)>, <13, (10, 12, 13)>, <13, (13, 11, 4)>)
- Node 14: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \) (<14, (5, 17, 19)>)
- Node 16: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \) (<16, (1, 9, 3)>)
- Node 17: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \) (<17, (14, 18, 4)>)
- Node 18: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) (<18, (3, 4, 11)>, <18, (4, 11, 17)>, <18, (11, 17, 14)>, <18, (17, 18, 4)>)

Adding all the different 3-stars we found, we get a total of 34 3-stars. So, the final answer is [34].
