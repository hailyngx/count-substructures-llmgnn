Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 29) (5, 27) (9, 0) (9, 19) (0, 9) (0, 23) (27, 5) (27, 24) (1, 21) (1, 6) (1, 29) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 18) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 28) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 22) (7, 17) (22, 7) (22, 14) (23, 0) (23, 8) (23, 6) (8, 4) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 26) (15, 13) (15, 17) (20, 18) (20, 2) (12, 5) (12, 28) (28, 21) (28, 4) (28, 12) (28, 26) (28, 2) (24, 27) (24, 6) (26, 8) (26, 28) (26, 10) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 15) (17, 3) (25, 2) (3, 21) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 14) (16, 13) (6, 1) (6, 23) (6, 24) (19, 9) (19, 13) (10, 8) (10, 26) (10, 2) (10, 14) (29, 5) (29, 1) (29, 8) (29, 13) (29, 11) (11, 29) (14, 22) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 2) (18, 21) (18, 20) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 19) (13, 29) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 25) (2, 10) (2, 14) 

Response:
Using the given information, we first construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 23}
- Node 1: {21, 6, 29}
- Node 2: {20, 28, 25, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {21, 7, 17, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 28, 17}
- Node 5: {12, 29, 27}
- Node 6: {1, 23, 24}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 22, 17}
- Node 8: {4, 23, 10, 26, 29}
- Node 9: {0, 19}
- Node 10: {8, 26, 2, 14}
- Node 11: {29}
- Node 12: {5, 28}
- Node 13: {15, 16, 19, 29}
- Node 14: {22, 3, 10, 2}
- Node 15: {13, 17}
- Node 16: {13}
- Node 17: {4, 7, 15, 3}
- Node 18: {21, 20}
- Node 19: {9, 13}
- Node 20: {18, 2}
- Node 21: {1, 28, 3, 18}
- Node 22: {7, 14}
- Node 23: {0, 8, 6}
- Node 24: {27, 6}
- Node 25: {2}
- Node 26: {8, 28, 10}
- Node 27: {5, 24}
- Node 28: {21, 4, 12, 26, 2}
- Node 29: {5, 1, 8, 13, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 54 \)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars is [54], and these are the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (21, 6, 29)>, <3, (21, 7, 17)>, <4, (7, 8, 28)>, <7, (4, 3, 22)>, <8, (4, 23, 26)>, <13, (15, 16, 19)>, <21, (1, 28, 18)>, <28, (21, 4, 26)>, <29, (1, 8, 13)>.
