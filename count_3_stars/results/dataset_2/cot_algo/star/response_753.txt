Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 21) (9, 16) (9, 13) (26, 28) (26, 8) (26, 27) (4, 18) (4, 17) (7, 21) (7, 29) (7, 5) (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 0) (25, 3) (25, 29) (21, 9) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 20) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 23) (2, 13) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 0) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 29) (28, 19) (29, 7) (29, 25) (29, 28) (29, 6) (17, 4) (17, 20) (17, 11) (20, 21) (20, 17) (20, 14) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 28) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 23) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 5) (11, 17) (11, 19) (1, 2) (1, 13) (23, 2) (23, 19) (6, 29) (6, 22) (22, 6) (22, 27) (22, 8) (27, 26) (27, 22) (27, 16) (27, 8) (5, 7) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 12) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 14) (24, 12) (24, 13) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 24) (8, 26) (8, 22) (8, 27) (8, 16) (16, 9) (16, 27) (16, 8) (14, 20) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 18}
- Node 1: {2, 13}
- Node 2: {1, 13, 18, 23}
- Node 3: {0, 21, 25, 28}
- Node 4: {17, 18}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 12, 15}
- Node 6: {22, 29}
- Node 7: {5, 21, 29}
- Node 8: {16, 22, 26, 27}
- Node 9: {13, 16, 21}
- Node 10: {15}
- Node 11: {17, 19}
- Node 12: {5, 14, 24}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 9, 24}
- Node 14: {12, 20}
- Node 15: {5, 10, 19}
- Node 16: {8, 9, 27}
- Node 17: {4, 11, 20}
- Node 18: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 19: {11, 15, 23, 28}
- Node 20: {14, 17, 21}
- Node 21: {3, 7, 9, 20}
- Node 22: {6, 8, 27}
- Node 23: {2, 19}
- Node 24: {12, 13}
- Node 25: {3, 29}
- Node 26: {8, 16, 27, 28}
- Node 27: {8, 16, 22, 26}
- Node 28: {3, 19, 26, 29}
- Node 29: {6, 7, 25, 28}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 12: [1]
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 15: [1]
- Node 16: [1]
- Node 17: [1]
- Node 18: [1]
- Node 19: [1]
- Node 20: [1]
- Node 21: [1]
- Node 22: [1]
- Node 23: [1]
- Node 24: [1]
- Node 25: [1]
- Node 26: [1]
- Node 27: [1]
- Node 28: [1]
- Node 29: [1]

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24], and all unique 3-stars are given below:
<0, 5, 18>, <2, 1, 13>, <3, 21, 25>, <5, 7, 12>, <7, 5, 21>, <8, 16, 27>, <9, 13, 16>, <12, 5, 14>, <13, 1, 2>, <15, 5, 19>, <16, 8, 9>, <17, 4, 11>, <18, 0, 2>, <19, 15, 28>, <20, 14, 17>, <21, 3, 9>, <22, 6, 27>, <23, 2, 19>, <24, 12, 13>, <25, 3, 29>, <26, 8, 16>, <27, 8, 22>, <28, 3, 19>, <29, 6, 7>
