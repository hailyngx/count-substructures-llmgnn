Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 13) (1, 6) (1, 13) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 14) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes and their neighbors. Then we can determine how many 3-stars can be formed with each central node that has at least three neighbors.

### Node Neighbors:
- Node 0: {6, 8, 14, 7}
- Node 1: {6, 13}
- Node 2: {8, 12, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 2, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 14}
- Node 5: {9, 8, 4, 3}
- Node 6: {1, 14, 10, 3, 0}
- Node 7: {11, 2, 0, 13}
- Node 8: {5, 11, 2, 0, 12}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 10}
- Node 10: {9, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 11: {10, 14, 7, 13, 8}
- Node 12: {10, 2, 8, 3}
- Node 13: {11, 7, 1, 3}
- Node 14: {6, 11, 0, 4}

### 3-stars Formation:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

### Total 3-stars:
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 65 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [65].

### Unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 8, 14)>
<2, (8, 12, 3)>
<3, (5, 6, 2)>
<3, (6, 10, 0)>
<3, (6, 13, 1)>
<3, (2, 12, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 10)>
<6, (1, 13, 7)>
<8, (5, 11, 2)>
<10, (9, 6, 4)>
<11, (10, 14, 7)>
<11, (14, 0, 4)>
<12, (10, 2, 8)>
<13, (11, 7, 3)>
