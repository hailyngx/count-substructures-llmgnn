Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edge connections:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 6, 8}

Next, let's determine the nodes that form 3-stars.
For each node, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 = 30

Therefore, we found a total of 30 3-stars in the given graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 8, 9)>

Putting the final number of 3-stars in brackets: [30].
