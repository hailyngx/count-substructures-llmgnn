Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 11) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 10) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 9) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 9) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 9) 

Response:
First, we will find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 8, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {5, 13}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 14}
- Node 9: {4, 10, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 6, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 12: {9, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 8, 12}

Now, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: [inom{5}{3} = 10]
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3} = 10]
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3} = 10]
- Node 10: [inom{5}{3} = 10]
- Node 11: [inom{5}{3} = 10]
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3} = 4]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: [60]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 8, 14>, <0, 10, 14>, <0, 11, 14>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 10>, <2, 4, 11>, <2, 8, 10>, <2, 8, 11>, <2, 10, 11>, <3, 6, 13>, <6, 7, 11>, <9, 10, 12>, <9, 11, 12>
