Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 4) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 9) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 7) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 11) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 8) (19, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (16, 13) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 0) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 2) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 6) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 14) (18, 1) (1, 18) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 3, 13, 10, 11
Node 1: 18
Node 2: 17, 11, 14, 4
Node 3: 0, 4
Node 4: 3, 19, 2
Node 5: 15, 9, 10
Node 6: 7, 12
Node 7: 9, 6, 14
Node 8: 15, 19, 14
Node 9: 5, 7
Node 10: 0, 5
Node 11: 17, 0, 2
Node 12: 13, 17, 14, 6
Node 13: 17, 12, 16, 0
Node 14: 8, 7, 18, 12, 2
Node 15: 5, 18, 8
Node 16: 13
Node 17: 13, 12, 2, 18, 11
Node 18: 15, 17, 14, 1
Node 19: 8, 4

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 0, 13, 17, and 14 have 4 or more neighbors. 
For nodes 0, 13, 17, and 14, we apply \( inom{n}{3} \) to find the number of unique 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding the number of 3-stars together: 
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 28 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 28 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 3, 13>, <0, 3, 11>, <0, 13, 10>, <0, 13, 11>, <13, 17, 12>, <13, 17, 14>, <13, 17, 2>, <13, 14, 18>, <17, 12, 18>, <17, 14, 18>, <17, 14, 2>, <17, 14, 11>, <17, 18, 1>, <14, 18, 1>, <14, 17, 1>, <14, 17, 2>, <14, 17, 11>, <14, 17, 18>, <15, 18, 8>, <15, 18, 17>, <15, 8, 19>, <15, 8, 14>, <15, 8, 18>, <18, 17, 1>, <18, 17, 14>, <18, 1, 14>, <18, 1, 17>, <18, 14, 2>, <18, 14, 17>
