Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

Node 0: {3, 4, 7}
Node 1: {5, 7}
Node 2: {5, 6, 8}
Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 9}
Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
Node 6: {2, 5, 7}
Node 7: {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
Node 8: {2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
Node 9: {3, 4, 7, 8}

Nodes 1, 2, 7, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (As it has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 = 9

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [9], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
