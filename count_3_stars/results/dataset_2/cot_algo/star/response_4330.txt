Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 6) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 3) (11, 9) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 0) (13, 18) (10, 5) (10, 7) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 17) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 4) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 6) (4, 2) (4, 17) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 14) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 9) (9, 11) (9, 18) (9, 7) (0, 3) (0, 13) (1, 2) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 12) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 16) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 13}
- Node 1: {2}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {2, 12, 17}
- Node 5: {10, 13, 17}
- Node 6: {2, 8, 16, 19}
- Node 7: {2, 9, 10}
- Node 8: {6, 15, 16, 19}
- Node 9: {7, 11, 18}
- Node 10: {5, 7}
- Node 11: {3, 9}
- Node 12: {4, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 5, 17, 18}
- Node 14: {3, 12, 15}
- Node 15: {8, 14, 17}
- Node 16: {6, 8, 17}
- Node 17: {4, 5, 13, 15, 16}
- Node 18: {9, 13, 19}
- Node 19: {6, 8, 18}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <3, (0, 11, 14)>.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <4, (12, 14, 17)>.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <5, (10, 13, 17)>, <5, (13, 17, 18)>, <5, (10, 17, 18)>, <5, (13, 17, 18)>.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <6, (8, 16, 19)>, <6, (8, 16, 17)>, <6, (8, 17, 19)>, <6, (16, 17, 19)>.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <8, (15, 16, 17)>, <8, (15, 17, 19)>, <8, (16, 17, 19)>, <8, (15, 16, 19)>.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <13, (0, 5, 18)>, <13, (0, 13, 17)>, <13, (5, 17, 18)>, <13, (13, 17, 18)>.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. <17, (4, 5, 15)>, <17, (4, 15, 16)>, <17, (4, 15, 17)>, <17, (4, 16, 17)>, <17, (5, 15, 16)>, <17, (5, 15, 17)>, <17, (5, 16, 17)>, <17, (15, 16, 17)>, <17, (5, 13, 18)>, <17, (13, 15, 18)>.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 32

Therefore, the final answer is [32].
