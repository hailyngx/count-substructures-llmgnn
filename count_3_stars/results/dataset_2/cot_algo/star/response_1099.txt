Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 10) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {4, 13, 14, 10, 3, 11}
Node 1 neighbors: {9, 10}
Node 2 neighbors: {4, 8, 13, 11}
Node 3 neighbors: {5, 8, 13, 12, 0, 6}
Node 4 neighbors: {0, 10, 2}
Node 5 neighbors: {8, 3, 7, 14}
Node 6 neighbors: {12, 14, 3}
Node 7 neighbors: {5, 12}
Node 8 neighbors: {5, 9, 13, 2, 3}
Node 9 neighbors: {8, 11, 10, 1, 12}
Node 10 neighbors: {9, 4, 0, 1}
Node 11 neighbors: {9, 0, 2}
Node 12 neighbors: {9, 7, 6, 3}
Node 13 neighbors: {8, 2, 3, 14, 0}
Node 14 neighbors: {5, 13, 0, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star graphs:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {0, 3, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14}

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 82

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [82].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 10>
<0, 11, 13>
<0, 13, 14>
<0, 3, 13>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 12>
<5, 7, 8>
<8, 9, 13>
<9, 10, 4>
<9, 10, 1>
