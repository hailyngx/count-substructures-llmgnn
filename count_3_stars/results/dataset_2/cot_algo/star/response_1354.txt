Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 12) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 14) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the provided edges:

- Node 0: {9, 4, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 2, 12}
- Node 2: {1, 10, 11, 0, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 1, 11, 8}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 13, 0, 6}
- Node 5: {11, 3}
- Node 6: {4, 1, 12}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 13, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 3, 13, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {4, 10, 0}
- Node 10: {9, 12, 2}
- Node 11: {5, 3, 8, 13, 2}
- Node 12: {1, 8, 10, 6, 0}
- Node 13: {4, 7, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {13, 2}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. 
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. 
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. 
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. 
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 66 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [66].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 9, 4, 12>
- <1, 3, 5, 11>
- <1, 6, 12, 2>
- <1, 12, 0, 2>
- <2, 10, 12, 0>
- <3, 7, 8, 13>
- <3, 8, 11, 13>
- <3, 11, 5, 8>
- <4, 7, 13, 8>
- <4, 9, 10, 0>
- <4, 9, 6, 0>
- <6, 4, 1, 12>
- <8, 11, 13, 14>
- <8, 11, 13, 7>
- <12, 10, 1, 2>
