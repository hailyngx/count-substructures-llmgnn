Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 12) (6, 3) (6, 17) (9, 8) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (7, 16) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 8) (5, 7) (5, 1) (13, 17) (13, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 18) (16, 7) (16, 19) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 19) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 19) (19, 16) (19, 14) (19, 18) (19, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 19) (4, 17) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 20 nodes and 60 edges. Let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {9, 10, 1, 18}
Node 1: {5, 0}
Node 2: {11, 13, 19}
Node 3: {15, 6, 12, 8, 18}
Node 4: {17}
Node 5: {7, 1}
Node 6: {3, 17}
Node 7: {16, 5}
Node 8: {3, 9, 12}
Node 9: {8, 0}
Node 10: {11, 0, 12, 18}
Node 11: {10, 14, 2}
Node 12: {3, 15, 10, 8}
Node 13: {17, 2}
Node 14: {15, 11, 19}
Node 15: {3, 18, 14, 12}
Node 16: {7, 19}
Node 17: {6, 13, 4}
Node 18: {3, 15, 10, 0, 19}
Node 19: {16, 14, 18, 2}

Now, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed:

Node 3: There are 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8: There are 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 10: There are 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 12: There are 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 15: There are 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 17: There are 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 18: There are 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 19: There are 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 38 3-stars in the given graph. 

Thus, the final answer is [38] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (15, 12, 18)>, <3, (15, 10, 18)>, <3, (15, 14, 19)>, <3, (6, 17, 13)>, <3, (12, 10, 18)>, <8, (9, 0, 1)>, <10, (11, 14, 19)>, <12, (15, 10, 18)>, <15, (18, 10, 0)>, <18, (15, 10, 0)>, <18, (15, 14, 19)>
