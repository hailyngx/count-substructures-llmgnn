Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 14) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 6) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 11, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 6, 12}
- Node 4: {9, 11}
- Node 5: {9, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {8, 10, 11}
- Node 8: {1, 7, 12}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 3, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {5, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 6, 9, 13}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, which is more than 3. So, it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 also has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 62

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [62].   

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 12>
<0, 2, 12>
<0, 6, 10>
<0, 6, 14>
<0, 10, 12>
<1, 6, 14>
<1, 9, 13>
<1, 9, 14>
<2, 6, 10>
<3, 6, 14>
<3, 12, 13>
<3, 12, 14>
<5, 9, 13>
<5, 9, 14>
<9, 10, 13>
