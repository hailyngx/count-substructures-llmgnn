Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 13) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 11) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 5) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 6) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {8, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {9, 10, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {13}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {10, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 9, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 5, 12}
- Node 12: {2, 4, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 5, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 6, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 10: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 12: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 13: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 70

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 12)>
<4, (0, 5, 12)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<10, (1, 2, 6)>
<12, (2, 4, 13)>
<13, (2, 5, 14)>
