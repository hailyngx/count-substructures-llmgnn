Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 1) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (4, 13) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {13, 14, 11}
- Node 1: {9, 2, 14, 7, 11}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {8, 13, 2, 12}
- Node 4: {13, 14}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 8, 14}
- Node 6: {13, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 14, 12, 11, 1}
- Node 8: {5, 13, 2, 10, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 10, 1}
- Node 10: {9, 8, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 7, 12, 1}
- Node 12: {13, 7, 10, 11, 3}
- Node 13: {8, 12, 4, 3, 6, 0}
- Node 14: {5, 0, 1, 7, 4}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 12, and 13. These nodes have the potential to form 3-stars.

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Number of 3-stars = \( inom{n}{3} \) for n = 9 (number of nodes with three or more neighbors)
Number of 3-stars = \( inom{9}{3} \) = 84

Therefore, there are 84 unique 3-stars in this graph. Inside brackets, this number is: [84].

Some of the unique 3-stars are:
{0, 13, 14}
{0, 11, 12}
{1, 7, 11}
{2, 5, 8}
{3, 12, 13}
{4, 13, 14}
{5, 9, 14}
{8, 10, 12}
{8, 13, 3}
{12, 7, 11}

These are just some examples of the 3-stars that can be formed within the provided graph.
