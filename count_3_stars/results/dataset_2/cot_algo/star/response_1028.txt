Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 9, 3}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 9, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 0, 5, 2}
- Node 4: {7, 0, 1, 6, 3}
- Node 5: {2, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {4, 9, 1, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 9}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {7, 6, 8, 1, 0}

Next, we identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 9

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the final answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>,
<1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>,
<3, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>
