Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 1) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 0) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 11}
- Node 1: {8, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 7, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 9, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 10, 14}
- Node 9: {5, 7, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 5, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 3, 9, 12}
- Node 12: {2, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 14: {3, 4, 8, 10, 12}

Now, let's identify nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 10: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 11: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 13: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 14: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \(10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 78\)

Therefore, the final answer is [78].

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <3, (4, 5, 14)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (4, 9, 13)>
- <9, (5, 7, 13)>
- <10, (5, 9, 14)>
- <11, (3, 9, 12)>
- <13, (5, 9, 7)>
- <14, (3, 10, 12)>
