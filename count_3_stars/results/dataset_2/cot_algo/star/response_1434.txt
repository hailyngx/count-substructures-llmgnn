Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 14) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 12) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 1) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 12) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (4, 6) (4, 5) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: {8, 5}
- Node 1 neighbors: {8, 13, 7, 2}
- Node 2 neighbors: {3, 12, 1, 10, 7, 14}
- Node 3 neighbors: {6, 11, 7, 2, 14}
- Node 4 neighbors: {6, 5, 10}
- Node 5 neighbors: {6, 4, 0}
- Node 6 neighbors: {5, 3, 8, 4}
- Node 7 neighbors: {8, 3, 2, 1, 10}
- Node 8 neighbors: {6, 13, 11, 1, 7, 0}
- Node 9 neighbors: {14}
- Node 10 neighbors: {13, 2, 12, 7, 4}
- Node 11 neighbors: {8, 13, 3, 12}
- Node 12 neighbors: {11, 2, 10, 14}
- Node 13 neighbors: {8, 1, 10, 11}
- Node 14 neighbors: {9, 3, 2, 12}

Now, let's identify the 3-star graphs:
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <8, (6, 1, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <3, (6, 11, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <2, (3, 12, 14)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <1, (8, 13, 7)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <12, (11, 2, 14)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <10, (13, 2, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <4, (6, 5, 10)>

Thus, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [7].
