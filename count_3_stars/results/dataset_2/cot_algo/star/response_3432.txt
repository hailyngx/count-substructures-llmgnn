Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 26) (11, 4) (16, 25) (16, 8) (16, 10) (15, 27) (15, 3) (27, 15) (27, 25) (27, 20) (27, 3) (2, 29) (2, 17) (2, 4) (29, 2) (29, 4) (29, 24) (29, 10) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 23) (1, 4) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 5) (22, 6) (23, 1) (7, 21) (21, 7) (21, 26) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 18) (28, 0) (28, 24) (28, 5) (12, 14) (26, 11) (26, 21) (26, 20) (9, 11) (9, 25) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 28) (5, 19) (5, 20) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 25) (25, 16) (25, 27) (25, 9) (25, 19) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 24) (20, 27) (20, 1) (20, 26) (20, 5) (0, 28) (0, 6) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 29) (4, 1) (4, 19) (24, 29) (24, 28) (24, 14) (24, 10) (10, 16) (10, 29) (10, 24) (10, 18) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 17) (17, 2) (17, 18) (6, 22) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 28}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 20, 23}
- Node 2: {4, 17, 29}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 13, 15, 27}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 11, 19, 29}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 19, 20, 28}
- Node 6: {0, 22}
- Node 7: {21}
- Node 8: {5, 13, 16}
- Node 9: {11, 25}
- Node 10: {16, 18, 24, 29}
- Node 11: {4, 9, 14, 26}
- Node 12: {14}
- Node 13: {3, 8, 18}
- Node 14: {11, 12, 24}
- Node 15: {3, 27}
- Node 16: {8, 10, 25}
- Node 17: {2, 18}
- Node 18: {10, 13, 17}
- Node 19: {4, 5, 25}
- Node 20: {1, 5, 26, 27}
- Node 21: {7, 26}
- Node 22: {6}
- Node 23: {1}
- Node 24: {10, 14, 28, 29}
- Node 25: {9, 16, 19, 27}
- Node 26: {11, 20, 21}
- Node 27: {3, 15, 20, 25}
- Node 28: {0, 5, 24}
- Node 29: {2, 4, 10, 24}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1, 4, 5, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, and 29 have 3 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: <1, (3, 4, 20)>, <4, (1, 2, 19)>, <5, (3, 8, 28)>, <11, (4, 9, 26)>, <13, (3, 8, 18)>, <14, (11, 12, 24)>, <16, (8, 10, 25)>, <18, (10, 13, 17)>, <19, (4, 5, 25)>, <20, (1, 26, 27)>, <24, (10, 14, 29)>, <25, (9, 16, 27)>, <26, (11, 20, 21)>, <29, (2, 10, 24)>.
