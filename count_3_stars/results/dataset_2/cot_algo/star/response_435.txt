Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 2) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 1) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: {13, 14, 5, 2}
- Node 1 neighbors: {4, 8, 11, 2}
- Node 2 neighbors: {8, 0, 14, 5, 1}
- Node 3 neighbors: {6, 4, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 4 neighbors: {9, 8, 1, 3}
- Node 5 neighbors: {6, 10, 12, 0, 2}
- Node 6 neighbors: {5, 14, 7, 3}
- Node 7 neighbors: {6, 12, 3}
- Node 8 neighbors: {4, 2, 1}
- Node 9 neighbors: {4, 10, 13, 12}
- Node 10 neighbors: {9, 13, 5}
- Node 11 neighbors: {13, 3, 1}
- Node 12 neighbors: {9, 7, 5, 14}
- Node 13 neighbors: {9, 11, 10, 0}
- Node 14 neighbors: {6, 12, 0, 3, 2}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, Node 9, and Node 14 have 5 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 48

So, the final answer is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (13, 5, 2)>
- <0, (13, 14, 2)>
- <0, (13, 14, 5)>
- <0, (5, 2, 14)>

- <2, (1, 4, 11)>
- <2, (1, 11, 4)>
- <2, (4, 8, 1)>
- <2, (4, 8, 11)>
- <2, (4, 11, 1)>
- <2, (11, 1, 4)>
- <2, (11, 4, 8)>
- <5, (6, 12, 0)>
- <5, (6, 12, 14)>

- <5, (6, 14, 12)>
- <5, (12, 14, 0)>
- <6, (7, 3, 14)>
- <9, (4, 3, 11)>
- <9, (4, 11, 1)>
- <9, (4, 11, 13)>
- <9, (1, 4, 11)>
- <9, (1, 11, 4)>
- <9, (1, 11, 13)>
- <9, (11, 4, 1)>
- <9, (11, 4, 13)>
- <9, (11, 13, 4)>
- <9, (13, 11, 4)>
- <14, (12, 5, 0)>
- <14, (12, 5, 2)>
- <14, (5, 0, 13)>
- <14, (5, 2, 13)>
