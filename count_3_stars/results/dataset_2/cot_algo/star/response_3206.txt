Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 24) (11, 17) (16, 14) (16, 27) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 25) (7, 28) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 29) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 4) (3, 21) (3, 1) (3, 29) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 27) (26, 7) (26, 1) (26, 12) (2, 15) (2, 25) (4, 1) (4, 18) (4, 12) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 28) (18, 25) (17, 11) (17, 20) (0, 7) (0, 24) (0, 19) (0, 6) (25, 7) (25, 2) (25, 18) (25, 19) (23, 27) (23, 10) (20, 17) (20, 22) (20, 14) (20, 28) (12, 26) (12, 4) (12, 10) (5, 24) (19, 0) (19, 25) (19, 29) (19, 9) (24, 11) (24, 0) (24, 5) (6, 0) (6, 15) (14, 16) (14, 20) (14, 9) (29, 21) (29, 3) (29, 19) (29, 15) (10, 18) (10, 23) (10, 12) (10, 22) (27, 16) (27, 13) (27, 23) (27, 28) (9, 19) (9, 14) (28, 7) (28, 18) (28, 20) (28, 27) (15, 13) (15, 2) (15, 6) (15, 29) (22, 20) (22, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges.

Node 0: {7, 19, 24, 6}
Node 1: {3, 4, 26}
Node 2: {15, 25}
Node 3: {1, 21, 29}
Node 4: {1, 12, 18}
Node 5: {24}
Node 6: {0, 15}
Node 7: {0, 21, 25, 26, 28}
Node 8: {13}
Node 9: {14, 19}
Node 10: {12, 18, 22, 23}
Node 11: {17, 24}
Node 12: {4, 10, 26}
Node 13: {8, 15, 27}
Node 14: {9, 16, 20}
Node 15: {2, 6, 13, 29}
Node 16: {14, 27}
Node 17: {11, 20}
Node 18: {4, 10, 25, 28}
Node 19: {0, 9, 25, 29}
Node 20: {17, 14, 28, 22}
Node 21: {3, 7, 29}
Node 22: {10, 20}
Node 23: {10, 27}
Node 24: {0, 5, 11}
Node 25: {2, 7, 18, 19}
Node 26: {1, 7, 12}
Node 27: {13, 16, 23, 28}
Node 28: {7, 18, 20, 27}
Node 29: {3, 15, 19, 21}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node.

Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 43

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [43]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<7, (0, 21, 25)>
<15, (2, 13, 29)>
<18, (4, 10, 25)>
<19, (0, 9, 29)>
<20, (14, 17, 28)>
<21, (3, 7, 29)>
<25, (2, 18, 19)>
<27, (13, 16, 23)>
<28, (18, 20, 27)>
<29, (15, 19, 21)>
