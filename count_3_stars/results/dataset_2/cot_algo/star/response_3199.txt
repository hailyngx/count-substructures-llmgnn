Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 0) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 0) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 13) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5, 8, 12}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {6, 12}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 10: {11, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {2, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 4, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 7, 10, 13}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 2, 7, 12, and 13 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- For Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) possible 3-stars
- For Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44].

List of unique 3-stars:
- <2, (5, 12, 13)>
- <7, (1, 4, 14)>
- <12, (1, 7, 14)>
- <13, (2, 4, 11)>
