Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 10) (27, 11) (27, 26) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 29) (8, 11) (13, 20) (13, 10) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 20) (11, 27) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 1) (23, 8) (23, 1) (22, 6) (22, 17) (22, 12) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 20) (6, 22) (6, 28) (6, 17) (6, 12) (28, 6) (28, 16) (28, 12) (28, 15) (28, 20) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 16) (3, 19) (21, 25) (21, 2) (1, 11) (1, 23) (1, 15) (1, 9) (15, 28) (15, 1) (15, 29) (15, 14) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 2) (19, 5) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 24) (2, 21) (2, 16) (12, 22) (12, 6) (12, 28) (17, 22) (17, 6) (17, 4) (17, 7) (9, 1) (9, 20) (9, 7) (25, 21) (25, 19) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 29) (24, 8) (24, 19) (24, 7) (7, 17) (7, 9) (7, 24) (29, 8) (29, 15) (29, 14) (20, 13) (20, 10) (20, 5) (20, 28) (20, 9) (26, 27) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 10
- Node 1: 11, 23, 15, 9
- Node 2: 21, 16
- Node 3: 19
- Node 4: 5, 18, 14, 17
- Node 5: 19, 4, 20
- Node 6: 22, 28, 17, 12
- Node 7: 17, 9, 24
- Node 8: 23, 24, 29, 11
- Node 9: 1, 20, 7
- Node 10: 0, 13, 11, 20
- Node 11: 27, 8, 10, 1
- Node 12: 22, 6, 28
- Node 13: 20, 10
- Node 14: 4, 15, 29
- Node 15: 28, 1, 29, 14
- Node 16: 28, 18, 2
- Node 17: 22, 6, 4, 7
- Node 18: 4, 16
- Node 19: 5, 3, 25, 24
- Node 20: 13, 10, 5, 28, 9
- Node 21: 25, 2
- Node 22: 6, 17, 12
- Node 23: 8, 1
- Node 24: 8, 19, 7
- Node 25: 21, 19
- Node 26: 27
- Node 27: 11, 26
- Node 28: 6, 16, 12, 15, 20
- Node 29: 8, 15, 14

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding all these up: \( 4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+10+4+10+1 = 57 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [57].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (11, 15, 23)>
<4, (5, 17, 18)>
<6, (12, 17, 22)>
<8, (23, 11, 24)>
<10, (0, 13, 20)>
<11, (1, 10, 27)>
<15, (1, 14, 29)>
<17, (4, 6, 22)>
<19, (24, 25, 19)>
<20, (9, 13, 28)>
<24, (19, 7, 24)>
<28, (15, 20, 6)>
<29, (14, 15, 8)>
