Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 5) (15, 12) (15, 16) (14, 17) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 0) (19, 5) (19, 7) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 4) (1, 13) (2, 12) (2, 16) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 2) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 19) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (6, 10) (6, 16) (18, 17) (18, 10) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 1) (16, 15) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 6) 

Response:
Since we have a total of 20 nodes, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

We start by listing the degrees of each node:

- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 2

Next, we identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 4, 13
- Node 2: 12, 16
- Node 3: 0, 13, 5
- Node 4: 8, 9, 13, 1
- Node 5: 3, 0, 12, 19
- Node 6: 10, 16
- Node 7: 17, 10, 11, 19
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 4, 8, 0, 12
- Node 10: 11, 6, 18, 7
- Node 11: 10, 7, 13
- Node 12: 15, 5, 9, 2
- Node 13: 3, 11, 4, 1
- Node 14: 17, 16
- Node 15: 12, 16
- Node 16: 15, 14, 2, 6
- Node 17: 14, 18, 7
- Node 18: 17, 10
- Node 19: 5, 7

Now we apply the combinatorial calculation to nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 three-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 three-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 three-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 three-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 three-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 three-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 three-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 three-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 three-star.

Finally, we sum up the total number of three-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8, which gives us the final answer of [8].

The unique three-stars found in the graph are: 
<4, 8, 9>, <5, 3, 19>, <7, 10, 11>, <9, 0, 12>, <10, 7, 18>, <12, 2, 16>, <13, 1, 4>, <16, 14, 2>
