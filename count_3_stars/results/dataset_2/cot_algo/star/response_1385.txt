Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 15) (9, 3) (26, 28) (26, 3) (11, 16) (11, 23) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 19) (16, 14) (16, 27) (18, 22) (18, 17) (18, 3) (22, 18) (22, 0) (22, 8) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 17) (27, 16) (27, 12) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 20) (28, 26) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 10) (5, 13) (5, 23) (5, 1) (5, 25) (5, 17) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 24) (8, 9) (8, 22) (8, 24) (8, 10) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 14) (19, 16) (19, 4) (25, 5) (25, 21) (25, 10) (29, 9) (29, 16) (29, 21) (2, 12) (2, 4) (24, 13) (24, 8) (15, 9) (15, 0) (0, 22) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 3) (3, 9) (3, 26) (3, 18) (3, 0) (1, 7) (1, 5) (21, 13) (21, 25) (21, 29) (21, 4) (4, 19) (4, 2) (4, 21) (10, 6) (10, 28) (10, 8) (10, 25) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 5) (14, 16) (14, 23) (20, 6) 

Response:
There are several nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {9, 26, 18, 0}
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: {13, 23, 1, 25, 17}
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {9, 22, 24, 10}
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {6, 28, 25, 8}
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: {7, 5, 21, 24}
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors: {11, 29, 19, 14, 27}
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors: {13, 25, 29, 4}
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: {18, 0, 8, 28}

For these nodes, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 21 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes: 
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 40 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([40]\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (9, 26, 18)>
- <5, (13, 23, 1)>
- <8, (9, 22, 24)>
- <10, (6, 28, 25)>
- <13, (7, 5, 21)>
- <16, (11, 29, 19)>
- <21, (13, 25, 29)>
- <22, (18, 0, 8)>
