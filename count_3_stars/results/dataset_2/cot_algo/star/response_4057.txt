Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 15) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 10) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (15, 14) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 18) (16, 15) (16, 18) (16, 4) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 1) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 7) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 16) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 3) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 4) (12, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (4, 17) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 14, 17, 10
- Node 1: 17, 12, 8, 7
- Node 2: 10, 19, 4
- Node 3: 7, 13
- Node 4: 17, 5, 16, 2
- Node 5: 6, 4
- Node 6: 5, 10
- Node 7: 1, 19, 3
- Node 8: 17, 10, 1, 19
- Node 9: 18, 15, 13
- Node 10: 6, 11, 0, 8, 2
- Node 11: 10, 13
- Node 12: 1
- Node 13: 9, 11, 3
- Node 14: 0, 15
- Node 15: 14, 9, 16, 18
- Node 16: 15, 18, 4
- Node 17: 1, 0, 8, 4
- Node 18: 9, 15, 16
- Node 19: 8, 2, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 1, Node 8, Node 10, and Node 17 each have 4 neighbors, resulting in inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars each.
- Node 4, Node 9, Node 15, and Node 18 each have 4 neighbors, resulting in inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars each.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4] = [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (8, 17, 4)>
- <1, (8, 17, 10)>
- <1, (10, 17, 4)>
- <1, (10, 17, 8)>
- <4, (15, 18, 16)>
- <4, (9, 15, 18)>
- <4, (9, 15, 16)>
- <4, (9, 16, 18)>
