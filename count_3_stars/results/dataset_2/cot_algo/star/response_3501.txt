Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 13}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 5, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 10: {4, 5, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {9, 14}
- Node 12: {3, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 13: {2, 7, 12}
- Node 14: {6, 8, 11}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (4, 5, 14)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (3, 5, 12)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (10, 8, 13)>

Since each of these nodes forms one 3-star, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [4].
