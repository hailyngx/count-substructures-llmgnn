This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 11) (18, 14) (18, 22) (18, 20) (18, 0) (18, 3) (22, 18) (22, 4) (22, 5) (20, 18) (20, 21) (25, 19) (25, 15) (25, 0) (25, 12) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 27) (13, 5) (1, 26) (1, 12) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 7) (28, 26) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 12) (5, 14) (5, 22) (5, 13) (6, 16) (6, 27) (21, 20) (19, 14) (19, 25) (19, 23) (23, 19) (0, 18) (0, 25) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 24) (10, 26) (10, 0) (10, 3) (4, 22) (4, 24) (4, 16) (7, 14) (7, 26) (7, 11) (7, 15) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 24) (24, 0) (24, 4) (24, 16) (24, 9) (27, 8) (27, 29) (27, 6) (3, 18) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 25) (15, 7) (15, 11) (2, 11) (9, 11) (9, 24) (12, 25) (12, 1) (12, 29) (12, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {18, 25, 8, 10, 24}
- Node 1: {26, 12}
- Node 2: {11}
- Node 3: {18, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {22, 24, 16}
- Node 5: {14, 22, 13}
- Node 6: {16, 27}
- Node 7: {14, 26, 11, 15}
- Node 8: {16, 0, 27}
- Node 9: {11, 24}
- Node 10: {26, 0, 3}
- Node 11: {17, 7, 9, 2, 15}
- Node 12: {25, 1, 29, 3}
- Node 13: {5}
- Node 14: {17, 18, 7, 19, 5}
- Node 15: {25, 7, 11}
- Node 16: {8, 6, 4, 24}
- Node 17: {14, 11}
- Node 18: {14, 22, 20, 0, 3}
- Node 19: {25, 14, 23}
- Node 20: {18, 21}
- Node 21: {20}
- Node 22: {18, 4, 5}
- Node 23: {19}
- Node 24: {0, 4, 16, 9}
- Node 25: {19, 15, 0, 12}
- Node 26: {1, 28, 10, 7}
- Node 27: {8, 29, 6}
- Node 28: {26, 29}
- Node 29: {28, 27, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, 3 neighbors: [1]
- Node 3, 3 neighbors: [1]
- Node 4, 3 neighbors: [1]
- Node 5, 3 neighbors: [1]
- Node 7, 4 neighbors: 4C3 = 4
- Node 8, 3 neighbors: [1]
- Node 11, 5 neighbors: 5C3 = 10
- Node 12, 4 neighbors: 4C3 = 4
- Node 14, 5 neighbors: 5C3 = 10
- Node 16, 4 neighbors: 4C3 = 4
- Node 18, 5 neighbors: 5C3 = 10
- Node 24, 4 neighbors: 4C3 = 4
- Node 25, 4 neighbors: 4C3 = 4
- Node 26, 4 neighbors: 4C3 = 4
- Node 27, 3 neighbors: [1]
- Node 29, 3 neighbors: [1]

Adding them up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].
