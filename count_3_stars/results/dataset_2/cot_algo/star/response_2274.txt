Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 5) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 10) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 13, 7, 3, 1}
- Node 1: {0, 11, 5}
- Node 2: {6, 4}
- Node 3: {6, 9, 0, 14, 5}
- Node 4: {5, 11, 2}
- Node 5: {8, 4, 1, 3, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 3, 2, 8, 13}
- Node 7: {12, 0, 10, 14}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 13, 5, 10}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 3, 0}
- Node 10: {8, 7, 14}
- Node 11: {13, 4, 1}
- Node 12: {13, 7, 14}
- Node 13: {6, 8, 12, 11, 0}
- Node 14: {7, 12, 3, 5, 10}

Next, we will identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed around them:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 14 (6 nodes). Each forms 1 3-star.
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 13 (6 nodes). Each forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 6 (from nodes with 3 neighbors) + 60 (from nodes with more than 3 neighbors) = 66.

Thus, the final answer is [66].

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (9, 13, 7)>
- <3, (6, 8, 13)>
- <5, (8, 10, 14)>
- <6, (9, 3, 2)>
- <8, (9, 13, 12)>
- <13, (6, 8, 12)>
- <4, (5, 11, 2)>
- <7, (12, 14, 0)>
- <10, (8, 7, 14)>
- <11, (13, 4, 1)>
- <12, (13, 7, 14)>
- <14, (7, 12, 3)>
