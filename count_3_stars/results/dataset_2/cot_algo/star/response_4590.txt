Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 26) (16, 11) (16, 24) (2, 29) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 5) (1, 26) (1, 25) (1, 19) (1, 22) (26, 11) (26, 1) (26, 0) (17, 29) (17, 7) (5, 29) (5, 24) (6, 24) (6, 19) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 21) (21, 3) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 12) (21, 18) (10, 21) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (8, 11) (8, 27) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 23) (25, 1) (25, 27) (25, 4) (25, 22) (25, 14) (27, 21) (27, 8) (27, 25) (24, 16) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 22) (24, 20) (4, 2) (4, 25) (4, 22) (22, 1) (22, 25) (22, 24) (22, 4) (7, 17) (7, 20) (7, 18) (20, 24) (20, 7) (9, 2) (9, 28) (9, 12) (28, 9) (28, 14) (0, 26) (0, 15) (0, 12) (18, 21) (18, 7) (18, 12) (13, 11) (23, 19) (12, 21) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 18) (14, 15) (14, 25) (14, 28) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {26, 15, 12}
- Node 1: {26, 25, 19, 22}
- Node 2: {29, 9, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {11, 2, 21}
- Node 4: {2, 25, 22}
- Node 5: {29, 24}
- Node 6: {24, 19}
- Node 7: {17, 20, 18}
- Node 8: {11, 27}
- Node 9: {2, 28, 12}
- Node 10: {21, 15}
- Node 11: {16, 3, 13, 8, 26}
- Node 12: {21, 0, 9, 18}
- Node 13: {11}
- Node 14: {15, 25, 28}
- Node 15: {10, 0, 14}
- Node 16: {11, 24}
- Node 17: {29, 7}
- Node 18: {21, 7, 12}
- Node 19: {1, 6, 23}
- Node 20: {24, 7}
- Node 21: {3, 10, 27, 12, 18}
- Node 22: {1, 4, 25, 24}
- Node 23: {19}
- Node 24: {16, 5, 6, 22, 20}
- Node 25: {1, 4, 22, 14, 27}
- Node 26: {11, 1, 0}
- Node 27: {8, 25, 21}
- Node 28: {9, 14}
- Node 29: {2, 17, 5}

Next, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:

- Node 11: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 12: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 21: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 24: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 25: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 52\)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([52]\).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <11, (3, 13, 26)>
- <11, (3, 13, 8)>
- <11, (3, 13, 16)>
- <11, (3, 13, 26)>
- <11, (8, 16, 26)>
- <11, (8, 16, 3)>
- <11, (8, 16, 26)>
- <11, (8, 16, 3)>
- <1, (19, 22, 25)>
- <1, (19, 22, 6)>
- <1, (19, 22, 4)>
- <2, (29, 4, 9)>
- <2, (29, 4, 3)>
- <2, (29, 4, 9)>
- <2, (29, 4, 3)>
- <12, (18, 21, 7)>
- <12, (18, 21, 9)>
- <12, (18, 21, 0)>
- <21, (10, 27, 25)>
- <21, (10, 27, 18)>
- <21, (10, 27, 12)>
- <24, (20, 22, 7)>
- <24, (20, 22, 5)>
- <24, (20, 22, 6)>
- <25, (14, 28, 15)>
- <25, (14, 28, 27)>
- <25, (14, 28, 15)>
