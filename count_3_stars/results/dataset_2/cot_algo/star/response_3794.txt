Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {7, 8, 6, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 0, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 8, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 1, 6, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8, 6, 2, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 8, 5, 3, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 0, 9, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 5, 0, 6, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7, 8, 2, 3}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3, 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 6, 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8, 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9, 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 38.

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (7, 8, 6)>
<0, (8, 6, 3)>
<0, (6, 3, 5)>
<0, (6, 5, 8)>

<8, (5, 6, 0)>
<8, (5, 6, 3)>

<9, (7, 8, 9)>
