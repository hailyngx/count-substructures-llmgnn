Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 11) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 14) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 6) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of its adjacency list:

- Node 0: 1, 11, 14, 13, 2
- Node 1: 4, 7, 0
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8, 0, 14, 13
- Node 3: 9, 10, 8
- Node 4: 9, 7, 8, 2, 1
- Node 5: 9, 13, 12, 11
- Node 6: 14, 2, 12, 8
- Node 7: 4, 12, 13, 1
- Node 8: 4, 3, 6, 2, 14
- Node 9: 5, 4, 10, 3
- Node 10: 9, 3, 11
- Node 11: 5, 10, 0
- Node 12: 5, 7, 6
- Node 13: 5, 7, 0, 2
- Node 14: 6, 8, 0, 2

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph. We'll look at each node's neighbors and identify any potential 3-star configurations.

- For Node 0: This node has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. However, it only forms one 3-star: <0, 1, 13>.
  
- For Node 2: This node also has 6 neighbors, so it can potentially form 20 3-stars. However, it only forms one 3-star: <2, 6, 8>.

Since these are the only nodes with three or more neighbors that can form 3-stars, we have a total of 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
