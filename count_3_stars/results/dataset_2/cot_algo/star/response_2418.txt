Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 23) (1, 19) (1, 27) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 1) (6, 28) (6, 0) (28, 6) (28, 16) (28, 24) (28, 18) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 16) (0, 2) (14, 23) (22, 26) (22, 27) (22, 5) (26, 22) (26, 15) (11, 9) (11, 17) (11, 20) (17, 11) (17, 2) (29, 21) (7, 3) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 18) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 8) (16, 28) (16, 0) (10, 9) (10, 5) (21, 29) (21, 18) (2, 0) (2, 17) (2, 9) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 4) (12, 20) (12, 8) (12, 23) (27, 1) (27, 22) (27, 25) (15, 26) (19, 1) (19, 13) (20, 11) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 8) (20, 13) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 25) (13, 19) (13, 20) (13, 9) (13, 24) (8, 25) (8, 12) (8, 20) (23, 1) (23, 14) (23, 12) (5, 22) (5, 10) (5, 4) (18, 28) (18, 7) (18, 21) (18, 24) (24, 28) (24, 13) (24, 18) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 6, 16}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 19, 23, 27}
- Node 2: {0, 9, 17}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 4: {5, 10, 12}
- Node 5: {4, 10, 22}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 28}
- Node 7: {3, 18, 20, 25}
- Node 8: {12, 13, 20, 25}
- Node 9: {2, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 11: {9, 17, 20}
- Node 12: {4, 8, 20, 23}
- Node 13: {8, 9, 13, 19, 24, 25}
- Node 14: {23}
- Node 15: {26}
- Node 16: {0, 28}
- Node 17: {2, 11}
- Node 18: {7, 21, 24, 28}
- Node 19: {1, 13}
- Node 20: {7, 8, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 21: {18, 29}
- Node 22: {5, 26, 27}
- Node 23: {1, 12, 14}
- Node 24: {13, 18, 28}
- Node 25: {7, 8, 13, 27}
- Node 26: {15, 22}
- Node 27: {1, 22, 25}
- Node 28: {6, 16, 18, 24}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0: Forms 3-star with {2, 3, 6}
- Node 1: Forms 3-star with {3, 19, 23}, {3, 19, 27}, and {3, 23, 27}
- Node 3: Forms 3-star with {1, 7, 27}
- Node 6: Forms 3-star with {1, 28, 27}
- Node 7: Forms 3-star with {18, 20, 25}
- Node 8: Forms 3-star with {12, 20, 13}
- Node 9: Forms 3-star with {10, 11, 13}
- Node 12: Forms 3-star with {20, 23, 13}
- Node 13: Forms 3-star with {19, 24, 25}
- Node 18: Forms 3-star with {21, 24, 28}

Total number of 3-stars = 12 = [12]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- <1, (3, 19, 23)>
- <1, (3, 19, 27)>
- <1, (3, 23, 27)>
- <3, (1, 7, 27)>
- <6, (1, 28, 27)>
- <7, (18, 20, 25)>
- <8, (12, 20, 13)>
- <9, (10, 11, 13)>
- <12, (20, 23, 13)>
- <13, (19, 24, 25)>
- <18, (21, 24, 28)>
