Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 23) (26, 15) (26, 17) (15, 26) (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 18) (27, 28) (27, 7) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (20, 18) (20, 19) (20, 24) (25, 13) (25, 19) (25, 11) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 24) (2, 28) (8, 14) (8, 22) (17, 26) (17, 5) (17, 21) (29, 7) (29, 10) (1, 28) (1, 12) (19, 20) (19, 25) (19, 23) (23, 9) (23, 19) (23, 18) (0, 16) (0, 5) (16, 0) (16, 10) (22, 2) (22, 8) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 0) (7, 27) (7, 29) (7, 28) (14, 8) (14, 24) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 24) (3, 18) (24, 20) (24, 2) (24, 14) (24, 3) (24, 4) (18, 27) (18, 20) (18, 23) (18, 3) (18, 28) (13, 6) (13, 25) (13, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (10, 29) (10, 16) (10, 14) (4, 6) (4, 24) (4, 13) (4, 11) (11, 25) (11, 4) (11, 21) (28, 27) (28, 2) (28, 1) (28, 7) (28, 18) (21, 17) (21, 11) 

Response:
Since we have a total of 90 edges in the graph with 30 nodes, we can establish that the average degree of each node is \( \frac{2 \times 90}{30} = 6 \). 

Let's first find the set of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {16, 5}
- Node 1: {28, 12}
- Node 2: {22, 5, 24, 28}
- Node 3: {9, 24, 18}
- Node 4: {6, 24, 13, 11}
- Node 5: {2, 17, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 12, 4, 13}
- Node 7: {27, 29, 28}
- Node 8: {14, 22}
- Node 9: {6, 3, 23}
- Node 10: {29, 16, 14}
- Node 11: {25, 4, 21}
- Node 12: {6, 1}
- Node 13: {6, 25, 4}
- Node 14: {8, 24, 10}
- Node 15: {26, 27}
- Node 16: {0, 10}
- Node 17: {26, 21, 5}
- Node 18: {27, 20, 23, 3, 28}
- Node 19: {20, 25, 23}
- Node 20: {18, 19, 24}
- Node 21: {17, 11}
- Node 22: {2, 8}
- Node 23: {9, 19, 18}
- Node 24: {20, 2, 14, 3, 4}
- Node 25: {13, 19, 11}
- Node 26: {15, 17}
- Node 27: {15, 18, 28, 7}
- Node 28: {27, 2, 1, 7, 18}
- Node 29: {7, 10}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: 0
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 0
- Node 10: 0
- Node 11: 1
- Node 12: 0
- Node 13: 0
- Node 14: 0
- Node 15: 0
- Node 16: 0
- Node 17: 0
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: 0
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: 0
- Node 22: 0
- Node 23: 0
- Node 24: 2
- Node 25: 0
- Node 26: 0
- Node 27: 1
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: 0

Summing up the 3-stars, we have a total of 30 [3-stars]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (4, 24, 14)>, <3, (9, 24, 18)>, <4, (6, 24, 13)>, <5, (17, 21, 11)>, <6, (9, 12, 4)>, <7, (27, 28, 18)>.
