Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 12) (14, 1) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 19) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 5) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 11) (0, 18) (0, 2) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (4, 5) (4, 18) (18, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 7) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 16) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 19) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 9) (19, 16) (12, 15) (12, 2) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (7, 3) (7, 18) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 19) 

Response:
First, we need to find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {2, 18}
Node 1: {13, 14, 15, 16}
Node 2: {0, 8, 12}
Node 3: {5, 6, 7}
Node 4: {5, 18}
Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 10, 11}
Node 6: {3, 5, 11}
Node 7: {3, 18}
Node 8: {2, 9, 16}
Node 9: {8, 17, 19}
Node 10: {5, 15, 17}
Node 11: {5, 6, 13}
Node 12: {2, 15}
Node 13: {1, 11, 19}
Node 14: {1}
Node 15: {1, 10, 12}
Node 16: {1, 8, 9, 17, 19}
Node 17: {9, 10, 16}
Node 18: {0, 4, 7, 19}
Node 19: {9, 13, 16, 18}

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors where we can potentially form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 5, 15, 16, 19

For each of these nodes, we find the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [29], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, 13, 15>, <1, 13, 16>, <1, 13, 19>, <1, 15, 16>, <1, 15, 19>, <1, 16, 19>, 
<5, 3, 4>, <5, 3, 6>, <5, 3, 11>, <5, 4, 6>, <5, 4, 10>, <5, 4, 11>, <5, 6, 11>, <5, 10, 11>, <3, 5, 6>, 
<15, 2, 12>, <15, 10, 17>, <15, 10, 5>, <15, 1, 13>, <15, 1, 16>, <15, 1, 17>, <15, 12, 2>, <16, 8, 9>, <16, 8, 17>, <16, 8, 19>, <16, 9, 17>, <16, 9, 19>, <16, 17, 19>, 
<19, 7, 18>
