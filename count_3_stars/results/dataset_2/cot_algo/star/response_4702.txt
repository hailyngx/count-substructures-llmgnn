Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 23) (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 25) (14, 5) (17, 14) (3, 11) (3, 27) (3, 22) (25, 14) (25, 0) (25, 28) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 1) (27, 3) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 19) (10, 15) (10, 13) (28, 9) (28, 14) (28, 25) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 6) (29, 11) (6, 29) (6, 1) (6, 18) (2, 8) (2, 15) (8, 2) (8, 0) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 23) (7, 18) (22, 26) (22, 3) (22, 5) (24, 26) (24, 13) (11, 3) (11, 29) (11, 13) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 5) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 18) (5, 14) (5, 22) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 4) (13, 10) (13, 24) (13, 11) (13, 5) (0, 25) (0, 8) (16, 12) (16, 4) (19, 27) (19, 7) (19, 4) (23, 26) (23, 7) (23, 20) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 19) (20, 23) (20, 21) (21, 20) (18, 27) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {25, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {12, 6, 15, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {8, 15}
- Node 3: Neighbors {11, 27, 22}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 16, 19}
- Node 5: Neighbors {14, 22, 1, 13, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {29, 1, 18}
- Node 7: Neighbors {12, 19, 23, 18}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {26, 28}
- Node 10: Neighbors {15, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors {3, 29, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {27, 7, 16, 1}
- Node 13: Neighbors {10, 24, 11, 5}
- Node 14: Neighbors {17, 28, 25, 5}
- Node 15: Neighbors {10, 2, 1, 18}
- Node 16: Neighbors {12, 4}
- Node 17: Neighbors {14}
- Node 18: Neighbors {27, 6, 7, 15}
- Node 19: Neighbors {27, 7, 4}
- Node 20: Neighbors {23, 21}
- Node 21: Neighbors {20}
- Node 22: Neighbors {26, 3, 5}
- Node 23: Neighbors {26, 7, 20}
- Node 24: Neighbors {26, 13}
- Node 25: Neighbors {14, 0, 28}
- Node 26: Neighbors {9, 22, 24, 23}
- Node 27: Neighbors {3, 12, 18, 19}
- Node 28: Neighbors {14, 25, 9, 29}
- Node 29: Neighbors {28, 6, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate how many 3-stars are formed using the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star <1, (6, 15, 12)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star <5, (1, 13, 14)>
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star <12, (1, 27, 7)>
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star <13, (11, 5, 10)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star <14, (17, 25, 28)>
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star <15, (2, 1, 18)>
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star <18, (27, 6, 7)>
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star <19, (27, 7, 4)>
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star <22, (26, 3, 5)>
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star <26, (9, 23, 24)>
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star <27, (3, 12, 18)>
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star <28, (14, 25, 29)>

Total number of 3-stars = 11, so the final answer is [11].
