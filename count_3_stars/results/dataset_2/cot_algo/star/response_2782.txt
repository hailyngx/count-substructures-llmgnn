Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 12) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 29) (5, 9) (5, 28) (5, 27) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 19) (7, 20) (7, 24) (7, 19) (7, 26) (21, 13) (21, 11) (21, 15) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 14) (27, 5) (27, 12) (27, 24) (28, 5) (28, 2) (29, 22) (29, 25) (29, 15) (29, 14) (26, 13) (26, 7) (26, 10) (26, 25) (26, 4) (10, 26) (10, 1) (15, 9) (15, 21) (15, 29) (15, 14) (11, 9) (11, 21) (11, 23) (11, 24) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 24) (8, 20) (8, 18) (1, 10) (6, 14) (19, 22) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 2) (24, 7) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 23) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 4) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 29) (14, 15) (14, 6) (20, 7) (20, 8) (20, 4) (20, 16) (2, 28) (2, 19) (2, 17) (4, 26) (4, 23) (4, 17) (4, 20) (25, 29) (25, 26) (16, 20) (18, 13) (18, 8) (18, 17) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 1: {10}
- Node 2: {17, 19, 28}
- Node 4: {17, 20, 23, 26}
- Node 5: {9, 14, 27, 28}
- Node 6: {14}
- Node 7: {19, 20, 24, 26}
- Node 8: {12, 13, 17, 18}
- Node 9: {5, 11, 15, 19}
- Node 10: {1, 26}
- Node 11: {9, 21, 23, 24}
- Node 12: {8, 13, 14, 27}
- Node 13: {8, 12, 18, 21, 22, 26}
- Node 14:  {5, 6, 15, 29}
- Node 15: {9, 14, 15, 21, 29}
- Node 16: {20}
- Node 17: {2, 4, 8, 18}
- Node 18: {8, 13, 17}
- Node 19: {2, 7, 9, 19, 22}
- Node 20: {4, 7, 16, 20}
- Node 21: {11, 13, 15}
- Node 22: {13, 19, 29}
- Node 23: {4, 11, 24}
- Node 24: {7, 11, 23, 24, 27}
- Node 25: {26, 29}
- Node 26: {4, 7, 10, 13, 25}
- Node 27: {5, 12, 24, 27}
- Node 28: {2, 5}
- Node 29: {14, 15, 22, 25}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 19: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 20: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 24: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 26: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 29: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 65 3-stars, which gives the final answer as [65].
