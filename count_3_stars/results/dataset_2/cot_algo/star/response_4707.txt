Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 15) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (4, 19) (8, 3) (8, 19) (17, 6) (17, 2) (9, 19) (9, 0) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 9) (19, 12) (2, 17) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 18) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 13) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 14) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 15) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 6) (13, 18) (13, 15) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 2: {17}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 4: {19}
- Node 5: {1, 12, 15}
- Node 6: {7, 10, 14, 17}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 19}
- Node 9: {0, 19}
- Node 10: {0, 6, 18}
- Node 11: {1, 15, 16, 18}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 14, 19}
- Node 13: {15, 18}
- Node 14: {3, 6, 12}
- Node 15: {5, 11, 13, 16}
- Node 16: {11, 15}
- Node 17: {2, 6}
- Node 18: {10, 11, 13}
- Node 19: {4, 8, 9, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0, Node 3, and Node 19 can form a 3-star: <0, 3, 19>
- Node 1, Node 11, and Node 15 can form a 3-star: <1, 11, 15>
- Node 3, Node 7, and Node 14 can form a 3-star: <3, 7, 14>
- Node 6, Node 10, and Node 17 can form a 3-star: <6, 10, 17>
- Node 11, Node 13, and Node 18 can form a 3-star: <11, 13, 18>

There are 5 unique 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [5].
