Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 8) (13, 12) (22, 26) (22, 2) (22, 15) (22, 24) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 25) (1, 27) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 15) (5, 27) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 20) (17, 16) (29, 15) (29, 12) (21, 24) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 27) (24, 22) (24, 21) (24, 14) (24, 23) (26, 22) (16, 17) (16, 21) (16, 18) (16, 4) (28, 14) (28, 2) (18, 3) (18, 16) (18, 10) (19, 0) (19, 23) (2, 22) (2, 28) (2, 7) (0, 8) (0, 19) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 20) (11, 8) (14, 24) (14, 28) (14, 12) (14, 25) (25, 1) (25, 14) (25, 4) (23, 5) (23, 24) (23, 19) (20, 6) (20, 21) (20, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (15, 22) (15, 5) (15, 29) (15, 7) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 15) (12, 13) (12, 29) (12, 14) (12, 9) (27, 1) (27, 5) (27, 21) (4, 3) (4, 16) (4, 25) 

Response:
First, we need to find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges. 

Node 0: {8, 19}
Node 1: {3, 6, 25, 27}
Node 2: {7, 22, 28}
Node 3: {1, 4, 10, 18}
Node 4: {3, 16, 25}
Node 5: {6, 15, 23, 27}
Node 6: {1, 5, 20}
Node 7: {2, 8, 9, 15}
Node 8: {0, 7, 11, 13}
Node 9: {7, 12}
Node 10: {3, 18, 20}
Node 11: {8}
Node 12: {9, 13, 14, 29}
Node 13: {8, 12}
Node 14: {12, 24, 25, 28}
Node 15: {5, 7, 22, 29}
Node 16: {4, 17, 18, 21}
Node 17: {16}
Node 18: {3, 10, 16}
Node 19: {0, 23}
Node 20: {6, 10, 21}
Node 21: {16, 20, 24, 27}
Node 22: {2, 15, 24, 26}
Node 23: {5, 19, 24}
Node 24: {14, 21, 22, 23}
Node 25: {1, 4, 14}
Node 26: {22}
Node 27: {1, 5, 21}
Node 28: {2, 14}
Node 29: {12, 15}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node that has three or more neighbors.

For Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For Node 12: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For Node 14: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For Node 15: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For Node 16: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For Node 21: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For Node 22: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For Node 24: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For Node 25: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For Node 27: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get \(4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 47\).

Therefore, the final answer is [47], and the unique 3-star configurations are:
<1, (3, 6, 25)>
<3, (1, 4, 10)>
<5, (6, 15, 27)>
<6, (1, 5, 20)>
<7, (2, 8, 15)>
<8, (0, 7, 13)>
<12, (9, 13, 29)>
<14, (24, 25, 28)>
<15, (5, 7, 22)>
<16, (4, 17, 18)>
<21, (16, 20, 24)>
<22, (15, 24, 26)>
<24, (14, 21, 23)>
<25, (1, 4, 14)>
<27, (1, 5, 21)>
