Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 12) (16, 10) (16, 15) (4, 7) (4, 15) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 9) (3, 19) (14, 8) (14, 13) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 5) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (18, 13) (18, 8) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 8) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 2) (19, 6) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 6) (15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 19) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 18) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 12) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 9) (13, 14) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {6, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 19}
- Node 3: {9, 19}
- Node 4: {7, 15}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 8, 17, 19}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 17, 19}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 11}
- Node 8: {5, 10, 14, 18}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 12}
- Node 10: {8, 16, 17}
- Node 11: {7, 12}
- Node 12: {9, 11, 17}
- Node 13: {14, 18}
- Node 14: {8, 13}
- Node 15: {4, 16, 19}
- Node 16: {10, 15}
- Node 17: {5, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 18: {8, 13}
- Node 19: {2, 3, 5, 6, 15}

Next, we identify nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 1: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 5: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 12: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 15: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 17: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 36

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (1, 8, 17)>
<6, (2, 17, 19)>
<8, (5, 10, 18)>
<9, (1, 3, 12)>
<9, (0, 1, 9)>
<10, (8, 16, 17)>
<12, (9, 11, 17)>
<17, (5, 6, 10)>
<19, (2, 5, 6)>
<19, (3, 5, 15)>
