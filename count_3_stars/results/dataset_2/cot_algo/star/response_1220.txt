Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>.
