Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 14) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 21) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 9) (21, 23) (21, 10) (21, 13) (21, 20) (28, 1) (7, 22) (25, 27) (25, 0) (25, 12) (25, 11) (16, 17) (16, 27) (13, 21) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 27) (19, 9) (27, 25) (27, 16) (27, 5) (27, 10) (9, 18) (9, 19) (9, 29) (9, 24) (29, 9) (29, 1) (29, 26) (10, 8) (10, 21) (10, 13) (10, 27) (22, 7) (22, 24) (12, 25) (1, 28) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 29) (1, 4) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 26) (6, 0) (14, 15) (14, 23) (14, 2) (20, 21) (20, 24) (26, 29) (26, 6) (0, 8) (0, 25) (0, 6) (0, 24) (24, 9) (24, 22) (24, 20) (24, 0) (11, 25) (11, 5) (11, 4) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 25, 6, 24}
- Node 1: {28, 13, 5, 29, 4}
- Node 2: {8, 18, 14}
- Node 3: {15, 18}
- Node 4: {13, 1, 11}
- Node 5: {1, 11, 27}
- Node 6: {15, 17, 26, 0}
- Node 7: {22}
- Node 8: {23, 2, 10, 0}
- Node 9: {18, 19, 29, 24}
- Node 10: {8, 21, 13, 27}
- Node 11: {25, 5, 4}
- Node 12: {25}
- Node 13: {21, 17, 4, 1, 10}
- Node 14: {15, 23, 2}
- Node 15: {3, 6, 14}
- Node 16: {17, 27}
- Node 17: {16, 13, 6}
- Node 18: {3, 2, 9}
- Node 19: {9}
- Node 20: {21, 24}
- Node 21: {23, 10, 13, 20}
- Node 22: {7, 24}
- Node 23: {8, 14, 21}
- Node 24: {9, 22, 20, 0}
- Node 25: {27, 0, 12, 11}
- Node 26: {29, 6}
- Node 27: {25, 5, 16, 10}
- Node 28: {1}
- Node 29: {9, 26, 1}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 4, and 29
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 1, and 11
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 17, and 26
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 23, 2, and 10
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 18, 19, and 29
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 21, 13, and 27
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 21, 17, and 4
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 14
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 13, and 6
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with nodes 23, 10, and 13
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 22, and 20
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes 27, 0, and 11
- Node 29 forms a 3-star with nodes 26, 1, and 9

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of 13, so the final number is [13].
