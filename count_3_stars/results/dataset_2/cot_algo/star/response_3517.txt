Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 14) (3, 14) (3, 12) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 4) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 6) (7, 11) (12, 3) (12, 17) (2, 8) (2, 17) (8, 15) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (19, 5) (19, 13) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 14) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 4) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 16) (13, 15) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 19) (4, 15) (4, 16) (4, 6) (4, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<5, (0, 9, 19)>
<9, (5, 14, 18)>
<3, (12, 14, 17)>
<15, (4, 8, 13)>
<10, (13, 16, 19)>
<11, (6, 13, 18)>
<7, (11, 18, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 14)>
<1, (6, 8, 0)>
<6, (0, 11, 16)>
<18, (9, 11, 14)>
<14, (3, 8, 18)>
<17, (2, 12, 16)>
<13, (10, 11, 19)>
<4, (6, 14, 15)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
