Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, we will construct the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 5}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 33. Therefore, the final answer is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 5)>
