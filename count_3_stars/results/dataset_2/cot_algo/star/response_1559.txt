Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 8, 5, 2}
- Node 1: {5, 8}
- Node 2: {7, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 3: {7, 6, 9, 2}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 0}
- Node 5: {7, 1, 6, 8, 0}
- Node 6: {7, 3, 5, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 6, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {4, 1, 9, 7, 2, 5, 0}
- Node 9: {3, 8}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars present in this graph:
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 1, 7} <8, (4, 1, 7)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 6, 8} <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 6, 8} <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 3, 6} <7, (4, 3, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 3, 8} <2, (7, 3, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 6, 9} <3, (7, 6, 9)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of 5 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
