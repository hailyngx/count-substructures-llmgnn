Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 16) (2, 7) (4, 18) (4, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 12) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 18) (1, 5) (1, 17) (17, 0) (17, 1) (17, 15) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 17) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 6) (16, 2) (16, 0) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 6) (11, 13) (11, 18) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 6) (14, 12) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 12) (3, 8) (3, 12) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 16, 17, 12}
- Node 1: {5, 17}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 16, 7}
- Node 3: {8, 12}
- Node 4: {18, 0}
- Node 5: {13, 2, 1}
- Node 6: {13, 15, 19, 14}
- Node 7: {8, 2, 18}
- Node 8: {13, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 15, 12}
- Node 10: {15, 19}
- Node 11: {13, 18}
- Node 12: {0, 14, 9, 3}
- Node 13: {8, 5, 11, 6}
- Node 14: {6, 12}
- Node 15: {17, 10, 9, 6}
- Node 16: {2, 0}
- Node 17: {0, 1, 15}
- Node 18: {4, 11, 7, 19}
- Node 19: {18, 10, 6}

Now, let's count the 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 12: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 13: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 15: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 18: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 19: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 16, 17)>, <0, (4, 16, 12)>, <0, (4, 17, 12)>, <0, (16, 17, 12)>,
<2, (5, 9, 16)>, <2, (5, 9, 7)>, <2, (5, 16, 7)>, <2, (9, 16, 7)>,
<6, (13, 15, 19)>, <6, (13, 15, 14)>, <6, (13, 19, 14)>, <6, (15, 19, 14)>,
<9, (2, 15, 12)>,
<12, (0, 14, 9)>, <12, (0, 14, 3)>, <12, (0, 9, 3)>, <12, (14, 9, 3)>,
<13, (8, 11, 6)>, <13, (8, 6, 14)>, <13, (8, 6, 19)>, <13, (11, 6, 14)>,
<13, (11, 6, 19)>, <13, (6, 14, 19)>,
<15, (17, 10, 9)>, <15, (17, 10, 6)>, <15, (17, 9, 6)>, <15, (10, 9, 6)>,
<18, (4, 11, 7)>, <18, (4, 7, 19)>, <18, (11, 7, 19)>,
<19, (10, 6, 14)>
