Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {7, 6}
Node 1: {9, 4, 2}
Node 2: {9, 7, 1, 3, 8, 6}
Node 3: {5, 4, 6, 2}
Node 4: {9, 7, 1, 6, 3}
Node 5: {9, 3, 7}
Node 6: {4, 3, 2, 8, 0}
Node 7: {5, 4, 0, 2, 8, 1}
Node 8: {7, 2, 6}
Node 9: {5, 4, 2, 1}

Now we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1 forms 2 3-stars: <1, (9, 4, 2)> and <1, (9, 2, 7)>
- Node 2 forms 6 3-stars: <2, (9, 7, 1)>, <2, (9, 7, 3)>, <2, (9, 1, 3)>, <2, (7, 1, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, and <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (5, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 forms 4 3-stars: <4, (9, 7, 1)>, <4, (9, 7, 3)>, <4, (7, 3, 6)>, and <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (4, 3, 2)>
- Node 7 forms 2 3-stars: <7, (5, 4, 0)> and <7, (5, 2, 8)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (5, 2, 1)>

This gives us a total of 17 3-stars, so the final answer is [17].
