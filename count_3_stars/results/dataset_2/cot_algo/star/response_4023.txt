Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 1) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 10) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 2) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, we need to list the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 11}
- Node 1: {7, 13, 12, 2}
- Node 2: {7, 1, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {9, 7, 12, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {9, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 14}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 11, 8, 13}
- Node 7: {3, 10, 1, 2}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 4, 13, 11, 0}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 13, 3, 14}
- Node 10: {7, 2, 14}
- Node 11: {6, 8, 3, 0}
- Node 12: {14, 3, 1}
- Node 13: {9, 6, 8, 1}
- Node 14: {5, 9, 12, 3, 2, 10}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 5 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 9 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 13 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 14 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 65, which we denote as [65].

The unique 3-stars formed are:
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 11>
<9, 8, 13>
<13, 9, 14>
<14, 3, 12>
<14, 2, 10>
