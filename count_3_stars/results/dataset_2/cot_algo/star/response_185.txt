Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9, 3, 6, 2, 7
- Node 1: 9, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 9, 0, 3
- Node 3: 1, 0, 2, 4
- Node 4: 1, 3, 8, 6
- Node 5: 9, 0, 7
- Node 6: 4, 8, 0
- Node 7: 5, 9, 1, 8, 0
- Node 8: 4, 7, 6
- Node 9: 5, 0, 2, 1, 7

Now we will identify which nodes can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Forms one 3-star, as it has 6 neighbors.
- Node 1: Forms one 3-star, as it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3: Forms one 3-star, as it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4: Forms one 3-star, as it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7: Forms one 3-star, as it has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9: Forms one 3-star, as it has 5 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 5, 7>
- <1, 3, 4, 7>
- <0, 3, 5, 7>
- <1, 4, 7, 8>
- <0, 5, 7, 9>
- <1, 7, 9, 3>
