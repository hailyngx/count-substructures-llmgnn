Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {9, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 2, 4}
- Node 2: {5, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 4: {9, 6, 1, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 2, 8, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 3, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 8, 2, 0}
- Node 8: {5, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 7, 0}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42]. 

Now listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 7, 9)>
