Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 10) (6, 5) (6, 18) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 17) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 13) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 15) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 16) (1, 19) (17, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 15) (16, 8) (16, 1) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 12) (3, 2) (3, 13) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 15) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:

1: 5, 14, 16, 19
2: 3, 4, 10
3: 2, 13
4: 2, 9, 13, 18
5: 1, 6, 9, 12
6: 5, 18
7: 0, 19
8: 9, 16, 17
9: 4, 5, 8, 10, 0
10: 2, 9, 11, 13
11: 10
12: 5, 15, 0  
13: 2, 3, 4, 10, 14
14: 1, 13, 15
15: 12, 14, 18, 19
16: 1, 8
17: 8
18: 4, 6, 15
19: 1, 7, 15

We see that nodes 1, 4, 5, 9, 13, 15 each have 4 or more neighbors, so we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them:

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 36 3-stars.    

Therefore, the final answer is [36], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 14, 19)>
<4, (2, 13, 18)>
<5, (6, 9, 12)>
<9, (8, 10, 0)>
<13, (3, 14, 10)>
<15, (12, 18, 19)>
