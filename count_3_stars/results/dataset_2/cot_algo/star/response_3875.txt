Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 7) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 7) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 28) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 8) (10, 17) (10, 9) (10, 28) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 11) (4, 22) (4, 23) (4, 16) (4, 3) (18, 23) (18, 29) (18, 13) (19, 26) (19, 0) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 2) (13, 25) (13, 18) (13, 26) (24, 26) (24, 3) (24, 21) (3, 4) (3, 24) (3, 21) (21, 24) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 8) (21, 22) (16, 4) (16, 28) (16, 22) (16, 5) (28, 20) (28, 10) (28, 16) (9, 10) (9, 2) (29, 15) (29, 18) (8, 25) (8, 21) (8, 22) (5, 10) (5, 26) (5, 16) (5, 0) (2, 26) (2, 9) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (11, 17) (11, 14) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (22, 4) (22, 21) (22, 16) (22, 8) (7, 15) (7, 27) (1, 20) (1, 12) (1, 14) (23, 4) (23, 18) (0, 19) (0, 21) (0, 5) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: {5, 12, 19, 21}
- Node 1: {12, 14, 20}
- Node 2: {9, 26}
- Node 3: {4, 21, 24}
- Node 4: {3, 16, 22, 23}
- Node 5: {0, 10, 16, 26}
- Node 7: {15, 27}
- Node 8: {5, 8, 21, 22, 25}
- Node 9: {2, 10}
- Node 10: {5, 9, 17, 28}
- Node 11: {14, 17}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 14, 17}
- Node 13: {18, 25, 26}
- Node 14: {1, 11, 12}
- Node 15: {7, 25, 29}
- Node 16: {4, 5, 16, 22, 28}
- Node 17: {10, 11, 12}
- Node 18: {13, 23, 26, 29}
- Node 19: {0, 26}
- Node 20: {1, 15, 25, 28}
- Node 21: {0, 3, 8, 21, 22}
- Node 22: {4, 8, 16, 21}
- Node 23: {4, 18}
- Node 24: {3, 26}
- Node 25: {8, 13, 15, 20}
- Node 26: {2, 5, 13, 18, 19, 24}
- Node 27: {7}
- Node 28: {10, 16, 20}
- Node 29: {15, 18}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 15: [inom{3}{3} = 1]
- Node 18: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 25: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 26: [inom{6}{3} = 20]
- Node 28: [inom{3}{3} = 1]

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 30

The unique 3-stars are:
- <15, (7, 25, 29)>
- <18, (13, 26, 29)>
- <25, (8, 15, 20)>
- <26, (5, 13, 18, 24)>
