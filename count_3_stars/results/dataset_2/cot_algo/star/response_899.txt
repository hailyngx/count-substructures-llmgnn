Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1 neighbors: {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 2 neighbors: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 3 neighbors: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 4 neighbors: {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5 neighbors: {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6 neighbors: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7 neighbors: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 8 neighbors: {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9 neighbors: {1, 4, 8}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <4, (0, 2, 5)> and <8, (0, 5, 6)>.
