Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {18, 13, 15}
- Node 1: {6, 19}
- Node 2: {14, 15, 21, 26, 28}
- Node 3: {7, 8, 28}
- Node 4: {6, 14, 19, 20}
- Node 5: {11, 26}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 16}
- Node 7: {3, 23}
- Node 8: {3, 25}
- Node 9: {14, 22}
- Node 10: {13, 19}
- Node 11: {5, 13, 19, 22, 24}
- Node 12: {15, 23}
- Node 13: {0, 10, 11, 21}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 15: {0, 2, 12}
- Node 16: {6, 20, 21}
- Node 17: {22, 23, 25, 27}
- Node 18: {0, 29}
- Node 19: {1, 4, 10, 11}
- Node 20: {4, 16}
- Node 21: {2, 13, 16}
- Node 22: {9, 11, 17, 18}
- Node 23: {7, 12, 17}
- Node 24: {11, 28, 29}
- Node 25: {8, 17, 27, 28}
- Node 26: {2, 5}
- Node 27: {17, 25}
- Node 28: {2, 3, 24, 25, 29}
- Node 29: {18, 24, 28}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, hence \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, hence \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors, hence \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (14, 21, 28)>
- <3, (7, 23, 28)>
- <4, (6, 14, 19)>
- <6, (1, 4, 16)>
- <11, (5, 19, 24)>
- <13, (0, 11, 21)>
- <14, (2, 4, 9)>
- <16, (6, 20, 21)>
- <17, (22, 23, 25)>
- <22, (9, 11, 18)>
- <25, (8, 17, 27)>
- <28, (2, 24, 29)>
