Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 14) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 14) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {11, 6, 2}
- Node 2: {4, 13, 5, 0, 9, 14}
- Node 3: {7, 9, 5}
- Node 4: {7, 12, 10, 11, 2}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 2}
- Node 6: {10, 8, 5, 12, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {9, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 8, 13, 2, 14}
- Node 10: {4, 7, 11, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {4, 10, 0, 12}
- Node 12: {4, 10, 11, 6, 14}
- Node 13: {7, 2, 9, 14}
- Node 14: {10, 13, 2, 9, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 2, 9, and 14 have 6 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 4, 6, 10, and 12 have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 0 and 5 have 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 3-star each.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 20*3 + 10*4 + 1*2 = 60 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60].

Here is the list of unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<2, (4, 14, 9)>, <4, (7, 10, 11)>, <6, (10, 12, 14)>, <10, (4, 7, 11)>, <0, (11, 2, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 2)>.
