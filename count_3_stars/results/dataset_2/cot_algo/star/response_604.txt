Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {6, 8}
Node 1: {4, 6, 9}
Node 2: {5, 7}
Node 3: {4, 5, 7, 9}
Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
Node 5: {2, 3, 8, 9}
Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 5, 9}
Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 8}
Node 8: {0, 4, 5, 7, 9}
Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 9
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 4 3-stars: <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 forms 10 3-stars
- Node 5 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 6 forms 10 3-stars
- Node 7 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 10 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 10 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 53

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [53].
