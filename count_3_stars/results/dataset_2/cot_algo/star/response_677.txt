Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get: 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
