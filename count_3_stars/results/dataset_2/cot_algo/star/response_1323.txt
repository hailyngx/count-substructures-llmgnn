Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighborhood sets for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {9, 6, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 1, 8, 6}
- Node 3: {9, 7, 6, 0}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 4, 7, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {5, 1, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {2, 1, 7, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors where a 3-star can be formed:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8 have 4 or more neighbors.

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 51

Therefore, the final answer is [51].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (9, 3, 8)>
- <1, (9, 6, 2)>
- <2, (9, 4, 1)>
- <3, (9, 7, 6)>
- <5, (6, 8, 4)>
- <6, (5, 4, 7)>
- <7, (5, 9, 3)>
- <8, (5, 1, 2)>
- <1, (6, 8, 2)>
