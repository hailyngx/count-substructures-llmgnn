Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 0) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 0) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 11) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {10, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 8, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {9, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 8, 10}
- Node 10: {0, 4, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 6, 13}
- Node 12: {4, 7, 10}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars formed in the graph = 20 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<4, (1, 10, 13)>
<4, (1, 12, 13)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 10)>
<4, (5, 10, 12)>
<7, (2, 12, 14)>
<7, (3, 12, 13)>
<7, (3, 13, 2)>
<7, (7, 13, 0)>
<7, (7, 13, 2)>
