Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 1) (11, 19) (11, 5) (17, 10) (17, 19) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 4) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 15) (5, 11) (5, 16) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 16) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 12) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 15) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 15) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 5) (16, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {7, 6, 12}
- Node 1: {6, 13, 10, 2, 3}
- Node 2: {9, 18, 1}
- Node 3: {4, 1, 16}
- Node 4: {7, 18, 3, 14, 16}
- Node 5: {11, 16}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 6, 13, 16}
- Node 9: {2}
- Node 10: {17, 1}
- Node 11: {19, 5}
- Node 12: {13, 0, 15}
- Node 13: {8, 12, 1, 18}
- Node 14: {4}
- Node 15: {18, 19, 12}
- Node 16: {4, 8, 5, 3}
- Node 17: {10, 19}
- Node 18: {4, 13, 2, 15}
- Node 19: {11, 17, 15}

From the neighbor sets, we see that nodes 0, 1, 4, 8, 12, 13, 15, and 16 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to count the number of 3-stars formed around these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [35].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 6, 12>
- <1, 10, 2>
- <1, 10, 3>
- <1, 13, 18>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <1, 2, 18>
- <1, 3, 16>
- <1, 6, 13>
- <1, 6, 10>
- <1, 6, 2>
- <3, 4, 16>
- <4, 18, 13>
- <4, 18, 16>
- <4, 18, 2>
- <4, 18, 15>
- <8, 6, 7>
- <8, 6, 13>
- <8, 6, 16>
- <8, 13, 16>
- <12, 0, 15>
- <13, 1, 18>
- <15, 18, 19>
- <15, 18, 12>
- <16, 8, 3>
