Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 10) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 15) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 4) (18, 13) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 15) (1, 12) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 13) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 13) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 19) (19, 16) (19, 3) (11, 5) (11, 0) (3, 6) (3, 19) (4, 2) (4, 16) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 12) (10, 9) (10, 14) (8, 0) (8, 16) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 11, 8, 1
- Node 1: 2, 0, 7, 15, 12
- Node 2: 1, 13, 4
- Node 3: 6, 19
- Node 4: 2, 16
- Node 5: 6, 11, 16, 7
- Node 6: 5, 14, 3, 0
- Node 7: 5, 14, 0, 13, 1
- Node 8: 0, 16
- Node 9: 10
- Node 10: 9, 14
- Node 11: 5, 0
- Node 12: 1, 16, 13
- Node 13: 2, 18, 7, 15, 12
- Node 14: 6, 7, 10
- Node 15: 17, 1, 13
- Node 16: 5, 12, 8, 4, 19
- Node 17: 15
- Node 18: 13
- Node 19: 16, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed by each of them:

- Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 2: No 3-stars
- Node 3: No 3-stars
- Node 4: No 3-stars
- Node 5: <5, (6, 11, 16)> = 1 3-star
- Node 6: <6, (5, 14, 0)>, <6, (5, 14, 3)>, <6, (5, 16, 0)>, <6, (14, 7, 0)> = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-stars
- Node 12: No 3-stars
- Node 13: <13, (2, 18, 7)>, <13, (2, 15, 12)>, <13, (7, 15, 12)> = 3 3-stars
- Node 14: <14, (6, 7, 10)>, <14, (7, 10, 9)>, <14, (7, 10, 13)>, <14, (10, 9, 13)> = 4 3-stars
- Node 15: No 3-stars
- Node 16: <16, (5, 12, 4)>, <16, (5, 12, 19)>, <16, (5, 8, 19)>, <16, (12, 19, 8)>, <16, (8, 4, 19)> = 5 3-stars
- Node 19: No 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 6) + 3 (from node 13) + 4 (from node 14) + 5 (from node 16) = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].
