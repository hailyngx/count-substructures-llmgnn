Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 4) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 14) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 4) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 4) (6, 11) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (10, 9) (10, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

1. Node 0: {9, 7, 4, 8}
2. Node 1: {11, 13, 4}
3. Node 2: {5, 9, 3, 14}
4. Node 3: {5, 11, 7, 14, 2}
5. Node 4: {11, 0, 12, 14, 1}
6. Node 5: {13, 2, 12, 3}
7. Node 6: {11, 8}
8. Node 7: {3, 0, 13}
9. Node 8: {9, 0, 14, 10, 6}
10. Node 9: {8, 2, 10, 0}
11. Node 10: {9, 8}
12. Node 11: {3, 1, 6, 12, 4}
13. Node 12: {5, 11, 13, 4}
14. Node 13: {5, 7, 12, 1, 14}
15. Node 14: {3, 13, 8, 4, 2}

Next, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 3, 9, 14

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (5, 11, 14)>
<9, (0, 8, 10)>
<14, (3, 13, 4)>
