Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 6, 7, 3, 2, 11}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 12, 1, 10}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 7, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 9, 8, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 4, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 8, 1, 7, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {13, 6, 0, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {13, 4, 9, 11, 0, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 14, 13}
- Node 10: Neighbors {13, 2, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {8, 0, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {13, 2, 14, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors {9, 8, 12, 4, 10, 7}
- Node 14: Neighbors {5, 9, 12, 3, 10}

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it forms [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it forms [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 20 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 94.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 6, 7)>, <0, (8, 6, 3)>, <0, (8, 6, 2)>, <0, (8, 7, 3)>, <0, (8, 7, 2)>, <0, (8, 3, 2)>, <0, (6, 7, 3)>, <0, (6, 7, 2)>, <0, (6, 3, 2)>, <0, (7, 3, 2)>, <2, (0, 12, 1)>, <2, (0, 12, 10)>, <2, (0, 1, 10)>, <2, (12, 1, 10)>, <6, (8, 1, 7)>, <8, (4, 13, 9)>, <8, (4, 13, 12)>, <8, (4, 9, 12)>, <8, (13, 9, 12)>, <13, (9, 4, 14)>.
