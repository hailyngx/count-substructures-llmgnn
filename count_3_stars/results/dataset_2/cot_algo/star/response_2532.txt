Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 12) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 12) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: neighbors {2, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 1: neighbors {5, 6, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 4, 5}
- Node 3: neighbors {4, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 3, 10, 13}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 5, 9, 10}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 3, 5}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 10: neighbors {4, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 11: neighbors {1, 9, 10}
- Node 12: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 13: neighbors {3, 4, 6, 12}
- Node 14: neighbors {6, 9, 10}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 13, and 14 <6, 1, 13, 14>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [1].
