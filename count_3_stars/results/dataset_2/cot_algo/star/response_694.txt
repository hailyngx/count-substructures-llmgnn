Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 11) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 12) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 10}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 11}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 5, 9, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 12}
- Node 11: {2, 5, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {6, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {3, 5, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 14: {1, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( {3\choose 3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( {5\choose 3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( {6\choose 3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( {4\choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \({4\choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 7: \({4\choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 8: \({4\choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 11: \({5\choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 12: \({4\choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 13: \({5\choose 3} = 10\)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 67

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [67].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 10)>
- <1, (2, 4, 14)>
- <1, (2, 10, 12)>
- <1, (4, 10, 14)>
- <1, (8, 10, 14)>
- <4, (0, 2, 14)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <4, (1, 9, 14)>
- <4, (3, 7, 13)>
- <5, (2, 11, 13)>
- <6, (7, 11, 12)>
- <7, (3, 9, 13)>
- <8, (1, 12, 14)>
- <11, (2, 5, 13)>
- <12, (6, 8, 10)>
- <13, (7, 8, 11)>
