Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (22, 26) (22, 12) (3, 1) (3, 8) (15, 17) (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 20) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 19) (1, 0) (26, 22) (28, 14) (28, 20) (10, 21) (10, 9) (21, 10) (21, 0) (25, 27) (25, 0) (25, 4) (27, 25) (27, 7) (27, 23) (7, 16) (7, 27) (7, 29) (7, 20) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 25) (0, 4) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 4) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 18) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 29) (18, 8) (29, 7) (29, 18) (29, 19) (29, 23) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 14) (20, 16) (20, 28) (20, 7) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 4) (19, 1) (19, 29) (19, 2) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 28) (14, 2) (14, 24) (8, 3) (8, 18) (12, 22) (12, 18) (12, 24) (24, 14) (24, 12) (4, 25) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 23) (23, 27) (23, 29) (23, 4) (5, 11) (5, 16) 

Response:
The total number of nodes in the graph is 30.

For each node, let's list its neighbors:
1: {0, 3, 6, 14, 19}
2: {11, 14, 19}
3: {0, 1, 8}
4: {0, 6, 17, 23, 25}
5: {11, 16}
6: {1, 4, 13}
7: {16, 20, 27, 29}
8: {3, 18}
9: {10, 13, 18}
10: {9, 21}
11: {2, 5, 16}
12: {18, 22, 24}
13: {6, 9, 14}
14: {1, 2, 13, 24, 28}
15: {17}
16: {5, 7, 11, 17, 20}
17: {4, 15, 16}
18: {8, 9, 12, 18, 29}
19: {1, 2, 29}
20: {7, 16, 20, 28}
21: {0, 10}
22: {12, 26}
23: {4, 23, 27, 29}
24: {12, 14, 24}
25: {0, 4, 27}
26: {22}
27: {7, 23, 25}
28: {14, 20}
29: {7, 18, 19, 23}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {0, 3, 6}.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {0, 6, 25}.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {16, 20, 27}.
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {2, 13, 24}.
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {5, 11, 17}.
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {9, 12, 29}.
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {7, 16, 28}.
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {4, 27, 29}.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 25)>
<7, (16, 20, 27)>
<14, (2, 13, 24)>
<16, (5, 11, 17)>
<18, (9, 12, 29)>
<20, (7, 16, 28)>
<23, (4, 27, 29)>
