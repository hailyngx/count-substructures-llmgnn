Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
After analyzing the given graph, we identify the following neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Now, we can identify the nodes that form a 3-star:

- Node 1 and 5 form a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 9.
- Node 7 and 9 form a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 5.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, 2, 4, 5> and <7, 1, 4, 5, 9>.
