Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 10) (1, 14) (1, 18) (3, 19) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 18) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 15) (12, 13) (12, 14) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 15) (7, 11) (7, 17) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 7) (17, 18) (4, 14) (4, 6) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 14) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 0) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 18) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 2) (18, 1) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 0) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 15, 18}
- Node 1: {14, 18}
- Node 2: {6, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {19}
- Node 4: {6, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 10, 17}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 10}
- Node 7: {11, 17}
- Node 8: {13, 16, 17}
- Node 10: {5, 6, 11, 18}
- Node 11: {7, 10, 15}
- Node 12: {13, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 8, 12, 18, 19}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 4, 19}
- Node 15: {0, 11, 16}
- Node 16: {8, 15, 17}
- Node 17: {5, 7, 8, 16, 18}
- Node 18: {0, 1, 10, 14, 17}
- Node 19: {3, 13, 14}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 5 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star 
- Node 8 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star 
- Node 13 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars 
- Node 14 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars 
- Node 17 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars 
- Node 18 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars 

Adding these up gives a total of 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 36. 

So, the final answer is [36], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<5, 0, 18>, <8, 13, 17>, <13, 2, 18>, <13, 12, 19>, <14, 1, 4>, <14, 1, 2>, <17, 5, 7>, <17, 5, 8>, <17, 8, 16>, <17, 8, 18>.
