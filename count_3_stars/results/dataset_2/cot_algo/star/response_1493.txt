Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 14) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 19) (4, 6) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 18) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 6) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 13) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 6) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 19) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 10) (18, 12) (18, 10) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 3}
- Node 1: {5, 2, 13}
- Node 2: {1}
- Node 3: {9, 7, 0, 14}
- Node 4: {19, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 0, 14}
- Node 6: {4, 8, 15, 17}
- Node 7: {16, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 10, 6}
- Node 9: {11, 3, 12}
- Node 10: {8, 15, 18, 13}
- Node 11: {9, 13, 17}
- Node 12: {9, 17, 18}
- Node 13: {11, 16, 1, 10}
- Node 14: {16, 5, 3, 19}
- Node 15: {10, 19, 6}
- Node 16: {7, 13, 14}
- Node 17: {11, 12, 6}
- Node 18: {12, 10}
- Node 19: {4, 15, 14}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 3: 4 neighbors (3-star count: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)), <3, (0, 5, 14)>, <3, (8, 7, 9)>, <3, (9, 12, 17)>, <3, (7, 13, 16)>
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (3-star count: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)), <6, (4, 17, 8)>, <6, (15, 8, 10)>, <6, (17, 12, 6)>, <6, (15, 19, 4)>
- Node 10: 4 neighbors (3-star count: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)), <10, (13, 15, 10)>, <10, (13, 18, 10)>, <10, (15, 18, 10)>, <10, (13, 15, 19)>

Total 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
