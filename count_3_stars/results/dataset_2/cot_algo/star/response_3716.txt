Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 2) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (13, 6) (13, 2) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 10) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {7, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 5: {4, 8, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 10}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {5, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 7, 9, 2}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 5, 2}
- Node 12: {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 13: {2, 6}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 4, 5, and 12 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 5) + 10 (from node 12) = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, 3, 5>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 10>
- <4, 5, 12>
- <5, 1, 11>
- <5, 2, 14>
- <5, 11, 2>
- <5, 14, 2>
- <12, 2, 4>
- <12, 2, 9>
