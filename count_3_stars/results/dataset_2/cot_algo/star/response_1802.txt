Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {4, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 3}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. We'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 68, which we put inside brackets: [68]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
