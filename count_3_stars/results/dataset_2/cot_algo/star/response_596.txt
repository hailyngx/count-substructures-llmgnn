Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 10) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 15) (14, 1) (14, 19) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 18) (19, 4) (19, 14) (18, 7) (18, 15) (18, 5) (2, 16) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 6) (12, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (10, 16) (10, 5) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 10) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 13, 15
- Node 1: 3, 7, 9, 14, 15
- Node 2: 6, 9, 13, 16
- Node 3: 1, 5, 9, 12
- Node 4: 7, 8, 17, 19
- Node 5: 3, 10, 11, 18
- Node 6: 2, 7, 17
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6, 18
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3
- Node 10: 5, 16
- Node 11: 5, 15, 16, 17
- Node 12: 3
- Node 13: 0, 2
- Node 14: 1, 19
- Node 15: 0, 1, 11, 18
- Node 16: 2, 10, 11
- Node 17: 4, 6, 11
- Node 18: 5, 7, 15
- Node 19: 4, 14

Now, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 1: <1, (3, 9, 15)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 5, 9)>

We have found 2 unique 3-stars, so the total number of 3-stars is [2].
