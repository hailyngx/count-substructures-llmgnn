Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 15) (4, 10) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 6) (13, 5) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 0) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 15) (17, 12) (17, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 6) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 18) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 16) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 6) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 19) (15, 8) (0, 12) (0, 11) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 16) (2, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) (16, 3) (16, 14) (16, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node. Then, we can identify 3-stars based on these neighbor sets.

Let's calculate the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {11, 12}
- Node 1: {2, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 10, 14, 16}
- Node 3: {11, 16, 18}
- Node 4: {10, 15}
- Node 5: {9, 10, 13, 19}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 12, 17, 18}
- Node 7: {12, 14, 19}
- Node 8: {6, 15, 19}
- Node 9: {5, 15, 18}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 11: {0, 3}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 7, 17}
- Node 13: {5}
- Node 14: {2, 7, 16}
- Node 15: {4, 8, 9, 19}
- Node 16: {2, 3, 14}
- Node 17: {6, 12}
- Node 18: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 19: {5, 7, 8, 15}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5 forms one 3-star with neighbors 9, 13, 19: <5, 9, 13, 19>
- Node 6 forms two 3-stars with neighbors 1, 8, 12: <6, 1, 8, 12>, <6, 8, 12, 17>
- Node 12 forms one 3-star with neighbors 0, 6, 17: <12, 0, 6, 17>
- Node 15 forms one 3-star with neighbors 4, 8, 19: <15, 4, 8, 19>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, represented inside brackets as [5].
