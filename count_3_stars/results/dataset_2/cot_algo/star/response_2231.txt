Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges as described, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: {1, 4, 5}
Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4}
Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Node 3: {1, 7, 8}
Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
Node 6: {2, 5, 9}
Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
Node 8: {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
Node 9: {5, 6, 8}

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 2 forms 4 3-stars: <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>
Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 7, 8)>
Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (2, 6, 9)>
Node 7 forms 4 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>
Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (3, 4, 7)>
Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [12].
