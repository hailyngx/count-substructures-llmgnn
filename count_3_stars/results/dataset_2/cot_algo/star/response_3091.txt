Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 11) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 14) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 14) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 10) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 14) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 3, 4, 7, 9, 12
Node 1: 3, 6, 9, 11
Node 2: 3, 9, 11, 14
Node 3: 0, 1, 2
Node 4: 0, 6, 11, 12
Node 5: 8, 10, 13, 14
Node 6: 1, 4, 12, 14
Node 7: 0, 8, 10, 13
Node 8: 5, 7, 11
Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 13
Node 10: 5, 7, 14
Node 11: 1, 4, 8, 14, 2
Node 12: 0, 4, 6
Node 13: 7, 9, 5, 14
Node 14: 2, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 14 has 6 neighbors, so there are [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 66

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [66].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, 4, 12>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 7, 13>, <1, 6, 12>, <1, 6, 14>, <1, 11, 14>, <2, 3, 9>, <5, 8, 13>, <5, 8, 14>, <5, 10, 14>, <7, 8, 13>, <9, 13, 14>, <11, 4, 14>, <11, 8, 14>, <11, 2, 14>, <14, 5, 10>, <14, 6, 10>, <14, 11, 10>
