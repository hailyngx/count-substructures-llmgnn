Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 29) (13, 10) (13, 27) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 7) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 22) (7, 4) (7, 27) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 25) (14, 4) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 1) (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 10) (0, 18) (0, 25) (0, 16) (0, 2) (25, 18) (25, 0) (25, 16) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 29) (19, 22) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 2) (26, 21) (15, 5) (11, 4) (11, 28) (11, 5) (28, 11) (28, 8) (28, 1) (28, 12) (28, 24) (1, 17) (1, 28) (1, 12) (1, 8) (21, 6) (21, 26) (21, 8) (29, 13) (29, 10) (29, 3) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 24) (23, 2) (23, 3) (8, 10) (8, 28) (8, 1) (8, 21) (24, 28) (24, 16) (5, 15) (5, 11) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 26) (2, 23) (2, 27) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 28) (12, 1) (3, 29) (3, 23) (3, 5) (27, 13) (27, 7) (27, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 16, 18, 25}
- Node 1: {8, 12, 17, 28}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 23, 26, 27}
- Node 3: {5, 23, 29}
- Node 4: {7, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 11, 15}
- Node 6: {2, 9, 21}
- Node 7: {4, 22, 27}
- Node 8: {1, 10, 21, 28}
- Node 9: {6, 10}
- Node 10: {8, 9, 13, 29}
- Node 11: {4, 5, 14, 28}
- Node 12: {1, 13, 18, 28}
- Node 13: {10, 12, 27, 29}
- Node 14: {4, 11, 17}
- Node 15: {5}
- Node 16: {0, 22, 24, 25}
- Node 17: {1, 14}
- Node 18: {0, 12, 25}
- Node 19: {22, 26}
- Node 21: {6, 8, 26}
- Node 22: {7, 19, 16}
- Node 23: {2, 3}
- Node 24: {16, 28}
- Node 25: {0, 16, 18}
- Node 26: {2, 19, 21}
- Node 27: {2, 7, 13}
- Node 28: {1, 8, 11, 12, 24}
- Node 29: {3, 10, 13}

Next, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 2, Node 8, Node 10, Node 12, Node 13, Node 16, Node 22, Node 26, and Node 28 have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 36

Therefore, the final answer is [36], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (16, 18, 25)>, <2, (6, 23, 26, 27)>, <8, (1, 10, 28)>, <10, (8, 9, 29)>, <12, (1, 18, 28)>, <13, (10, 27, 29)>, <16, (0, 22, 24, 25)>, <22, (7, 16, 19)>, <26, (2, 19, 21)>, <28, (1, 11, 12, 24)>
