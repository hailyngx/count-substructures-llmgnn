Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8, 2
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 9, 4, 3, 0
- Node 3: 5, 4, 7, 6, 2
- Node 4: 5, 7, 8, 2, 3
- Node 5: 9, 4, 0, 3, 7
- Node 6: 9, 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 5, 9, 4, 3
- Node 8: 9, 4, 6, 0
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8, 2, 7

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 43

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars formed is [43], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 8, 5)>, <2, (9, 4, 0)>, <3, (5, 4, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 3)>, <5, (9, 4, 0)>, <6, (9, 4, 8)>, <8, (9, 4, 6)>, <9, (5, 4, 7)>
