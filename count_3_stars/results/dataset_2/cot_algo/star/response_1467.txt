Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 27) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 5) (1, 23) (3, 1) (8, 4) (8, 25) (8, 17) (13, 26) (13, 24) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 20) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 21) (2, 16) (2, 0) (15, 20) (15, 29) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 21) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 10) (17, 8) (17, 15) (17, 29) (17, 18) (29, 15) (29, 17) (26, 13) (26, 14) (26, 5) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 26) (14, 0) (24, 6) (24, 13) (21, 12) (21, 15) (5, 1) (5, 26) (5, 18) (5, 22) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 22) (22, 5) (22, 19) (22, 27) (25, 9) (25, 8) (25, 23) (28, 27) (28, 10) (28, 23) (27, 11) (27, 20) (27, 22) (27, 28) (18, 17) (18, 5) (10, 16) (10, 20) (10, 28) (23, 1) (23, 25) (23, 28) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 20, 23}
- Node 2: {0, 10, 16}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {8, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 18, 22, 26}
- Node 6: {9, 19, 24}
- Node 7: {12, 15, 20}
- Node 8: {4, 17, 25}
- Node 9: {6, 12, 19, 25}
- Node 10: {2, 16, 20, 28}
- Node 11: {4, 16, 27}
- Node 12: {7, 9, 21}
- Node 13: {24, 26}
- Node 14: {4, 15, 26}
- Node 15: {7, 14, 17, 21, 29}
- Node 16: {2, 10, 11}
- Node 17: {8, 15, 18, 29}
- Node 18: {5, 17}
- Node 19: {6, 9, 22}
- Node 20: {1, 7, 10, 27}
- Node 21: {12, 15}
- Node 22: {5, 19, 27}
- Node 23: {1, 25, 28}
- Node 24: {6, 13}
- Node 25: {8, 9, 23}
- Node 26: {5, 13, 14}
- Node 27: {11, 20, 22, 28}
- Node 28: {10, 23, 27}
- Node 29: {15, 17}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars formed:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 20, 23: <1, (5, 20, 23)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 8, 14, 15: <4, (8, 14, 15)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 18, 22, 26: <5, (18, 22, 26)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 17, 25, 9: <8, (17, 25, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 12, 19: <9, (6, 12, 19)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with leaves 16, 20, 27: <11, (16, 20, 27)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with leaves 17, 21, 29: <15, (17, 21, 29)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with leaves 10, 2, 11: <16, (10, 2, 11)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with leaves 8, 15, 18: <17, (8, 15, 18)>
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 7, 27: <20, (1, 7, 27)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 19, 27: <22, (5, 19, 27)>
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with leaves 11, 20, 22: <27, (11, 20, 22)>
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with leaves 25, 28, 1: <23, (25, 28, 1)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [12].
