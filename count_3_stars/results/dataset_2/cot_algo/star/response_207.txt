Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 10) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 2) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 5, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 7, 5, 14, 10}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 1, 13, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 0, 7, 11, 2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 14, 3, 12, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {8, 2, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 4, 11, 0, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 2, 11, 10, 13}
- Node 10: Neighbors {9, 14, 2}
- Node 11: Neighbors {9, 8, 5}
- Node 12: Neighbors {6, 3, 4}
- Node 13: Neighbors {9, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 14: Neighbors {6, 0, 2, 10}

Next, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors. 
These nodes can potentially form 3-stars:

- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13, and 14 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, there is exactly 1 3-star formed.
  - Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (8, 5, 14)>
  - Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 4, 13)>
  - Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (9, 7, 14)>
  - Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (6, 1, 13)>
  - Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 8, 12)>
  - Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 0, 7)>
  - Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (9, 14, 3)>
  - Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (6, 4, 11)>
  - Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (9, 1, 3)>
  - Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (6, 0, 2)>

- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we apply the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
  - Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) additional 3-stars with node 9 at the center.
  
In total, we have 11 (from nodes with 3 neighbors) + 10 (from node 9) = 21 3-stars. 
Therefore, the final number to put inside brackets is [21].
