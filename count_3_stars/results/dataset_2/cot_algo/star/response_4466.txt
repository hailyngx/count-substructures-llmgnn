Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
    4 -- 0 -- 3
    |    |    |
    1 -- 5 -- 6 -- 2
            |    |
            8 -- 7
              \ /
               9
```

Next, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1, Node 3, Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4, Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 19

So, we put the final number inside brackets to represent the total number of 3-stars: [19].

And the unique 3-stars found are: <0, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <4, 5, 1>, <6, 7, 8, 9>.
