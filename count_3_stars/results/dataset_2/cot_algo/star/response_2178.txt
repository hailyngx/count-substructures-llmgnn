Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 5) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 19) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 1) (5, 14) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 13) (13, 3) (13, 5) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 16) (19, 11) (19, 18) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 19) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 15) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 12) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:

Node 0: 14, 7, 2
Node 1: 7, 4, 12
Node 2: 17, 0, 8
Node 3: 6, 11, 16, 13, 5
Node 4: 17, 12, 1
Node 5: 14, 8, 3, 13
Node 6: 17, 10, 3
Node 7: 0, 16, 1
Node 8: 2, 5, 11
Node 9: 12
Node 10: 6, 15, 18
Node 11: 8, 3, 19
Node 12: 9, 4, 1
Node 13: 3, 5
Node 14: 17, 0, 5
Node 15: 10, 18, 16
Node 16: 3, 7, 15
Node 17: 6, 14, 2, 4
Node 18: 10, 15, 19
Node 19: 11, 18

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph.

Node 6 has 3 neighbors (10, 17, 3), so it can form 1 3-star.
<6, (10, 17, 3)>

Node 14 has 3 neighbors (17, 0, 5), so it can form 1 3-star.
<14, (17, 0, 5)>

Node 3 has 5 neighbors (6, 11, 16, 13, 5), so it can form 10 3-stars.
<3, (6, 11, 16)>
<3, (6, 11, 13)>
<3, (6, 11, 5)>
<3, (6, 16, 13)>
<3, (6, 16, 5)>
<3, (6, 13, 5)>
<3, (11, 16, 13)>
<3, (11, 16, 5)>
<3, (11, 13, 5)>
<3, (16, 13, 5)>

Node 17 has 4 neighbors (14, 2, 4, 6), so it can form 4 3-stars.
<17, (14, 2, 4)>
<17, (14, 2, 6)>
<17, (14, 4, 6)>
<17, (2, 4, 6)>

Node 5 has 4 neighbors (14, 8, 3, 13), so it can form 4 3-stars.
<5, (14, 8, 3)>
<5, (14, 8, 13)>
<5, (14, 3, 13)>
<5, (8, 3, 13)>

Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 16, 1), so it can form 1 3-star.
<7, (0, 16, 1)>

Node 8 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 11), so it can form 1 3-star.
<8, (2, 5, 11)>

Node 12 has 3 neighbors (9, 4, 1), so it can form 1 3-star.
<12, (9, 4, 1)>

Node 10 has 3 neighbors (6, 15, 18), so it can form 1 3-star.
<10, (6, 15, 18)>

Node 16 has 3 neighbors (3, 7, 15), so it can form 1 3-star.
<16, (3, 7, 15)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 25. So, the final answer is [25].
