Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 19) (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 12) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 18) (13, 2) (13, 7) (4, 16) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 15) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 12) (1, 10) (1, 7) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 18) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 2) (15, 10) (3, 17) (3, 14) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 17) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 7) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 14) (18, 16) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 17) (18, 10) (12, 6) (12, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are connected in the given graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 12, and 18.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 10, and 14.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 8, 13, and 15.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 14, and 17.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 16.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 9, 12, and 14.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 13, and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 15, and 18.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 15, and 18.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 15, 17, and 19.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 10, and 11.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 4, 18, and 19.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 3, 11, 16, and 19.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 0, 8, 10, 16, and 17.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 11, 16, and 17.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{14}{3} = 364 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [364].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 12, 18)>, <1, (7, 10, 14)>, <3, (7, 14, 17)>, <4, (16, 18, 19)>, <5, (6, 9, 12)>, <8, (2, 15, 18)>, <9, (5, 6, 12)>, <10, (15, 18, 10)>, <12, (0, 6, 9)>, <13, (2, 7, 13)>, <14, (1, 3, 7)>, <15, (2, 8, 15)>, <18, (8, 10, 16)>, <19, (11, 16, 17)>
