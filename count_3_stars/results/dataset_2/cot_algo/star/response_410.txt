Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 1) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 8, 12, 14, 2}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 10}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 8, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 7, 11}
- Node 6: {0, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 9: {6, 7, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {2, 8, 11}
- Node 11: {5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 11, 12}

Next, we'll determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node gives a total of 76 3-stars. So, the final answer is [76].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (4, 8, 12)>
- <1, (8, 12, 14)>
- <1, (4, 8, 14)>
- <1, (8, 12, 2)>
- <1, (12, 14, 2)>
- <3, (2, 5, 13)>
- <4, (5, 8, 14)>
- <8, (1, 9, 11)>
- <9, (6, 8, 13)>
- <11, (5, 8, 10)>
- <12, (1, 9, 14)>
- <13, (3, 11, 9)>
- <14, (3, 12, 13)>
