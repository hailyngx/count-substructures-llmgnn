Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 6 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Now, sum up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, there are 60 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 2, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
