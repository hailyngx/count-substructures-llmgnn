Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (2, 9) (2, 11) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to analyze the neighbors of each node and determine if they form a 3-star configuration.

First, let's list the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (1, 6, 10)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (0, 7, 11, 13)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (9, 11)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (6, 11, 12)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (8, 10, 11, 14)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (7, 9, 13)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 12, 14)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (1, 5, 6)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (4, 6, 10, 13, 14)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (2, 5, 10, 14)
- Node 10: 5 neighbors (0, 4, 8, 9, 12)
- Node 11: 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 4, 14)
- Node 12: 4 neighbors (3, 6, 10, 13)
- Node 13: 4 neighbors (1, 5, 8, 12)
- Node 14: 5 neighbors (4, 6, 8, 9, 11)

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [0 choose 3] = [1] = 1
- Node 1: [4 choose 3] = [4] = 4
- Node 3: [3 choose 3] = [1] = 1
- Node 4: [4 choose 3] = [4] = 4
- Node 6: [5 choose 3] = [10] = 10
- Node 8: [5 choose 3] = [10] = 10
- Node 10: [5 choose 3] = [10] = 10
- Node 12: [4 choose 3] = [4] = 4
- Node 13: [4 choose 3] = [4] = 4
- Node 14: [5 choose 3] = [10] = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 6, 10)>
- <1, (0, 7, 13)>
- <3, (6, 11, 12)>
- <4, (8, 10, 14)>
- <6, (0, 1, 12)>
- <8, (4, 10, 14)>
- <10, (0, 4, 12)>
- <12, (3, 6, 13)>
- <13, (1, 8, 12)>
- <14, (4, 8, 11)>
