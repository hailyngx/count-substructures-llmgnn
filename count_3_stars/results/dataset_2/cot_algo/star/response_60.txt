This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 10) (25, 3) (25, 7) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 0) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 28) (20, 14) (20, 28) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 15) (13, 12) (1, 26) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 4) (26, 1) (26, 15) (26, 11) (26, 27) (26, 7) (2, 22) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 21) (17, 1) (17, 27) (17, 15) (0, 22) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 29) (7, 25) (7, 26) (7, 0) (7, 29) (7, 28) (5, 15) (5, 10) (19, 18) (19, 29) (11, 3) (11, 26) (11, 27) (6, 14) (6, 16) (21, 2) (21, 4) (4, 1) (4, 21) (4, 24) (12, 13) (12, 14) (18, 19) (29, 0) (29, 7) (29, 19) (15, 8) (15, 26) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 5) (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 6) (14, 12) (16, 2) (16, 6) (27, 26) (27, 17) (27, 11) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 28) (9, 10) (24, 4) (24, 28) (28, 23) (28, 20) (28, 7) (28, 10) (28, 24) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {22, 7, 15, 29}
- Node 1: {26, 17, 2, 4}
- Node 2: {22, 8, 1, 16, 21}
- Node 3: {25, 11, 10}
- Node 4: {1, 21, 24}
- Node 5: {15, 10}
- Node 6: {14, 16}
- Node 7: {25, 26, 0, 29, 28}
- Node 8: {23, 2, 15}
- Node 9: {10}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 9, 28}
- Node 11: {3, 26, 27}
- Node 12: {13, 14}
- Node 13: {12}
- Node 14: {23, 20, 6, 12}
- Node 15: {8, 26, 17, 0, 5}
- Node 16: {2, 6}
- Node 17: {1, 27, 15}
- Node 18: {19}
- Node 19: {18, 29}
- Node 20: {14, 28}
- Node 21: {2, 4}
- Node 22: {23, 2, 0}
- Node 23: {22, 8, 14, 28}
- Node 24: {4, 28}
- Node 25: {3, 7}
- Node 26: {1, 15, 11, 27, 7}
- Node 27: {26, 17, 11}
- Node 28: {23, 20, 7, 10, 24}
- Node 29: {0, 7, 19}

Node 3, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 20, 23, 26, and 28 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 54 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [54].
