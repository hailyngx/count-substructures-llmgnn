Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 13) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 4) (10, 8) (10, 19) (17, 9) (17, 5) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 16) (0, 19) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 16) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 19) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 11) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 12) (8, 10) (8, 9) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 7) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 6) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 19) (7, 14) (7, 9) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 12) (4, 15) (4, 2) (4, 14) (16, 18) (16, 14) (16, 13) (16, 19) (12, 1) (12, 11) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: [19, 9]
- Node 1: [11, 12, 6]
- Node 2: [18, 5, 4]
- Node 3: [13]
- Node 4: [15, 2, 14]
- Node 5: [15, 17, 2, 13, 19]
- Node 6: [15, 1, 19]
- Node 7: [14, 9]
- Node 8: [10, 9]
- Node 9: [17, 0, 8, 7]
- Node 10: [8, 19]
- Node 11: [18, 13, 1, 12]
- Node 12: [1, 11]
- Node 13: [3, 5, 16, 11]
- Node 14: [7, 4, 16]
- Node 15: [6, 5, 4]
- Node 16: [18, 14, 13, 19]
- Node 17: [9, 5]
- Node 18: [2, 11, 16]
- Node 19: [10, 0, 5, 16, 6]

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 5: Can form a 3-star <5, (15, 17, 19)>
- Node 9: Can form a 3-star <9, (17, 0, 8)> and <9, (17, 7, 19)>
- Node 13: Can form a 3-star <13, (3, 5, 16)>
- Node 16: Can form a 3-star <16, (18, 14, 19)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
