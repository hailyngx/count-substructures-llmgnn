Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node: 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
