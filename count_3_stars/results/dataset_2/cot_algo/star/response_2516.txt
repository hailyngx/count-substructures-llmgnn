Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 5}

Next, we identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0 forms 4 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 1 forms 3 3-stars: <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 3 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 forms 9 3-stars: <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 7 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 9 forms 3 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 9 + 1 + 3 = 22. So the final answer is [22].
