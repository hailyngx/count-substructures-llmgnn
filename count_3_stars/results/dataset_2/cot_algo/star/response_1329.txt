Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 12) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 14) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 6: It has 4 neighbors (5, 3, 4, 0), so we calculate \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
For node 9: It has 4 neighbors (4, 14, 3, 1), so we calculate \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 10: It has 4 neighbors (11, 3, 12, 1), so we calculate \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 11: It has 5 neighbors (10, 14, 1, 12, 2), so we calculate \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 12: It has 4 neighbors (10, 11, 7, 4), so we calculate \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 14: It has 6 neighbors (9, 11, 8, 5, 0, 1), so we calculate \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 46.

Therefore, the final answer is [46], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<6, (5, 3, 4)>
<9, (4, 14, 3)>
<10, (11, 3, 12)>
<11, (10, 14, 1)>
<12, (10, 11, 7)>
<14, (9, 11, 8)>
<14, (9, 5, 0)>
<14, (9, 5, 1)>
<14, (11, 8, 5)>
<14, (11, 1, 0)>
