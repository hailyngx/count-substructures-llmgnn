Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 13) (14, 17) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 2) (8, 19) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 0) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 4) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 16) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 6) (0, 13) (0, 18) (0, 6) (5, 16) (15, 13) (15, 10) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 9) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 9) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 19) (9, 16) (18, 7) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {13, 18, 6}
Node 1: {11, 19, 18}
Node 2: {4, 17, 19, 12}
Node 3: {4, 9}
Node 4: {7, 16, 3, 2}
Node 5: {16}
Node 6: {7, 17, 11, 0}
Node 7: {4, 6, 18, 13}
Node 8: {19}
Node 9: {3, 19, 16}
Node 10: {11, 15, 16}
Node 11: {1, 10, 6}
Node 12: {2, 16}
Node 13: {7, 15, 0}
Node 14: {17, 18}
Node 15: {13, 10}
Node 16: {4, 10, 5, 12, 9}
Node 17: {14, 6, 2}
Node 18: {7, 14, 1, 0}
Node 19: {8, 1, 2, 9}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 4, 2, 9, 16, 6, 7, 18, 1, 0, 19, 17

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].
