Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4

Now, let's check for nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors, inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 1: 5 neighbors, inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: 5 neighbors, inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed
- Node 7: 4 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed
- Node 8: 4 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed

Add up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 = 30
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <1, 3, 8>
