Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 6) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 24) (7, 14) (21, 6) (21, 23) (10, 8) (10, 22) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 29) (11, 20) (20, 11) (20, 25) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 29) (25, 4) (25, 22) (1, 15) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 4) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 13) (29, 11) (29, 25) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 12) (2, 0) (2, 12) (24, 7) (24, 26) (24, 17) (26, 28) (26, 24) (26, 17) (6, 27) (6, 21) (6, 11) (6, 19) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 19) (16, 1) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 2) (19, 11) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 23) (22, 10) (22, 25) (22, 5) (22, 17) (5, 8) (5, 22) (5, 18) (5, 17) (18, 5) (18, 23) (23, 21) (23, 19) (23, 18) (17, 24) (17, 26) (17, 9) (17, 22) (17, 5) (13, 15) (13, 28) (4, 25) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 7, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 12, 15, 16}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 25}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8, 17, 18, 22}
- Node 6: Neighbors {11, 19, 21, 27}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 14, 24}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9, 10}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8, 17, 19}
- Node 10: Neighbors {8, 22}
- Node 11: Neighbors {6, 19, 20, 29}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 2, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {15, 28}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 3, 7, 12}
- Node 15: Neighbors {1, 13, 27}
- Node 16: Neighbors {1}
- Node 17: Neighbors {5, 9, 17, 22, 24, 26}
- Node 18: Neighbors {5, 23}
- Node 19: Neighbors {6, 9, 11, 23}
- Node 20: Neighbors {11, 25, 28}
- Node 21: Neighbors {6, 23}
- Node 22: Neighbors {5, 10, 17, 25}
- Node 23: Neighbors {18, 19, 21}
- Node 24: Neighbors {7, 17, 26}
- Node 25: Neighbors {4, 20, 22, 29}
- Node 26: Neighbors {17, 24, 28}
- Node 27: Neighbors {6, 15}
- Node 28: Neighbors {13, 20, 26}
- Node 29: Neighbors {11, 25}

Next, we will identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 15: <15, (1, 13, 27)>
- Node 17: <17, (5, 9, 22)>, <17, (5, 22, 24)>, <17, (9, 22, 24)>, <17, (17, 24, 26)>
- Node 19: <19, (6, 9, 11)>, <19, (6, 11, 23)>, <19, (9, 11, 23)>
- Node 25: <25, (4, 22, 29)>, <25, (20, 22, 25)>, <25, (20, 25, 29)>
- Node 26: <26, (17, 24, 28)>

Counting up the total unique 3-stars found, we have 12 in total. Therefore, the final answer is [12].
