Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 28) (1, 4) (1, 9) (21, 13) (2, 22) (2, 7) (29, 27) (29, 11) (0, 27) (0, 24) (0, 19) (27, 29) (27, 0) (27, 14) (27, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 29) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 22) (5, 15) (6, 23) (6, 4) (20, 23) (20, 28) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 9) (22, 2) (22, 11) (25, 16) (25, 4) (23, 6) (23, 20) (23, 26) (26, 23) (26, 15) (26, 16) (26, 3) (26, 8) (14, 27) (14, 11) (14, 28) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 26) (15, 9) (13, 21) (13, 19) (13, 12) (13, 28) (7, 2) (7, 24) (7, 8) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 15) (9, 24) (9, 16) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 3) (24, 0) (24, 7) (24, 9) (8, 10) (8, 26) (8, 7) (8, 18) (28, 1) (28, 20) (28, 14) (28, 13) (16, 25) (16, 26) (16, 9) (3, 27) (3, 26) (3, 12) (3, 18) (3, 4) (18, 8) (18, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 25) (4, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes and their neighbors based on the given edge list. 

Here are the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 27, 24, 19
- Node 1: 28, 4, 9
- Node 2: 22, 7
- Node 3: 27, 26, 12, 18, 4
- Node 4: 1, 6, 25, 3
- Node 5: 15
- Node 6: 23, 4
- Node 7: 2, 24, 8
- Node 8: 10, 26, 7, 18
- Node 9: 1, 19, 15, 24, 16
- Node 10: 11, 8, 12
- Node 11: 29, 10, 14, 22
- Node 12: 10, 13, 3
- Node 13: 21, 19, 12, 28
- Node 14: 27, 11, 28
- Node 15: 5, 19, 26, 9
- Node 16: 25, 26, 9
- Node 18: 8, 3
- Node 19: 0, 15, 13, 9
- Node 20: 23, 28
- Node 21: 13
- Node 22: 2, 11
- Node 23: 6, 20, 26
- Node 24: 0, 7, 9
- Node 25: 16, 4
- Node 26: 23, 15, 16, 3, 8
- Node 27: 29, 0, 14, 3
- Node 28: 1, 20, 14, 13
- Node 29: 27, 11

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: [1]
  <0, (27, 24, 19)>

- Node 1: [1]
  <1, (28, 4, 9)>

- Node 3: [1]
  <3, (27, 26, 12)>

- Node 4: [1]
  <4, (6, 25, 3)>

- Node 8: [1]
  <8, (26, 7, 18)>

- Node 9: [1]
  <9, (15, 19, 24)>

- Node 11: [1]
  <11, (29, 14, 22)>

- Node 13: [1]
  <13, (19, 12, 28)>

- Node 15: [1]
  <15, (19, 26, 9)>

- Node 16: [1]
  <16, (25, 26, 9)>

- Node 18: [1]
  <18, (8, 3, 26)>

- Node 19: [1]
  <19, (15, 13, 9)>

- Node 26: [1]
  <26, (15, 16, 3)>

- Node 27: [1]
  <27, (29, 14, 0)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
