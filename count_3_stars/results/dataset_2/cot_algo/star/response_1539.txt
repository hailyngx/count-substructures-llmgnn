Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 17) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 8) (9, 14) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 19) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 7) (18, 1) (18, 8) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 19) (7, 17) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 18) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 14) (6, 3) (6, 13) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 11) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 13) (19, 15) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 19) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 12) (14, 9) (14, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {3, 7, 16, 19}
Node 1: {3, 10, 18}
Node 2: {11, 12, 13}
Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 12, 15}
Node 5: {8, 11}
Node 6: {3, 13}
Node 7: {0, 17}
Node 8: {5, 9, 18}
Node 9: {8, 14}
Node 10: {1, 13, 15, 19}
Node 11: {2, 5, 19}
Node 12: {2, 3, 13, 17}
Node 13: {2, 6, 10, 12}
Node 14: {9, 16}
Node 15: {3, 10, 17, 19}
Node 16: {0, 14, 19}
Node 17: {7, 12, 15}
Node 18: {1, 8}
Node 19: {0, 10, 11, 16, 19}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3, 12, 15, and 19 each have more than 3 neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 3, 12>
- <0, 3, 15>
- <0, 3, 19>
- <0, 12, 15>
- <0, 12, 19>
- <0, 15, 19>
- <3, 12, 15>
- <3, 12, 17>
- <3, 15, 17>
- <3, 15, 19>
- <3, 17, 19>
- <12, 15, 17>
- <12, 15, 19>
- <12, 17, 19>
- <15, 17, 19>
- <19, 11, 10>
