Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 29) (26, 6) (26, 4) (11, 17) (16, 0) (16, 2) (1, 28) (1, 19) (3, 10) (3, 22) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 24) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 7) (4, 26) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 20) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 27) (6, 26) (6, 23) (6, 0) (28, 1) (28, 17) (28, 21) (21, 28) (22, 3) (22, 4) (22, 20) (22, 24) (5, 23) (5, 18) (5, 0) (19, 1) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 5) (18, 5) (18, 20) (18, 12) (18, 13) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 24) (2, 14) (12, 18) (12, 2) (12, 14) (23, 9) (23, 6) (23, 5) (23, 25) (23, 27) (27, 8) (27, 23) (27, 20) (29, 26) (7, 17) (7, 20) (7, 14) (20, 4) (20, 22) (20, 18) (20, 27) (20, 7) (13, 4) (13, 18) (15, 8) (15, 25) (25, 23) (25, 15) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 7) (14, 24) (24, 10) (24, 22) (24, 2) (24, 14) 

Response:
Since this graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges, it is not a 3-star graph. We will analyze the structure of this graph to identify any 3-stars formed.

Let's first list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {16, 6, 5}
- Node 1: {28, 19}
- Node 2: {16, 10, 12, 24, 14}
- Node 3: {10, 22}
- Node 4: {26, 8, 22, 13, 20}
- Node 5: {23, 0, 18}
- Node 6: {26, 23, 0}
- Node 7: {17, 20, 14}
- Node 8: {4, 15, 27}
- Node 9: {26, 23}
- Node 10: {3, 17, 2, 24}
- Node 11: {17}
- Node 12: {18, 2, 14}
- Node 13: {4, 18}
- Node 14: {2, 7, 12, 24}
- Node 15: {8, 25}
- Node 16: {0, 2}
- Node 17: {11, 10, 28, 7}
- Node 18: {5, 20, 12, 13}
- Node 19: {1}
- Node 20: {4, 22, 18, 27, 7}
- Node 21: {28}
- Node 22: {3, 4, 20, 24}
- Node 23: {5, 6, 27, 25, 9}
- Node 24: {10, 2, 14, 22}
- Node 25: {23, 15}
- Node 26: {9, 29, 6, 4}
- Node 27: {8, 20, 23}
- Node 28: {1, 17, 21}
- Node 29: {26}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves: <2, (12, 14, 24)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves: <4, (8, 13, 20)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with leaves: <10, (17, 2, 24)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with leaves: <14, (2, 7, 24)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with leaves: <17, (10, 7, 28)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with leaves: <18, (5, 12, 20)>
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with leaves: <20, (4, 7, 22)>
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with leaves: <23, (5, 25, 27)>
  
In total, there are 8 unique 3-stars, so the final number inside brackets is [8].
