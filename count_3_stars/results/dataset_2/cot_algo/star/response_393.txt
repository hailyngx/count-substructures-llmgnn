Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 3) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 5) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 2) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 8, 11, 5}
- Node 1: {4, 2, 5}
- Node 2: {4, 3, 7, 5, 1, 10}
- Node 3: {9, 13, 10, 2}
- Node 4: {9, 10, 1, 2}
- Node 5: {8, 12, 2, 1, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 12, 0}
- Node 7: {6, 14, 2}
- Node 8: {5, 14, 11, 0}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 14, 3}
- Node 10: {4, 3, 2, 14}
- Node 11: {8, 13, 14, 0}
- Node 12: {6, 13, 5}
- Node 13: {12, 11, 3}
- Node 14: {9, 8, 11, 7, 10}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: <4, (9, 10, 1)>
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: <6, (9, 7, 12)>
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: <9, (6, 4, 14)>
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: <11, (8, 13, 14)>
- Node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 14: <14, (9, 8, 11)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].
