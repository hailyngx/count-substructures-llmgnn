Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 13) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 20) (26, 25) (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 28) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 25) (3, 25) (3, 23) (25, 26) (25, 21) (25, 3) (25, 16) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 18) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) (15, 1) (15, 20) (15, 22) (15, 14) (15, 12) (20, 26) (20, 15) (20, 8) (4, 6) (18, 11) (18, 23) (18, 29) (7, 10) (7, 17) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 8) (5, 26) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (23, 3) (23, 10) (23, 18) (2, 17) (2, 22) (2, 19) (22, 15) (22, 2) (22, 28) (22, 29) (16, 25) (16, 12) (16, 27) (14, 15) (14, 8) (14, 28) (14, 19) (0, 1) (0, 8) (28, 1) (28, 22) (28, 14) (8, 20) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 0) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 29) (19, 27) (27, 21) (27, 16) (27, 19) (29, 18) (29, 22) (29, 19) (13, 9) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 15, 21, 28}
- Node 2: {17, 19, 22}
- Node 3: {23, 25}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 26}
- Node 6: {4, 5}
- Node 7: {10, 17}
- Node 8: {0, 12, 14, 20}
- Node 9: {12, 13, 26}
- Node 10: {7, 11, 17, 23}
- Node 11: {10, 18}
- Node 12: {8, 9, 15, 16}
- Node 13: {9}
- Node 14: {8, 15, 19, 28}
- Node 15: {1, 12, 14, 20, 22}
- Node 16: {12, 25, 27}
- Node 17: {2, 7, 10}
- Node 18: {11, 23, 29}
- Node 19: {2, 14, 27, 29}
- Node 20: {8, 15, 26}
- Node 21: {1, 25, 27}
- Node 22: {2, 15, 19, 28, 29}
- Node 23: {3, 10, 18}
- Node 25: {3, 21, 26, 16}
- Node 26: {5, 9, 20, 25}
- Node 27: {16, 19, 21}
- Node 28: {1, 14, 22}
- Node 29: {18, 19, 22}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 15, Node 19, Node 22, Node 25 

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 38 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [38], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 5, 15, 21>
- <1, 5, 15, 28>
- <1, 5, 21, 28>
- <1, 15, 21, 28>
- <15, 20, 25, 26>
- <15, 22, 25, 26>
- <15, 22, 25, 27>
- <15, 22, 26, 27>
- <19, 22, 25, 29>
- <22, 25, 26, 27>
