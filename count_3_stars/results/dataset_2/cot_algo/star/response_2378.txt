Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 9) (16, 6) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 13) (7, 12) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 15) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 9) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 13) (19, 18) (19, 13) (15, 12) (15, 14) (14, 2) (14, 15) (6, 16) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 4) (0, 1) (0, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (9, 16) (9, 13) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 8, 17}
- Node 2: Neighbors {10, 12, 14, 18}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 11}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 10, 12, 16}
- Node 7: Neighbor {12}
- Node 8: Neighbor {1, 11}
- Node 9: Neighbor {13, 16}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 4, 6}
- Node 11: Neighbors {5, 8, 18}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 6, 7, 15, 17}
- Node 13: Neighbors {9, 17, 18, 19}
- Node 14: Neighbors {2, 15}
- Node 15: Neighbors {12, 14}
- Node 16: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 17: Neighbors {1, 12, 13}
- Node 18: Neighbors {2, 11, 13, 19}
- Node 19: Neighbors {13, 18}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 36 \), so the final number to be placed inside brackets is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (0, 5, 17)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 17)>, <1, (0, 5, 17)>, <1, (1, 5, 17)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (1, 3, 4)>, <1, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <12, (2, 6, 7)>, <12, (2, 6, 15)>, <12, (2, 7, 15)>, <12, (6, 7, 15)>, <12, (6, 7, 17)>, <13, (9, 17, 19)>, <18, (2, 13, 19)>, <18, (2, 18, 19)>, <18, (13, 17, 19)>, <18, (13, 18, 19)>.
