Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars formed: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 54

Therefore, the final answer is [54], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 3, 5>
- <1, 3, 5, 7>
- <1, 3, 7, 9>
