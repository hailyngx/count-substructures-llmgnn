Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 10) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 19) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (7, 6) (7, 17) (12, 5) (12, 14) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 14) (18, 11) (18, 4) (0, 8) (5, 17) (5, 12) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 17) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 17) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 4) (2, 15) 

Response:
First, let's construct the adjacency list for each node based on the given edge list:

Node 0: {8}
Node 1: {11, 16, 6, 17}
Node 2: {15}
Node 3: {11, 15, 4}
Node 4: {3, 18, 14}
Node 5: {17, 12}
Node 6: {9, 1, 7, 13, 8}
Node 7: {6, 17}
Node 8: {6, 9, 0}
Node 9: {6, 8, 19}
Node 10: {16, 17, 14}
Node 11: {1, 16, 3, 18}
Node 12: {5, 14}
Node 13: {16, 15, 6}
Node 14: {10, 12, 4}
Node 15: {3, 13, 19, 2}
Node 16: {11, 1, 13, 10}
Node 17: {10, 1, 19, 5, 7}
Node 18: {11, 4}
Node 19: {15, 9, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to check for the formation of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 42, which can be represented as [42].
