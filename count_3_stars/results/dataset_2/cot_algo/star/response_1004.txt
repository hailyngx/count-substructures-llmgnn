Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (4, 0) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 11) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 2) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 14) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 10) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 2) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 11)>
<0, (1, 11, 14)>
<0, (4, 5, 12)>
<1, (0, 11, 14)>
<3, (2, 8, 10)>
<3, (2, 8, 14)>
<4, (0, 1, 11)>
<4, (0, 5, 12)>
<5, (4, 8, 12)>
<7, (0, 4, 13)>
<8, (2, 3, 10)>
<9, (6, 7, 13)>
<12, (0, 4, 5)>
