Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 3, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 3, 2, 9, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 1, 0, 9, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 0, 5, 1, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 3, 6, 2, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7, 1, 3, 6, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 2, 0}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 59, therefore the answer is [59].

Some of the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (4, 3, 5)>
- <1, (4, 6, 3)>
- <1, (3, 2, 9)>
- <3, (7, 1, 8)>
- <4, (7, 0, 5)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 6)>
