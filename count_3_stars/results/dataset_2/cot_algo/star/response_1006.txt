Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 13) (9, 18) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 24) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 8) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 15) (22, 17) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 1) (23, 27) (0, 8) (0, 13) (27, 23) (27, 29) (27, 3) (27, 20) (17, 22) (17, 29) (29, 27) (29, 17) (29, 5) (29, 21) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 12) (26, 19) (26, 14) (26, 11) (26, 16) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 10) (21, 29) (21, 3) (14, 9) (14, 22) (14, 26) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 23) (1, 8) (2, 12) (2, 20) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 25) (18, 9) (18, 15) (15, 22) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 28) (25, 23) (25, 12) (25, 16) (11, 19) (11, 26) (11, 15) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (24, 4) (24, 7) (24, 12) (16, 26) (16, 25) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 20) (20, 27) (20, 2) (20, 8) (20, 5) (28, 15) (28, 5) (5, 29) (5, 20) (5, 28) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star must have exactly three neighbors. Let's first find all the nodes that have at least three neighbors:

1. Node 1 has neighbors: 6, 4, 23, 8
2. Node 4 has neighbors: 7, 24, 1
3. Node 7 has neighbors: 4, 24, 8
4. Node 12 has neighbors: 19, 2, 24, 25
5. Node 15 has neighbors: 22, 18, 11, 28
6. Node 20 has neighbors: 27, 2, 8, 5
7. Node 22 has neighbors: 23, 14, 15, 17
8. Node 23 has neighbors: 22, 25, 1, 27
9. Node 26 has neighbors: 19, 14, 11, 16
10. Node 27 has neighbors: 23, 29, 3, 20
11. Node 29 has neighbors: 27, 17, 5, 21

So, the nodes that can form 3-stars are: 1, 4, 7, 12, 15, 20, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29

Next, we count the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, 4, 23, 8>
2. Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, 7, 24, 8>
3. Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, 4, 24, 8>
4. Node 12 forms 1 3-star: <12, 19, 2, 24>
5. Node 15 forms 1 3-star: <15, 22, 18, 28>
6. Node 20 forms 1 3-star: <20, 27, 2, 5>
7. Node 22 forms 1 3-star: <22, 23, 14, 17>
8. Node 23 forms 1 3-star: <23, 25, 1, 27>
9. Node 26 forms 1 3-star: <26, 19, 14, 11>
10. Node 27 forms 1 3-star: <27, 29, 3, 20>
11. Node 29 forms 1 3-star: <29, 17, 5, 21>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
