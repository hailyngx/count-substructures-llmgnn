Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 14) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 3) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) (1, 5) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {9, 8, 6, 2}
- Node 1: {5, 2}
- Node 2: {12, 0, 3, 1, 6, 10}
- Node 3: {5, 4, 11, 10, 2}
- Node 4: {13, 6, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 1, 7, 11, 3}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 0, 2}
- Node 7: {5, 12, 11, 6, 14}
- Node 8: {13, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 10, 0, 12}
- Node 10: {9, 14, 3, 2}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 3}
- Node 12: {9, 13, 7, 2}
- Node 13: {5, 8, 12, 4, 14}
- Node 14: {13, 7, 10}

Node 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, and 13 have 6 or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.
Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 74

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [74].

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (0, 6, 10)>
<3, (5, 4, 11)>
<5, (9, 1, 13)>
<7, (12, 14, 11)>
<12, (9, 13, 7)>
<13, (5, 8, 14)>
