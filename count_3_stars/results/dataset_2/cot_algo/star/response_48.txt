Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 19) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 12) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 15) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 12) (7, 18) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 10) (1, 13) (15, 14) (15, 4) (15, 5) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 1) (16, 0) (16, 6) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 19) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 5) (6, 18) (6, 16) (19, 17) (19, 9) (19, 10) (5, 15) (5, 3) (5, 10) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {14, 7, 16, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 3, 11}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {18, 9, 15}
- Node 5: Neighbors {15, 3, 10}
- Node 6: Neighbors {18, 16}
- Node 7: Neighbors {18, 8, 0, 10}
- Node 8: Neighbors {11, 12, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 4, 19}
- Node 10: Neighbors {7, 19, 5}
- Node 11: Neighbors {14, 2, 8}
- Node 12: Neighbors {18, 8, 0}
- Node 13: Neighbors {14, 17, 1}
- Node 14: Neighbors {17, 0, 11, 15, 13}
- Node 15: Neighbors {14, 4, 5}
- Node 16: Neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 17: Neighbors {14, 13, 19}
- Node 18: Neighbors {4, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 19: Neighbors {17, 9, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 7, Node 12, Node 14, Node 18, Node 19

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of unique 3-stars they are part of:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <0, (14, 7, 16)>, <0, (14, 7, 12)>, <0, (14, 16, 12)>, <0, (7, 16, 12)>
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <7, (18, 8, 10)>, <7, (18, 0, 10)>, <7, (18, 12, 10)>, <7, (8, 0, 12)>
- For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <12, (18, 8, 0)>, <12, (18, 8, 7)>, <12, (18, 0, 7)>, <12, (8, 0, 7)>
- For Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <14, (17, 11, 15)>, <14, (17, 11, 13)>, <14, (17, 15, 13)>, <14, (11, 15, 13)>, <14, (17, 11, 0)>, <14, (17, 15, 0)>, <14, (11, 15, 0)>, <14, (11, 13, 0)>, <14, (15, 13, 0)>, <14, (17, 13, 0)>
- For Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <18, (4, 6, 12)>, <18, (4, 7, 12)>, <18, (6, 7, 12)>, <18, (4, 8, 12)>
- For Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <19, (17, 9, 10)>

Adding these up, we get a total of 27 unique 3-stars:
