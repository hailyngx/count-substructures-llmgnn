Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 12) (5, 14) (18, 13) (18, 8) (1, 15) (1, 11) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 2) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 14) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (10, 7) (10, 2) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 12) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 11) (3, 17) (3, 8) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (8, 18) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 12) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 16) (14, 8) (13, 18) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 11) (2, 6) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 17) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we need to identify the 3-star structures. Let's first calculate the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {15, 19, 13, 12} (degree: 4)
- Node 1: {15, 11} (degree: 2)
- Node 2: {6, 15, 10, 17} (degree: 4)
- Node 3: {17, 8} (degree: 2)
- Node 5: {14} (degree: 1)
- Node 6: {9, 17, 7, 2} (degree: 4)
- Node 7: {6, 16, 10, 14} (degree: 4)
- Node 8: {18, 3, 14, 12} (degree: 4)
- Node 9: {6, 12} (degree: 2)
- Node 10: {7, 2} (degree: 2)
- Node 11: {1, 17, 13} (degree: 3)
- Node 12: {9, 0, 19, 8} (degree: 4)
- Node 13: {18, 16, 0, 11} (degree: 4)
- Node 14: {5, 7, 16, 8} (degree: 4)
- Node 15: {1, 19, 0, 2} (degree: 4)
- Node 16: {7, 13, 14} (degree: 3)
- Node 17: {6, 3, 2, 11} (degree: 4)
- Node 18: {13, 8} (degree: 2)
- Node 19: {15, 0, 12} (degree: 3)

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms one 3-star: <0, 15, 19>
- Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, 15, 17>
- Node 6 forms one 3-star: <6, 7, 17>
- Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, 14, 16>
- Node 8 forms one 3-star: <8, 12, 14>
- Node 12 forms one 3-star: <12, 0, 19>
- Node 13 forms one 3-star: <13, 0, 11>
- Node 14 forms one 3-star: <14, 5, 8>
- Node 15 forms one 3-star: <15, 1, 19>
- Node 17 forms one 3-star: <17, 2, 11>

The total number of 3-stars is 9, so the final answer is [9].
