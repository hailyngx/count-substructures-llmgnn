Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 18) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 13) (13, 2) (13, 15) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 4) (4, 10) (4, 17) (12, 5) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 14) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 3) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 6) (19, 3) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 0) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 8) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 15, 6
- Node 1: 16, 2, 8
- Node 2: 8, 1, 13, 6
- Node 3: 17, 14, 19, 0
- Node 4: 10, 17
- Node 5: 9, 12, 0
- Node 6: 2, 18, 0
- Node 7: 16, 10, 14
- Node 8: 9, 2, 1
- Node 9: 5, 8, 18
- Node 10: 11, 15, 7, 4
- Node 11: 10, 14, 17
- Node 12: 5
- Node 13: 2, 15
- Node 14: 11, 7, 3
- Node 15: 10, 0, 18, 13
- Node 16: 7, 1, 18
- Node 17: 11, 3, 4
- Node 18: 16, 9, 15, 6
- Node 19: 3

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 18

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{12}{3} = 220 \]

So, there are 220 3-stars in the graph. 

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (5, 15, 6)>
- <1, (16, 2, 8)>
- <2, (8, 1, 13)>
- <3, (17, 14, 19)>
- <5, (9, 12, 0)>
- <6, (2, 18, 0)>
- <8, (9, 18, 2)>
- <9, (5, 8, 18)>
- <10, (11, 15, 7)>
- <11, (10, 14, 17)>
- <15, (10, 0, 18)>
- <18, (16, 9, 15)> 

So, the final answer is [220].
