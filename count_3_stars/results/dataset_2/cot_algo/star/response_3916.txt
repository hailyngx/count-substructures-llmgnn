Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 13) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 3) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {11, 13, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 12, 8, 6, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 6, 10, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 12, 2, 10}
- Node 4: Neighbors {13, 14, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 12, 10, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 14, 1, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7, 11, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 2, 14, 1}
- Node 10: Neighbors {5, 12, 2, 3}
- Node 11: Neighbors {12, 0, 14, 8, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {5, 10, 11, 3, 1}
- Node 13: Neighbors {4, 0, 14, 1, 11}
- Node 14: Neighbors {9, 4, 11, 6, 13}

Now we will check the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 1, Node 9, and Node 12 each have exactly 3 neighbors, so they each form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars formed by each node:
1 (from Node 1) + 1 (from Node 9) + 1 (from Node 12) + 10 (from Node 11) + 10 (from Node 13) = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, 9, 6>, <11, 8, 13>, <11, 13, 1>, <11, 13, 14>, <11, 13, 0>, <11, 13, 4>, <13, 0, 11>, <13, 1, 11>, <13, 1, 14>, <13, 1, 4>
