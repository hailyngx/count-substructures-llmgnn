Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 11) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 2) (22, 12) (2, 22) (2, 3) (29, 7) (29, 8) (29, 10) (3, 2) (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 24) (3, 11) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 5) (25, 4) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 28) (12, 13) (12, 22) (12, 27) (12, 15) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 7) (27, 16) (6, 21) (6, 23) (28, 18) (28, 16) (28, 24) (4, 25) (4, 18) (4, 14) (26, 13) (26, 22) (26, 5) (1, 17) (1, 7) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 15) (21, 3) (21, 6) (21, 0) (7, 29) (7, 25) (7, 27) (7, 1) (7, 10) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 8) (23, 6) (23, 11) (23, 20) (23, 19) (16, 27) (16, 28) (0, 21) (10, 29) (10, 7) (5, 25) (5, 26) (5, 17) (9, 24) (9, 19) (24, 3) (24, 28) (24, 9) (24, 15) (15, 12) (15, 17) (15, 24) (14, 4) (8, 29) (8, 12) (8, 11) (20, 23) (20, 19) (19, 23) (19, 9) (19, 20) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are:  
Node 3: (2, 25, 21, 24, 11)  
Node 7: (29, 25, 27, 1, 10)  
Node 12: (13, 22, 27, 15, 8)  
Node 13: (26, 12, 11)  
Node 18: (22, 4, 28)  
Node 19: (23, 9, 20)  
Node 22: (18, 26, 12, 2)  
Node 23: (6, 11, 20, 19)  
Node 24: (3, 28, 9, 15)  
Node 25: (3, 7, 5, 4)  
Node 27: (12, 7, 16)  
Node 29: (7, 8, 10)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 39 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars are:
