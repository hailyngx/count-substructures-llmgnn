Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 neighbors: 5, 9, 1, 4, 8, 7
- Node 1 neighbors: 6, 3, 4, 0, 2
- Node 2 neighbors: 6, 1, 4, 8
- Node 3 neighbors: 6, 1, 4
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 0, 2
- Node 5 neighbors: 9, 0, 7
- Node 6 neighbors: 9, 1, 3, 2
- Node 7 neighbors: 5, 0
- Node 8 neighbors: 9, 4, 2, 0
- Node 9 neighbors: 5, 9, 6, 8, 0

Now, let's identify the 3-star structures:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of unique 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are:
