Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 6) (15, 2) (15, 11) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 16) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 13) (17, 10) (17, 7) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 9) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 16) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 12) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 5) (19, 10) (19, 7) (19, 13) (2, 15) (2, 16) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 18) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 19) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 9) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 1) (13, 6) (6, 3) (6, 13) (5, 16)

The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:
- Node 0: 1, 12, 14
- Node 1: 0, 9, 13
- Node 2: 15, 16
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 8, 9, 18
- Node 5: 16
- Node 6: 3, 13
- Node 7: 3, 8, 17, 19
- Node 8: 4, 7, 12
- Node 9: 1, 4, 14
- Node 10: 11, 16, 17, 19
- Node 11: 10, 13, 14, 15, 18
- Node 12: 0, 8, 18
- Node 13: 1, 6, 11, 19
- Node 14: 0, 9, 11, 16

There are [4] unique 3-stars in this graph:
- <0, (1, 12, 14)>
- <3, (6, 7, 17)>
- <11, (13, 14, 19)>
- <16, (10, 14, 19)>
