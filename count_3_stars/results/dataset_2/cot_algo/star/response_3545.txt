Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 29) (1, 0) (21, 27) (21, 20) (21, 22) (6, 1) (6, 12) (9, 13) (9, 12) (22, 21) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 17) (23, 22) (23, 4) (2, 19) (2, 20) (2, 15) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 12) (15, 2) (15, 20) (15, 10) (20, 21) (20, 2) (20, 15) (20, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 28) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 0) (16, 29) (16, 25) (28, 5) (28, 24) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 29) (17, 22) (17, 13) (17, 25) (26, 18) (26, 8) (25, 16) (25, 17) (25, 27) (27, 21) (27, 25) (27, 11) (19, 2) (19, 18) (11, 27) (11, 7) (14, 22) (14, 10) (3, 29) (7, 13) (7, 11) (29, 1) (29, 16) (29, 10) (29, 3) (29, 8) (8, 26) (8, 29) (8, 24) (8, 0) (24, 28) (24, 8) (24, 0) (4, 23) (4, 20) (4, 0) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 8) (0, 24) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 13, 8, 24, 4
- Node 1: 6, 29, 0
- Node 2: 19, 20, 15
- Node 3: 29
- Node 4: 23, 20, 0
- Node 5: 13, 12, 28
- Node 6: 1, 12
- Node 7: 13, 11
- Node 8: 26, 29, 24, 0
- Node 9: 13, 12
- Node 10: 15, 12, 14, 29
- Node 11: 27, 7
- Node 12: 6, 9, 18, 5, 10
- Node 13: 9, 5, 17, 7, 0
- Node 14: 22, 10
- Node 15: 2, 20, 10
- Node 16: 29, 25
- Node 17: 22, 13, 25
- Node 18: 26, 19, 12
- Node 19: 18, 2
- Node 20: 21, 2, 15, 4
- Node 21: 27, 20, 22
- Node 22: 21, 23, 14, 17
- Node 23: 22, 4
- Node 24: 28, 8, 0
- Node 25: 16, 17, 27
- Node 26: 18, 8
- Node 27: 21, 25, 11
- Node 28: 5, 24
- Node 29: 1, 16, 10, 3, 8

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 8, Node 12, Node 13, Node 20, Node 22, Node 29

Now, we'll apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [52].
