Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 9) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 10) (14, 9) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {13, 6, 2, 10, 1}
Node 1: {8, 12, 11, 0, 10}
Node 2: {11, 0}
Node 3: {8, 5, 12, 9}
Node 4: {7, 8, 10}
Node 5: {7, 8, 6, 12, 3}
Node 6: {7, 5, 11, 0}
Node 7: {4, 12, 11, 6, 5}
Node 8: {4, 5, 3, 1}
Node 9: {13, 3, 11, 10, 14}
Node 10: {4, 13, 0, 1, 9}
Node 11: {7, 6, 2, 1, 9}
Node 12: {7, 5, 3, 1}
Node 13: {10, 9, 0}
Node 14: {9}

Next, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star:

Nodes with 3 neighbors or more: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
\[
\binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 65
\]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 65. 
Therefore, the final answer is [65].

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (13, 6, 10)>, <1, (8, 12, 11)>, <3, (8, 5, 12)>, <4, (7, 8, 10)>, <5, (7, 8, 6)>, <6, (7, 5, 11)>, <7, (4, 12, 11)>, <8, (4, 5, 3)>, <9, (13, 11, 10)>, <10, (4, 13, 0)>, <11, (7, 6, 2)>, (9, 14, 13), <5, 3, 12>, <6, (7, 12, 5)>, <7, (11, 6, 5)>, <9, (10, 11, 14)>, <10, (0, 13, 1)>, <12, (1, 3, 5)>, <13, (0, 1, 9)>
