Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (28, 29) (28, 26) (28, 27) (29, 28) (29, 5) (29, 14) (29, 10) (18, 4) (18, 25) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (26, 28) (26, 11) (26, 0) (3, 17) (3, 20) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 26) (11, 9) (11, 25) (14, 29) (14, 15) (14, 21) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 19) (15, 24) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 25) (19, 21) (16, 6) (24, 15) (24, 0) (24, 27) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 23) (0, 26) (0, 24) (0, 6) (5, 29) (5, 20) (12, 3) (27, 28) (27, 24) (27, 1) (20, 3) (20, 5) (20, 9) (20, 23) (6, 16) (6, 0) (25, 18) (25, 11) (25, 19) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 20) (23, 17) (23, 20) (23, 21) (1, 8) (1, 27) (1, 10) (1, 22) (10, 29) (10, 1) (21, 14) (21, 19) (21, 23) (21, 22) (22, 1) (22, 21) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

After exploring the neighbors for each node, we find that:
- Node 0 has neighbors: [6, 24, 26]
- Node 1 has neighbors: [8, 10, 22, 27]
- Node 2 has neighbors: [4, 8, 13]
- Node 3 has neighbors: [12, 17, 20]
- Node 4 has neighbors: [2, 7, 11, 18]
- Node 5 has neighbors: [20, 29]
- Node 6 has neighbors: [0, 16]
- Node 7 has neighbors: [4, 9, 19]
- Node 8 has neighbors: [1, 2, 13]
- Node 9 has neighbors: [7, 9, 11, 17, 20]
- Node 10 has neighbors: [1, 10, 22, 29]
- Node 11 has neighbors: [4, 9, 11, 25, 26]
- Node 12 has neighbors: [3]
- Node 13 has neighbors: [2, 8, 15]
- Node 14 has neighbors: [15, 21, 29]
- Node 15 has neighbors: [13, 14, 19, 24]
- Node 16 has neighbors: [6]
- Node 17 has neighbors: [3, 9, 17, 23]
- Node 18 has neighbors: [4, 25]
- Node 19 has neighbors: [7, 15, 19, 21, 25]
- Node 20 has neighbors: [3, 5, 9, 20, 23]
- Node 21 has neighbors: [14, 19, 21, 22, 23]
- Node 22 has neighbors: [1, 21, 22]
- Node 23 has neighbors: [17, 20, 21, 23]
- Node 24 has neighbors: [0, 15, 24, 27]
- Node 25 has neighbors: [11, 18, 19, 25]
- Node 26 has neighbors: [0, 11, 26, 28]
- Node 27 has neighbors: [1, 24, 27, 28]
- Node 28 has neighbors: [26, 27, 29]
- Node 29 has neighbors: [5, 10, 14, 29]

We can see that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: {1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29}

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars:
[ \binom{16}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{1}{3} ] = [560]

Therefore, there are a total of 560 unique 3-stars in the graph.
