Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 9) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 10) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 10) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbor sets for each node:

1. Node 0: {3, 4, 7, 9, 12}
2. Node 1: {5, 10, 14}
3. Node 2: {8, 9, 11}
4. Node 3: {0, 9, 10}
5. Node 4: {0, 9, 10, 11}
6. Node 5: {1, 11, 13, 14}
7. Node 6: {7, 8, 12, 13}
8. Node 7: {6, 12, 14}
9. Node 8: {2, 6, 9, 12}
10. Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 13}
11. Node 10: {1, 3, 4, 13}
12. Node 11: {2, 4, 5, 13, 14}
13. Node 12: {6, 7, 8, 14}
14. Node 13: {5, 9, 10, 11}
15. Node 14: {1, 7, 11, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
6. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
7. Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
8. Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
9. Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 65

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [65].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (3, 4, 12)>
<4, (0, 9, 10)>
<5, (1, 11, 14)>
<6, (7, 8, 13)>
<7, (12, 14, 6)>
<8, (2, 9, 12)>
<9, (0, 2, 13)>
<11, (2, 5, 13)>
<12, (6, 7, 8)>
<13, (9, 10, 11)>
<14, (1, 7, 11)>
