Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 9) (15, 28) (15, 11) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 23) (27, 22) (27, 7) (27, 16) (27, 5) (8, 0) (8, 11) (13, 18) (7, 27) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 28) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 23) (28, 15) (28, 7) (28, 6) (28, 14) (29, 16) (29, 21) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 9) (26, 1) (26, 19) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 22) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 20) (9, 10) (22, 27) (22, 6) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 24) (5, 27) (5, 19) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 23) (11, 18) (11, 20) (23, 0) (23, 12) (23, 11) (10, 9) (10, 21) (10, 4) (10, 24) (21, 29) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 14) (16, 27) (16, 29) (16, 21) (14, 28) (14, 1) (14, 21) (2, 3) (2, 20) (2, 17) (2, 25) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 11) (24, 7) (24, 19) (24, 10) (24, 20) (25, 2) (4, 10) (4, 20) (17, 2) (20, 9) (20, 11) (20, 2) (20, 24) (20, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {8, 12, 18, 23}
- Node 1: {6, 9, 14, 26}
- Node 2: {3, 17, 20, 25}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {10, 20}
- Node 5: {19, 27}
- Node 6: {1, 6, 22, 28}
- Node 7: {12, 24, 27, 28}
- Node 8: {0, 11}
- Node 9: {1, 10, 15, 20}
- Node 10: {4, 9, 21, 24}
- Node 11: {8, 15, 18, 20, 23}
- Node 12: {0, 7, 23}
- Node 13: {18}
- Node 14: {1, 21, 28}
- Node 15: {9, 11, 28}
- Node 16: {21, 27, 29}
- Node 17: {2}
- Node 18: {0, 11, 13}
- Node 19: {5, 24, 26}
- Node 20: {4, 9, 11, 24}
- Node 21: {10, 14, 16, 29}
- Node 22: {6, 27}
- Node 23: {0, 11, 12}
- Node 24: {7, 10, 19, 20}
- Node 25: {2}
- Node 26: {1, 19}
- Node 27: {5, 7, 16, 22}
- Node 28: {6, 7, 14, 15}
- Node 29: {16, 21}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and for each such node, calculate the number of 3-stars formed using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: 3 neighbors => No 3-star formed
- Node 14: 3 neighbors => No 3-star formed
- Node 15: 3 neighbors => No 3-star formed
- Node 16: 3 neighbors => No 3-star formed
- Node 18: 3 neighbors => No 3-star formed
- Node 19: 3 neighbors => No 3-star formed
- Node 20: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: 2 neighbors => No 3-star formed
- Node 24: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: 2 neighbors => No 3-star formed

Summing up the 3-stars formed, we get: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 8, 11, 23>, <1, 6, 9, 14>, <7, 12, 24, 27>, <9, 11, 15, 20>, <10, 21, 24, 29>.
