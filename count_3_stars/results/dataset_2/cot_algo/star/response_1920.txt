Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 4) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 2) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) 

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 12}, so it can form 1 3-star with nodes {5, 7, 12}.
2. Node 1: Neighbors {2, 7, 9, 13}, so it can form 1 3-star with nodes {7, 9, 13}.
3. Node 3: Neighbors {2, 6, 9, 14}, so it can form 1 3-star with nodes {6, 9, 14}.
4. Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 8, 11}, so it can form 1 3-star with nodes {4, 8, 11}.
5. Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 8, 10, 14}, so it can form 1 3-star with nodes {3, 10, 14}.
6. Node 8: Neighbors {5, 6, 8, 12, 13}, so it can form 1 3-star with nodes {6, 12, 13}.
7. Node 10: Neighbors {6, 11, 12, 13}, so it can form 1 3-star with nodes {11, 12, 13}.
8. Node 12: Neighbors {0, 7, 8, 10, 0}, so it can form 1 3-star with nodes {0, 7, 14}.
9. Node 13: Neighbors {1, 4, 8, 10}, so it can form 1 3-star with nodes {1, 4, 10}.

There are a total of 8 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are as follows:
<5, 7, 12>, <7, 9, 13>, <6, 9, 14>, <4, 8, 11>, <3, 10, 14>, <6, 12, 13>, <11, 12, 13>, <0, 7, 14>.
