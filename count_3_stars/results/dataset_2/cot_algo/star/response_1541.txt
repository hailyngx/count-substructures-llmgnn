Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 13) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 18) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (8, 14) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (6, 5) (6, 15) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 19) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 16) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (2, 8) (2, 19) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 10) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 16) (19, 0) (19, 2) (12, 18) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 7) (7, 1) (7, 18) (7, 11) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 10) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 neighbors: 13, 10, 11, 19
- Node 1 neighbors: 15, 4, 7
- Node 2 neighbors: 8, 19
- Node 3 neighbors: 13, 4
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 18, 16
- Node 5 neighbors: 9, 6, 10
- Node 6 neighbors: 5, 15
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 18, 11
- Node 8 neighbors: 14, 2
- Node 9 neighbors: 5, 14, 16, 13
- Node 10 neighbors: 5, 0, 15, 16
- Node 11 neighbors: 14, 0, 7
- Node 12 neighbors: 18
- Node 13 neighbors: 9, 3, 0
- Node 14 neighbors: 9, 17, 11, 8
- Node 15 neighbors: 17, 1, 6, 10
- Node 16 neighbors: 9, 4, 10
- Node 17 neighbors: 14, 15, 18
- Node 18 neighbors: 4, 17, 7, 12
- Node 19 neighbors: 0, 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 4: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-star
- Node 9: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-star
- Node 10: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-star
- Node 14: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-star
- Node 15: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-star
- Node 18: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-star

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is [24].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 10, 15>
<4, 9, 16>
<4, 9, 13>
<4, 10, 16>
<9, 14, 16>
<9, 14, 13>
<14, 15, 17>
<18, 17, 15>
<18, 17, 7>
<18, 4, 7>
<18, 4, 17>
<18, 12, 7>
