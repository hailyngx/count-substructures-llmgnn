Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 12) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 0) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 1) (2, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

- Node 0: neighbors {3, 4, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 6, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 4, 5}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 3, 5, 13}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 4, 8, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 8, 12}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 2, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 10: neighbors {5, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 11: neighbors {5, 12, 14}
- Node 12: neighbors {6, 7, 11}
- Node 13: neighbors {4, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 14: neighbors {10, 11, 13}

Looking at the neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 4, 5, 8, and 13 each have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

- Node 4: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4]
- Node 5: [\( \binom{6}{3} \) = 20]
- Node 8: [\( \binom{6}{3} \) = 20]
- Node 13: [\( \binom{6}{3} \) = 20]

Adding these up, we get a total of 64 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (0, 3, 13)>
- <5, (3, 8, 10)>
- <8, (0, 5, 13)>
- <13, (4, 7, 9)>
- <13, (9, 10, 14)>
