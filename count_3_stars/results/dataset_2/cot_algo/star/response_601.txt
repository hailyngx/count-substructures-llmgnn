Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 5, 2, 7
Node 1: 6, 3, 2
Node 2: 9, 1, 8, 0, 7
Node 3: 9, 1, 7
Node 4: 6, 9, 8, 0
Node 5: 6, 8, 0, 7
Node 6: 5, 1, 7, 4
Node 7: 6, 3, 5, 2, 0
Node 8: 9, 4, 2, 5
Node 9: 8, 4, 2, 3

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 46

The final number inside brackets is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>,
<1, (2, 3, 6)>, 
<2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<3, (1, 7, 9)>,
<4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (8, 9, 2)>, 
<5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, 
<6, (1, 4, 7)>,
<7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, 
<8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 9, 2)>, <8, (4, 9, 2)>, 
<9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 2)>, <9, (3, 8, 2)>
