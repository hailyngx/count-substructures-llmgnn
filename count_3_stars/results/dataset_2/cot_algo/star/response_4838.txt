Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 23) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 3) (26, 0) (3, 26) (3, 24) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 29) (15, 21) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 21) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 28) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 5) (17, 2) (21, 15) (21, 6) (21, 10) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 28) (16, 1) (16, 28) (16, 22) (16, 27) (28, 10) (28, 1) (28, 16) (28, 25) (13, 17) (13, 23) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 20) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 4) (25, 28) (25, 0) (25, 22) (0, 26) (0, 25) (11, 19) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 22) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 20) (23, 9) (23, 13) (23, 18) (7, 11) (7, 18) (24, 3) (24, 8) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 7) (12, 29) (20, 8) (20, 14) (20, 2) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 29) (29, 15) (29, 12) (29, 4) (27, 16) (5, 17) (22, 16) (22, 25) (22, 11) (2, 17) (2, 20) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {25, 26}
- Node 1: Neighbors {15, 16}
- Node 2: Neighbors {17, 20}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 18, 24, 26}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 19, 29}
- Node 5: Neighbors {17}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 15, 21}
- Node 7: Neighbors {11, 18}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 19, 20, 24}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 8, 19, 23, 26}
- Node 10: Neighbors {14, 17, 21, 28}
- Node 11: Neighbors {7, 11, 14, 19, 22}
- Node 12: Neighbors {29}
- Node 13: Neighbors {17, 23}
- Node 14: Neighbors {10, 11, 20}
- Node 15: Neighbors {1, 6, 21, 29}
- Node 16: Neighbors {1, 22, 27, 28}
- Node 17: Neighbors {2, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 18: Neighbors {3, 7, 18, 23}
- Node 19: Neighbors {4, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 20: Neighbors {2, 8, 14}
- Node 21: Neighbors {6, 10, 15} 
- Node 22: Neighbors {11, 16, 25}
- Node 23: Neighbors {9, 13, 18}
- Node 24: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 25: Neighbors {0, 22, 28}
- Node 26: Neighbors {0, 3, 9}
- Node 27: Neighbors {16}
- Node 28: Neighbors {10, 16, 25}
- Node 29: Neighbors {4, 12, 15}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 8, 19}
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 6, 21}
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 22, 28}
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 10, 21}
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 8, 11}
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 10, 15}
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with neighbors {16, 25, 10}

The total number of 3-stars is 7, so the final answer is [7].
