Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {27}
- Node 1: {14, 17, 2, 10, 18}
- Node 2: {27, 1, 4, 3}
- Node 3: {6, 16, 2}
- Node 4: {22, 6, 2}
- Node 5: {19, 26}
- Node 6: {28, 14, 3, 11, 4}
- Node 7: {12, 17, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 9, 26, 18}
- Node 9: {8, 15, 23}
- Node 10: {1}
- Node 11: {6, 18}
- Node 12: {7, 21}
- Node 14: {6, 1, 16}
- Node 15: {17, 9, 16, 26, 25}
- Node 16: {14, 15, 3}
- Node 17: {7, 1, 25, 23, 15}
- Node 18: {8, 1, 25, 11}
- Node 19: {28, 29, 5}
- Node 20: {27, 29}
- Node 21: {12, 24}
- Node 22: {4, 25}
- Node 23: {27, 17, 9}
- Node 24: {21}
- Node 25: {22, 17, 15, 18}
- Node 26: {5, 8, 15}
- Node 27: {29, 0, 2, 20, 23}
- Node 28: {29, 6, 19}
- Node 29: {27, 28, 20, 19}

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors that can form 3-stars are: 1, 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 27, 29

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars:
\[ inom{5}{3} + inom{4}{3} + 1 + inom{5}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{4}{3} = 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 53 \]

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [53].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (14, 17, 2)>
- <2, (27, 1, 4)>
- <6, (28, 14, 3)>
- <15, (17, 9, 23)>
- <17, (7, 1, 25)>
- <18, (8, 1, 25)>
- <27, (29, 0, 20)>
- <29, (28, 6, 19)>
