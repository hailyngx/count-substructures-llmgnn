Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 15) (6, 18) (6, 16) (1, 17) (1, 10) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 16) (4, 15) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 12) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 15) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 18) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 19) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 13) (15, 16) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 15) (18, 6) (18, 17) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 2) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we need to find the number of 3-stars it contains.

Let's first list out the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 7, 12
Node 1: 10, 17
Node 2: 12, 13, 14, 19
Node 3: 0, 8, 10
Node 4: 8, 10, 11, 15, 16
Node 5: 7, 8, 13
Node 6: 16, 18
Node 7: 0, 5, 8, 19
Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 7
Node 9: 15
Node 10: 1, 3, 4, 13
Node 11: 4
Node 12: 0, 2, 14
Node 13: 2, 5, 10, 15
Node 14: 2, 12
Node 15: 4, 13, 15, 16
Node 16: 4, 6, 15
Node 17: 1, 18, 19
Node 18: 6, 17
Node 19: 2, 7, 17

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 30 \).

So, the final answer is [30].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 12>, <2, 12, 14>, <2, 12, 19>, <2, 13, 19>, <2, 19, 12>, <4, 8, 7>, <4, 8, 10>, <4, 8, 16>, <4, 10, 13>, <7, 8, 5>, <10, 13, 2>, <13, 5, 10>, <13, 15, 4>, <15, 16, 6>, <17, 18, 19>, <19, 7, 17>.
