Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 19) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 15) (13, 16) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (8, 16) (8, 17) (9, 18) (9, 14) (9, 1) (12, 16) (12, 11) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 19) (18, 14) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 10) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 12) (16, 17) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 11) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 6) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 3) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 10) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 10) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (14, 9) (14, 18) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 15) (11, 6) 

Response:
Since the graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can start by finding the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 9, 10}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 10}
- Node 3: {6, 10, 17}
- Node 4: {2, 10}
- Node 5: {11, 15, 18}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 11}
- Node 7: {0, 10, 19}
- Node 8: {16, 17}
- Node 9: {1, 14, 18}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 3, 4, 19}
- Node 11: {5, 6, 12, 15}
- Node 12: {11, 16}
- Node 13: {16}
- Node 14: {9, 18}
- Node 15: {5, 11, 19}
- Node 16: {8, 12, 13, 17}
- Node 17: {3, 8, 16}
- Node 18: {5, 9, 14, 19}
- Node 19: {7, 10, 15, 18}

Next, we'll identify nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1, 10, and 18 have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 0, 5, 11, 16, and 19 have 3 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 3 \times 4 + 5 \times 1 = 17 \), and we represent this as [17].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 2, 10)>
<10, (1, 2, 4)>
<18, (9, 14, 19)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (11, 15, 19)>
<11, (5, 6, 12)>
<16, (8, 12, 17)>
<19, (7, 15, 18)>
