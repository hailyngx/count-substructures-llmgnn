Response:
The central idea of the 3-star graph relies on nodes that have at least 3 neighbors. Let's identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and then count the number of unique 3-stars. 

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) different 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) different 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) different 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) different 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) different 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) different 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) different 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) different 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) different 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) different 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) different 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) different 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of unique 3-stars:
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 44 \)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [44]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (4, 8, 9)> <4, (3, 8, 29)> <8, (3, 4, 17)> <8, (3, 4, 25)> <8, (4, 23, 29)> <8, (9, 17, 29)> <9, (4, 8, 22)> <9, (8, 17, 27)> <10, (16, 25, 26)> <16, (8, 25, 28)> <17, (8, 9, 29)> <17, (8, 11, 21)> <17, (9, 17, 29)> <17, (11, 18, 21)> <18, (4, 11, 29)> <27, (7, 9, 1)> <29, (4, 8, 22)>
