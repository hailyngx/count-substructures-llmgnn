Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, 8: <9, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, 9: <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, 9: <7, (1, 4, 9)>

In total, there are 3 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [3].
