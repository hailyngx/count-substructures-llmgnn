Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, let's go through each node and identify its neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 3, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 5: It has 5 neighbors {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1: It has 4 neighbors {2, 5, 7, 9}, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3: It has 4 neighbors {4, 7, 8, 9}, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4: It has 5 neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6: It has 4 neighbors {4, 5, 7, 8}, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9: It has 3 neighbors {1, 3, 5}, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 33, which we enclose in brackets to get [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
