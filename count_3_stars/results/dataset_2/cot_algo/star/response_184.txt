Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (17, 12) (17, 5) (17, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (5, 17) (5, 3) (5, 15) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 16) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 7) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 7) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 11) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 19) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (16, 6) (16, 18) (19, 12) (19, 0) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 10) (7, 15) (13, 1) (13, 9) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 11) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 15) (11, 12) (11, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 10, 19}
- Node 1: {6, 8, 13}
- Node 2: {14}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {3, 15, 17}
- Node 6: {1, 11, 16}
- Node 7: {10, 14, 15, 18}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 8, 11, 17}
- Node 9: {3, 9, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 7, 15}
- Node 11: {6, 8, 9, 12, 15}
- Node 12: {11, 17, 19}
- Node 13: {1, 9}
- Node 14: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 15: {5, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 16: {6, 18}
- Node 17: {5, 8, 12}
- Node 18: {7, 15, 16}
- Node 19: {0, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 18

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [34], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 4, 10>
- <1, 6, 13>
- <3, 5, 8>
- <5, 7, 10>
- <7, 10, 15>
- <8, 1, 3>
- <9, 3, 11>
- <11, 6, 16>
- <12, 11, 17>
- <18, 7, 16>
