Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 5) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 4) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 19) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 16) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 5) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 5) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 19) (0, 9) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 14) (9, 0) (9, 14) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 1) (13, 7) (13, 16) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 9) (16, 4) (16, 13) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 15) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 8) (6, 17) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the provided edges:

- Node 0: 11, 7, 19, 9
- Node 1: 17, 8, 4, 15, 5
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 17, 12, 8
- Node 4: 11, 1, 16
- Node 5: 10, 8, 18, 1
- Node 6: 17, 12
- Node 7: 0, 19, 13
- Node 8: 2, 5, 3, 1
- Node 9: 0, 14
- Node 10: 5, 17
- Node 11: 0, 18, 4
- Node 12: 6, 3
- Node 13: 7, 16
- Node 14: 18, 15, 9
- Node 15: 1, 19, 14
- Node 16: 4, 13
- Node 17: 10, 1, 3, 6, 19
- Node 18: 11, 14, 5
- Node 19: 17, 7, 0, 15

Now we can analyze which nodes form 3-star structures:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 17, 8, and 5: <1, (17, 8, 5)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, and 19: <17, (1, 3, 19)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 11, 7, and 19: <0, (11, 7, 19)>

Adding these unique 3-stars together, we have a total of [3] 3-stars in the graph.
