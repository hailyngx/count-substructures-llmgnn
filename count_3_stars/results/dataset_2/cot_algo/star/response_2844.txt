Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 16) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 12) (17, 8) (17, 1) (15, 19) (15, 2) (15, 16) (3, 6) (3, 18) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 16) (2, 14) (2, 15) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 1) (18, 3) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 19) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 10, 14, 19}
- Node 1: {9, 4, 13, 17, 12}
- Node 2: {14, 15}
- Node 3: {6, 18}
- Node 4: {9, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 0}
- Node 6: {5, 4, 11, 14, 3}
- Node 7: {19, 13}
- Node 8: {11, 17, 12}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 1}
- Node 10: {0, 11}
- Node 11: {10, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {11, 1, 8}
- Node 13: {7, 1}
- Node 14: {6, 0, 2, 16}
- Node 15: {19, 2, 16}
- Node 16: {14, 15, 19}
- Node 17: {8, 1}
- Node 18: {3}
- Node 19: {7, 0, 15, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes {5, 10, 14} and {5, 14, 19} - 2 3-stars in total.
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes {9, 4, 13} and {9, 1, 17} and {9, 1, 12} - 3 3-stars in total.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes {5, 6, 14}.
- Node 14 forms 3-stars with nodes {0, 14, 16} and {2, 14, 16} and {14, 15, 16} - 3 3-stars in total.
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes {14, 15, 16}.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, 5, 10, 14>, <0, 5, 14, 19>, <1, 9, 4, 13>, <1, 9, 1, 17>, <1, 9, 1, 12>, <5, 6, 14>, <14, 0, 16>, <14, 2, 16>, and <14, 15, 16>.
