Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 10) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 0) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 13) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors = {2, 4, 13}
- Node 1: neighbors = {6, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 2: neighbors = {0, 6, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 3: neighbors = {5, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 4: neighbors = {0, 8, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors = {3, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 6: neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 10}
- Node 7: neighbors = {8, 10, 14}
- Node 8: neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 9: neighbors = {3, 4, 11, 12}
- Node 10: neighbors = {6, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 11: neighbors = {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 12: neighbors = {9, 10}
- Node 13: neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 10, 14}
- Node 14: neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 7, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 5, 8, 13, and 14 have 5 neighbors.
- Node 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11 have 4 neighbors.

For nodes with 5 neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
Since there are 6 nodes with 5 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars from these nodes is \( 6 \times 10 = 60 \).

For nodes with 4 neighbors, there is 1 3-star for each node. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars from nodes with 4 neighbors is \( 7 \times 1 = 7 \).

The total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is 60 + 7 = 67. So, putting the final number inside brackets gives us [67]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 2, 5, 13, 14>, <1, 6, 10, 13>, <3, 4, 8, 9>, <7, 10, 12, 14>, <8, 11, 2, 4>, <9, 11, 3, 12>, <13, 1, 5, 14>
