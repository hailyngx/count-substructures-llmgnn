Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 21) (3, 26) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 5) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 27) (18, 23) (18, 10) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 1) (8, 14) (8, 29) (8, 25) (8, 11) (13, 2) (13, 7) (10, 18) (10, 17) (10, 28) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 23) (0, 17) (0, 20) (20, 15) (20, 0) (20, 19) (20, 11) (28, 10) (28, 11) (28, 24) (5, 15) (5, 22) (5, 26) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 7) (14, 25) (11, 8) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 4) (21, 3) (21, 2) (29, 9) (29, 8) (29, 23) (29, 12) (26, 3) (26, 5) (26, 14) (26, 7) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 26) (7, 16) (16, 22) (16, 7) (1, 6) (1, 22) (1, 24) (2, 13) (2, 21) (12, 29) (19, 15) (19, 20) (19, 24) (19, 27) (25, 8) (25, 14) (25, 27) (27, 9) (27, 19) (27, 25) (27, 24) (23, 18) (23, 17) (23, 29) (24, 28) (24, 1) (24, 19) (24, 27) (4, 15) (4, 11) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the provided edges:

Node 0 neighbors: 17, 20
Node 1 neighbors: 6, 22, 24
Node 2 neighbors: 13, 21
Node 3 neighbors: 21, 26
Node 4 neighbors: 11, 15
Node 5 neighbors: 15, 22, 26
Node 6 neighbors: 1, 9
Node 7 neighbors: 13, 14, 16, 26
Node 8 neighbors: 11, 14, 25, 29
Node 9 neighbors: 6, 27, 29
Node 10 neighbors: 17, 18, 28
Node 11 neighbors: 4, 8, 20, 28
Node 12 neighbors: 29
Node 13 neighbors: 2, 7
Node 14 neighbors: 8, 7, 25, 26
Node 15 neighbors: 4, 5, 19, 20
Node 16 neighbors: 7, 22
Node 17 neighbors: 0, 10, 23
Node 18 neighbors: 10, 23
Node 19 neighbors: 15, 19, 24, 27
Node 20 neighbors: 0, 11, 15, 19
Node 21 neighbors: 2, 3
Node 22 neighbors: 1, 5, 16
Node 23 neighbors: 17, 18, 29
Node 24 neighbors: 1, 19, 27, 28
Node 25 neighbors: 8, 14, 27
Node 26 neighbors: 3, 5, 7, 14
Node 27 neighbors: 9, 19, 24, 25
Node 28 neighbors: 10, 11, 24
Node 29 neighbors: 9, 23, 27, 12

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17, which we put inside brackets: [17].

The unique 3-stars are:
<9, 6, 29>
<15, 4, 19>
<15, 5, 20>
<15, 20, 27>
<20, 11, 28>
<20, 11, 19>
<20, 15, 19>
<20, 15, 27>
<26, 3, 21>
<26, 5, 22>
<26, 7, 14>
<26, 14, 25>
<27, 9, 29>
<27, 19, 24>
<27, 19, 25>
<27, 24, 28>
<29, 9, 23>
