Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 13) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (7, 11) (7, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (5, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 10, 11}
- Node 4: {1, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 7, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 12}
- Node 7: {5, 11}
- Node 8: {5, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 13}
- Node 10: {3, 8, 11}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 12: {1, 5, 6, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 13}

Next, for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: No 3-star (2 neighbors)
- Node 1: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 2: No 3-star (3 neighbors)
- Node 3: No 3-star (4 neighbors)
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: No 3-star (3 neighbors)
- Node 10: No 3-star (3 neighbors)
- Node 11: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 12: No 3-star (4 neighbors)
- Node 13: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 14: No 3-star (6 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 68

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [68], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 11, 12)>, <1, (4, 9, 13)>, <1, (5, 8, 14)>, <1, (5, 12, 14)>, <4, (9, 13, 14)>, <5, (7, 11, 12)>, <5, (8, 10, 11)>, <5, (8, 11, 14)>, <13, (9, 12, 14)>, <13, (9, 13, 14)>
