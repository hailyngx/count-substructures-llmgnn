Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 9) (1, 26) (1, 29) (26, 1) (0, 2) (0, 29) (0, 8) (0, 23) (2, 0) (2, 19) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 16) (28, 21) (28, 3) (28, 7) (28, 27) (28, 18) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 27) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 10) (13, 18) (6, 21) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 16) (15, 14) (15, 6) (15, 25) (11, 14) (11, 23) (11, 27) (11, 29) (23, 0) (23, 11) (23, 19) (3, 28) (3, 5) (12, 29) (16, 21) (16, 6) (16, 24) (29, 1) (29, 0) (29, 11) (29, 12) (24, 17) (24, 16) (24, 9) (7, 28) (7, 20) (20, 7) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 10) (9, 17) (9, 24) (9, 4) (9, 27) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 23) (19, 4) (25, 13) (25, 15) (25, 8) (18, 28) (18, 13) (18, 6) (18, 10) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 27) (8, 0) (8, 25) (27, 28) (27, 5) (27, 11) (27, 9) (27, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

- Node 0: {2, 8, 23, 29}
- Node 1: {26, 29}
- Node 2: {0, 19}
- Node 3: {5, 28}
- Node 4: {9, 10, 19}
- Node 5: {3, 13, 27}
- Node 6: {15, 16, 18, 21}
- Node 7: {20, 28}
- Node 8: {0, 25}
- Node 9: {4, 17, 24, 27}
- Node 10: {4, 13, 18, 27}
- Node 11: {14, 23, 27, 29}
- Node 12: {29}
- Node 13: {5, 10, 18, 25}
- Node 14: {11, 15, 17, 19}
- Node 15: {6, 14, 25}
- Node 16: {6, 21, 24}
- Node 17: {14, 24}
- Node 18: {6, 10, 13, 28}
- Node 19: {2, 4, 14, 23}
- Node 20: {7}
- Node 21: {6, 16, 28}
- Node 23: {0, 11, 19}
- Node 24: {9, 16, 17}
- Node 25: {8, 13, 15}
- Node 26: {1}
- Node 27: {5, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 28: {3, 7, 18, 21}
- Node 29: {1, 11, 12}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4 has \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 6 has \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9 has \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 10 has \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 13 has \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 14 has \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 18 has \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 21 has \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 27 has \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of \(4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4 = 40\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

Unique 3-stars found are:
