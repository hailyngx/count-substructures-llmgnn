Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 12) (3, 8) (14, 4) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 18) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 2) (19, 3) (19, 16) (6, 11) (6, 12) (2, 17) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 15) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 12) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 18) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 18) (0, 15) (18, 7) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 15) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the edges given:

1: 3, 5
2: 5, 9, 12, 15, 17
3: 1, 8, 12, 19
4: 7, 13, 14, 16
5: 1, 2, 7, 18
6: 10, 11, 12
7: 4, 5, 15, 18
8: 3, 9
9: 2, 8
10: 11, 12, 16
11: 6, 10
12: 2, 3, 6, 10, 16
13: 4
14: 4, 17
15: 2, 5, 7, 18, 0
16: 4, 10, 12, 19
17: 2, 14, 18
18: 5, 7, 15, 17, 18
19: 3, 16

Next, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if any 3-stars can be formed:

Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the possible 3-stars, we get a total of 50.
So, the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars formed are:
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 12>
<2, 5, 15>
<2, 5, 17>
<2, 9, 12>
<2, 9, 15>
<2, 9, 17>
<2, 12, 15>
<2, 12, 17>
<2, 15, 17>
<3, 8, 19>
<4, 7, 14>
<4, 7, 16>

<7, 5, 15>
<7, 5, 18>
<7, 15, 18>
<12, 6, 10>
<12, 6, 16>
<12, 6, 2>
<12, 10, 16>
<12, 10, 2>
<12, 10, 16>
<15, 5, 18>
