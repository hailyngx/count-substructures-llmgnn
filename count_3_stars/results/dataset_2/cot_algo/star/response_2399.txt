Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 0) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 14) (5, 18) (5, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 15) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 17) (17, 18) (17, 12) (10, 3) (10, 15) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 0) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 15) (0, 12) (7, 8) (7, 5) (11, 9) (11, 19) (2, 19) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 0) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 18) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can explore the neighbor sets for each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {9, 8, 15, 12}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {8}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {19, 14}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {10, 12}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {9, 13, 18, 16, 15}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {18, 7}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {9, 13, 12}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {8, 5}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {1, 14, 0, 7}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {6, 4, 11, 16, 0}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {3, 15}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {9, 19}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {6, 3, 17, 0}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {6, 4, 14}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {8, 13, 2}
16. Node 15: Neighbors {4, 10, 0}
17. Node 16: Neighbors {4, 18, 9}
18. Node 17: Neighbors {18, 12}
19. Node 18: Neighbors {5, 4, 19, 16, 17}
20. Node 19: Neighbors {18, 11, 2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

1. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
2. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
3. Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is [34], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (9, 13, 16)>
<9, (6, 4, 16)>
<12, (3, 6, 17)>
<18, (4, 16, 17)>
