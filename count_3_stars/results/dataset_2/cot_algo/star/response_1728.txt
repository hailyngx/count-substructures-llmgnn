Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 18) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 0) (11, 6) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 15) (12, 7) (12, 15) (12, 3) (2, 18) (5, 6) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 3) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 3) (19, 15) (19, 14) (1, 4) (1, 6) (9, 13) (9, 18) (9, 3) (3, 12) (3, 18) (3, 0) (3, 9) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 19) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 17) (16, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated as follows:

For each node, we will determine its neighbor set first:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {3, 7, 10, 13, 17}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {4, 6}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {18}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {0, 9, 12, 18}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {1, 8, 15}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {6}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 11, 14}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {0, 12, 15}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {4, 18}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {3, 13, 18}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {0, 17}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {6, 17}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {3, 7, 15}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {0, 9, 15}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {6, 16, 18, 19}
16. Node 15: Neighbors {4, 7, 12, 13, 19}
17. Node 16: Neighbors {14, 17}
18. Node 17: Neighbors {10, 11, 16, 0}
19. Node 18: Neighbors {2, 8, 9, 14, 3}

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars by checking nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
5. Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
6. Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
7. Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 16 has 2 neighbors, which is not sufficient to form a 3-star.
10. Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
11. Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 12) + 1 (from node 13) + 4 (from node 14) + 10 (from node 15) + 4 (from node 17) + 10 (from node 18) = 49. 

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [49].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 7, 10)>
<0, (3, 7, 13)>
<0, (3, 10, 13)>
<0, (7, 10, 13)>
<3, (0, 9, 18)>
<6, (1, 11, 16)>
<14, (6, 16, 18)>
<15, (4, 12, 19)>
<18, (8, 9, 14)>
