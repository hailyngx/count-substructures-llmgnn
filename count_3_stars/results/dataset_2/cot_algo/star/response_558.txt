Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 11) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 14) (10, 17) (10, 19) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 18) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 14) (4, 15) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 9) (12, 11) (19, 10) (19, 18) (11, 15) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (6, 14) (6, 16) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 6) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 4, 11
Node 1: 0, 2, 3
Node 2: 1, 8, 11, 17, 18
Node 3: 1, 15, 16, 17
Node 4: 0, 9, 15, 17
Node 6: 14, 16
Node 7: 18
Node 8: 2, 9, 13
Node 9: 4, 8, 14, 18
Node 10: 17, 19
Node 11: 0, 2, 12, 15
Node 12: 11
Node 13: 8, 14, 15, 16
Node 14: 6, 9, 13
Node 15: 3, 4, 11, 13
Node 16: 3, 6, 13
Node 17: 2, 3, 4, 10
Node 18: 2, 7, 9, 19
Node 19: 10, 18

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 2: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 15: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 16: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 31
Therefore, the final answer is [31].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 11, 15)>, <2, (1, 3, 17)>, <2, (1, 3, 16)>, <2, (1, 3, 15)>, <2, (11, 15, 0)>, <2, (11, 15, 3)>, <2, (11, 15, 13)>, <2, (11, 0, 1)>, <2, (11, 0, 15)>, <2, (11, 0, 4)>, <3, (1, 15, 13)>, <3, (1, 15, 4)>, <3, (1, 15, 11)>, <3, (1, 4, 15)>, <4, (0, 1, 11)>, <4, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (0, 11, 15)>, <4, (4, 0, 1)>, <9, (2, 8, 13)>, <9, (2, 8, 9)>, <9, (8, 2, 13)>, <9, (8, 2, 9)>, <13, (8, 9, 14)>, <13, (8, 9, 4)>, <13, (9, 8, 14)>, <13, (9, 8, 4)>, <15, (11, 0, 4)>, <15, (11, 4, 0)>, <15, (13, 1, 4)>, <15, (13, 1, 11)>, <16, (13, 3, 6)>
