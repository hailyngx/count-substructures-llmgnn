Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 9) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 13) (17, 2) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 11) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 13) (16, 18) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 14) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 5) (18, 16) (18, 14) (18, 19) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 6) (6, 19) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 19) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 12) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 14) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 10
Node 1: 0, 12, 14
Node 2: 0, 4, 17, 19
Node 3: 5, 8, 12
Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 17
Node 5: 3, 4, 14
Node 6: 12, 13, 19
Node 7: 10, 11, 13
Node 8: 3, 9
Node 9: 8, 11, 15
Node 10: 0, 7, 13
Node 11: 7, 9, 14
Node 12: 1, 3, 6, 14
Node 13: 6, 7, 10, 19
Node 14: 1, 5, 11, 12, 18
Node 15: 9
Node 16: 18
Node 17: 2, 4
Node 18: 14, 16, 19
Node 19: 2, 6, 13, 18

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 0
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 2, 4
Nodes with 6 neighbors: 12, 13, 14, 19

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and sum them up:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 104

Therefore, the final answer is [104].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 17)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<12, (1, 6, 14)>
<13, (6, 7, 19)>
<14, (1, 11, 18)>
<19, (2, 6, 13)>
