Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing these up, we get a total of 59 3-stars: [59].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 7, 5)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- <3, (7, 5, 8)>
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- <5, (7, 1, 8)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <5, (7, 8, 7)>
- <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- <7, (5, 8, 6)>
- <7, (5, 9, 6)>
- <7, (5, 9, 7)>
