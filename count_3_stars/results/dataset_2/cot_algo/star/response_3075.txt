Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 9, 4, 7, 2, 3
Node 1: 9, 2, 8
Node 2: 9, 4, 6, 0, 8, 1
Node 3: 4, 6, 0, 8
Node 4: 5, 7, 0, 2, 3
Node 5: 9, 4, 7
Node 6: 3, 2
Node 7: 5, 4, 0
Node 8: 9, 2, 3, 1
Node 9: 5, 8, 2, 1, 0

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 4, 8, and 9 have 5 neighbors each.

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 54 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [54], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- <9, (0, 2, 8)>
