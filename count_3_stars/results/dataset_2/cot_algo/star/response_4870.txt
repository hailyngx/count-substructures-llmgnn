Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 6, 8}

Nodes 0, 2, and 8 have 5, 6, and 5 neighbors respectively, which is 3 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.
Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:

Node 0:
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 0.

Node 2:
- \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed with node 2.

Node 8:
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 8.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 = 40

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- <8, (0, 5, 7)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
