Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, and Node 5 have 5 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<4, 0, 6>
