Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 3) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 7) (3, 5) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 10) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 4) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 2) (1, 8) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 10) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 1) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 10) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 12) (4, 0) (4, 16) (12, 10) (12, 16) (7, 9) (7, 16) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 7) (16, 2) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 6) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 11) (2, 14) (2, 16) 

Response:
Considering the given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we first need to determine the set of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {13, 4}
- Node 1: {8, 17, 11, 10}
- Node 2: {14, 16}
- Node 3: {5, 15, 17, 14, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 16}
- Node 5: {19, 15, 3}
- Node 6: {3, 14, 11}
- Node 7: {9, 16}
- Node 8: {13, 19, 17, 1}
- Node 9: {15, 10, 7}
- Node 10: {9, 15, 1, 19, 12}
- Node 11: {1, 19, 6}
- Node 12: {10, 16}
- Node 13: {8, 0}
- Node 14: {3, 6, 2}
- Node 15: {5, 9, 3, 10}
- Node 16: {4, 12, 7, 2}
- Node 17: {3, 8, 1}
- Node 19: {5, 8, 11, 10}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking at nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 8, 17, and 11 (<1, (8, 17, 11)>)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 15, and 17 (<3, (5, 15, 17)>)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 14, and 11 (<6, (3, 14, 11)>)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 13, 19, and 17 (<8, (13, 19, 17)>)
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with leaves 9, 15, and 19 (<10, (9, 15, 19)>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, which we will represent as [5].
