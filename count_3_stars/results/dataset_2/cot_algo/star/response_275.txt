Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 18) (16, 14) (16, 15) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 17) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 14) (17, 18) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 10) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 15) (12, 8) (12, 18) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 9, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 13}
- Node 3: {10, 14, 19}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 8, 18}
- Node 5: {6, 10, 19}
- Node 6: {0, 5}
- Node 7: {11, 15, 19}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 13}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 14}
- Node 11: {7, 18, 19}
- Node 12: {8, 18}
- Node 13: {2, 9, 15}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 10, 16}
- Node 15: {7, 13, 16}
- Node 16: {14, 15}
- Node 17: {18}
- Node 18: {4, 11, 12, 17}
- Node 19: {3, 5, 7, 11}

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with {0, 1, 2}: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with {0, 2, 12}: <8, (0, 2, 12)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with {11, 4, 17}: <18, (11, 4, 17)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with {5, 7, 11}: <19, (5, 7, 11)>

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars, so the final answer is [4].
