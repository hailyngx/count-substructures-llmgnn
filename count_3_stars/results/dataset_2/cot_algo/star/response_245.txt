- Node 28 is connected to nodes 8, 11, 19, and 29.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 7, 9, 12, and 28.

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 49 \).

Therefore, the final answer, in brackets, is [49]. The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <2, 5, 18, 25>
2. <4, 5, 18, 25>
3. <8, 22, 13, 27>
4. <9, 11, 28, 19>
5. <13, 0, 15, 18>
6. <19, 9, 29, 28>
