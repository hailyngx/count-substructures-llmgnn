Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 10 and 25.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 24, and 27.
- Node 2 is connected to node 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 19, and 26.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8 and 23.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 16, 18, and 21.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 11, and 13.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 12.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 12, and 20.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 10, 13, and 23.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 0, 9, and 23.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 6, 22, 26, and 27.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 17, 19, and 26.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 9, and 28.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 17, 28, and 29.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 18, 24, and 28.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 5 and 23.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 12, 14, 22, and 29.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 5, 15, and 20.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 3 and 12.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 8, 18, and 21.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 5, 20, and 25.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 17, 23, and 11.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 4, 9, 10, 16, and 22.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 1, 15, and 26.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 0, 21, and 25.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 3, 11, 12, 24, and 19.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 1, 11, and 27.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 13, 14, and 15.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 14, 17, and 28.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 28, and 29: <14, (17, 28, 29)>.
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 22, and 29: <17, (14, 22, 29)>.
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 15, and 14: <28, (13, 15, 14)>.

Since there are 3 unique 3-stars in the graph, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
