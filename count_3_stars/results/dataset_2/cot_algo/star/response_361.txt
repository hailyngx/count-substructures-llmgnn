Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 12) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 4) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 4) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 0) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 4) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 12) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes connected to each node. Based on the provided edges, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: {4, 6, 11}
- Node 1: {7, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 11}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 11}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 8: {7, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 7, 10}
- Node 10: {2, 8, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 12: {1, 5, 6, 8, 10}
- Node 13: {5, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 6, 7, 13}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, 4, 11>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <1, 7, 9>, <1, 12, 14>, <1, 14, 7>, <1, 9, 7>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <2, 3, 4>, <2, 10, 8>, <2, 11, 3>, <2, 11, 8>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, 2, 4>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <4, 0, 11>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <5, 2, 3>, <5, 6, 12>, <5, 12, 6>, <5, 13, 6>
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <6, 0, 13>, <6, 0, 12>, <6, 5, 13>, <6, 5, 12>, <6, 12, 0>, <6, 12, 5>, <6, 13, 0>, <6, 13, 5>, <6, 14, 13>, <6, 14, 0>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <8, 7, 10>, <8, 10, 2>, <8, 10, 13>, <8, 11, 2>
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <10, 2, 8>, <10, 2, 13>, <10, 8, 13>, <10, 12, 6>, <10, 12, 1>, <10, 13, 2>, <10, 13, 6>, <10, 13, 14>, <10, 14, 1>, <10, 14, 13>
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <12, 1, 5>, <12, 1, 6>, <12, 5, 6>, <12, 8, 11>, <12, 10, 1>, <12, 10, 6>, <12, 10, 8>, <12, 10, 13>, <12, 13, 6>, <12, 14, 1>
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <13, 5, 6>, <13, 6, 14>, <13, 10, 14>, <13, 14, 6>
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <14, 1, 7>, <14, 6, 13>, <14, 6, 0>, <14, 7, 1>

Adding up all the 3-stars identified, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [43].
