Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 6, 4, 3, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6, 1}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 9, 6, 4, 1, 0}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 6, 2, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 9, 3, 2, 8, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 1, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 3, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 3, and Node 6 have 5 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 0, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.
- For Node 3, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed.
- For Node 6, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed.

Adding them up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 20 + 20 = 50.
So, the final answer is [50].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 8)>
