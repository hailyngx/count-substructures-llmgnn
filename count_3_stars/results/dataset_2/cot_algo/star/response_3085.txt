Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 24) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 13) (9, 23) (9, 12) (18, 22) (18, 23) (18, 6) (22, 18) (22, 10) (22, 29) (22, 3) (7, 25) (21, 0) (21, 11) (10, 22) (10, 24) (10, 20) (10, 29) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 19) (0, 21) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 12) (20, 10) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 14) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 11) (28, 0) (28, 29) (29, 22) (29, 10) (29, 0) (29, 28) (29, 26) (4, 19) (8, 11) (8, 1) (1, 17) (1, 8) (6, 18) (6, 23) (6, 26) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 13) (25, 7) (25, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 14) (27, 20) (27, 3) (11, 21) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 25) (14, 20) (14, 13) (15, 5) (15, 26) (26, 29) (26, 6) (26, 15) (26, 2) (26, 16) (23, 9) (23, 18) (23, 6) (16, 17) (16, 26) (16, 3) (2, 26) (2, 24) (3, 22) (3, 27) (3, 16) (24, 5) (24, 10) (24, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {21, 20, 28, 29, 12}
- Node 1: {17, 8}
- Node 2: {26, 24}
- Node 3: {22, 27, 16}
- Node 4: {19}
- Node 5: {9, 24, 15}
- Node 6: {18, 23, 26}
- Node 7: {25}
- Node 8: {1, 11}
- Node 9: {5, 13, 23, 12}
- Node 10: {22, 24, 20, 29}
- Node 11: {21, 12, 8, 25}
- Node 12: {9, 0, 11}
- Node 13: {9, 17, 19, 14}
- Node 14: {20, 13}
- Node 15: {5, 26}
- Node 16: {17, 26, 3}
- Node 17: {1, 13, 19, 16}
- Node 18: {22, 23, 6}
- Node 19: {17, 4, 13}
- Node 20: {10, 0, 27, 14}
- Node 21: {0, 11}
- Node 22: {18, 10, 29, 3}
- Node 23: {9, 18, 6}
- Node 24: {5, 10, 2}
- Node 25: {7, 11}
- Node 26: {2, 6, 15, 29, 16}
- Node 27: {20, 3}
- Node 28: {0, 29}
- Node 29: {22, 10, 0, 28, 26}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: [\[inom{5}{3}\] = 10]
- Node 9: <5, 13, 23>
- Node 10: <22, 24, 29>
- Node 11: <21, 12, 25>
- Node 12: <0, 11, 9>
- Node 13: <9, 17, 19>
- Node 15: <5, 26, 15>
- Node 16: <17, 26, 3>
- Node 18: <22, 23, 6>
- Node 20: <0, 14, 27>
- Node 22: <10, 29, 3>
- Node 26: <2, 15, 29>
- Node 29: <0, 28, 26>

Adding them up: 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
