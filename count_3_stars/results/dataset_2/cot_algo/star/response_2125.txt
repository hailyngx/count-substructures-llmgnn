Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 28) (21, 7) (21, 23) (21, 25) (21, 15) (10, 15) (10, 4) (11, 29) (11, 20) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 27) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 4) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 29) (0, 25) (0, 6) (20, 11) (20, 1) (20, 0) (20, 19) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 6) (19, 20) (19, 26) (19, 25) (19, 24) (28, 7) (28, 8) (6, 0) (6, 26) (6, 23) (15, 21) (15, 10) (15, 12) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 22) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 13) (2, 14) (22, 8) (22, 5) (5, 26) (5, 22) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 4) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 16) (12, 15) (12, 14) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 23) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 12) (29, 11) (29, 0) (18, 1) (18, 27) (18, 24) (27, 1) (27, 18) (27, 13) (13, 9) (13, 16) (13, 27) (24, 19) (24, 9) (24, 18) (25, 21) (25, 0) (25, 19) (23, 21) (23, 6) (23, 17) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {20, 17, 29, 25, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 20, 27, 18}
- Node 2: {14}
- Node 3: {1, 17, 14, 4}
- Node 4: {10, 3, 16}
- Node 5: {26, 22}
- Node 6: {0, 26, 23}
- Node 7: {21, 16, 28}
- Node 8: {28, 14, 22}
- Node 9: {24, 14, 13}
- Node 10: {15, 4}
- Node 11: {29, 20}
- Node 12: {15, 14}
- Node 13: {9, 16, 27}
- Node 14: {3, 8, 9, 2, 12}
- Node 15: {21, 10, 12}
- Node 16: {7, 13, 4}
- Node 17: {3, 0, 23}
- Node 18: {1, 27, 24}
- Node 19: {20, 26, 25, 24}
- Node 20: {11, 1, 0, 19}
- Node 21: {7, 23, 25, 15}
- Node 22: {8, 5}
- Node 23: {6, 17, 21}
- Node 24: {19, 9, 18}
- Node 25: {21, 0, 19}
- Node 26: {19, 5, 6}
- Node 27: {1, 18, 13}
- Node 28: {7, 8}
- Node 29: {11, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0, 5 neighbors, [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 1, 4 neighbors, [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3, 4 neighbors, [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4, 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 6, 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 7, 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 8, 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 9, 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 14, 5 neighbors, [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 15, 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 16, 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 19, 4 neighbors, [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 20, 4 neighbors, [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 21, 4 neighbors, [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 23, 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 24, 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 26, 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 27, 3 neighbors, 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].
