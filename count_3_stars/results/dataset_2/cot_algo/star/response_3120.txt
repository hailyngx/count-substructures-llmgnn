Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 10) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 10) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 11) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 10) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more visual form:

```
    1
    |
    8 -- 13 -- 10
   /|    |     |
  4 |    |     2
   \|    |     |
    3 -- 7 -- 12 -- 0 -- 9
            |     |
            6 -- 14
```

Next, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {8, 12, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {7, 12, 5, 10}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 8, 5, 11}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 7, 0, 2, 11}
- Node 6: {8, 7, 14, 11}
- Node 7: {3, 12, 6, 10, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 13, 4, 11, 0, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 10}
- Node 10: {13, 7, 14, 2, 9}
- Node 11: {8, 4, 14, 5, 6}
- Node 12: {7, 2, 0}
- Node 13: {8, 10}
- Node 14: {6, 10, 11}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 5, 7, 8, and 11 have 6, 6, 6, and 5 neighbors respectively.
- Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 70 \)

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [70]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <5, (3, 4, 11)>
- <7, (3, 12, 2)>
- <8, (1, 4, 11)>
- <11, (4, 5, 6)>
- <11, (4, 5, 14)>
- <11, (4, 6, 14)>
- <11, (5, 6, 14)>
