Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
