Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 26) (11, 21) (23, 5) (23, 17) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 27) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 25) (16, 0) (16, 14) (28, 9) (18, 26) (18, 20) (18, 24) (18, 21) (21, 10) (21, 11) (21, 18) (21, 0) (21, 19) (0, 16) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (3, 4) (24, 18) (24, 17) (24, 15) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (29, 27) (29, 19) (5, 23) (5, 2) (5, 15) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (20, 18) (27, 22) (27, 29) (27, 17) (14, 22) (14, 16) (14, 1) (12, 0) (12, 25) (12, 9) (19, 21) (19, 0) (19, 29) (19, 25) (15, 24) (15, 5) (15, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 4) (9, 28) (9, 7) (9, 12) (25, 26) (25, 12) (25, 19) (17, 23) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 4) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 17) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 16, 21, 12, 19, 13
- Node 1: 14, 13
- Node 2: 5, 6, 4
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 3, 2, 6, 17
- Node 5: 23, 2, 15
- Node 6: 7, 2, 15, 4
- Node 7: 11, 6, 9
- Node 9: 28, 7, 12
- Node 10: 11, 21, 26, 13
- Node 11: 10, 7, 26, 21
- Node 12: 0, 25, 9
- Node 13: 10, 0, 1
- Node 14: 22, 16, 1
- Node 15: 24, 5, 6
- Node 16: 0, 14
- Node 17: 23, 24, 27, 4
- Node 18: 26, 20, 24, 21
- Node 19: 21, 0, 29, 25
- Node 20: 18
- Node 21: 10, 11, 18, 0, 19
- Node 22: 26, 14, 27
- Node 23: 5, 17
- Node 24: 18, 17, 15
- Node 25: 26, 12, 19
- Node 26: 10, 11, 22, 18, 25
- Node 27: 22, 29, 17
- Node 28: 9
- Node 29: 27, 19

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: Forms 3-stars with (21, 19, 13) and (21, 12, 19) -> 2 3-stars
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star with (5, 6, 15) -> 1 3-star
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with (3, 6, 17) -> 1 3-star
- Node 6: Forms a 3-star with (7, 15, 4) -> 1 3-star
- Node 10: Forms a 3-star with (11, 26, 21) -> 1 3-star
- Node 11: Forms a 3-star with (10, 26, 21) -> 1 3-star
- Node 17: Forms a 3-star with (23, 24, 27) -> 1 3-star
- Node 18: Forms a 3-star with (26, 24, 17) -> 1 3-star
- Node 21: Forms a 3-star with (10, 11, 18) and (21, 18, 0) -> 2 3-stars
- Node 26: Forms a 3-star with (10, 11, 22) and (26, 22, 18) -> 2 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are <(21, 19, 13), (21, 12, 19), (5, 6, 15), (3, 6, 17), (7, 15, 4), (11, 26, 21), (23, 24, 27), (26, 24, 17), (10, 11, 18), (21, 18, 0)>.
