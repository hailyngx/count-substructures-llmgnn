Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 11) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 3) (18, 22) (18, 19) (22, 18) (22, 20) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 24) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 12) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 24) (4, 11) (8, 28) (8, 16) (8, 6) (7, 14) (7, 23) (7, 26) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 15) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 1) (28, 8) (28, 5) (9, 25) (9, 15) (9, 24) (9, 27) (5, 14) (5, 28) (5, 25) (5, 20) (13, 16) (13, 27) (1, 11) (1, 10) (15, 12) (15, 9) (15, 23) (20, 29) (20, 22) (20, 5) (20, 6) (10, 1) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 19) (21, 10) (25, 2) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 23) (27, 9) (27, 13) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 10) (23, 7) (23, 15) (23, 25) (23, 26) (26, 7) (26, 10) (26, 23) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 3) (3, 29) (3, 0) (24, 14) (24, 4) (24, 9) (16, 8) (16, 13) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 20) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {17, 4, 3}
- Node 1: {11, 10}
- Node 2: {29, 11, 25}
- Node 3: {29, 0}
- Node 4: {19, 0, 24, 11}
- Node 5: {14, 28, 25, 20}
- Node 6: {8, 12, 20}
- Node 7: {14, 23, 26}
- Node 8: {28, 16, 6}
- Node 9: {25, 15, 24, 27}
- Node 10: {1, 21, 26, 19}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 1}
- Node 12: {14, 17, 6, 15}
- Node 13: {16, 27}
- Node 14: {17, 7, 12, 24, 5}
- Node 15: {12, 9, 23}
- Node 16: {8, 13}
- Node 17: {14, 0, 12}
- Node 18: {22, 19}
- Node 19: {18, 4, 10}
- Node 20: {29, 22, 5, 6}
- Node 21: {10}
- Node 22: {18, 20}
- Node 23: {7, 15, 25, 26}
- Node 24: {14, 4, 9}
- Node 25: {2, 9, 5, 23}
- Node 26: {7, 10, 23}
- Node 27: {9, 13}
- Node 28: {8, 5}
- Node 29: {2, 20, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 47\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [47].
