Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 5) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 17) (13, 16) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 17) (7, 3) (7, 15) (16, 4) (16, 13) (16, 12) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 18) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 15) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 18) (1, 12) (2, 3) (2, 15) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 17) (15, 7) (15, 11) (15, 2) (15, 9) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 3) (17, 5) (17, 19) (17, 12) (17, 9) (18, 0) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {14, 18, 6}
Node 1: {12}
Node 2: {3, 15}
Node 3: {7, 10, 2, 18}
Node 4: {8, 9, 5, 16}
Node 5: {4, 8, 17}
Node 6: {0, 14, 18}
Node 7: {3, 15}
Node 8: {4, 19, 5}
Node 9: {4, 15, 17}
Node 10: {14, 12, 3}
Node 11: {19, 18, 15}
Node 12: {16, 10, 17, 1}
Node 13: {16}
Node 14: {0, 6, 10}
Node 15: {7, 11, 2, 9}
Node 16: {4, 13, 12}
Node 17: {5, 19, 12, 9}
Node 18: {0, 3, 11, 6}
Node 19: {8, 11, 17}

From this, we see that nodes 0, 3, 4, 8, 12, 15, 16, 17, and 18 have 3 or more neighbors and are potential centers of a 3-star. Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 27

Therefore, the final answer is [27], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 14, 18>
<3, 7, 15>
<4, 8, 9>
<4, 8, 5>
<12, 16, 17>
<12, 16, 10>
<12, 17, 9>
<15, 7, 11>
<15, 2, 9>
<15, 11, 18>
<16, 13, 12>
<17, 5, 19>
<17, 19, 11>
<17, 12, 9>
<18, 0, 6>
<18, 0, 3>
<18, 11, 6>
<18, 11, 3>
<18, 3, 11>
<18, 3, 6>
<18, 11, 3>
