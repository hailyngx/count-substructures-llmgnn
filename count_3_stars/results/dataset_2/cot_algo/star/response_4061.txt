Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 2) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 2) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 1) (13, 9) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 7, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 9, 11}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 4: {12, 13}
- Node 5: {8, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {5, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 6, 10}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 13: {4, 9}
- Node 14: {3, 7, 10}

Next, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: \([20 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4] = [78]\)

The unique 3-stars formed are: <1, (2, 7, 12)>, <1, (3, 7, 12)>, <1, (3, 9, 12)>, <1, (7, 9, 12)>, <3, (0, 6, 11)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 9, 11)>, <3, (6, 9, 14)>, <3, (7, 9, 14)>, <5, (8, 9, 10)>, <7, (1, 9, 12)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 10)>, <9, (5, 7, 10)>, <9, (6, 10, 11)>.
