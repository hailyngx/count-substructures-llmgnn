Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 5) (16, 1) (16, 9) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 3) (18, 13) (5, 11) (5, 6) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (4, 8) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 15) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 19) (19, 8) (19, 3) (19, 17) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 10) (12, 2) (12, 17) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 14) (15, 8) (15, 13) (9, 11) (9, 16) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 17) (0, 13) (17, 19) (17, 12) (17, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 11, 13, 17}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 10, 16}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 12, 14, 18}
- Node 3: {2, 11, 18, 19}
- Node 4: {1, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 11}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 14, 18}
- Node 7: {14}
- Node 8: {4, 15, 19}
- Node 9: {11, 16}
- Node 10: {1, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 12: {2, 17}
- Node 13: {0, 10, 15, 18}
- Node 14: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 15: {8, 13}
- Node 16: {1, 9}
- Node 17: {0, 12, 19}
- Node 18: {2, 3, 6, 13}
- Node 19: {8, 17}

After determining the neighbor set for each node, we find that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 11, 13, 18, and 17. 
For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) unique 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) unique 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) unique 3-star

Adding up the total number of unique 3-stars, we get: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 36 \). 
Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are then listed as follows:
<0, 2, 13>, <0, 2, 17>, <0, 13, 17>, <2, 3, 18>, <2, 6, 13>, <2, 6, 18>, <2, 13, 18>, <3, 11, 19>, <3, 18, 19>, <7, 14, 6>, <1, 4, 10>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 10>, <1, 6, 16>, <1, 10, 13>, <11, 3, 9>, <0, 13, 17>, <0, 17, 12>, <13, 15, 8>, <13, 15, 0>, <13, 15, 18>, <11, 5, 6>, <14, 2, 6>, <14, 2, 7>, <14, 6, 7>, <15, 8, 4>, <17, 0, 12>, <18, 2, 6>, <18, 6, 13>, <2, 14, 7>, <3, 19, 17>, <19, 8, 15>, <0, 2, 14>, <2, 18, 6>, <4, 1, 6>.
