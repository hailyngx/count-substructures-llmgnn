- Node 16: {10, 21}
- Node 17: {13, 20, 25, 27}
- Node 18: {7, 12, 25}
- Node 19: {11, 15, 29}
- Node 20: {17, 26}
- Node 21: {2, 13, 16, 24, 29}
- Node 22: {8}
- Node 23: {4, 26, 27}
- Node 24: {5, 7, 15, 21}
- Node 25: {9, 17, 18, 27}
- Node 26: {2, 6, 20, 23}
- Node 27: {3, 17, 23, 25}

For nodes with three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they form. 

The nodes forming 3-stars are:
- Node 3: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 12: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 15: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 17: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 18: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 21: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 24: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 25: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 26: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 27: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us:

\[4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- \<3, (4, 12, 27)\>
- \<4, (6, 7, 23)\>
- \<5, (6, 9, 14)\>
- \<7, (0, 11, 18)\>
- \<9, (5, 24, 29)\>
- \<12, (3, 14, 18)\>
- \<15, (1, 19, 24)\>
- \<17, (20, 25, 27)\>
- \<18, (7, 12, 25)\>
- \<21, (16, 24, 29)\>
