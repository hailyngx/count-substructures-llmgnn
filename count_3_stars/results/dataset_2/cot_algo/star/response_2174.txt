Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 7) (15, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 18) (12, 3) (12, 7) (4, 13) (4, 5) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 17) (1, 17) (1, 19) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 2) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 0) (16, 9) (14, 6) (14, 2) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 9, 5, 19, 10
- Node 1: 17, 19
- Node 2: 3, 13, 11, 14
- Node 3: 11, 2, 12
- Node 4: 13, 5
- Node 5: 4, 17, 19, 0
- Node 6: 9, 14, 8
- Node 7: 15, 12, 11, 18
- Node 8: 6, 13, 10
- Node 9: 0, 17, 16, 6
- Node 10: 8, 0
- Node 11: 3, 7, 18, 2
- Node 12: 3, 7
- Node 13: 15, 8, 4, 2
- Node 14: 6, 2
- Node 15: 7, 13
- Node 16: 9
- Node 17: 9, 1, 5, 18
- Node 18: 7, 17, 11
- Node 19: 1, 5, 0

Now, let's look at nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 19: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 25

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [25].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 5, 19)>
<2, (3, 11, 14)>
<5, (4, 17, 19)>
<6, (9, 8, 14)>
<8, (6, 10, 13)>
<9, (0, 17, 16)>
<11, (3, 7, 18)>
<13, (15, 4, 8)>
<17, (1, 5, 18)>
<19, (1, 0, 5)>
