Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (7, 10) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 0) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 17) (2, 1) (2, 3) (12, 6) (12, 19) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 17) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 14) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 5) (3, 2) (3, 17) (3, 9) (3, 5) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 16) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 3) (8, 11) (8, 16) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (18, 15) (18, 14) (18, 0) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 16) (16, 19) (16, 8) (16, 13) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 14) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
1 --- 2     3 --- 9
|     |     |     |
0    15 - 17 - 5
      |    |    |
     18   11 - 6 - 14
          |     |    |
         19     12   10
          |            |
          13 --- 16 --- 8
             |
             4
```

Now, we will find the 3-stars in this graph.

- Node 1 has neighbors {0, 2, 15, 18}.
- Node 2 has neighbors {1, 3}.
- Node 3 has neighbors {2, 5, 9, 17}.
- Node 4 has neighbors {13}.
- Node 5 has neighbors {3, 15, 17}.
- Node 6 has neighbors {11, 12, 14, 17}.
- Node 7 has neighbors {10}.
- Node 8 has neighbors {11, 16}.
- Node 9 has neighbors {3, 13}.
- Node 10 has neighbors {7, 14, 19}.
- Node 11 has neighbors {6, 8, 17, 19}.
- Node 12 has neighbors {6, 19}.
- Node 13 has neighbors {4, 9, 16, 19}.
- Node 14 has neighbors {6, 10, 18}.
- Node 15 has neighbors {0, 1, 5, 17, 18}.
- Node 16 has neighbors {8, 13, 19}.
- Node 17 has neighbors {3, 5, 6, 11, 15}.
- Node 18 has neighbors {0, 14, 15}.
- Node 19 has neighbors {10, 11, 12, 13, 16}.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 46

Therefore, the final answer is [46], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 0, 2, 15>, <1, 2, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 15, 17>, <1, 15, 17, 18>, <3, 5, 15, 17>, <6, 11, 17, 19>, <6, 11, 17, 3>, <6, 11, 17, 5>, <6, 12, 19, 11>, <6, 12, 19, 13>, <10, 14, 18, 6>, <13, 16, 19, 8>
