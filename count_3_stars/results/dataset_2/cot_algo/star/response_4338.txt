Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 18) (15, 7) (15, 9) (18, 3) (18, 22) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 10) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 7) (23, 16) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 0) (10, 22) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 1) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 24) (17, 19) (17, 27) (4, 8) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 20) (28, 6) (28, 12) (28, 14) (28, 25) (21, 0) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 20) (24, 17) (24, 1) (26, 12) (0, 8) (0, 21) (0, 29) (7, 15) (7, 23) (7, 10) (7, 2) (2, 7) (2, 27) (2, 20) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 24) (11, 25) (11, 29) (12, 28) (12, 26) (12, 20) (12, 9) (20, 6) (20, 13) (20, 2) (20, 12) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 16) (25, 6) (25, 28) (25, 13) (25, 11) (25, 19) (29, 0) (29, 11) (14, 28) (27, 17) (27, 2) (27, 19) (19, 17) (19, 25) (19, 27) (16, 23) (16, 8) (16, 9) 

Response:
The central idea is to find all possible 3-star graphs in this network. We'll begin by identifying the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {8, 21, 29}
- Node 1: {5, 10, 24}
- Node 2: {7, 20, 27}
- Node 3: {5, 17, 18}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 13}
- Node 6: {20, 25, 28}
- Node 7: {2, 10, 15, 23}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 16, 23}
- Node 9: {10, 12, 15, 16}
- Node 10: {1, 7, 9, 17, 22}
- Node 11: {25, 29}
- Node 12: {9, 20, 26, 28}
- Node 13: {5, 20, 25}
- Node 14: {28}
- Node 15: {7, 9}
- Node 16: {8, 9, 23}
- Node 17: {3, 10, 19, 24, 27}
- Node 18: {3, 22}
- Node 19: {17, 25, 27}
- Node 20: {2, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 21: {0}
- Node 22: {10, 18, 23}
- Node 23: {7, 8, 16, 22}
- Node 24: {1, 17}
- Node 25: {6, 11, 13, 19}
- Node 26: {12}
- Node 27: {2, 17, 19}
- Node 28: {6, 12, 14, 25}
- Node 29: {0, 11}

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes 10, 17, and 27 each form a 3-star:

Total number of 3-stars = 3

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
