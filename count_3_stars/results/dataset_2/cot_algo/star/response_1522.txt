Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 2) (4, 8) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 18) (10, 7) (10, 5) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 11) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 9) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 18) (9, 12) (15, 0) (2, 17) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 3) (16, 12) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 0) (0, 15) (0, 2) (0, 3) (13, 14) (13, 12) (6, 19) (6, 11) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 6) 

Response:
In this graph, we can first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 15}
- Node 1: {9, 17, 19}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 11, 12, 17}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 12}
- Node 4: {8, 11}
- Node 5: {2, 10, 19}
- Node 6: {11, 19}
- Node 7: {3, 10, 18}
- Node 8: {4, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 8, 12, 18}
- Node 10: {5, 7}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 9, 13, 16}
- Node 13: {12, 14}
- Node 14: {8, 13, 17, 18}
- Node 15: {0}
- Node 16: {12}
- Node 17: {1, 2, 14}
- Node 18: {7, 9, 14}
- Node 19: {1, 5, 6}

Now, we can see which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 5 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 17: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up gives a total of 32 3-stars in the graph: `[32]`.

The unique 3-stars formed are:
<2, (0, 11, 12)>, <8, (4, 9, 11)>, <9, (1, 12, 18)>, <11, (2, 4, 6)>, <12, (2, 13, 16)>
