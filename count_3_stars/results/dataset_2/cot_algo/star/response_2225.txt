Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 6) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 18) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 9) (15, 16) (15, 19) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 19) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 19) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 14) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 18) (17, 8) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 17) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:
First, we need to determine the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: {10, 17, 1, 9}
Node 1: {0, 6}
Node 2: {10, 12}
Node 3: {11, 8, 13, 4, 18}
Node 4: {3, 5, 17}
Node 5: {12, 4}
Node 6: {16, 1, 19}
Node 7: {9}
Node 8: {13, 17, 3}
Node 9: {0, 7, 18, 17, 19}
Node 10: {13, 0, 2}
Node 11: {16, 3}
Node 12: {2, 14, 5}
Node 13: {8, 10, 14, 3}
Node 14: {13, 12, 18}
Node 15: {16, 19}
Node 16: {11, 15, 6}
Node 17: {8, 0, 9, 4}
Node 18: {3, 9, 14}
Node 19: {15, 6, 9}

Now, we need to identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Nodes 3, 13, 14, and 9 have 5 neighbors each.

For nodes 3, 13, 14, and 9, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up gives us a total of 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 31 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [31].

The unique 3-stars found are as follows:
<3, (8, 13, 18)>
<13, (8, 3, 14)>
<14, (13, 12, 18)>
<9, (0, 17, 19)>
