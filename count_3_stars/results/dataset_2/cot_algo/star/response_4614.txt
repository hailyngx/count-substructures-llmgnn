Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 8}

Now let's identify the 3-stars based on the neighbor sets:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars: <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star can be formed with this node.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars: <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star can be formed with this node.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star can be formed with this node.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <6, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star can be formed with this node.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <9, (0, 5, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].
