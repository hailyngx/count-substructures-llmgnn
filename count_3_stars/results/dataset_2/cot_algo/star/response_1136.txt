Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 29) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 26) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 17) (12, 13) (12, 28) (12, 26) (27, 23) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 8) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 22) (29, 4) (29, 0) (29, 23) (21, 2) (21, 6) (28, 12) (28, 0) (28, 19) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 18) (13, 12) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 20) (26, 10) (26, 12) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 3) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 26) (3, 6) (6, 7) (6, 21) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 20) (25, 26) (25, 16) (25, 15) (19, 28) (19, 15) (19, 1) (23, 27) (23, 29) (22, 2) (22, 17) (22, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 22) (14, 16) (15, 4) (15, 25) (15, 19) (1, 2) (1, 19) (20, 13) (20, 6) (0, 29) (0, 28) (0, 6) (16, 13) (16, 25) (16, 14) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first determine the neighbors of each node before identifying the 3-stars.

### Neighbors of Each Node:
- Node 0: {6, 28, 29}
- Node 1: {2, 19}
- Node 2: {1, 8, 18, 21, 22}
- Node 3: {6, 7, 11, 26}
- Node 4: {7, 14, 15, 29}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 7, 20, 21}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 8: {2, 7, 9, 18}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 17}
- Node 10: {11, 26}
- Node 11: {3, 7, 10, 14, 17}
- Node 12: {13, 26, 28}
- Node 13: {12, 16, 20, 26}
- Node 14: {4, 11, 16, 22}
- Node 15: {4, 19, 25}
- Node 16: {13, 14, 25}
- Node 17: {9, 11, 22}
- Node 18: {2, 8}
- Node 19: {1, 15}
- Node 20: {6, 13}
- Node 21: {2, 6}
- Node 22: {2, 14, 17}
- Node 23: {27, 29}
- Node 25: {15, 16, 26}
- Node 26: {10, 12, 13, 25, 3}
- Node 27: {23}
- Node 28: {0, 12, 19}
- Node 29: {0, 4, 23}

### 3-Stars:
- There are a total of 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 13.
- For each of these nodes, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) where \( n \) is the number of neighbors of the node.
    - Node 0 has 3 neighbors, therefore no 3-stars are formed.
    - Node 2 has 5 neighbors, hence \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars are formed:
      <2, (1, 8, 18)>, <2, (1, 8, 21)>, <2, (1, 18, 21)>, <2, (2, 8, 18)>, <2, (2, 8, 21)>, <2, (2, 18, 21)>, <2, (8, 18, 21)>, <2, (17, 22, 21)>, <2, (2, 18, 22)>, <2, (2, 21, 22)>
    - Node 4 has 4 neighbors, thus \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed:
      <4, (7, 14, 29)>, <4, (7, 15, 29)>, <4, (14, 15, 29)>, <4, (4, 15, 25)>
    - Node 6 has 5 neighbors, therefore \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars are formed. 
    - Node 7 has 5 neighbors, thus \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars are formed.
    - Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed:
      <8, (2, 7, 18)>, <8, (2, 7, 8)>, <8, (7, 18, 8)>, <8, (8, 18, 21)>
    - Node 13 has 4 neighbors, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed:
      <13, (12, 16, 26)>, <13, (13, 16, 25)>, <13, (13, 20, 26)>, <13, (16, 20, 25)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 42 \). 
Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [42].
