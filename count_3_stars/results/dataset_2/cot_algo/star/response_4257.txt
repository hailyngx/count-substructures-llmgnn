Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 20) (7, 21) (7, 23) (7, 26) (7, 13) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 11) (21, 18) (3, 28) (3, 17) (25, 9) (25, 22) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 20) (17, 3) (17, 14) (17, 4) (28, 21) (28, 3) (22, 9) (22, 25) (22, 5) (22, 29) (5, 22) (5, 13) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 0) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 29) (27, 16) (1, 10) (1, 23) (1, 0) (15, 29) (15, 24) (15, 2) (26, 7) (26, 20) (26, 16) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 10) (19, 8) (19, 12) (19, 23) (12, 14) (12, 19) (12, 20) (16, 27) (16, 26) (16, 2) (18, 9) (18, 21) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 1) (29, 22) (29, 4) (29, 15) (20, 9) (20, 14) (20, 26) (20, 12) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 21) (23, 7) (23, 1) (23, 19) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 10) (24, 15) 

Response:
The first step is to determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 6, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 10, 23}
- Node 2: {10, 15, 16}
- Node 3: {14, 17, 28}
- Node 4: {6, 10, 17, 29}
- Node 5: {13, 22}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {13, 21, 23, 26}
- Node 8: {10, 14, 19}
- Node 9: {6, 18, 20, 22, 25}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 4, 8, 13}
- Node 11: {21}
- Node 12: {14, 19, 20}
- Node 13: {0, 5, 7, 10}
- Node 14: {3, 8, 12, 17, 20}
- Node 15: {2, 24, 29}
- Node 16: {2, 16, 26}
- Node 17: {3, 4, 14}
- Node 18: {9, 21}
- Node 19: {8, 12, 23}
- Node 20: {9, 12, 14, 26}
- Node 21: {7, 11, 18, 28}
- Node 22: {5, 9, 25, 29}
- Node 23: {1, 7, 19}
- Node 24: {15}
- Node 25: {9, 22}
- Node 26: {7, 16, 20}
- Node 27: {16}
- Node 28: {3, 21}
- Node 29: {4, 15, 22}

Now we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph based on the number of neighbors of each node:

- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 11, 24, 27: Not considered as they have less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4, 5, 6, 18, 25, 28, 29: Each form 1 3-star.
- Node 7: Forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8, 12: Each form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9, 13, 16, 19: Each form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 10, 14, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26: Each form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 15: Forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 72

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [72].
