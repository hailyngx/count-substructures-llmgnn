Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 26) (10, 18) (11, 3) (4, 18) (4, 23) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 20) (18, 12) (3, 11) (3, 5) (27, 8) (27, 19) (27, 13) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 26) (5, 21) (5, 16) (19, 27) (19, 5) (19, 24) (19, 9) (9, 19) (9, 29) (9, 15) (29, 9) (29, 1) (29, 8) (13, 27) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 23) (17, 13) (17, 7) (17, 15) (14, 26) (14, 28) (14, 16) (14, 25) (14, 21) (26, 10) (26, 5) (26, 14) (26, 6) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 20) (7, 1) (16, 5) (16, 14) (16, 7) (16, 22) (22, 16) (22, 2) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 23) (6, 26) (24, 19) (1, 29) (1, 7) (1, 0) (2, 13) (2, 22) (2, 28) (2, 25) (20, 18) (20, 7) (20, 21) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 28) (21, 5) (21, 14) (21, 20) (21, 8) (0, 1) (23, 4) (23, 13) (23, 12) (8, 27) (8, 29) (8, 21) (25, 14) (25, 2) (28, 14) (28, 2) (28, 15) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 29}
- Node 2: {13, 22, 25, 28}
- Node 3: {5, 11}
- Node 4: {18, 23}
- Node 5: {3, 5, 16, 19, 21, 26}
- Node 6: {26}
- Node 7: {1, 16, 17, 20}
- Node 8: {21, 27, 29}
- Node 9: {15, 19, 29}
- Node 10: {18, 26}
- Node 11: {3}
- Node 12: {13, 18, 23}
- Node 13: {2, 12, 17, 23, 27}
- Node 14: {16, 21, 25, 26, 28}
- Node 15: {9, 17, 28}
- Node 16: {5, 7, 14, 21, 22}
- Node 17: {7, 13, 15}
- Node 18: {4, 10, 12, 20}
- Node 19: {5, 9, 24, 27}
- Node 20: {7, 18, 21}
- Node 21: {5, 8, 14, 20}
- Node 22: {2, 16}
- Node 23: {4, 12, 13}
- Node 24: {19}
- Node 25: {2, 14}
- Node 26: {5, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 27: {8, 13, 19}
- Node 28: {2, 14, 15}
- Node 29: {1, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 14: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 16: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 18: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 21: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 26: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 29: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 47

Therefore, the final answer is [47]. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<7, 1, 20, 16>, <13, 2, 12, 23>, <13, 2, 17, 27>, <13, 2, 27, 23>, <13, 12, 23, 4>, <13, 17, 7, 15>, <13, 17, 7, 16>, <13, 17, 15, 28>, <13, 23, 4, 12>, <13, 23, 4, 18>, <13, 23, 12, 18>, <13, 27, 19, 9>, <13, 27, 19, 24>, <13, 27, 19, 5>, <13, 27, 23, 12>, <14, 16, 5, 21>, <14, 16, 5, 26>, <14, 16, 21, 20>, <14, 16, 21, 5>, <14, 21, 5, 16>, <14, 21, 8, 26>, <14, 21, 20, 7>, <14, 21, 20, 18>, <14, 21, 20, 7>, <16, 5, 26, 10>, <16, 7, 17, 15>, <16, 7, 17, 13>, <16, 7, 17, 28>, <18, 4, 12, 23>, <18, 4, 12, 13>, <18, 4, 23, 13>, <18, 10, 26, 5>, <21, 5, 26, 10>, <21, 8, 29, 1>, <21, 14, 28, 15>, <21, 16, 22, 2>
