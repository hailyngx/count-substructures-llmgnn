Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 18) (16, 2) (9, 26) (9, 0) (26, 9) (26, 18) (15, 2) (15, 17) (27, 22) (27, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 24) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 17) (23, 8) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 6) (20, 11) (20, 0) (20, 13) (20, 22) (20, 5) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 29) (17, 7) (29, 17) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 22) (29, 21) (24, 10) (24, 4) (18, 16) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 1) (18, 3) (7, 17) (7, 13) (25, 0) (2, 16) (2, 15) (2, 10) (22, 27) (22, 20) (22, 29) (22, 3) (3, 18) (3, 22) (3, 12) (28, 12) (28, 14) (28, 5) (4, 24) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 3) (12, 28) (12, 4) (12, 13) (21, 16) (21, 29) (19, 18) (19, 4) (1, 29) (1, 18) (5, 20) (5, 28) (14, 8) (14, 28) (14, 6) (6, 27) (6, 0) (6, 29) (6, 14) (13, 20) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: Neighbors -> 9, 10, 20, 25, 6
- Node 1: Neighbors -> 29, 18
- Node 2: Neighbors -> 16, 15, 10
- Node 3: Neighbors -> 18, 22, 12
- Node 4: Neighbors -> 24, 19, 12
- Node 5: Neighbors -> 20, 28
- Node 6: Neighbors -> 27, 0, 29, 14
- Node 7: Neighbors -> 17, 13
- Node 8: Neighbors -> 23, 14, 17
- Node 9: Neighbors -> 26, 0
- Node 10: Neighbors -> 11, 0, 2, 24
- Node 11: Neighbors -> 16, 10, 20
- Node 12: Neighbors -> 3, 28, 4, 13
- Node 13: Neighbors -> 20, 7, 12
- Node 14: Neighbors -> 8, 28, 6
- Node 15: Neighbors -> 2, 17
- Node 16: Neighbors -> 11, 21, 18, 2
- Node 17: Neighbors -> 15, 8, 29, 7
- Node 18: Neighbors -> 16, 26, 19, 1, 3
- Node 19: Neighbors -> 18, 4
- Node 20: Neighbors -> 11, 0, 22, 5, 13
- Node 21: Neighbors -> 16, 29
- Node 22: Neighbors -> 27, 20, 29, 3
- Node 23: Neighbors -> 8
- Node 24: Neighbors -> 10, 4
- Node 25: Neighbors -> 0
- Node 26: Neighbors -> 9, 18
- Node 27: Neighbors -> 22, 6
- Node 28: Neighbors -> 12, 14, 5
- Node 29: Neighbors -> 17, 1, 6, 22, 21

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 57

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [57].
