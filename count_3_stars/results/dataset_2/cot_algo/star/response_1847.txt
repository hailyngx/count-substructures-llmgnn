Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (8, 10) (8, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 11) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 4: {9, 10, 13}
- Node 5: {11, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {3, 10}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 5, 12}
- Node 12: {2, 5, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 7, 10}
- Node 14: {2, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4: Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star
- Node 5: Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star
- Node 6: Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 14: Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 66

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [66].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <1, (0, 7, 13)>
- <1, (2, 7, 14)>
- <1, (3, 10, 13)>
- <1, (7, 13, 14)>
- <2, (0, 6, 14)>
- <2, (6, 7, 14)>
- <3, (8, 10, 13)>
- <3, (9, 10, 13)>
- <3, (11, 12, 5)>
- <7, (0, 1, 13)>
- <7, (1, 13, 14)>
- <9, (3, 10, 13)>
- <10, (3, 8, 13)>
- <10, (3, 9, 13)>
- <10, (4, 9, 13)>
