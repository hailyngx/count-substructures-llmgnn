Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 7) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 7) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 13
- Node 1: 7, 8, 10
- Node 3: 6, 8, 11, 12, 14
- Node 4: 5, 10, 12, 13
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7, 9, 14
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 7, 13
- Node 8: 1, 3, 8, 10, 12, 14
- Node 9: 5, 6, 9, 11, 13
- Node 10: 1, 4, 8, 10, 13
- Node 11: 3, 9, 10, 11, 14
- Node 12: 3, 4, 8, 12
- Node 13: 0, 4, 7, 9, 10
- Node 14: 3, 5, 7, 8, 11

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars for each node: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 94

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [94].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (6, 8, 14)>, <4, (5, 10, 13)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 13)>, <8, (1, 10, 14)>, <12, (3, 4, 8)>
