Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's organize the given edges based on the nodes they connect:

Node 0: {7, 6, 1, 2, 3}
Node 1: {4, 0}
Node 2: {4, 0, 3}
Node 3: {4, 6, 8, 0, 2}
Node 4: {7, 8, 2, 1, 6, 3}
Node 5: {9, 6, 8}
Node 6: {5, 9, 4, 3, 8, 0}
Node 7: {4, 0}
Node 8: {5, 9, 4, 6, 3}
Node 9: {5, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star subgraphs:
Node 3 has 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3} = 10] 3-stars
Node 4 has 6 neighbors => [inom{6}{3} = 20] 3-stars
Node 6 has 6 neighbors => [inom{6}{3} = 20] 3-stars
Node 8 has 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3} = 10] 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 60

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 2)>
<3, (0, 4, 1)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 3, 2)>
<4, (7, 0, 6)>
<4, (7, 0, 3)>
<4, (7, 0, 2)>
<4, (1, 0, 6)>
<4, (1, 0, 2)>
<4, (6, 5, 9)>
<4, (6, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 9, 8)>
<4, (6, 3, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 5)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (8, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 9, 8)>
<6, (4, 8, 5)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 9, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [60].
