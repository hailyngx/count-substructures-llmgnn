Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 3}

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars centered at each node:

- Node 1, 2, 5, and 8 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) unique 3-stars each.
- Node 3 and 9 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) unique 3-stars each.
- Node 0, 4, 6, and 7 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 unique 3-star each.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: \( 4\times 10 + 2\times 10 + 4\times 1 = 60 \).

So the final answer is [60]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- <8, (1, 2, 5)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
