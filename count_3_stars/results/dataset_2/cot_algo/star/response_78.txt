Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 6
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 7

Now, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:

- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us \( 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 48 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>
