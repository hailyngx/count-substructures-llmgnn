Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 11) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 14) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 18) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 13) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 8) (15, 1) (15, 17) (15, 16) (13, 11) (17, 15) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 12) (19, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (6, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 10) (10, 3) (10, 9) (16, 15) (16, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (12, 19) (12, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node. Then we can count the number of 3-stars formed around nodes with three or more neighbors.

The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 9, 12} (Degree 5)
- Node 1: {5, 8, 15} (Degree 3)
- Node 2: {0, 7, 9, 18, 19} (Degree 5)
- Node 3: {0, 7, 10, 11, 14} (Degree 5)
- Node 4: {9, 14, 18} (Degree 3)
- Node 5: {0, 1} (Degree 2)
- Node 6: {7} (Degree 1)
- Node 7: {2, 3, 6, 11} (Degree 4)
- Node 8: {1, 16, 19} (Degree 3)
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 10, 19} (Degree 5)
- Node 10: {3, 9} (Degree 2)
- Node 11: {3, 7, 11, 13, 18} (Degree 5)
- Node 12: {0, 19} (Degree 2)
- Node 13: {11} (Degree 1)
- Node 14: {3, 4} (Degree 2)
- Node 15: {1, 16, 17} (Degree 3)
- Node 16: {8, 15} (Degree 2)
- Node 17: {15} (Degree 1)
- Node 18: {2, 4, 11} (Degree 3)
- Node 19: {2, 8, 9, 12, 18} (Degree 5)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0, 2, 3, 9, 19 each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- The total number of 3-stars formed is \( 5 \times 10 = 50 \).

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are as follows:
<2, (0, 9, 19)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 19)>, <19, (0, 2, 9)>
