Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 14) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2 neighbors: 4, 6, 14
- Node 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 12, 13, 14
- Node 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 10, 11
- Node 5 neighbors: 0, 7, 12, 13
- Node 6 neighbors: 2, 3, 9
- Node 7 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 8, 14
- Node 8 neighbors: 7, 9, 12
- Node 9 neighbors: 6, 8, 13
- Node 10 neighbors: 4, 11, 13
- Node 11 neighbors: 4, 10, 12
- Node 12 neighbors: 3, 5, 8, 11, 14
- Node 13 neighbors: 3, 5, 9, 10, 14
- Node 14 neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 12, 13

Now we will check the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 2: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 3: 5 neighbors, can form 10 3-stars
- Node 4: 5 neighbors, can form 10 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 7: 5 neighbors, can form 10 3-stars
- Node 8: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 9: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 10: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 11: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 12: 5 neighbors, can form 10 3-stars
- Node 13: 5 neighbors, can form 10 3-stars
- Node 14: 5 neighbors, can form 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the given graph is [54].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
- <0, 1, 4>
- <3, 1, 13>
- <3, 1, 4>
- <3, 4, 14>
- <3, 5, 13>
- <3, 7, 14>
- <3, 12, 14>
- <4, 1, 10>
- <4, 1, 11>
- <4, 13, 14>
