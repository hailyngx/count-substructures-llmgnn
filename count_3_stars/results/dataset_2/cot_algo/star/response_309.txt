Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 6) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 2) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: (1, 3, 9, 10)
- Node 1: (0, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12)
- Node 2: (3, 6, 13, 14)
- Node 3: (0, 1, 2)
- Node 4: (1, 5, 6, 7, 10)
- Node 5: (4, 8, 12, 14)
- Node 6: (2, 4, 7, 13)
- Node 7: (1, 4, 6, 11, 13)
- Node 8: (5, 14)
- Node 9: (0, 1, 11,14)
- Node 10: (0, 4, 11)
- Node 11: (7, 9, 10, 14)
- Node 12: (1, 5, 14)
- Node 13: (2, 6, 7)
- Node 14: (2, 5, 8, 11, 12, 9)

Now, let's find the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 1: \( \text{inom}(6, 3) = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \text{inom}(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \text{inom}(6, 3) = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 77 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [77], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 12)>, <1, (4, 9, 12)>, <1, (7, 9, 12)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 10)>, <4, (6, 7, 10)>, <5, (8, 12, 14)>, <9, (11, 14, 9)>
