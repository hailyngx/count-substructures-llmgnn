Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 27) (11, 20) (16, 29) (16, 9) (16, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 22) (5, 29) (9, 16) (9, 25) (9, 15) (15, 9) (15, 2) (27, 11) (27, 28) (27, 26) (27, 8) (18, 26) (18, 19) (22, 5) (22, 24) (10, 26) (10, 7) (6, 16) (6, 5) (6, 29) (28, 27) (28, 19) (28, 2) (28, 23) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 17) (26, 27) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 19) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 20) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 4) (17, 19) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 23) (0, 12) (3, 12) (3, 17) (25, 9) (25, 21) (13, 21) (13, 4) (21, 25) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 2) (8, 5) (8, 27) (20, 11) (20, 7) (20, 4) (2, 15) (2, 28) (2, 1) (2, 21) (29, 16) (29, 5) (29, 6) (24, 22) (24, 14) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 20) (4, 14) (23, 28) (23, 17) (23, 21) (23, 14) (14, 24) (14, 4) (14, 23) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

For each node, let's list its neighboring nodes:

- Node 0: {12}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 17}
- Node 2: {1, 15, 21, 28}
- Node 3: {12, 17}
- Node 4: {1, 13, 14, 20}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 22, 29}
- Node 6: {5, 16, 29}
- Node 7: {10, 12, 20}
- Node 8: {5, 27}
- Node 9: {15, 16, 25}
- Node 10: {7, 26}
- Node 11: {19, 20, 27}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 13: {4, 14, 21}
- Node 14: {4, 13, 23, 24}
- Node 15: {2, 9}
- Node 16: {6, 9, 29}
- Node 17: {1, 3, 19, 23}
- Node 18: {19, 26}
- Node 19: {11, 17, 18, 26, 28}
- Node 20: {4, 7, 11}
- Node 21: {2, 13, 21, 23}
- Node 22: {5, 24}
- Node 23: {14, 17, 21, 23, 28}
- Node 24: {14, 22}
- Node 25: {9, 21}
- Node 26: {10, 18, 19, 27}
- Node 27: {8, 11, 26, 28}
- Node 28: {2, 19, 23, 27}
- Node 29: {5, 6, 16}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 21, 23, 26, 28, 29}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = {16 \choose 3} = 560 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [560].

Some unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 14)>
<4, (13, 14, 21)>
<(5, 6, 16), 29>
<7, (10, 20, 27)>
<9, (15, 16, 25)>
<11, (19, 27, 28)>
<12, (7, 20, 23)>
<13, (4, 14, 21)>
<14, (4, 13, 23)>
<17, (1, 3, 19)>
<19, (17, 18, 28)>
<21, (2, 13, 23)>
<23, (14, 17, 21)>
<26, (18, 19, 27)>
<28, (19, 23, 27)>
