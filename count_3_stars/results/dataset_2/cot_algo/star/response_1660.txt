Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 17) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 6) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 8) (17, 11) (5, 3) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 8) (9, 10) (0, 11) (16, 10) (4, 12) (4, 14) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 2) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (14, 19) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 14) (18, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the 3-star graph can be formed as follows:

Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 15, 5, 8. So, there is 1 3-star formed with node 3. 
Node 15 has 2 neighbors: 3, 17. Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 3, 19. Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 11, 13, 11. So, there is 1 3-star formed with node 7. 
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 4, 13, 18, 6. So, there are 4 3-stars formed with node 12: 
<12, (4, 13, 18)>, <12, (4, 13, 6)>, <12, (18, 13, 6)>, <12, (4, 18, 6)>
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 17, 2, 9, 8. So, there are 4 3-stars formed with node 1: 
<1, (17, 2, 9)>, <1, (17, 2, 8)>, <1, (17, 9, 8)>, <1, (2, 9, 8)>
Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 15, 1, 8, 11. So, there are 4 3-stars formed with node 17: 
<17, (15, 1, 8)>, <17, (15, 1, 11)>, <17, (15, 8, 11)>, <17, (1, 8, 11)>
Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 5, 14, 9. So, there is 1 3-star formed with node 19. 
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 3, 1, 17, 9. So, there are 4 3-stars formed with node 8: 
<8, (3, 1, 17)>, <8, (3, 1, 9)>, <8, (3, 17, 9)>, <8, (1, 17, 9)>
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 19, 8, 10. So, there are 4 3-stars formed with node 9: 
<9, (1, 19, 8)>, <9, (1, 19, 10)>, <9, (1, 8, 10)>, <9, (19, 8, 10)>
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 11. So, there is 1 3-star formed with node 2. 
Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 7, 12, 11, 14. So, there are 4 3-stars formed with node 13: 
<13, (7, 12, 11)>, <13, (7, 12, 14)>, <13, (7, 11, 14)>, <13, (12, 11, 14)>
Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 9, 16, 6, 14. So, there are 4 3-stars formed with node 10: 
<10, (9, 16, 6)>, <10, (9, 16, 14)>, <10, (9, 6, 14)>, <10, (16, 6, 14)>
Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 12, 14. Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 12, 10, 2. So, there is 1 3-star formed with node 6. 
Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 7, 17, 0, 13, 2. So, there are 5 3-stars formed with node 11: 
<11, (7, 17, 0)>, <11, (7, 17, 13)>, <11, (7, 17, 2)>, <11, (7, 0, 13)>, <11, (7, 13, 2)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31].
