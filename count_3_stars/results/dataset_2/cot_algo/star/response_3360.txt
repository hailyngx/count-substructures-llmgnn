Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 14) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 29) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 5) (0, 3) (0, 27) (0, 24) (0, 11) (0, 4) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 7) (7, 27) (7, 23) (7, 17) (20, 25) (20, 29) (25, 20) (25, 10) (1, 26) (1, 28) (1, 23) (1, 18) (10, 25) (10, 8) (10, 19) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 29) (12, 27) (12, 11) (12, 16) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (22, 19) (22, 28) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 14) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 22) (19, 5) (29, 26) (29, 15) (29, 20) (29, 11) (29, 14) (18, 9) (18, 1) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 4) (23, 7) (23, 1) (23, 6) (24, 0) (24, 17) (17, 7) (17, 16) (17, 24) (17, 28) (28, 1) (28, 22) (28, 17) (28, 14) (13, 2) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 23) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 16) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 29) (14, 28) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 11, 24, 27, 4}
- Node 1: {18, 23, 26, 28}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 8, 13, 19}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 15}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 16}
- Node 5: {14, 15, 19}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 6, 23}
- Node 7: {17, 23, 27}
- Node 8: {2, 8, 10, 19}
- Node 9: {14, 18, 26}
- Node 10: {8, 19, 25}
- Node 11: {0, 12, 29}
- Node 12: {11, 16, 27}
- Node 13: {2}
- Node 14: {5, 9, 29, 28}
- Node 15: {3, 5, 29}
- Node 16: {4, 12, 17}
- Node 17: {7, 16, 24, 28}
- Node 18: {1, 9}
- Node 19: {2, 5, 8, 10, 22}
- Node 20: {25, 29}
- Node 22: {19, 28}
- Node 23: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 24: {0, 17}
- Node 25: {10, 20}
- Node 26: {1, 9, 29}
- Node 27: {0, 7, 12}
- Node 28: {1, 14, 17, 22}
- Node 29: {11, 14, 15, 20, 26}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 13, 19, 25, 28 (4 nodes) => \( 4 \times \binom{3}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: none, as the rest have less than 3 neighbors

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4. 

Therefore, the answer is [4], and the unique 3-star configurations are:
- <13, (2, 6, 4)>
- <19, (2, 8, 5)>
- <25, (10, 20, 29)>
- <28, (1, 14, 17)>
