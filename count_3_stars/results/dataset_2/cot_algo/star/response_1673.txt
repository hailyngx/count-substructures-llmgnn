Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 4, 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 4, 0, 8, 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 4
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 1, 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 0, 2
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 0, 3
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 2, 8, 4
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 1
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 1, 3, 0
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 3, 7

Next, we determine the number of neighbors each node has:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 6 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, we apply the combinatorial calculation to nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 8, 1)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
