Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 16) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 14) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 17) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 10) (12, 19) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 0) (15, 5) (15, 1) (15, 19) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 2) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 18) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 18) (16, 4) (16, 1) (11, 14) (11, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 3) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 13) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (18, 5) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 11) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {1, 3, 10, 18}

Node 1: {0, 15, 16}

Node 2: {3, 8, 17}

Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 14}

Node 4: {9, 16}

Node 5: {7, 14, 15, 18}

Node 6: {3, 9}

Node 7: {5, 10, 14}

Node 8: {2, 10, 14}

Node 9: {4, 6}

Node 10: {0, 7, 8, 12, 18}

Node 11: {14, 18}

Node 12: {10, 19}

Node 13: {18, 19}

Node 14: {3, 5, 7, 8, 11}

Node 15: {1, 5, 19}

Node 16: {1, 4}

Node 17: {2}

Node 18: {0, 5, 10, 11, 13}

Node 19: {12, 13, 15}

Now, we can count the 3-stars:

- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 1: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 2: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 4: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 6: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 7: No 3-stars (only 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 9: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 10: No 3-stars (only 5 neighbors)
- Node 11: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 12: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 13: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 14: No 3-stars (only 5 neighbors)
- Node 15: No 3-stars (only 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 17: No 3-stars (only 1 neighbor)
- Node 18: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 19: No 3-stars (only 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is [29], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, 3, 10>, <0, 3, 18>, <0, 10, 18>, <3, 5, 14>, <5, 14, 18>
