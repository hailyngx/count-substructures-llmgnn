Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 5) (11, 8) (12, 10) (27, 26) (27, 19) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 22) (29, 28) (29, 25) (29, 13) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (3, 11) (3, 23) (3, 19) (16, 28) (16, 8) (26, 27) (26, 5) (26, 20) (23, 11) (23, 3) (23, 14) (23, 25) (21, 10) (21, 25) (1, 10) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 8) (15, 1) (15, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 26) (6, 19) (6, 20) (17, 18) (17, 0) (17, 24) (17, 22) (0, 4) (0, 17) (0, 22) (25, 10) (25, 29) (25, 23) (25, 21) (20, 26) (20, 6) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 7) (19, 27) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) (13, 29) (13, 15) (24, 1) (24, 17) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 7) (14, 4) (14, 23) (22, 28) (22, 17) (22, 0) 

Response:
Based on the provided edge list, we can construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {17, 4, 22}
- Node 1 neighbors: {8, 10, 15, 24}
- Node 2 neighbors: {4, 7, 9, 19}
- Node 3 neighbors: {11, 19, 23}
- Node 4 neighbors: {0, 2, 5, 14, 18}
- Node 5 neighbors: {4, 11, 26}
- Node 6 neighbors: {19, 20}
- Node 7 neighbors: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 8 neighbors: {1, 7, 11, 16}
- Node 9 neighbors: {2, 7}
- Node 10 neighbors: {1, 12, 21, 25}
- Node 11 neighbors: {3, 5, 8, 10, 23}
- Node 12 neighbors: {10}
- Node 13 neighbors: {15, 29}
- Node 14 neighbors: {4, 23}
- Node 15 neighbors: {1, 13}
- Node 16 neighbors: {8, 28}
- Node 17 neighbors: {0, 22}
- Node 18 neighbors: {4, 17}
- Node 19 neighbors: {2, 3, 6, 27}
- Node 20 neighbors: {6, 26}
- Node 21 neighbors: {10, 25}
- Node 22 neighbors: {0, 17, 28}
- Node 23 neighbors: {3, 11, 14, 25}
- Node 24 neighbors: {1, 17}
- Node 25 neighbors: {10, 21, 23, 29}
- Node 26 neighbors: {5, 20, 27}
- Node 27 neighbors: {19, 26}
- Node 28 neighbors: {16, 22, 29}
- Node 29 neighbors: {13, 25, 28}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Nodes 0, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 17, 19, 22, 23, and 25 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].

List of unique 3-stars: 
- <0, (17, 4, 22)>
- <4, (0, 18, 5)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 11, 16)>
- <10, (1, 21, 25)>
- <11, (3, 5, 8)>
- <19, (2, 3, 6)>
- <22, (17, 0, 28)>
- <23, (3, 14, 25)>
- <25, (10, 21, 29)>
