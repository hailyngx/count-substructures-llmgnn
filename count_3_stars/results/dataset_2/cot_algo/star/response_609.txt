Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 7}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 42. Therefore, the final answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 6)>
