Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 10) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 12) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 14) (13, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {6, 2, 3}
Node 1 neighbors: {5, 7, 6, 12}
Node 2 neighbors: {7, 8, 11, 0}
Node 3 neighbors: {0, 11, 12}
Node 4 neighbors: {9, 7, 12}
Node 5 neighbors: {9, 8, 1, 10}
Node 6 neighbors: {9, 1, 11, 0}
Node 7 neighbors: {9, 4, 2, 1, 8}
Node 8 neighbors: {5, 9, 7, 2, 10, 11}
Node 9 neighbors: {5, 6, 8, 4, 7, 12}
Node 10 neighbors: {5, 8, 14}
Node 11 neighbors: {6, 2, 8, 3}
Node 12 neighbors: {9, 4, 0, 14, 3, 1}
Node 13 neighbors: {14}
Node 14 neighbors: {12, 13, 10}

From the neighbor sets, we can identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14.

Now we need to calculate the total number of 3-stars. For each of these nodes, we'll apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 1 = 85

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [85].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 6, 11>, <1, 5, 10>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 7, 5>, <1, 7, 12>, <2, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 12, 9>, <5, 9, 10>, <7, 8, 9>, <8, 9, 5>, <8, 9, 7>, <8, 9, 12>, <9, 12, 4>, <9, 12, 1>, <10, 14, 13>, <12, 14, 3>.
