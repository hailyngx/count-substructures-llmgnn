Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 8) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 2) (8, 11) (8, 7) (9, 10) (9, 11) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 2) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 2, 7, 13
- Node 1: 3, 6, 10, 12, 14
- Node 2: 0, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 10, 14
- Node 4: 3, 5, 12, 13
- Node 5: 4, 7, 12, 13
- Node 6: 1, 2, 12, 14
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14
- Node 8: 7, 11
- Node 9: 10, 11
- Node 10: 1, 3, 9, 11, 13
- Node 11: 7, 8, 9, 10
- Node 12: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 13: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10
- Node 14: 1, 3, 6, 7

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 6, 10)>, <1, (3, 12, 14)>, <1, (3, 10, 14)>, <1, (6, 10, 12)>, <1, (6, 10, 14)>, <1, (10, 12, 14)>
  
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  Unique 3-stars: <3, (4, 10, 14)>
  
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  Unique 3-stars: <4, (5, 12, 13)>
  
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  Unique 3-stars: <5, (7, 12, 13)>
  
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  Unique 3-stars: <6, (12, 13, 14)>
  
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  Unique 3-stars: <7, (11, 13, 14)>
  
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  Unique 3-stars: <10, (11, 13, 14)>
  
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  Unique 3-stars: <12, (4, 5, 6)>
  
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  Unique 3-stars: <13, (5, 6, 7)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 80 \).
So, the final answer is [80].
