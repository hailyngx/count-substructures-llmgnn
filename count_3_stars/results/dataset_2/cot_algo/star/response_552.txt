Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 50 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 8)>
- <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4)>
