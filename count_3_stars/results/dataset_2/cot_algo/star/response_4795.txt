Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 5) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 6) (15, 27) (15, 20) (27, 13) (27, 15) (27, 3) (27, 9) (2, 29) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 4) (29, 2) (29, 14) (6, 22) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 27) (9, 12) (9, 14) (23, 25) (23, 1) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 0) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 29) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 10) (20, 15) (20, 1) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 25) (26, 11) (26, 17) (26, 7) (24, 8) (24, 21) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 12) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 26) (16, 17) (16, 18) (17, 26) (17, 16) (17, 25) (17, 3) (17, 28) (25, 23) (25, 19) (25, 17) (25, 10) (12, 2) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 8) (4, 2) (4, 21) (11, 26) (11, 1) (11, 18) (3, 27) (3, 0) (3, 17) (1, 23) (1, 20) (1, 8) (1, 11) (28, 17) (28, 10) (18, 16) (18, 11) (10, 14) (10, 25) (10, 28) (21, 5) (21, 24) (21, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: 23, 20, 8, 11
2: 29, 12, 19, 4
3: 27, 9, 17, 0
4: 2, 21
5: 13, 6, 12, 21, 0
6: 22, 5, 7
7: 6, 26
8: 19, 24, 12, 1
9: 27, 12, 14
10: 14, 25, 28
11: 26, 1, 18
12: 2, 9, 5, 8
13: 22, 5, 27
14: 29, 9, 0, 10
15: 27, 20
16: 17, 18
17: 26, 16, 25, 3, 28
18: 16, 11
19: 2, 8, 25
20: 15, 1
21: 5, 24, 4
22: 13, 6
23: 25, 1
24: 8, 21
25: 23, 19, 17, 10
26: 11, 17, 7
27: 13, 15, 3, 9, 0
28: 17, 10
29: 2, 14

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 21, 25, 27, 28, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
2: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
3: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
5: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
6: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
8: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
9: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
10: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
12: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
13: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
14: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
17: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
19: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
21: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
25: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
27: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
28: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
29: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1] = [59]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [59].
