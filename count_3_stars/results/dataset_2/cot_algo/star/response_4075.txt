Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 2) (15, 25) (15, 5) (27, 15) (12, 22) (12, 8) (0, 20) (0, 9) (0, 22) (0, 2) (20, 0) (20, 22) (20, 6) (1, 26) (1, 8) (1, 7) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 17) (4, 16) (18, 11) (18, 6) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 13) (29, 28) (29, 5) (29, 3) (29, 14) (16, 4) (16, 28) (16, 7) (16, 3) (25, 15) (25, 23) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 10) (14, 26) (14, 29) (14, 11) (14, 24) (14, 10) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 21) (5, 15) (5, 29) (5, 23) (23, 25) (23, 5) (23, 19) (8, 12) (8, 1) (2, 15) (2, 0) (2, 26) (2, 3) (9, 0) (9, 24) (21, 11) (3, 29) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 22) (10, 24) (17, 26) (17, 24) (17, 19) (24, 14) (24, 9) (24, 10) (24, 17) (13, 28) (13, 6) (6, 20) (6, 18) (6, 13) (22, 12) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 10) (19, 23) (19, 17) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {20, 9, 22, 2}
- Node 1: {26, 8, 7}
- Node 2: {15, 26, 3, 0}
- Node 3: {29, 16, 2, 10}
- Node 4: {16}
- Node 5: {15, 29, 23}
- Node 6: {20, 18, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 16, 10}
- Node 8: {12, 1}
- Node 9: {0, 24}
- Node 10: {7, 14, 3, 22, 24}
- Node 11: {18, 14, 21}
- Node 12: {22, 8}
- Node 13: {28, 6}
- Node 14: {26, 29, 11, 24, 10}
- Node 15: {27, 2, 25, 5}
- Node 16: {4, 28, 7, 3}
- Node 17: {26, 19, 24}
- Node 18: {11, 6}
- Node 19: {23, 17}
- Node 20: {0, 22, 6}
- Node 21: {11}
- Node 22: {12, 0, 20, 10}
- Node 23: {25, 5, 19}
- Node 24: {14, 9, 10, 17}
- Node 25: {15, 23}
- Node 26: {1, 2, 17, 14}
- Node 27: {15}
- Node 28: {29, 16, 13}
- Node 29: {28, 5, 3, 14}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 45

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [45].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 26>
- <2, 3, 10>
- <5, 15, 25>
- <10, 14, 24>
- <16, 28, 3>
- <24, 10, 17>
