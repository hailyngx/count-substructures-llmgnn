Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 12) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 7, 13, 12}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 13, 12}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 13}
- Node 4: {7, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 9, 1, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 4, 1, 14, 2}
- Node 7: {4, 12, 0, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {9, 10, 13, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8, 10, 1}
- Node 10: {9, 11, 8, 14}
- Node 11: {7, 10, 14}
- Node 12: {7, 2, 0, 14}
- Node 13: {8, 2, 3, 0}
- Node 14: {7, 6, 10, 11, 12}

Next, we'll identify nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars involving those nodes:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 6: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 10: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 14: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 61

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 7, 12>, <0, 7, 13>, <0, 7, 12>, <0, 7, 13>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 9, 6>, <1, 9, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <6, 4, 9>, <6, 1, 9>, <6, 14, 10>, <6, 14, 11>, <6, 14, 12>, <7, 4, 6>, <7, 4, 14>, <7, 11, 14>, <8, 9, 10>, <8, 9, 13>, <8, 9, 3>, <8, 10, 13>, <8, 10, 3>, <9, 10, 8>, <9, 10, 13>, <9, 10, 3>, <12, 7, 14>, <12, 0, 13>, <13, 3, 0>, <14, 10, 11> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [61].
