Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 10) (27, 15) (27, 22) (27, 1) (27, 13) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 22) (1, 27) (1, 26) (1, 6) (14, 23) (14, 9) (14, 21) (17, 6) (17, 8) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 24) (11, 13) (26, 1) (26, 19) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 16) (20, 15) (20, 29) (20, 23) (20, 28) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 25) (19, 13) (28, 11) (28, 20) (28, 8) (28, 25) (5, 19) (5, 29) (9, 14) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 2) (29, 20) (29, 5) (29, 8) (21, 14) (21, 8) (21, 24) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 22) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (12, 10) (22, 27) (22, 4) (22, 7) (22, 6) (24, 11) (24, 21) (24, 8) (0, 13) (23, 14) (23, 20) (16, 4) (16, 18) (25, 19) (25, 28) (25, 9) (8, 17) (8, 28) (8, 29) (8, 21) (8, 24) (13, 27) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 0) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. 

To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {13}
- Node 1: {6, 27, 26}
- Node 2: {6, 9}
- Node 4: {7, 13, 16, 18, 22}
- Node 5: {19, 29}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 22, 17}
- Node 7: {4, 22}
- Node 8: {21, 24, 28, 29, 17}
- Node 9: {2, 14, 18, 25}
- Node 10: {11, 12, 15}
- Node 11: {10, 13, 24, 28}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 11, 19, 27}
- Node 14: {9, 21, 23}
- Node 15: {10, 20, 27}
- Node 16: {4, 18}
- Node 17: {8, 6}
- Node 18: {9, 4, 16}
- Node 19: {25, 13, 26, 5}
- Node 20: {15, 23, 28, 29}
- Node 21: {14, 24, 8}
- Node 22: {4, 6, 7, 27}
- Node 23: {14, 20}
- Node 24: {11, 21, 8}
- Node 25: {9, 19, 28}
- Node 26: {1, 19}
- Node 27: {1, 15, 22, 13}
- Node 28: {20, 29, 8, 25, 11}
- Node 29: {20, 5, 28, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 10: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 11: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 14: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 15: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 18: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 19: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 20: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 21: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 22: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 24: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 25: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 27: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 28: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 29: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 65

Therefore, the final answer is [65]. 

Some unique 3-stars found in the graph include:
- <1, (6, 26, 27)>
- <4, (7, 16, 22)>
- <6, (1, 2, 17)>
- <8, (21, 24, 29)>
- <9, (2, 14, 25)>
- <10, (11, 12, 15)>
- <13, (0, 4, 27)>
- <14, (9, 21, 23)>
- <15, (10, 20, 27)>
- <18, (4, 16, 18)>
- <19, (5, 13, 26)>
- <20, (15, 23, 28)>
- <21, (8, 14, 24)>
- <22, (4, 6, 7)>
- <24, (8, 11, 21)>
- <25, (9, 19, 28)>
- <27, (1, 13, 22)>
- <28, (8, 20, 29)>
- <29, (5, 8, 20)>
