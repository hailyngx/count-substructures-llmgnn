Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 9) (14, 13) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 9) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 1) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {10, 1, 9}
- Node 1: {8, 13, 0, 10}
- Node 2: {8, 5, 3}
- Node 3: {13, 5, 6, 2, 9}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 5: {8, 6, 2, 12, 11, 3}
- Node 6: {7, 5, 10, 3}
- Node 7: {4, 12, 11, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 13, 2, 5, 1}
- Node 9: {4, 12, 0, 3, 11}
- Node 10: {4, 6, 0, 1}
- Node 11: {7, 5, 9}
- Node 12: {7, 5, 9}
- Node 13: {8, 3, 1, 14}
- Node 14: {13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 64

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [64].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (10, 0, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 2)>
<5, (8, 6, 12)>
<8, (4, 7, 13)>
<9, (4, 12, 0)>
