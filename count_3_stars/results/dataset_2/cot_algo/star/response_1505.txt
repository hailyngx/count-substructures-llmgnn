Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 6) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 1) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {10, 7, 6}
- Node 1: {12, 8, 9, 6, 2, 4}
- Node 2: {12, 5, 1}
- Node 3: {13, 8, 6, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3}
- Node 5: {11, 13, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {11, 12, 0, 1, 3}
- Node 7: {12, 0, 14, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 5, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {10, 11, 13, 1}
- Node 10: {11, 0, 9}
- Node 11: {10, 9, 6, 5, 12}
- Node 12: {11, 7, 2, 14, 6, 1}
- Node 13: {5, 3, 9, 14}
- Node 14: {7, 12, 13}

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 20 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (2, 6, 8)>
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 6, 12)>
- <1, (2, 8, 12)>
- <1, (2, 9, 12)>
- <1, (4, 6, 12)>
- <1, (4, 8, 12)>
- <1, (4, 9, 12)>
- <1, (6, 8, 12)>
- <1, (6, 9, 12)>
- <1, (8, 9, 12)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 12)>
- <2, (4, 8, 12)>
- <2, (4, 9, 12)>
- <2, (6, 8, 12)>
- <2, (6, 9, 12)>
- <2, (8, 9, 12)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <6, (8, 9, 12)>
