Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 15) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 1) (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 1) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 18) (16, 0) (3, 14) (3, 9) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 2) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 9) (19, 11) (19, 17) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 14) (15, 11) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 18) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 18) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 6) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {11, 16, 15, 18}
- Node 1: {11, 12, 13, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 17, 14}
- Node 3: {14, 9}
- Node 4: {8, 2}
- Node 5: {13, 15, 14}
- Node 6: {10, 8, 18}
- Node 7: {12, 14, 13, 17}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 18}
- Node 9: {3, 17, 1}
- Node 10: {6}
- Node 11: {1, 19, 0, 15}
- Node 12: {7, 1}
- Node 13: {5, 7, 1}
- Node 14: {7, 5, 3, 2}
- Node 15: {11, 5, 0, 18}
- Node 16: {0}
- Node 17: {7, 9, 19, 2}
- Node 18: {8, 0, 15, 6}
- Node 19: {11, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each:
- Node 0, 4 3-stars
- Node 1, 4 3-stars
- Node 2, 1 3-star
- Node 5, 3 3-stars
- Node 7, 4 3-stars
- Node 8, 3 3-stars
- Node 11, 4 3-stars
- Node 13, 2 3-stars
- Node 14, 4 3-stars
- Node 15, 4 3-stars
- Node 17, 4 3-stars
- Node 18, 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 11, 15>
- <0, 11, 18>
- <0, 15, 18>
- <1, 11, 15>
- <1, 11, 18>
- <1, 15, 18>
- <1, 11, 0>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <5, 13, 7>
- <5, 13, 1>
- <5, 7, 14>
- <7, 13, 1>
- <7, 13, 5>
- <7, 13, 14>
- <7, 14, 2>
- <8, 4, 6>
- <11, 19, 17>
- <11, 19, 0>
- <11, 19, 17>
- <11, 19, 0>
- <14, 7, 5>
- <14, 7, 3>
