Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 7) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 14) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 5) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {4, 12}
Node 1: {2, 3, 14}
Node 2: {1, 5, 7, 13}
Node 3: {1, 8, 12}
Node 4: {0, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10}
Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 10, 14}
Node 6: {4, 5, 13, 14}
Node 7: {2, 4, 11, 13, 14}
Node 8: {3, 9, 12, 13}
Node 9: {4, 8, 10, 13, 14}
Node 10: {4, 5, 9, 13}
Node 11: {7}
Node 12: {0, 3, 8}
Node 13: {2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Node 14: {1, 5, 6, 7, 9}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
<4, (5, 6, 7)> <4, (5, 6, 9)> <4, (5, 7, 9)> <4, (6, 7, 9)> are 4 such 3-stars.

Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<5, (4, 6, 10)> <5, (4, 9, 10)> <5, (4, 6, 14)> <5, (4, 10, 14)> <5, (6, 9, 14)> are 5 such 3-stars.

Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
<13, (2, 7, 8)> <13, (2, 7, 9)> <13, (2, 7, 10)> <13, (2, 8, 9)> <13, (2, 8, 10)> <13, (2, 9, 10)> <13, (6, 7, 8)> <13, (6, 7, 9)> <13, (6, 7, 10)> <13, (6, 8, 9)> <13, (6, 8, 10)> <13, (6, 9, 10)> <13, (7, 8, 9)> <13, (7, 8, 10)> <13, (7, 9, 10)> <13, (8, 9, 10)> are 16 such 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 5 + 16 = 25. 

The final answer is [25].
