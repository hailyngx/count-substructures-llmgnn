Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 29) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 23) (9, 0) (7, 21) (7, 12) (21, 7) (21, 11) (21, 18) (10, 11) (10, 22) (10, 23) (10, 25) (11, 21) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 25) (2, 26) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 22) (8, 1) (8, 18) (28, 26) (28, 1) (28, 24) (29, 5) (13, 12) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 27) (26, 2) (26, 28) (26, 13) (26, 23) (26, 20) (16, 13) (16, 6) (17, 24) (25, 10) (25, 14) (25, 18) (23, 9) (23, 10) (23, 26) (24, 11) (24, 28) (24, 17) (15, 9) (15, 19) (19, 15) (19, 27) (3, 2) (3, 6) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 28) (1, 4) (20, 26) (20, 22) (4, 5) (4, 1) (22, 10) (22, 8) (22, 20) (22, 27) (27, 13) (27, 19) (27, 22) (27, 18) (18, 21) (18, 8) (18, 25) (18, 27) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 16) (6, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1. Node 0: {9, 14}
2. Node 1: {11, 8, 4, 28}
3. Node 2: {26, 6, 3}
4. Node 3: {2, 6}
5. Node 4: {5, 1}
6. Node 5: {9, 29, 4, 14}
7. Node 6: {12, 2, 16, 3}
8. Node 7: {21, 12}
9. Node 8: {22, 1, 18}
10. Node 9: {5, 15, 23, 0}
11. Node 10: {11, 22, 23, 25}
12. Node 11: {21, 10, 24, 1}
13. Node 12: {7, 13, 6}
14. Node 13: {12, 26, 16, 27}
15. Node 15: {9, 19}
16. Node 16: {13, 6}
17. Node 17: {24}
18. Node 18: {21, 8, 25, 27}
19. Node 19: {15, 27}
20. Node 20: {26, 22}
21. Node 21: {7, 11, 18}
22. Node 22: {10, 8, 20, 27}
23. Node 23: {9, 10, 26}
24. Node 24: {11, 28, 17}
25. Node 25: {10, 14, 18}
26. Node 26: {2, 28, 13, 23, 20}
27. Node 27: {13, 19, 22, 18}
28. Node 28: {26, 1, 24}
29. Node 29: {5}

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 1: <1, (11, 4, 28)>
- Node 5: <5, (9, 29, 14)>
- Node 9: <9, (5, 15, 23)>
- Node 11: <11, (21, 24, 10)>
- Node 12: <12, (7, 13, 6)>
- Node 13: <13, (26, 16, 27)>
- Node 18: <18, (21, 25, 27)>
- Node 22: <22, (10, 20, 27)>
- Node 26: <26, (2, 28, 23)>
- Node 27: <27, (13, 19, 22)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of 9, so the final answer is [9].
