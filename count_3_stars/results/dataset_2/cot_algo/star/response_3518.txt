Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
From the given information, we can construct the following graph:

```
    1 ----- 4 ----- 8 ----- 0
    |       |       |       |
    |       |       |       |
    |       3 ----- 7 ----- 9
    |       |       |
    |       |       |
    |       6 ----- 5
    |
    2
```

Now, let's analyze the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4}
- Node 2: {6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 7}

Now, we'll determine the number of 3-stars:

1. Nodes with 3 neighbors: Node 0, Node 3, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9.
2. Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 neighbors:
    - Node 0: 5 choose 3 = 10
        - <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 7, 9>
    - Node 3: 6 choose 3 = 20
        - <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 7, 9>
    - Node 7: 7 choose 3 = 35
        - <7, 0, 2>, <7, 0, 5>, <7, 0, 6>, <7, 0, 8>, <7, 0, 9>, <7, 2, 5>, <7, 2, 6>, <7, 2, 9>, <7, 5, 6>, <7, 5, 8>, <7, 5, 9>, <7, 6, 8>, <7, 6, 9>, <7, 8, 9>
    - Node 8: 4 choose 3 = 4
        - <8, 0, 3>, <8, 3, 4>, <8, 3, 7>, <8, 4, 7>
    - Node 9: 3 choose 3 = 1
        - <9, 0, 7>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 35 + 4 + 1 = 70

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [70].
