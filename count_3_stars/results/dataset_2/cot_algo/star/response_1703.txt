Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 4) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we can first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 9, 11}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 5, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 6, 13}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 6: {4, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 11}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {0, 10, 11}
- Node 10: {9, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 6, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 5, 6}

We can now identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves: <3, 1, 12>, <3, 1, 13>, <3, 2, 12>, and <3, 2, 13>.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves: <4, 2, 5>, <4, 2, 6>, and <4, 4, 13>.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves: <6, 5, 8> and <6, 5, 14>.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves: <8, 5, 14> and <8, 5, 13>.
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with leaves: <11, 6, 13> and <11, 6, 14>.

The total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is 9. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
