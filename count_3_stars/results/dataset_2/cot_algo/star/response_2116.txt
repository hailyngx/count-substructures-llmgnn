Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 12) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 6) (12, 7) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 13) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

1: {2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 14}
3: {1, 9, 11, 14}
10: {2, 8, 11, 14}
11: {3, 5, 10}
4: {9, 13, 14}
8: {0, 6, 7, 10}
5: {0, 1, 2, 11, 13}
6: {8, 12}
0: {2, 5, 7, 8, 14}
14: {0, 1, 3, 4, 10}
7: {0, 1, 8, 9, 12}
12: {6, 7}
9: {3, 4, 7}

Only node 1 and node 14 have more than 3 neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of.

For node 1:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

For node 14:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

Summing these up:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 5, 13)>
<1, (2, 5, 14)>
<1, (2, 11, 5)>
<1, (2, 11, 13)>
<1,(5, 11, 13)>
<1, (5, 14, 3)>
<1, (11, 3, 14)>
<1, (13, 4, 9)>
<1, (13, 5, 2)>
<1, (13, 5, 11)>
<1, (13, 14, 4)>
<14, (0, 2, 5)>
<14, (0, 2, 13)>
<14, (0, 5, 13)>
<14, (1, 3, 10)>
