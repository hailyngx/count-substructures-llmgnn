Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 2) (11, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 12) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 2, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {9, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {9, 7, 11, 0}
- Node 3: {6, 4, 7, 13, 5}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 0, 3}
- Node 5: {1, 11, 3, 12}
- Node 6: {9, 14, 7, 10, 3}
- Node 7: {6, 4, 3, 2}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 14, 10, 1, 13}
- Node 10: {6, 9, 1, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {2, 5}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 14}
- Node 13: {9, 1, 0, 10, 3}
- Node 14: {6, 9, 10, 12}

Next, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (9, 10, 14)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (6, 10, 13)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (6, 9, 14)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (6, 10, 12)>

Therefore, a total of 4 unique 3-stars are formed in this graph. The final count inside brackets is [4].
