Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 12) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 16) (22, 10) (5, 13) (5, 9) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 1) (17, 9) (17, 14) (18, 22) (18, 21) (18, 1) (18, 8) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 25) (0, 1) (19, 29) (19, 28) (19, 6) (26, 11) (21, 18) (21, 28) (21, 24) (28, 19) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 2) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 9) (11, 26) (11, 3) (11, 20) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 4) (7, 28) (7, 24) (7, 10) (2, 28) (2, 3) (2, 20) (12, 13) (12, 29) (25, 0) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 18) (1, 0) (1, 20) (20, 11) (20, 2) (20, 1) (20, 23) (6, 19) (6, 10) (6, 15) (8, 14) (8, 18) (29, 19) (29, 12) (29, 23) (27, 22) (27, 5) (10, 22) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 24) (24, 21) (24, 7) (24, 10) (23, 20) (23, 29) (23, 4) (4, 16) (4, 23) (15, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 14, 16, 25, 1}
- Node 1: {9, 14, 18, 0, 20}
- Node 2: {3, 20, 28}
- Node 3: {11, 2}
- Node 4: {16, 23}
- Node 5: {9, 27, 13}
- Node 6: {10, 15, 19}
- Node 7: {24, 10, 28}
- Node 8: {14, 18}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 11, 17, 5}
- Node 10: {22, 7, 6, 24}
- Node 11: {9, 20...
- Node 12: {13, 29}
- Node 13: {5, 12}
- Node 14: {9, 17, 18, 0, 8}
- Node 15: {6}
- Node 16: {22, 0, 4}
- Node 17: {9, 14}
- Node 18: {22, 21, 8, 1}
- Node 19: {6, 29}
- Node 20: {2, 1, 11, 23}
- Node 21: {18, 28, 24}
- Node 22: {16, 27, 10, 18}
- Node 23: {20, 4, 29}
- Node 24: {21, 7, 10}
- Node 25: {0}
- Node 26: {11}
- Node 27: {5, 22}
- Node 28: {19, 21, 2, 7}
- Node 29: {19, 23, 12}

Next, we identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors in the list above and count the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0: 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 1: 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 2: 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed
Node 3: 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed
Node 4: 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed
Node 5: 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed
Node 6: 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed
Node 7: 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed
Node 8: 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed
Node 9: 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 10: 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 11: 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 12: 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed
Node 13: 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed
Node 14: 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 15: 1 neighbor, no 3-star formed
Node 16: 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed
Node 17: 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed
Node 18: 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 19: 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed
Node 20: 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 21: 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed
Node 22: 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 23: 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed
Node 24: 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed
Node 25: 1 neighbor, no 3-star formed
Node 26: 1 neighbor, no 3-star formed
Node 27: 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed
Node 28: 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 29: 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46

Therefore, the final answer is [46], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 9, 14>, <0, 1, 9, 18>, <0, 1, 14, 18>, <0, 1, 14, 8>,
<1, 9, 11, 20>, <9, 11, 20, 23>, <9, 11, 20, 2>, 
<10, 22, 16, 0>, <10, 22, 16, 4>, <10, 22, 16, 0>, 
<14, 17, 9, 5>, <18, 22, 16, 0>, <18, 22, 16, 4>, <18, 22, 16, 0>, 
<20, 11, 23, 4>, <28, 21, 24, 10>, <29, 19, 6, 10> it’s all unique that’s only mantle unique ones.
