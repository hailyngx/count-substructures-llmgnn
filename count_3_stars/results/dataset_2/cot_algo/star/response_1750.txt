Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (3, 2) (15, 9) (15, 5) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 0) (4, 13) (8, 11) (8, 18) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 13) (18, 8) (18, 11) (19, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 1) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 11) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 9) (0, 17) (0, 1) (9, 15) (9, 16) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 1) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

Node 0: {1, 17}
Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 11, 13}
Node 2: {3, 6, 11, 12}
Node 3: {2, 16}
Node 4: {13}
Node 5: {1, 6, 15}
Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 10, 13}
Node 7: {10, 12, 14, 19}
Node 8: {11, 18}
Node 9: {15, 16}
Node 10: {6, 7, 14}
Node 11: {1, 2, 8, 14, 18}
Node 12: {2, 7, 13}
Node 13: {1, 4, 6, 12}
Node 14: {7, 10, 11, 17}
Node 15: {5, 9}
Node 16: {3, 9, 17}
Node 17: {0, 14, 16}
Node 18: {8, 11}
Node 19: {7}


Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars centered at node 14 are: <14, (7, 10, 11)>, <14, (7, 10, 17)>, <14, (7, 11, 17)>, <14, (10, 11, 17)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
