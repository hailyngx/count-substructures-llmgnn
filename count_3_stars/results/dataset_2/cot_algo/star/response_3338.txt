Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: (5, 11, 13)
- Node 1: (2, 7, 11)
- Node 2: (1, 4, 11, 13, 14)
- Node 3: (7, 8, 9)
- Node 4: (2, 12, 13, 14)
- Node 5: (0, 6, 7, 12)
- Node 6: (5, 8, 9, 13)
- Node 7: (1, 3, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 8: (3, 6, 7, 10, 13)
- Node 9: (3, 6, 7, 11)
- Node 10: (8, 11)
- Node 11: (1, 9, 10, 12, 13, 0)
- Node 12: (4, 5, 11, 13)
- Node 13: (2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 12, 0)
- Node 14: (2, 4)

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed
- Node 1: 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed
- Node 2: 5 neighbors, can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: 5 neighbors, can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: 5 neighbors, can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 10: 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed
- Node 11: 6 neighbors, can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 12: 4 neighbors, can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: 7 neighbors, can form inom{7}{3} = 35 3-stars
- Node 14: 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 35 = 101

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [101].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, 13, 11>, <2, 13, 0>, <2, 13, 4>, <2, 13, 12>, <2, 11, 0>, <2, 11, 4>, <2, 11, 12>, <2, 0, 4>, <2, 0, 12>, <2, 4, 12>, 
<4, 13, 12>, <4, 13, 11>, <4, 13, 0>, <4, 12, 11>, 
<5, 6, 13>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 13, 8>, <5, 13, 7>, <5, 13, 9>, <5, 8, 7>, <5, 8, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, 
<6, 9, 11>, <6, 9, 7>, <6, 9, 8>, <6, 11, 8>, <7, 9, 11>, <8, 13, 11>, <8, 13, 12>, <8, 13, 6>, <8, 13, 2>, <8, 13, 0>, <8, 13, 4>, <8, 11, 12>, <8, 11, 0>, <8, 11, 2>, <8, 11, 4>, <8, 12, 0>, <8, 12, 2>, <8, 12, 4>, <8, 0, 2>, <8, 0, 4>, <8, 2, 4>, 
<11, 0, 13>, <11, 0, 5>, <11, 0, 12>, <11, 0, 1>, <11, 13, 5>, <11, 13, 12>, <11, 13, 1>, <11, 5, 12>, <11, 5, 1>, <11, 12, 1>, 
<13, 2, 14>, <13, 2, 4>, <13, 2, 12>, <13, 4, 14>, <13, 4, 12>, <13, 12, 14>
