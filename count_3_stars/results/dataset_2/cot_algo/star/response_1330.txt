Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 2) (16, 0) (16, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 19) (1, 12) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 18) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 14) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 13) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 12) (19, 1) (19, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 13) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 15) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 13) (2, 11) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 4) (4, 16) (4, 15) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 19) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 16, 17, 15, 12, 13
- Node 1: 5, 19, 12
- Node 2: 11
- Node 3: 11, 17, 14
- Node 4: 16, 15
- Node 5: 1, 8, 18, 15
- Node 6: 9, 7, 8
- Node 7: 6, 18, 13
- Node 8: 6, 9, 5
- Node 9: 6, 8, 14, 13
- Node 11: 3, 2
- Node 12: 1, 0, 18, 19
- Node 13: 9, 0, 14, 7
- Node 14: 9, 3, 15, 13
- Node 15: 0, 14, 5, 4
- Node 16: 0, 4
- Node 17: 3, 0, 18
- Node 18: 17, 5, 7, 12
- Node 19: 1, 12

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0, 3, 15, and 18 each have 5 neighbors.
- Node 1, 5, 9, 12, and 13 each have 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
- For nodes with 5 neighbors, inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars each, so a total of 4 * 10 = 40 3-stars.
- For nodes with 3 neighbors, each forms only 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 40 + 5 = 45. 

So, the final answer to this problem is [45], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (16, 17, 15)>, <0, (16, 17, 12)>, <0, (16, 15, 12)>, <0, (17, 15, 12)>, <3, (11, 17, 14)>, <5, (1, 8, 18)>, <9, (6, 8, 5)>, <12, (1, 0, 18)>, <13, (9, 0, 14)>
