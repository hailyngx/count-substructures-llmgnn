Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 13) (5, 11) (5, 7) (13, 14) (13, 16) (13, 3) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 18) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 19) (11, 17) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 1) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 19) (1, 12) (4, 6) (4, 15) (4, 17) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 10) (7, 17) (15, 4) (15, 7) (12, 1) (12, 6) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 18) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 16) (16, 13) (16, 10) (18, 14) (18, 3) (18, 6) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 7) 

Response:
Considering the given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 14, 19}
- Node 1: {2, 14, 19, 12}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 13, 18}
- Node 4: {6, 15, 17}
- Node 5: {7, 11}
- Node 6: {4, 10, 12, 18}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 10, 15, 17}
- Node 8: {2, 11}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 16}
- Node 11: {5, 8, 17, 19}
- Node 12: {1, 6}
- Node 13: {3, 14, 16}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 13, 18, 19}
- Node 15: {4, 7}
- Node 16: {10, 13}
- Node 17: {4, 7, 11}
- Node 18: {3, 6, 14}
- Node 19: {0, 1, 11, 14}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors => [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors => [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors => [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors => [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors => [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors => [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors => [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors => [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [43].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 3, 14>, <1, 2, 14>, <1, 2, 19>, <1, 14, 18>, <1, 14, 19>, <2, 7, 11>, <6, 7, 10>, <7, 15, 17>, <11, 17, 4>, <13, 14, 18>, <13, 14, 19>, <14, 0, 19>, <14, 1, 19>, <14, 13, 18>, <16, 10, 13>, <17, 11, 4>.
