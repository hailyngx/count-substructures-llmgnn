Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 13) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 14) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (11, 8) (11, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edge list:

1: 5, 9, 8, 7, 10, 14
2: 12, 14
3: 9, 6, 8, 7, 12, 13
4: 13, 0, 14
5: 12, 1
6: 9, 3
7: 0, 3, 14, 13, 1, 10
8: 11, 3, 1
9: 6, 3, 1
10: 0, 12, 1, 13, 14
11: 8, 0
12: 5, 2, 10, 14, 3
13: 4, 0, 7, 10, 3
14: 4, 2, 7, 10, 12, 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 1: C(6, 3) = 20
Node 3: C(6, 3) = 20
Node 7: C(6, 3) = 20
Node 8: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 9: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 10: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 12: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 13: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 14: C(6, 3) = 20

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 92

Therefore, the final answer is [92], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 9, 8)>
<3, (9, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 14)>
<8, (11, 0, 3)>
<9, (6, 3, 1)>
<10, (0, 12, 13)>
<12, (5, 2, 14)>
<13, (4, 0, 7)>
<14, (4, 2, 7)>
