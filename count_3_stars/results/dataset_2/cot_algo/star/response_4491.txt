Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 4, 8, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 3, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {6, 1, 7, 4, 2}
- Node 4: {6, 3, 2, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 8, 1}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 2, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 3, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {5, 1, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 7}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Total 3-stars: 0

There are no nodes with 3 or more neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [0].
