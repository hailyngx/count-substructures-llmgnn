Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 13) (16, 8) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 16) (13, 14) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 19) (17, 8) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 12) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 1) (1, 17) (1, 18) (1, 15) (3, 14) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 1) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 19) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 5) (14, 13) (14, 3) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 0) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 19) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more readable format:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
- 0: {11, 18, 15, 8, 7, 5, 4, 19}
- 1: {17, 18, 15, 12}
- 2: {9, 5, 4, 19}
- 3: {14}
- 4: {9, 18, 0, 15, 2}
- 5: {2, 0, 12}
- 6: {9}
- 7: {8}
- 8: {16, 17, 0, 7}
- 9: {6, 4, 2}
- 10: {17, 12, 18, 19}
- 11: {0, 18, 15}
- 12: {10, 17, 5}
- 13: {16, 14}
- 14: {13, 3}
- 15: {11, 4, 1}
- 16: {13, 8}
- 17: {8, 10, 1, 12}
- 18: {11, 10, 4, 1}
- 19: {10, 2, 0}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 19: <0, (4, 5, 19)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 18: <4, (0, 2, 18)>

So, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
