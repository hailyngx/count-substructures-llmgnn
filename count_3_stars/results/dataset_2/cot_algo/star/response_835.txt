Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 7) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 8) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 12) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 3) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {5, 8, 10}
- Node 1: {9, 8, 4, 12}
- Node 2: {9, 6, 12, 3}
- Node 3: {10, 8, 4, 2, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 3}
- Node 5: {8, 12, 11, 0, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 14, 10, 2, 11}
- Node 7: {5, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {5, 13, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 1, 12}
- Node 10: {6, 0, 7, 3}
- Node 11: {5, 6, 14, 7}
- Node 12: {5, 9, 13, 7, 2, 1}
- Node 13: {8, 12}
- Node 14: {6, 11, 3}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 14 does not form any 3-star.

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have 9 in total.
Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [9].

Unique 3-stars found are: 
<6, (9, 14, 10)>
<7, (5, 11, 12)>
<9, (6, 2, 12)>
<11, (5, 6, 14)>
<12, (9, 13, 7)>
<1, (9, 8, 4)>
<2, (9, 6, 12)>
<3, (10, 8, 4)>
<5, (8, 12, 11)>
