   - Node 8 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
   - Node 9 forms [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars
   - Node 10 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
   - Node 11 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
   - Node 12 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
   - Node 13 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
   - Node 14 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
   - Node 16 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
   - Node 17 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
   - Node 18 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
   - Node 19 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
   - Node 20 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
   - Node 21 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
   - Node 23 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
   - Node 24 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
   - Node 25 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
   - Node 26 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
   - Node 28 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
   - Node 29 forms [inom{1}{3}] = 0 3-stars

3. Counting the total number of 3-stars:
   Total = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0
   Total = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46]. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, 20, 25>, <1, 7, 27>, <2, 17, 27>, <2, 18, 27>, <2, 17, 18>, <5, 8, 12>, <8, 18, 21>, <10, 20, 26>, <12, 13, 28>, <12, 14, 21>, <12, 16, 25>, <13, 26, 28>, <14, 15, 21>, <16, 19, 25>, <19, 23, 24>
