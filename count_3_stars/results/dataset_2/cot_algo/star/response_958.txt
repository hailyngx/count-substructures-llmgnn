Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by first determining the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 1 neighbors: {0, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2 neighbors: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 3 neighbors: {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4 neighbors: {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6 neighbors: {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 7 neighbors: {2, 8}
- Node 8 neighbors: {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0 and Node 4 have 4 neighbors each, so they each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 8 have 5 neighbors each, so they each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it also forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get:
\[ 4 + 4(0) + 10(5) + 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (4, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 6, 8)>
