Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 10) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 10) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges based on the nodes they connect:

Node 0: {1, 5, 12, 14}
Node 1: {0, 4, 9, 10, 12}
Node 2: {6, 8}
Node 3: {4, 6, 9, 12, 13}
Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 7, 10}
Node 5: {0, 10, 13}
Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 9, 11, 13}
Node 7: {4, 9, 14}
Node 8: {2, 9, 12, 14}
Node 9: {1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 11}
Node 10: {1, 4, 5, 14}
Node 11: {6, 9}
Node 12: {0, 1, 3, 8}
Node 13: {3, 5, 6}
Node 14: {0, 7, 8, 10}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors: (0, 4, 9, 10, 12), so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (4, 6, 9, 12, 13), so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (1, 3, 6, 7, 10), so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 6 has 6 neighbors: (2, 3, 4, 9, 11, 13), so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (2, 9, 12, 14), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 6 neighbors: (1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 11), so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (1, 4, 5, 14), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (0, 1, 3, 8), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (0, 7, 8, 10), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 86
Therefore, the final answer is [86].
