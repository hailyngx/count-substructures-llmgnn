Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 22) (1, 18) (21, 20) (21, 9) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 20) (9, 21) (9, 6) (9, 27) (0, 27) (0, 16) (0, 25) (27, 9) (27, 0) (14, 11) (14, 28) (14, 7) (14, 5) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 2) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 24) (18, 1) (18, 25) (18, 3) (19, 26) (19, 28) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 11) (13, 26) (13, 20) (15, 6) (15, 25) (16, 0) (16, 24) (16, 25) (7, 14) (7, 10) (11, 14) (11, 26) (11, 24) (8, 6) (8, 28) (8, 22) (28, 14) (28, 19) (28, 8) (28, 5) (24, 10) (24, 16) (24, 11) (24, 12) (2, 17) (2, 5) (2, 23) (5, 14) (5, 28) (5, 2) (5, 29) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 12) (3, 22) (20, 21) (20, 6) (20, 13) (20, 23) (12, 24) (12, 3) (12, 25) (12, 22) (23, 2) (23, 20) (23, 29) (29, 5) (29, 23) (25, 0) (25, 18) (25, 15) (25, 16) (25, 12) (22, 1) (22, 8) (22, 3) (22, 12) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {16, 25, 27}
- Node 1: {18, 22}
- Node 2: {5, 17, 23}
- Node 3: {12, 17, 18, 22, 24}
- Node 5: {2, 14, 28, 29}
- Node 6: {8, 9, 15, 20}
- Node 7: {10, 14}
- Node 8: {6, 22, 28}
- Node 9: {6, 21, 27}
- Node 10: {7, 17, 24}
- Node 11: {14, 24, 26}
- Node 12: {3, 22, 24, 25}
- Node 13: {20, 26}
- Node 14: {5, 7, 11, 28}
- Node 15: {6, 25}
- Node 16: {0, 24, 25}
- Node 17: {2, 3, 10}
- Node 18: {1, 3, 25}
- Node 19: {26, 28}
- Node 20: {6, 13, 21, 23}
- Node 21: {9, 20}
- Node 22: {1, 3, 8, 12}
- Node 23: {2, 20, 29}
- Node 24: {3, 10, 11, 12, 16}
- Node 25: {0, 15, 16, 18, 12}
- Node 26: {11, 13, 19}
- Node 27: {0, 9}
- Node 28: {5, 8, 14, 19}
- Node 29: {5, 23}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 3 and Node 22 are connected to four common neighbors: Node 12, Node 18, Node 24, and Node 25. Thus, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 3 as the center and common neighbors as leaves: <3, (12, 18, 24)>, <3, (12, 18, 25)>, <3, (12, 24, 25)>, <3, (18, 24, 25)>.

The total number of 3-stars is 4, so the final answer is [4].
