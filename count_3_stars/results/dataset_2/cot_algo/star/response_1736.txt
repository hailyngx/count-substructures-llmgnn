Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 22) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 27) (18, 28) (18, 8) (0, 20) (0, 23) (20, 0) (20, 1) (20, 21) (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 8) (26, 10) (24, 27) (24, 10) (4, 27) (27, 18) (27, 24) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 7) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 6) (28, 18) (8, 18) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 3) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 8) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 25) (23, 0) (23, 11) (10, 26) (10, 24) (10, 25) (3, 17) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 22) (7, 27) (7, 3) (7, 29) (7, 5) (7, 13) (29, 27) (29, 7) (29, 22) (29, 21) (25, 11) (25, 10) (25, 6) (19, 1) (19, 11) (21, 2) (21, 20) (21, 29) (21, 22) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 15) (6, 16) (6, 25) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 5) (12, 14) (5, 17) (5, 7) (5, 15) (22, 17) (22, 3) (22, 29) (22, 21) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more readable format:

Node: [Neighbors]
0: [20, 23]
1: [20, 19, 8]
2: [18, 16, 21]
3: [17, 8, 7, 22]
4: [27]
5: [17, 7, 15]
6: [16, 25]
7: [27, 3, 29, 5, 13]
8: [18, 1, 9, 15, 3]
9: [18, 16, 8]
10: [26, 24, 25]
11: [23, 19, 13, 25]
12: [14]
13: [11, 7, 15]
14: [17, 12]
15: [8, 13, 5]
16: [2, 9, 6]
17: [14, 3, 5, 22]
18: [2, 9, 27, 28, 8]
19: [1, 11]
20: [0, 1, 21]
21: [2, 20, 29, 22]
22: [17, 3, 29, 21]
23: [0, 11]
24: [27, 10]
25: [11, 10, 6]
26: [10]
27: [18, 24, 4, 29, 7]
28: [18]
29: [27, 7, 22, 21]

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: <3, (17, 8, 7)>
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: <7, (27, 3, 29)>, <7, (17, 5, 13)>, <7, (3, 29, 5)>, <7, (27, 29, 22)>
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: <8, (18, 1, 9)>, <8, (18, 15, 3)>, <8, (1, 9, 15)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: <9, (18, 16, 8)>
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: <11, (23, 19, 13)>, <11, (23, 10, 25)>
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: <13, (11, 7, 15)>
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: <15, (8, 13, 5)>
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: <17, (14, 3, 5)>
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors: <18, (2, 9, 16)>
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors: <21, (2, 20, 29)>
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: <22, (17, 3, 29)>, <22, (21, 29, 17)>
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: <25, (11, 10, 6)>
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors: <27, (18, 24, 4)>, <27, (18, 29, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: [18]
