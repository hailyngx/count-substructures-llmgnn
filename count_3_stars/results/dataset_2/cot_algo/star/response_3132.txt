Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 26) (16, 5) (15, 27) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 29) (15, 4) (27, 15) (27, 7) (27, 19) (3, 15) (3, 25) (3, 18) (25, 3) (25, 18) (18, 3) (18, 25) (18, 22) (18, 0) (22, 18) (22, 9) (22, 24) (22, 8) (28, 9) (28, 13) (28, 20) (29, 15) (29, 1) (29, 5) (2, 0) (8, 22) (8, 9) (8, 12) (0, 18) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 0) (14, 1) (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 8) (9, 17) (6, 21) (21, 6) (21, 26) (21, 17) (7, 27) (7, 24) (7, 19) (7, 26) (26, 16) (26, 21) (26, 7) (26, 12) (1, 29) (1, 14) (1, 12) (10, 0) (10, 23) (10, 20) (24, 22) (24, 7) (24, 17) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 29) (23, 10) (23, 13) (23, 12) (12, 8) (12, 26) (12, 1) (12, 23) (20, 28) (20, 10) (20, 13) (4, 15) (4, 13) (19, 27) (19, 7) (17, 9) (17, 21) (17, 24) (13, 28) (13, 23) (13, 20) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

1: {29, 14}
2: {0}
3: {15, 25, 18}
4: {15, 13}
5: {15, 29, 16}
6: {21}
7: {27, 24, 26}
8: {22, 12, 9}
9: {22, 28, 17, 8}
10: {0, 20, 23}
11: {16}
12: {8, 26, 1, 23}
13: {28, 23, 20, 4}
14: {0, 1}
15: {3, 5, 4, 27, 29}
16: {11, 5, 26}
17: {9, 21, 24}
18: {3, 25, 0, 22}
19: {27, 7}
20: {28, 10, 13}
21: {6, 17, 26}
22: {18, 0, 8, 24}
23: {10, 13, 12}
24: {17, 7, 22}
25: {3, 18}
26: {16, 21, 7, 12}
27: {15, 7, 19}
28: {9, 13, 20}
29: {15, 1, 5}

Next, let's identify the nodes that could form a 3-star:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars for each node gives us a total of 50 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (15, 25, 18)>
<3, (15, 27, 4)>
<3, (15, 27, 5)>
<3, (25, 18, 0)>
<3, (25, 18, 22)>
<5, (15, 29, 16)>
<7, (27, 24, 17)>
<9, (22, 28, 13)>
<12, (8, 26, 1)>
<13, (28, 20, 4)>
<15, (3, 5, 29)>
<18, (3, 25, 0)>
<22, (18, 0, 22)>
<26, (16, 21, 7)>
<29, (1, 5, 15)>
