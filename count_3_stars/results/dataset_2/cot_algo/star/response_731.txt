Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 11) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {10, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {4, 13}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 10}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 10, 13, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 12}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {3, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 9: {5, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 11: {0, 8, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 5, 8, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 6, 11, 13}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with central node 0 and leaves (10, 11, 14) <0, (10, 11, 14)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with central node 3 and leaves (2, 6, 10) <3, (2, 6, 10)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with central node 4 and leaves (1, 5, 12) <4, (1, 5, 12)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with central node 5 and leaves (4, 9, 13) <5, (4, 9, 13)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with central node 6 and leaves (0, 3, 10) <6, (0, 3, 10)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with central node 8 and leaves (7, 10, 13) <8, (7, 10, 13)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with central node 9 and leaves (5, 10, 11) <9, (5, 10, 11)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with central node 10 and leaves (0, 3, 6) <10, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with central node 11 and leaves (0, 9, 14) <11, (0, 9, 14)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with central node 12 and leaves (0, 4, 9) <12, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with central node 13 and leaves (1, 8, 14) <13, (1, 8, 14)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
