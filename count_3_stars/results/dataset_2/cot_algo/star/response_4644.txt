Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 14) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 3) (1, 15) (1, 12) (1, 27) (21, 2) (21, 17) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 3) (19, 29) (19, 28) (26, 24) (26, 28) (26, 0) (26, 12) (24, 4) (24, 8) (24, 26) (24, 14) (24, 5) (28, 19) (28, 26) (15, 1) (15, 4) (15, 17) (0, 22) (0, 26) (0, 5) (16, 18) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 18) (2, 21) (2, 11) (2, 6) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 26) (12, 20) (14, 22) (14, 11) (14, 24) (17, 21) (17, 8) (17, 15) (7, 11) (7, 9) (5, 24) (5, 0) (5, 23) (5, 29) (23, 13) (23, 5) (23, 9) (20, 22) (20, 12) (29, 19) (29, 5) (3, 13) (3, 22) (3, 10) (3, 8) (27, 1) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 23) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {22, 26, 5}
- Node 1: {15, 12, 27}
- Node 2: {21, 11, 6}
- Node 3: {13, 22, 10, 8}
- Node 4: {8, 24, 15}
- Node 5: {24, 0, 23, 29}
- Node 6: {8, 2, 18}
- Node 7: {11, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 24, 17, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {10, 7, 23}
- Node 10: {13, 3, 12, 9}
- Node 11: {14, 7, 18, 2}
- Node 12: {1, 10, 26, 20}
- Node 13: {22, 3, 10, 23}
- Node 14: {22, 11, 24}
- Node 15: {1, 4, 17}
- Node 16: {18}
- Node 17: {21, 8, 15}
- Node 18: {11, 16, 6}
- Node 19: {29, 28}
- Node 20: {22, 12}
- Node 21: {2, 17}
- Node 22: {13, 14, 0, 20, 3}
- Node 23: {13, 5, 9}
- Node 24: {4, 8, 26, 14, 5}
- Node 26: {24, 28, 0, 12}
- Node 27: {1}
- Node 28: {19, 26}
- Node 29: {19, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 10: [1]
- Node 11: [1]
- Node 12: [1]
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 14: [1]
- Node 15: [1]
- Node 17: [1]
- Node 18: [1]
- Node 21: [1]
- Node 22: [1]
- Node 23: [1]
- Node 24: [1]
- Node 26: [1]
- Node 28: [1]
- Node 29: [1]

In this case, there is a total of [18] 3-stars formed in the graph:
<0, 22, 5>, <3, 13, 10>, <5, 24, 23>, <8, 4, 17>, <9, 10, 23>, <10, 12, 26>, <11, 14, 18>, <12, 1, 20>, <13, 22, 3>, <14, 11, 24>, <15, 1, 17>, <17, 21, 8>, <18, 11, 6>, <21, 2, 17>, <22, 13, 3>, <23, 13, 9>, <24, 14, 5>, <26, 12, 28>
