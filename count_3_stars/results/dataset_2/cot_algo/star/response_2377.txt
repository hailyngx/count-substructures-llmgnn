Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (11, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 10) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 12, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 6, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 8, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 4, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 12}
- Node 11: Neighbors {9}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 5, 12}

Now, we apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 88 3-stars in the graph, which can be represented as [88].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (4, 5, 13)>
- <2, (4, 6, 13)>
- <2, (4, 10, 13)>
- <2, (5, 6, 13)>
- <2, (5, 10, 13)>
- <2, (6, 10, 13)>
- <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (5, 6, 12)>
- <4, (5, 8, 12)>
- <4, (6, 8, 12)>
- <4, (5, 9, 12)>
- <4, (9, 12, 13)>
- <5, (6, 12, 14)>
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- <6, (4, 8, 12)>
- <6, (5, 8, 12)>
- <6, (4, 12, 13)>
- <6, (5, 12, 13)>
- <6, (8, 12, 13)>
- <8, (0, 6, 7)>
- <12, (5, 13, 14)>
