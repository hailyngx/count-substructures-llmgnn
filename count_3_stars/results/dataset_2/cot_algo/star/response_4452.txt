Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (1, 17) (1, 8) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 6) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 18) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 3) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 12) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (15, 19) (15, 0) (6, 10) (6, 17) (6, 2) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 2) (4, 9) (4, 16) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 5) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 4) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 12) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {12, 15}
- Node 1: {8, 17}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 14}
- Node 3: {8, 9}
- Node 4: {9, 16}
- Node 5: {11, 12, 18}
- Node 6: {2, 10, 17}
- Node 7: {2, 10, 11, 19}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 14, 18}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 16}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 11}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 10}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 13, 18}
- Node 13: {12, 16, 17}
- Node 14: {2, 8, 19}
- Node 15: {0, 19}
- Node 16: {4, 9, 13}
- Node 17: {1, 6, 13}
- Node 18: {5, 8, 12, 19}
- Node 19: {7, 14, 15, 18}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {6, 7, 14}
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {2, 10, 17}
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {2, 10, 11, 19}
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 14, 18}
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: {0, 5, 13, 18}
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: {12, 16, 17}
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: {2, 8, 19}
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: {5, 8, 12, 19}
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: {7, 14, 15, 18}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 3 3-stars
- Node 8: 3 3-stars
- Node 12: 3 3-stars
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 3 3-stars
- Node 19: 3 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 19, so the final answer is [19].

Unique 3-stars found are: 
- <2, 6, 17>
- <7, 10, 19>
- <7, 11, 19>
- <7, 14, 19>
- <8, 12, 18>
- <8, 12, 5>
- <8, 13, 18>
- <13, 16, 17>
- <18, 14, 19>
- <18, 15, 19>
