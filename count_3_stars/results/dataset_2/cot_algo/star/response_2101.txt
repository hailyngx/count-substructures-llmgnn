Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 0, 4, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 1, 0, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 1, 3, 6, 0, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 7, 4, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9, 1, 6, 2, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 6, 0, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8, 3, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 = 30
Therefore, the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <7, (1, 2, 9)>
