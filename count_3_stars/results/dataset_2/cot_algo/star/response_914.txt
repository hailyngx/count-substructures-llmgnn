Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 14) (13, 0) (22, 19) (22, 6) (22, 10) (22, 3) (9, 26) (9, 25) (9, 20) (9, 1) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 10) (26, 2) (26, 3) (14, 13) (14, 17) (17, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (2, 26) (2, 29) (2, 20) (29, 2) (29, 3) (8, 28) (8, 1) (8, 7) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 20) (1, 25) (4, 16) (4, 20) (27, 11) (5, 13) (5, 23) (5, 21) (15, 23) (16, 4) (16, 21) (16, 7) (11, 27) (11, 23) (11, 21) (23, 5) (23, 15) (23, 11) (12, 24) (12, 0) (12, 19) (21, 5) (21, 16) (21, 11) (21, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 19) (19, 22) (19, 12) (19, 7) (19, 25) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 10) (10, 22) (10, 26) (10, 28) (3, 22) (3, 26) (3, 29) (6, 22) (6, 17) (24, 12) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 18) (20, 9) (20, 2) (20, 1) (20, 4) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 21) (0, 28) (18, 25) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {13, 12, 21, 28}
- Node 1: {9, 8, 20, 25}
- Node 2: {26, 29, 20}
- Node 3: {22, 26, 29}
- Node 4: {16, 20}
- Node 5: {13, 23, 21}
- Node 6: {22, 17}
- Node 7: {9, 8, 16, 19}
- Node 8: {28, 1, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 7, 26, 25, 20}
- Node 10: {22, 26, 28}
- Node 11: {27, 23, 21}
- Node 12: {0, 24, 19}
- Node 13: {5, 17, 14, 0}
- Node 14: {13, 17}
- Node 15: {23}
- Node 16: {4, 21, 7}
- Node 17: {13, 14, 6}
- Node 18: {25}
- Node 19: {22, 12, 7, 25}
- Node 20: {9, 2, 1, 4}
- Node 21: {5, 16, 11, 0}
- Node 22: {19, 6, 10, 3}
- Node 23: {5, 15, 11}
- Node 24: {12}
- Node 25: {9, 1, 19, 18}
- Node 26: {9, 10, 2, 3}
- Node 27: {11}
- Node 28: {8, 0, 10}
- Node 29: {2, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, forming 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 56

Therefore, the final answer is [56] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, 12, 21, 28>, <1, 9, 20, 25>, <7, 8, 16, 19>, <13, 0, 12, 14>, <19, 7, 22, 25>, <20, 1, 4, 9>, <21, 0, 11, 16>, <22, 6, 10, 19>, <25, 18, 19, 9>, <26, 2, 3, 9>
