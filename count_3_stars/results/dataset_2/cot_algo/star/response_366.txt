Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 9, 0}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {7, 1, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {7, 0, 5, 6, 2}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 6, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {1, 0}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 6)>
