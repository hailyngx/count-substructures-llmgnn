Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 17) (7, 29) (7, 27) (7, 1) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 26) (27, 7) (27, 2) (27, 9) (27, 26) (8, 4) (8, 28) (6, 28) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 20) (6, 13) (28, 8) (28, 6) (28, 3) (28, 18) (28, 20) (9, 27) (9, 11) (22, 11) (1, 4) (1, 7) (17, 4) (17, 19) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 10) (11, 9) (11, 22) (11, 18) (23, 21) (23, 29) (14, 26) (14, 20) (14, 2) (14, 10) (26, 0) (26, 27) (26, 14) (26, 15) (3, 6) (3, 28) (29, 7) (29, 23) (15, 26) (15, 16) (21, 0) (21, 23) (21, 18) (21, 25) (12, 0) (12, 18) (13, 6) (13, 24) (13, 10) (10, 19) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 25) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 25) (16, 20) (20, 6) (20, 28) (20, 14) (20, 16) (25, 21) (25, 10) (25, 16) (24, 13) (18, 28) (18, 11) (18, 21) (18, 12) (2, 27) (2, 6) (2, 14) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {21, 12, 26}
Node 1: {4, 7}
Node 2: {27, 6, 14}
Node 3: {6, 28}
Node 4: {8, 5, 17, 1}
Node 5: {4, 19, 16}
Node 6: {28, 3, 2, 20, 13}
Node 7: {29, 27, 1}
Node 8: {4, 28}
Node 9: {27, 11}
Node 10: {19, 14, 13, 25}
Node 11: {9, 22, 18}
Node 12: {0, 18}
Node 13: {6, 24, 10}
Node 14: {26, 20, 2, 10}
Node 15: {26, 16}
Node 16: {5, 15, 25, 20}
Node 17: {4, 19}
Node 18: {28, 11, 21, 12}
Node 19: {17, 5, 10}
Node 20: {6, 28, 14, 16}
Node 21: {0, 23, 18, 25}
Node 22: {11}
Node 23: {21, 29}
Node 24: {13}
Node 25: {10, 16, 21}
Node 26: {0, 27, 14, 15}
Node 27: {7, 2, 9, 26}
Node 28: {8, 6, 3, 18, 20}
Node 29: {7, 23}

Next, we identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 4, Node 6, and Node 28 have three neighbors each and can form a 3-star. (3 total)
- Node 10 has four neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. (4 total)
- Node 16 and Node 25 both have four neighbors, so each can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. (2 total)
- Node 18 has four neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. (1 total)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 10, so the final answer is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, 1, 7>
<6, 3, 28>
<28, 6, 20>
<10, 13, 14>
<16, 20, 25>
<25, 10, 21>
<4, 5, 17>
<4, 8, 28>
<4, 17, 19>
<18, 11, 28>
