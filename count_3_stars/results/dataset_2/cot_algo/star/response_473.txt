Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 26) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 2) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 19) (0, 9) (7, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (21, 27) (21, 0) (21, 4) (20, 29) (20, 8) (20, 2) (20, 10) (29, 20) (29, 22) (29, 14) (13, 17) (13, 25) (13, 23) (11, 25) (23, 13) (23, 26) (23, 2) (23, 10) (6, 26) (6, 8) (16, 18) (16, 19) (26, 15) (26, 23) (26, 6) (14, 29) (14, 22) (14, 24) (22, 29) (22, 14) (22, 5) (2, 27) (2, 17) (2, 20) (2, 23) (12, 17) (12, 9) (4, 21) (4, 9) (4, 28) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 4) (25, 13) (25, 11) (25, 8) (25, 24) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 24) (28, 4) (28, 19) (28, 5) (8, 17) (8, 3) (8, 20) (8, 6) (8, 25) (10, 20) (10, 23) (10, 18) (5, 22) (5, 28) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 28) (19, 24) (24, 14) (24, 25) (24, 18) (24, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {7, 21, 19, 9}
- Node 1: {17}
- Node 2: {27, 17, 20, 23}
- Node 3: {9, 8}
- Node 4: {21, 9, 28}
- Node 5: {22, 28}
- Node 6: {26, 8}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {17, 3, 20, 6, 25}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 12, 4}
- Node 10: {20, 23, 18}
- Node 11: {25}
- Node 12: {17, 9}
- Node 13: {17, 25, 23}
- Node 14: {29, 22, 24}
- Node 15: {27, 26}
- Node 16: {18, 19}
- Node 17: {1, 13, 12, 8, 2}
- Node 18: {16, 10, 24}
- Node 19: {0, 28, 16, 24}
- Node 20: {29, 8, 2, 10}
- Node 21: {27, 0, 4}
- Node 22: {29, 14, 5}
- Node 23: {13, 26, 2, 10}
- Node 24: {14, 25, 18, 19}
- Node 25: {13, 11, 8, 24}
- Node 26: {15, 23, 6}
- Node 27: {15, 21, 2}
- Node 28: {4, 5, 19}
- Node 29: {20, 22, 14}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 17: 5 neighbors
- Node 20: 4 neighbors
- Node 23: 4 neighbors
- Node 24: 4 neighbors
- Node 25: 4 neighbors

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, 17, 20>
- <2, 17, 23>
- <2, 17, 25>
- <2, 20, 23>
- <2, 20, 25>
- <2, 23, 25>
- <8, 17, 20>
- <8, 17, 23>
- <8, 17, 25>
- <8, 20, 23>
- <8, 20, 25>
- <8, 23, 25>
