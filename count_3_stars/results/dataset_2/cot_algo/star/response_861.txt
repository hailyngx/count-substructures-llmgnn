Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 0) (15, 23) (15, 21) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 3) (1, 3) (1, 7) (21, 15) (21, 18) (11, 16) (11, 18) (16, 22) (16, 11) (16, 24) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 25) (3, 13) (3, 27) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 23) (17, 29) (17, 0) (17, 5) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 28) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 28) (29, 17) (29, 7) (29, 9) (6, 28) (28, 7) (28, 12) (28, 6) (28, 5) (4, 27) (4, 3) (4, 2) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 24) (18, 21) (18, 11) (18, 26) (18, 20) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 0) (9, 10) (9, 29) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 28) (5, 26) (19, 22) (19, 14) (19, 24) (24, 16) (24, 25) (24, 19) (20, 12) (20, 18) (20, 2) (2, 4) (2, 20) (23, 15) (23, 10) (0, 22) (0, 17) (0, 25) (0, 26) (14, 13) (14, 27) (14, 19) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For each node, we will identify its neighbors:

- Node 0: {17, 22, 25, 26}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 20}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 13, 27, 10}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 27}
- Node 5: {8, 17, 26, 28}
- Node 6: {28}
- Node 7: {1, 12, 28, 29}
- Node 8: {5, 13, 25}
- Node 9: {10, 29}
- Node 10: {3, 9, 23}
- Node 11: {16, 18}
- Node 12: {7, 20, 28}
- Node 13: {3, 8, 14, 22}
- Node 14: {13, 19, 27}
- Node 15: {21, 23}
- Node 16: {11, 22, 24}
- Node 17: {0, 5, 29}
- Node 18: {11, 21, 20, 26}
- Node 19: {14, 22, 24}
- Node 20: {2, 12, 18}
- Node 21: {15, 18}
- Node 22: {13, 16, 19, 0}
- Node 23: {15, 10}
- Node 24: {16, 19, 25}
- Node 25: {0, 8, 24}
- Node 26: {5, 18, 0}
- Node 27: {3, 14, 4}
- Node 28: {6, 7, 12, 5}
- Node 29: {17, 7, 9}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 18: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 26: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 29: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (17, 25, 26)>, <5, (8, 17, 28)>, <7, (1, 12, 29)>, <12, (7, 20, 28)>, <18, (11, 21, 20)>, <26, (5, 18, 0)>, <29, (17, 7, 9)>.
