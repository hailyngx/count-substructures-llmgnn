Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 38

Therefore, the final answer is [38], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
