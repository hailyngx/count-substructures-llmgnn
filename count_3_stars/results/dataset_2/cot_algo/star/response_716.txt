Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 1) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 10) (15, 19) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 14) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 5) (11, 2) (11, 6) (11, 0) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 3) (14, 19) (14, 6) (14, 16) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 3) (13, 1) (16, 10) (16, 14) (0, 11) (0, 5) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we need to first determine the set of neighbors for each node:

1. Node 0: {5, 11}
2. Node 1: {6, 8, 13}
3. Node 2: {4, 8, 11, 12}
4. Node 3: {5, 6, 9, 12}
5. Node 4: {2, 7, 9, 17}
6. Node 5: {0, 3, 17}
7. Node 6: {1, 3, 11, 14}
8. Node 7: {4, 9, 10, 12, 19}
9. Node 8: {1, 2}
10. Node 9: {3, 4, 7, 17}
11. Node 10: {7, 10, 15, 19, 16}
12. Node 11: {0, 2, 6}
13. Node 12: {2, 3, 7}
14. Node 14: {6, 16, 19}
15. Node 15: {10, 19}
16. Node 16: {10, 14}
17. Node 17: {4, 5, 9}
18. Node 19: {7, 10, 14, 15}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 7: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - <7, (4, 9, 12)>, <7, (4, 9, 17)>, <7, (4, 12, 17)>, <7, (9, 12, 17)>, <7, (4, 9, 10)>, <7, (4, 10, 12)>, <7, (9, 10, 12)>, <7, (4, 10, 19)>, <7, (10, 15, 19)>, <7, (10, 16, 19)>.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
