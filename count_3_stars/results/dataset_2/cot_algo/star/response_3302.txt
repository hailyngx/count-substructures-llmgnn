Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 0) (4, 5) (7, 16) (7, 1) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 14) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 14) (18, 15) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 12) (17, 5) (17, 15) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 6) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 19) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 9) (3, 19) (3, 6) (3, 9) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 6) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 8, 16, 6
- Node 1: 11, 7, 9, 12
- Node 2: 9, 10, 14
- Node 3: 19, 6, 9
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 4, 17, 19, 10
- Node 6: 0, 19, 3, 14
- Node 7: 16, 1
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 2, 1, 12, 15, 3
- Node 10: 2, 5, 19
- Node 11: 16, 1, 15
- Node 12: 13, 1, 9
- Node 13: 12, 14
- Node 14: 2, 18, 13, 6
- Node 15: 11, 18, 17, 9
- Node 16: 11, 7, 0
- Node 17: 5, 15
- Node 18: 14, 15
- Node 19: 5, 10, 3, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to potentially form a 3-star:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 4 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 2 neighbors
- Node 18: 2 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors

We can now count the number of unique 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [1 3-star]
- Node 1: [1 3-star]
- Node 2: [1 3-star]
- Node 3: [1 3-star]
- Node 5: [1 3-star]
- Node 6: [1 3-star]
- Node 9: [1 3-star]
- Node 10: [1 3-star]
- Node 11: [1 3-star]
- Node 12: [1 3-star]
- Node 14: [1 3-star]
- Node 15: [1 3-star]
- Node 19: [1 3-star]

Summing up these individual 3-stars gives a total of [12]. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, 16, 6>
- <1, 11, 15>
- <2, 9, 14>
- <3, 19, 6>
- <5, 17, 19>
- <6, 19, 3>
- <9, 1, 12>
- <10, 2, 19>
- <11, 16, 1>
- <12, 13, 1>
- <14, 2, 18>
- <15, 11, 17>
