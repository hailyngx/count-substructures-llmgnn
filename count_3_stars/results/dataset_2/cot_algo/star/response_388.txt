Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 2) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 4) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 1) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 5) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 5) (13, 17) (13, 1) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (19, 14) (19, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 6) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 3) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 0) (5, 12) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 6) (14, 4) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 4) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges provided, let's first construct the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {5, 6}
- Node 1 neighbors: {4, 13, 18}
- Node 2 neighbors: {4, 7, 11}
- Node 3 neighbors: {6, 7, 9, 16}
- Node 4 neighbors: {1, 2, 14, 16, 17}
- Node 5 neighbors: {0, 12, 15, 16}
- Node 6 neighbors: {0, 3, 12, 14}
- Node 7 neighbors: {2, 3, 18}
- Node 9 neighbors: {3, 11, 14}
- Node 10 neighbors: {11, 17}
- Node 11 neighbors: {2, 9, 10}
- Node 12 neighbors: {5, 6, 19}
- Node 13 neighbors: {1, 17}
- Node 14 neighbors: {4, 6, 9, 19}
- Node 15 neighbors: {5, 17, 18}
- Node 16 neighbors: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 17 neighbors: {10, 13, 15, 4}
- Node 18 neighbors: {1, 7, 15}
- Node 19 neighbors: {12, 14}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 13, 18)>
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: 
    <4, (1, 16, 17)>, <4, (1, 14, 16)>, <4, (1, 14, 17)>, <4, (13, 16, 17)>, <4, (13, 14, 16)>, <4, (1, 14, 17)>, <4, (1, 13, 14)>, <4, (1, 13, 17)>, <4, (1, 16, 16)>, <4, (13, 16, 17)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: 
    <5, (0, 12, 15)>, <5, (12, 15, 16)>, <5, (0, 15, 16)>, <5, (0, 12, 16)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: 
    <6, (0, 12, 14)>, <6, (3, 6, 14)>, <6, (3, 6, 12)>, <6, (3, 12, 14)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <7, (2, 3, 18)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <9, (3, 11, 14)>
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors and does not form a 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <11, (2, 9, 10)>
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors and does not form a 3-star.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors and does not form a 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: 
    <14, (4, 6, 9)>, <14, (4, 6, 19)>, <14, (4, 9, 19)>, <14, (6, 9, 19)>
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <15, (5, 17, 18)>
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <16, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: 
    <17, (4, 15, 18)>, <17, (4, 15, 16)>, <17, (4, 5, 15)>, <17, (4, 5, 16)>
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <18, (1, 7, 15)>
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors and does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, a total of [25] unique 3-stars are present in the given graph.
