Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 11) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 14) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 2) (2, 3) (2, 1) (10, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first determine the neighbors for each node, then identify the 3-stars present in the graph.

1. Node 0: Neighbors {9, 7, 14, 8} - has 4 neighbors
2. Node 1: Neighbors {6, 14, 2} - has 3 neighbors
3. Node 2: Neighbors {3, 1} - has 2 neighbors
4. Node 3: Neighbors {4, 14, 11, 2} - has 4 neighbors
5. Node 4: Neighbors {9, 7, 12, 13, 3, 11} - has 6 neighbors
6. Node 5: Neighbors {9, 13, 8, 7} - has 4 neighbors
7. Node 6: Neighbors {9, 1, 14, 10, 12, 13} - has 6 neighbors
8. Node 7: Neighbors {5, 4, 0, 8} - has 4 neighbors
9. Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9, 7, 0, 11} - has 5 neighbors
10. Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 8, 4, 0, 12} - has 6 neighbors
11. Node 10: Neighbor {6} - has 1 neighbor
12. Node 11: Neighbors {4, 3, 8} - has 3 neighbors
13. Node 12: Neighbors {9, 6, 4, 14} - has 4 neighbors
14. Node 13: Neighbors {5, 6, 4} - has 3 neighbors
15. Node 14: Neighbors {6, 0, 3, 1, 12} - has 5 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14

\( \text{Total 3-stars} = \sum \limits_{i}^{n} \binom{deg(v_i)}{3} \)

\( \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 15 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 11, 14)>, <4, (9, 12, 13)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (9, 12, 13)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 12)>, <12, (4, 6, 14)>, <14, (3, 6, 12)>
