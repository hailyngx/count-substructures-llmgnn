Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 21) (11, 17) (16, 29) (10, 11) (10, 27) (10, 13) (10, 9) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 3) (20, 22) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 9) (25, 19) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 7) (23, 24) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (12, 2) (12, 21) (21, 11) (21, 12) (21, 28) (28, 20) (28, 21) (28, 3) (28, 19) (28, 15) (4, 9) (4, 13) (27, 10) (27, 29) (27, 13) (1, 20) (1, 9) (15, 28) (15, 22) (3, 20) (3, 7) (3, 28) (3, 0) (26, 29) (9, 10) (9, 25) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 1) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 5) (14, 22) (14, 19) (14, 13) (22, 20) (22, 15) (22, 14) (22, 17) (17, 11) (17, 8) (17, 22) (29, 16) (29, 27) (29, 26) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (24, 23) (24, 0) (19, 25) (19, 2) (19, 28) (19, 14) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 27) (13, 14) (6, 18) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 24}
- Node 1: {9, 20}
- Node 2: {7, 9, 12, 18, 19}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 20, 28}
- Node 4: {9, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {18}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 17}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 18, 19, 25}
- Node 10: {9, 11, 13, 27}
- Node 11: {10, 17, 21}
- Node 12: {2, 21}
- Node 13: {4, 10, 14, 27}
- Node 14: {13, 19, 22}
- Node 15: {22, 28}
- Node 16: {29}
- Node 17: {8, 11, 22}
- Node 18: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 19: {2, 9, 14, 19, 25, 28}
- Node 20: {1, 3, 22, 25, 28}
- Node 21: {11, 12, 28}
- Node 22: {14, 15, 17, 20}
- Node 23: {24}
- Node 24: {0, 23}
- Node 25: {1, 9, 19, 20}
- Node 26: {29}
- Node 27: {10, 13, 29}
- Node 28: {3, 15, 19, 20, 21}
- Node 29: {16, 26, 27}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 9, 19, and 28 each have 5 neighbors, so they each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 and 13 each have 4 neighbors, so they each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 39 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [39].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <9, (1, 19, 25)>
- <19, (2, 14, 25)>
- <28, (3, 15, 20)>
- <10, (9, 13, 27)>
- <13, (4, 14, 27)>
- <2, (7, 9, 18)>
- <17, (8, 11, 22)>
