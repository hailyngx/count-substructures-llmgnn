Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 2
Node 1: 9, 6, 3, 2, 4
Node 2: 9, 1, 7, 8, 0
Node 3: 9, 1, 8
Node 4: 5, 6, 1, 8, 0
Node 5: 9, 8, 4, 7
Node 6: 9, 1, 8, 4
Node 7: 5, 2
Node 8: 5, 6, 3, 4, 2
Node 9: 5, 6, 2, 3, 1

Now, let's analyze the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

Node 1: \( C(5,3) = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( C(5,3) = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( C(5,3) = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( C(4,3) = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( C(4,3) = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( C(5,3) = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( C(5,3) = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up:

10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (9, 6, 3)>
<2, (9, 1, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (9, 8, 7)>
<6, (9, 1, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
