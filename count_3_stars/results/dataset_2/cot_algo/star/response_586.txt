Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 10) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 5) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 18) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 3) (19, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 17) (5, 2) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 18) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 3) (15, 7) (15, 13) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 3) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 6) (13, 1) (13, 15) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 6) (6, 16) (6, 19) (6, 12) (6, 18) 

Response:
Calculating the total number of 3-stars in the given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges:

1. For node 0: Neighbors - 2, 3, 17, 18. Possible 3-stars = 4C3 = 4.
2. For node 1: Neighbors - 12, 13. Possible 3-stars = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors).
3. For node 2: Neighbors - 0, 5, 10, 11. Possible 3-stars = 4C3 = 4.
4. For node 3: Neighbors - 0, 9, 14, 17, 19. Possible 3-stars = 5C3 = 10.
5. For node 5: Neighbors - 0, 2, 17. Possible 3-stars = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors).
6. For node 6: Neighbors - 12, 16, 18, 19. Possible 3-stars = 4C3 = 4.
7. For node 7: Neighbors - 11, 15. Possible 3-stars = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors).
8. For node 8: Neighbors - 14, 18, 19. Possible 3-stars = 3C3 = 1.
9. For node 9: Neighbors - 3, 16, 17. Possible 3-stars = 3C3 = 1.
10. For node 10: Neighbors - 2, 11, 12, 16. Possible 3-stars = 4C3 = 4.
11. For node 12: Neighbors - 1, 6, 10. Possible 3-stars = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors).
12. For node 13: Neighbors - 1, 15. Possible 3-stars = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors).
13. For node 14: Neighbors - 3, 8, 19. Possible 3-stars = 3C3 = 1.
14. For node 15: Neighbors - 7, 13. Possible 3-stars = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors).
15. For node 16: Neighbors - 6, 9, 10. Possible 3-stars = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors).
16. For node 17: Neighbors - 0, 3, 5, 9. Possible 3-stars = 4C3 = 4.
17. For node 18: Neighbors - 0, 6, 8. Possible 3-stars = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors).
18. For node 19: Neighbors - 3, 6, 8, 14. Possible 3-stars = 4C3 = 4.

Total 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 32.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].

Listing out the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 17, 18)>, <2, (0, 10, 11)>, <3, (0, 9, 17)>, <6, (12, 16, 19)>, <8, (14, 18, 19)>, <9, (3, 16, 17)>.
