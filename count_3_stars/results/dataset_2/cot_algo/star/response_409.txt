Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 26) (18, 22) (18, 16) (18, 6) (22, 18) (20, 17) (20, 13) (20, 6) (20, 10) (25, 7) (25, 28) (8, 4) (8, 5) (17, 20) (17, 15) (9, 21) (9, 14) (9, 27) (9, 19) (13, 20) (13, 23) (13, 6) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 23) (21, 9) (21, 3) (21, 2) (21, 29) (14, 9) (14, 26) (14, 6) (26, 7) (26, 14) (26, 5) (26, 29) (28, 25) (28, 3) (28, 0) (2, 21) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 26) (5, 0) (12, 24) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 29) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 23) (16, 7) (16, 18) (16, 1) (16, 23) (11, 7) (11, 27) (0, 4) (0, 28) (0, 5) (6, 18) (6, 20) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 27) (24, 12) (1, 19) (1, 16) (29, 21) (29, 26) (29, 15) (10, 20) (10, 23) (27, 9) (27, 11) (27, 6) (23, 13) (23, 3) (23, 19) (23, 16) (23, 10) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 28}
- Node 1: {16, 19}
- Node 2: {21}
- Node 3: {21, 23, 28}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 8, 26}
- Node 6: {13, 14, 18, 20, 27}
- Node 7: {4, 11, 16, 25, 26}
- Node 8: {4, 5}
- Node 9: {14, 19, 21, 27}
- Node 10: {20, 23}
- Node 11: {7, 27}
- Node 12: {24}
- Node 13: {6, 20, 23}
- Node 14: {6, 9, 26}
- Node 15: {17, 19, 29}
- Node 16: {1, 7, 18, 23}
- Node 17: {15, 20}
- Node 18: {6, 16, 22}
- Node 19: {1, 9, 15, 23}
- Node 20: {6, 10, 13, 17}
- Node 21: {2, 3, 9, 29}
- Node 22: {18}
- Node 23: {10, 13, 16, 19}
- Node 24: {12}
- Node 25: {7, 28}
- Node 26: {5, 7, 14, 29}
- Node 27: {6, 9, 11}
- Node 28: {0, 3, 25}
- Node 29: {15, 21, 26}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 6 = 69

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [69].
