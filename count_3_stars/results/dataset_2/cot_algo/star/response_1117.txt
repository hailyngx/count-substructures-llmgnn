Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 17) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 4) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 16) (4, 2) (4, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (17, 1) (17, 11) (17, 15) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 15) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 6) (15, 17) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 12) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 14) (14, 19) (14, 6) (14, 12) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 0) (16, 18) (16, 13) (12, 10) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {11, 13, 9, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 17, 19, 7}
- Node 2: {18, 9, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 5}
- Node 4: {2, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 15}
- Node 6: {10, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 3}
- Node 8: {5, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 0}
- Node 10: {6, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 18, 17}
- Node 12: {10, 15, 14, 0}
- Node 13: {16, 0, 6}
- Node 14: {19, 6, 12}
- Node 15: {17, 5, 19, 12}
- Node 16: {18, 13}
- Node 17: {1, 11, 15}
- Node 18: {11, 2, 16}
- Node 19: {1, 15, 14}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <0, (11, 13, 9)>, <0, (11, 13, 12)>, <0, (11, 9, 12)>, <0, (13, 9, 12)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <1, (3, 17, 19)>, <1, (3, 17, 7)>, <1, (3, 19, 7)>, <1, (17, 19, 7)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <6, (10, 8, 13)>, <6, (10, 8, 14)>, <6, (10, 13, 14)>, <6, (8, 13, 14)>
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <12, (10, 15, 14)>, <12, (10, 15, 12)>, <12, (10, 14, 12)>, <12, (15, 14, 12)>
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <15, (17, 5, 19)>, <15, (17, 5, 12)>, <15, (17, 19, 12)>, <15, (5, 19, 12)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20. Therefore, the final answer is [20].
