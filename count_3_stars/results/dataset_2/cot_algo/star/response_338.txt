Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {9, 7, 8, 2}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 1, 3, 6, 0}
- Node 3: {9, 6, 2, 8}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 8, 1}
- Node 6: {5, 3, 2}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 0, 1}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 1, 3, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 3, 7, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-star formations:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 56.

Thus, the final answer is [56]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 7, 9>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <2, 1, 8>
- <2, 1, 5>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <3, 2, 8>
- <3, 2, 5>
- <5, 8, 9>
