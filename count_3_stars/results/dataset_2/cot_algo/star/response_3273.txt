Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 3) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 13) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 4) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, let's first determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 10, 4}
- Node 1: {5, 2, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {7, 1, 3, 13}
- Node 3: {5, 2, 11, 6, 4, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 6, 13}
- Node 5: {9, 1, 3}
- Node 6: {14, 8, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {9, 12, 11, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 6, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 14, 7, 0}
- Node 10: {0, 12, 1, 13}
- Node 11: {7, 14, 3}
- Node 12: {7, 10}
- Node 13: {14, 2, 3, 10, 1, 4}
- Node 14: {9, 11, 6, 13}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- From Node 0: [1]
- From Node 1: [1*inom{5}{3} = 10]
- From Node 2: [1]
- From Node 3: [1*inom{6}{3} = 20]
- From Node 4: [1]
- From Node 5: [1]
- From Node 6: [1]
- From Node 7: [1]
- From Node 8: [1]
- From Node 9: [1]
- From Node 10: [1]
- From Node 11: [1]
- From Node 12: [1]
- From Node 13: [1*inom{6}{3} = 20]
- From Node 14: [1]

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 56. Therefore, the final answer is [56], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 9, 10, 4>, <1, 5, 2, 8>, <3, 5, 2, 11>, <3, 5, 6, 4>, <6, 8, 1, 7>, <13, 14, 2, 3>.
