Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 10) (26, 20) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 18) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 7) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 2) (1, 3) (1, 29) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 24) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 7) (22, 23) (22, 0) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 16) (12, 27) (12, 29) (6, 5) (6, 11) (19, 15) (19, 21) (19, 20) (21, 19) (21, 29) (28, 7) (28, 25) (0, 22) (0, 10) (0, 24) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 20) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 11) (14, 18) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 25) (29, 1) (29, 12) (29, 21) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 23) (24, 27) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 4) (20, 26) (20, 19) (20, 10) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 28) (4, 13) (4, 24) (4, 16) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 4) (16, 2) (25, 23) (25, 28) (25, 18) (25, 2) (2, 27) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {22, 10, 24, 2}
Node 1: {3, 29, 8}
Node 2: {27, 0, 16, 25}
Node 3: {1, 17, 24}
Node 4: {13, 24, 16}
Node 5: {6, 8, 18}
Node 6: {5, 11}
Node 7: {15, 13, 28}
Node 8: {5, 1, 13, 16}
Node 9: {18, 17, 10}
Node 10: {9, 0, 20}
Node 11: {6, 14}
Node 12: {27, 29}
Node 13: {8, 4, 7}
Node 14: {11, 18}
Node 15: {27, 19, 7}
Node 16: {2, 8, 4, 23}
Node 17: {9, 3, 23}
Node 18: {5, 14, 25, 9}
Node 19: {15, 21, 20}
Node 20: {26, 19, 10}
Node 21: {19, 29}
Node 22: {23, 0}
Node 23: {22, 17, 25, 16}
Node 24: {27, 3, 0, 4}
Node 25: {23, 28, 18, 2}
Node 26: {20}
Node 27: {15, 12, 24, 2}
Node 28: {7, 25}
Node 29: {1, 12, 21}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

The total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is \(4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 33\).

Therefore, the final answer is [33]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (22, 24, 2)>
<2, (27, 0, 25)>
<4, (13, 16, 7)>
<5, (6, 18, 8)>
<8, (5, 1, 13)>
<9, (18, 17, 10)>
<15, (27, 19, 7)>
<16, (2, 23, 8)>
<18, (5, 25, 14)>
<20, (19, 26, 10)>
<23, (17, 25, 16)>
<25, (23, 28, 18)>
<27, (15, 24, 2)>
<29, (1, 12, 21)>
