Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 17) (10, 7) (10, 2) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 5) (2, 10) (18, 16) (18, 3) (18, 13) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 11) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 1) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 19) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 14) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 15) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 11) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 11) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 5) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 3) (3, 18) (3, 0) (14, 15) (14, 13) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 1) (13, 18) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {6, 15, 3}
- Node 1: {8, 16, 19}
- Node 2: {10}
- Node 3: {18, 0}
- Node 4: {9, 12, 5, 11}
- Node 5: {17, 4, 11}
- Node 6: {9, 17, 0}
- Node 7: {10, 12, 19, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 19, 15, 1}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 17}
- Node 10: {7, 2}
- Node 11: {12, 4, 5}
- Node 12: {7, 4, 11}
- Node 13: {18, 14}
- Node 14: {15, 13}
- Node 15: {8, 19, 0, 14}
- Node 16: {17, 18, 1}
- Node 17: {6, 9, 16, 5}
- Node 18: {16, 3, 13}

Next, we will find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 1: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 2: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 3: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star.
  <4, (9, 12, 11)>
- Node 5: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star.
  <6, (9, 17, 0)>
- Node 7: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 8: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 9: Forms 1 3-star.
  <9, (6, 17, 4)>
- Node 10: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 11: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 12: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 13: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 14: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 15: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 16: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 17: Forms 1 3-star.
  <17, (6, 9, 5)>
- Node 18: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 19: Does not form any 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are <4, (9, 12, 11)>, <6, (9, 17, 0)>, and <17, (6, 9, 5)>.
