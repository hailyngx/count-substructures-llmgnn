Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the provided edge list:

1: 5, 7, 2
2: 4, 10, 11, 6, 1
3: 4, 8, 0, 14
4: 9, 7, 13, 3, 2
5: 6, 1, 11
6: 5, 7, 2, 8, 13
7: 4, 0, 6, 14, 1
8: 6, 12, 3
9: 4, 11, 14, 10, 12
10: 9, 11, 0, 2
11: 5, 9, 10, 12, 2
12: 9, 11, 8
13: 4, 6, 0
14: 9, 7, 3

Next, we will check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors to potentially form a 3-star. Nodes 1, 3, and 5 do not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star, so we will exclude them from further consideration.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, which is enough to form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, which is enough to form 10 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, which is enough to form 10 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, which is enough to form 10 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, which is enough to form 10 3-stars.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.
Node 11 has 5 neighbors, which is enough to form 10 3-stars.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.
Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50, so the final answer is [50].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 11, 14)>
<11, (4, 9, 10)>
<4, (9, 11, 14)>
<7, (9, 11, 14)>
<10, (9, 11, 14)>
<11, (9, 10, 14)>
