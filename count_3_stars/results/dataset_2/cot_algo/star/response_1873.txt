Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 27) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 14) (3, 25) (3, 12) (25, 3) (25, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 27) (10, 5) (1, 23) (17, 29) (17, 13) (29, 17) (29, 23) (29, 22) (29, 14) (21, 9) (28, 24) (28, 2) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 0) (4, 20) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 24) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 26) (26, 18) (26, 7) (26, 14) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 6) (14, 16) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 8) (14, 9) (6, 0) (6, 13) (6, 8) (24, 28) (24, 18) (24, 2) (2, 28) (2, 7) (2, 24) (12, 3) (12, 19) (15, 11) (15, 19) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 15) (5, 25) (5, 10) (5, 27) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 22) (23, 1) (23, 29) (23, 4) (23, 18) (20, 4) (9, 21) (9, 14) (9, 27) (27, 11) (27, 10) (27, 5) (27, 9) (22, 29) (22, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 4, 6, 7, 10
- Node 1: 23
- Node 2: 7, 24, 28
- Node 3: 5, 12, 25
- Node 4: 0, 18, 19, 20, 23
- Node 5: 3, 10, 25, 27
- Node 6: 0, 8, 13
- Node 7: 0, 2, 26
- Node 8: 6, 8, 14, 22
- Node 9: 14, 21, 27
- Node 10: 0, 5, 11, 27
- Node 11: 10, 15, 16, 27
- Node 12: 3, 19
- Node 13: 6, 13, 16, 17, 19
- Node 14: 8, 9, 13, 14, 26, 29
- Node 15: 11, 19
- Node 16: 11, 13, 14
- Node 17: 13, 29
- Node 18: 4, 23, 24, 26
- Node 19: 4, 12, 13, 15, 19
- Node 20: 4
- Node 21: 9
- Node 22: 8, 29
- Node 23: 1, 4, 18, 23, 29
- Node 24: 2, 18, 24, 28
- Node 25: 3, 5
- Node 26: 7, 14, 18, 26
- Node 27: 5, 9, 10, 11
- Node 28: 2, 24, 28
- Node 29: 17, 22, 23, 29

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes (10, 15, 27)
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes (13, 14, 16)
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes (13, 17, 29)
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes (23, 24, 26)
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 18, 23)
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with nodes (18, 24, 28)
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes (14, 18, 26)
- Node 29 forms a 3-star with nodes (14, 22, 29)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 8, thus the answer is [8].
