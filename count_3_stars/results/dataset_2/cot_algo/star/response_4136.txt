Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 13) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 6) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 12) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 14) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 5, 10, 11, 14  
Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 11  
Node 2: 3, 6, 9, 11, 12  
Node 3: 1, 2  
Node 4: 6, 9, 14  
Node 5: 0, 7, 9, 13  
Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 13, 14  
Node 7: 5, 9, 10, 12  
Node 8: 13  
Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 7, 12  
Node 10: 0, 7, 11  
Node 11: 0, 1, 2, 10, 13  
Node 12: 2, 7, 9, 13, 14  
Node 13: 5, 8, 11, 12, 6  
Node 14: 0, 4, 6, 12  

Now, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 5, 14, 11  
Node 1: None  
Node 2: 6, 11, 12  
Node 3: None  
Node 4: 6, 9, 14  
Node 5: 0, 9, 13  
Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 13, 14  
Node 7: 5, 9, 10, 12  
Node 8: 13  
Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 7, 12  
Node 10: 0, 7, 11  
Node 11: 0, 2, 13, 10  
Node 12: 2, 7, 9, 13, 14  
Node 13: 5, 8, 11, 12, 6  
Node 14: 0, 4, 6, 12  

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 4, 10  
Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14  
Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + 11 = 1 + 120 + 11 = 132 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [132].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 11, 14)>
<2, (6, 11, 12)>
<4, (6, 9, 14)>
<5, (0, 9, 13)>
<6, (1, 2, 14)>
<7, (5, 9, 12)>
<9, (2, 7, 12)>
<11, (0, 2, 13)>
<12, (2, 7, 14)>
<13, (5, 8, 11)>
<14, (0, 6, 12)>
