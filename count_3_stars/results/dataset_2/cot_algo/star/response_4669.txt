Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {6, 7, 8, 5}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 2, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 3, 7, 5}
- Node 3: neighbors {9, 1, 2, 5, 8, 4}
- Node 4: neighbors {6, 3, 7, 5}
- Node 5: neighbors {6, 3, 4, 2, 0}
- Node 6: neighbors {5, 7, 4, 0}
- Node 7: neighbors {6, 9, 4, 0, 2}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 3, 0}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 2 3-stars: <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 11, so the final answer is [11].
