Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 9) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 11) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 12) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (13, 11) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 13) 

Response:
First, we will identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 9, 14}
- Node 2: {6, 9, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7, 12}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 13}
- Node 7: {5, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 8: {3, 7, 11}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {2, 4}
- Node 11: {2, 8, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 14: {1, 2}

Now, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Nodes 1, 4, 9, 12, and 13 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Nodes 2 and 11 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Nodes 3 and 7 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars formed is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 54. 

Therefore, the final answer is [54], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 4, 9, 12>
- <1, 4, 9, 13>
- <1, 4, 12, 13>
- <1, 9, 12, 13>
- <4, 9, 12, 13>
- <2, 11, 5, 7>
- <2, 11, 5, 13>
- <2, 11, 7, 13>
- <2, 5, 7, 13>
- <11, 5, 7, 13>
