Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 7, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {7, 0, 4}
- Node 4: {9, 3, 6, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 1}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 8, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 1, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 8: {2, 7, 6}
- Node 9: {5, 2, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 6, and Node 7 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.
- Node 1: <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 6: <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)> 

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have [11].
