Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- From the neighbor sets, we see that nodes 0, 1, and 9 have 6 or more neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars.
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
  - <0, (1, 6, 9)> appears 3 times.
  - <0, (2, 6, 9)> appears 3 times.
  - <0, (3, 6, 9)> appears 3 times.
  - <0, (4, 6, 9)> appears 3 times.
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
  - <1, (0, 6, 9)> appears 3 times.
  - <1, (3, 6, 9)> appears 3 times.
  - <1, (5, 6, 9)> appears 3 times.
  - <1, (7, 5, 9)> appears 3 times.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - <9, (0, 1, 6)> appears 3 times.
  - <9, (0, 4, 6)> appears 3 times.
  - <9, (1, 4, 6)> appears 3 times.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 10 = 50, so the final answer is [50].
