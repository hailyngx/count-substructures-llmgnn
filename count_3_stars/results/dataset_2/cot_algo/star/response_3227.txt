Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 8) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 9) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 12) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 5) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 4) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 0) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 18) (0, 15) (0, 18) (10, 4) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 5) (5, 17) (5, 1) (2, 7) (7, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated as follows:

1. For node 11: Neighbors = {16, 19, 4}, so there is 1 3-star formed.
2. For node 16: Neighbors = {11, 1, 3, 8}, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) additional 3-stars.
3. For node 3: Neighbors = {16, 13, 9}, so there is 1 3-star formed.
4. For node 15: Neighbors = {0, 6, 12}, so we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) additional 3-star.
5. For node 14: Neighbors = {9, 12, 19}, so we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) additional 3-star.
6. For node 17: Neighbors = {6, 12, 5}, so we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) additional 3-star.
7. For node 6: Neighbors = {15, 17, 9, 1}, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) additional 3-stars.
8. For node 9: Neighbors = {3, 14, 6, 4}, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) additional 3-stars.
9. For node 8: Neighbors = {16, 13, 18}, so there is 1 3-star formed.
10. For node 13: Neighbors = {3, 8, 12, 4}, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) additional 3-stars.
11. For node 4: Neighbors = {11, 9, 13, 12, 10}, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) additional 3-stars.
12. For node 12: Neighbors = {15, 14, 17, 13, 4}, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) additional 3-stars.
13. For node 18: Neighbors = {8, 19, 0}, so there is 1 3-star formed.
14. For node 19: Neighbors = {11, 14, 18}, so there is 1 3-star formed.
15. For node 0: Neighbors = {15, 18}, so there is no 3-star formed.
16. For node 10: Neighbors = {4}, so there is no 3-star formed.
17. For node 1: Neighbors = {16, 6, 5}, so there is no 3-star formed.
18. For node 5: Neighbors = {17, 1}, so there is no 3-star formed.
19. For node 2: Neighbors = {7}, so there is no 3-star formed.
20. For node 7: Neighbors = {2}, so there is no 3-star formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1] = [43].
