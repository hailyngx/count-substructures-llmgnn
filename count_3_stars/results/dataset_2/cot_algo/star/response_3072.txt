Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 22) (29, 2) (29, 26) (29, 25) (29, 11) (1, 6) (3, 16) (3, 19) (4, 8) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 27) (24, 26) (24, 9) (24, 15) (26, 29) (26, 24) (26, 23) (26, 21) (15, 24) (15, 5) (11, 29) (11, 4) (11, 23) (11, 20) (23, 26) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 25) (22, 2) (22, 27) (22, 12) (28, 0) (28, 17) (28, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (14, 18) (14, 20) (19, 3) (19, 16) (19, 12) (0, 28) (0, 6) (5, 15) (5, 23) (5, 7) (5, 20) (9, 24) (9, 25) (9, 10) (25, 29) (25, 23) (25, 9) (25, 13) (25, 16) (7, 28) (7, 6) (7, 5) (17, 8) (17, 28) (17, 12) (17, 18) (21, 26) (21, 27) (27, 8) (27, 22) (27, 21) (13, 25) (18, 14) (18, 17) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 16) (12, 22) (12, 6) (12, 19) (12, 17) (12, 10) (16, 3) (16, 19) (16, 25) (16, 10) (20, 11) (20, 14) (20, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {6, 28}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {22, 29}
- Node 3: {16, 19}
- Node 4: {8, 11}
- Node 5: {7, 15, 20, 23}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7, 12}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 28}
- Node 8: {4, 17, 27}
- Node 9: {10, 24, 25}
- Node 10: {9, 12, 16}
- Node 11: {4, 20, 23, 29}
- Node 12: {6, 10, 17, 19, 22}
- Node 13: {25}
- Node 14: {18, 20}
- Node 15: {5, 24}
- Node 16: {3, 10, 19, 25}
- Node 17: {8, 12, 18, 28}
- Node 18: {14, 17}
- Node 19: {3, 12, 16}
- Node 20: {5, 11, 14}
- Node 21: {26, 27}
- Node 22: {2, 12, 27}
- Node 23: {5, 11, 25, 26}
- Node 24: {9, 15, 26}
- Node 25: {9, 13, 16, 23, 29}
- Node 26: {21, 23, 24, 29}
- Node 27: {8, 21, 22}
- Node 28: {0, 7, 17}
- Node 29: {2, 11, 25, 26}

Now we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 20

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
