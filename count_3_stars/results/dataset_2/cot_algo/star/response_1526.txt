Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 18) (21, 1) (21, 9) (21, 8) (21, 22) (10, 17) (10, 24) (17, 10) (17, 20) (17, 8) (17, 27) (8, 21) (8, 17) (8, 29) (8, 22) (23, 2) (23, 25) (23, 0) (4, 19) (4, 6) (4, 26) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 0) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 24) (13, 6) (26, 4) (26, 13) (26, 16) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 20) (20, 17) (20, 5) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 28) (15, 19) (9, 21) (9, 29) (9, 11) (29, 8) (29, 9) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 0) (27, 17) (27, 29) (14, 18) (14, 5) (16, 26) (3, 28) (3, 0) (28, 20) (28, 3) (28, 7) (28, 12) (28, 25) (11, 9) (2, 23) (22, 21) (22, 8) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 29) (19, 6) (0, 23) (0, 18) (0, 29) (0, 3) (25, 23) (25, 28) (25, 6) (7, 20) (7, 28) (7, 24) (12, 5) (12, 20) (12, 28) (24, 10) (24, 13) (24, 7) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 19) (6, 25) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {18, 23, 3, 29}
- Node 1: {18, 21}
- Node 2: {23}
- Node 3: {0, 28}
- Node 4: {6, 19, 26}
- Node 5: {13, 14, 20, 12}
- Node 6: {4, 13, 19, 25}
- Node 7: {20, 24, 28}
- Node 8: {21, 17, 29, 22}
- Node 9: {21, 29, 11}
- Node 10: {17, 24}
- Node 11: {9}
- Node 12: {5, 20, 28}
- Node 13: {5, 6, 24, 26}
- Node 14: {18, 5}
- Node 15: {19}
- Node 16: {26}
- Node 17: {8, 20, 27, 10}
- Node 18: {1, 14, 0}
- Node 19: {4, 6, 29, 15}
- Node 20: {17, 5, 7, 12, 28}
- Node 21: {1, 9, 8, 22}
- Node 22: {21, 8}
- Node 23: {2, 25, 0}
- Node 24: {10, 13, 7}
- Node 25: {23, 28, 6}
- Node 26: {4, 13, 16}
- Node 27: {17, 29}
- Node 28: {3, 7, 12, 25, 20}
- Node 29: {9, 8, 27, 19, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 8, Node 21, Node 29, and Node 20 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.
- Node 17 and Node 13 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars as well.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 21 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 29 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 20 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 17 can form 1 3-star.
Node 13 can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 30 \). 

So, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<8, 21, 22>
<8, 21, 9>
<8, 21, 29>
<8, 21, 20>
<21, 1, 18>
<21, 1, 8>
<21, 1, 22>
<21, 9, 29>
<21, 9, 11>
<29, 8, 22>
<29, 8, 27>
<29, 8, 0>
<29, 8, 17>
<29, 21, 9>
<20, 17, 8>
<20, 17, 27>
<20, 17, 10>
<20, 17, 20>
<17, 20, 27>
<13, 5, 14>
