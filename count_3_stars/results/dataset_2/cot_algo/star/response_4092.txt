Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 17) (12, 14) (12, 11) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 9) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 5) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 0) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 13) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 19) (0, 2) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (18, 9) (18, 5) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 10) (17, 7) (17, 3) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 16) (5, 14) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 16) (13, 15) (16, 5) (16, 14) (6, 4) (6, 15) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 8, 10, 19
- Node 1: 0, 7, 14
- Node 2: 0, 10, 14
- Node 3: 9, 11, 17
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 11, 14, 16, 18
- Node 6: 4, 15
- Node 7: 1, 8, 10, 17
- Node 8: 0, 4, 7
- Node 9: 3, 15, 18
- Node 10: 0, 2, 7, 19
- Node 11: 3, 5, 12, 19
- Node 12: 11, 14
- Node 13: 15
- Node 14: 1, 2, 5, 12, 16
- Node 15: 6, 9, 13
- Node 16: 5, 14
- Node 17: 3, 7
- Node 18: 5, 9
- Node 19: 0, 10, 11

Nodes 0, 5, and 14 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each, resulting in a total of 30 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 10>, <0, 1, 19>, <0, 2, 10>, <0, 2, 14>, <0, 7, 10>, <0, 7, 17>, <0, 10, 19>, <1, 7, 14>, <5, 11, 14>, <5, 14, 16> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].
