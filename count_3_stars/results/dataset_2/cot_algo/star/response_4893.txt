Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given edges in a more understandable way:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 7, 5, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 5, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 5, and 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 0, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 8, and 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 0, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 0, 2, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 0, and 7.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: [4] 3-stars <0, (8, 5, 7)>  
- Node 1: [1] 3-star <1, (9, 3, 5)>
- Node 3: [1] 3-star <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 4: [1] 3-star <4, (6, 7, 5)>
- Node 5: [1] 3-star <5, (1, 3, 0)>
- Node 6: [2] 3-stars <6, (9, 4, 0)>, <6, (8, 4, 0)>
- Node 7: [2] 3-stars <7, (1, 4, 0)>, <7, (3, 4, 0)>
- Node 8: [1] 3-star <8, (6, 0, 5)>
- Node 9: [1] 3-star <9, (1, 0, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
