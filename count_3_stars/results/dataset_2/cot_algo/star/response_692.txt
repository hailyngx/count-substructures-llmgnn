Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 7) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (11, 1) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 14) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 5) 

Response:
First, let's build the adjacency list for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {6, 1, 7, 9}
Node 1: {3, 5, 10, 11, 12, 0}
Node 2: {8, 4, 12, 13}
Node 3: {1, 9, 13, 14}
Node 4: {8, 12}
Node 5: {6, 1, 14}
Node 6: {9, 5, 7, 10, 0}
Node 7: {6, 8, 13, 0}
Node 8: {13, 4, 2, 14, 7}
Node 9: {6, 14, 3, 0}
Node 10: {6, 1, 12}
Node 11: {1, 12}
Node 12: {1, 10, 11, 4, 2}
Node 13: {3, 8, 2, 7}
Node 14: {9, 3, 8, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-star subgraphs they are a part of:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
2. Node 1 has 6 neighbors: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
3. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
4. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
5. Node 8 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
6. Node 12 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
7. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 10, 12>, <3, 8, 13>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 13>, <8, 13, 14>, <12, 8, 13>, <12, 2, 8>, <12, 4, 8>, <12, 4, 2>
