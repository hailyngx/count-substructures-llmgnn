Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by examining each node that has three or more neighbors and applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors of the node.

Node 1 has 6 neighbors: {0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 2}. 
So, the number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \). 

Node 3 has 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 4, 5, 9}. 
So, the number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). 

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 10 = 30 \), thus the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
