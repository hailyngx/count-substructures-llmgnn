Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 12) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 19) (10, 9) (17, 18) (17, 4) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 17) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 19) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (5, 1) (5, 19) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 4) (19, 1) (19, 0) (19, 5) (8, 15) (8, 12) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 4) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 6) (7, 11) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 8) (4, 17) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 11) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {14, 16, 19}
Node 1: {3, 5, 11, 14, 19}
Node 2: {11, 16}
Node 3: {1, 15}
Node 4: {11, 13, 16, 17}
Node 5: {1, 19}
Node 6: {7, 9, 12, 15}
Node 7: {6, 11}
Node 8: {12, 15}
Node 9: {6, 10, 14}
Node 10: {9}
Node 11: {1, 2, 4, 7, 14}
Node 12: {6, 8, 13, 15}
Node 13: {4, 12, 16}
Node 14: {0, 1, 9, 11}
Node 15: {3, 6, 8, 12}
Node 16: {0, 2, 4, 13}
Node 17: {4, 18}
Node 18: {17}
Node 19: {0, 1, 5}

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding all these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 41.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [41].

And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 11, 14)>
<1, (3, 5, 19)>
<1, (11, 14, 19)>
<1, (5, 14, 19)>
<4, (11, 13, 14)>
<6, (7, 9, 14)>
<11, (2, 4, 13)>
<11, (4, 7, 14)>
<11, (4, 13, 16)>
<14, (0, 9, 19)>
<15, (8, 12, 13)>
<16, (0, 13, 4)>
