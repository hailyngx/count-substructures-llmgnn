Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 7) (10, 3) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 1) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 5) (0, 5) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 4) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 16) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 19) (19, 2) (19, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 18) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 16) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {5}
Node 1 neighbors: {6, 7, 8, 18}
Node 2 neighbors: {4, 11, 14, 19}
Node 3 neighbors: {10, 15, 16}
Node 4 neighbors: {2, 10, 16, 18}
Node 5 neighbors: {0, 7, 11, 12, 19}
Node 6 neighbors: {1, 9, 12, 18}
Node 7 neighbors: {1, 5, 7, 9, 13}
Node 8 neighbors: {1, 8, 13, 14, 15}
Node 9 neighbors: {6, 7, 9}
Node 10 neighbors: {3, 4}
Node 11 neighbors: {2, 5}
Node 12 neighbors: {5, 6}
Node 13 neighbors: {7, 8, 13, 15}
Node 14 neighbors: {2, 8, 16}
Node 15 neighbors: {3, 8, 13, 15, 18}
Node 16 neighbors: {3, 4, 14, 16}
Node 18 neighbors: {1, 4, 6, 15, 18}
Node 19 neighbors: {2, 5}

Next, we identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, 18}

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing these up: 
\( 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 63 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [63].

Unique 3-stars:
<3, 10, 15, 16>
<4, 10, 16, 18>
<5, 11, 19, 2>
<6, 1, 18, 7>
<7, 1, 5, 13>
<8, 13, 15, 1>
<13, 7, 15, 8>
<15, 8, 18, 1>
<18, 1, 6, 15>
