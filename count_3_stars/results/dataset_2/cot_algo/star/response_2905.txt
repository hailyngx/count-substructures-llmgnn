Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (with nodes 1, 4, 5), so total = 4
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (with nodes 4, 6, 9), so total = 4
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars (with nodes 2, 3, 5), so total = 10
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (with nodes 2, 4, 8), so total = 4
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars (with nodes 1, 3, 7), so total = 20
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (with nodes 5, 7, 9), so total = 4
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars (with nodes 3, 4, 6), so total = 10

Summing up all the 3-stars, we have a total of 56 3-stars, so the final answer is [56].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- <9, (3, 4, 6)>
