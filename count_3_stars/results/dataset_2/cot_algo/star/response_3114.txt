Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 10) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 19) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 7) (17, 9) (17, 14) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 18) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 19) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 6) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 12) (19, 16) (19, 9) (19, 4) (0, 1) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 6) (6, 18) (6, 15) (6, 12) 

Response:
The first step is to find the neighbor nodes for each node:

1: {3, 4, 7, 0}
2: {5, 8}
3: {1, 7, 10}
4: {1, 11, 19}
5: {2, 8, 9, 13}
6: {15, 12, 18}
7: {1, 3, 14}
8: {2, 5, 9, 13, 18}
9: {5, 8, 13, 14, 17, 19}
10: {3, 12, 15, 16}
11: {4, 16}
12: {6, 10, 15}
13: {5, 8, 9, 18}
14: {7, 9, 17}
15: {6, 10, 12, 16}
16: {10, 15, 19, 11}
17: {9, 14}
18: {8, 13, 6}
19: {4, 9, 16}
0: {1}
Now, we need to find the 3-stars. 

Node 5 forms a 3-star because it has 4 neighbors: <5, (2, 8, 9)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star because it has 5 neighbors: <8, (2, 5, 13)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star because it has 6 neighbors: <9, (5, 8, 13)>
Node 15 forms a 3-star because it has 4 neighbors: <15, (6, 10, 12)>
Node 16 forms a 3-star because it has 4 neighbors: <16, (10, 15, 19)>

Counting all unique 3-stars found, the total is [5].
