Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {6, 7, 2}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 5, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 4, 5, 6}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars
- Node 1: 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars
- Node 2: 5 neighbors, so [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 5 neighbors, so [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: 5 neighbors, so [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [42].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 5, 9)>
