Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 14) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 7) (11, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 10) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 1) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {6, 7, 8}
Node 1: {4, 7, 8, 10, 2}
Node 2: {9, 7, 13, 3, 1}
Node 3: {14, 2, 12}
Node 4: {9, 7, 5, 1}
Node 5: {4, 8, 13, 11, 12, 10}
Node 6: {9, 8, 0}
Node 7: {4, 0, 11, 10, 2, 1}
Node 8: {6, 5, 0, 1}
Node 9: {6, 4, 2, 14, 13}
Node 10: {7, 5, 12, 1}
Node 11: {7, 5}
Node 12: {3, 5, 10}
Node 13: {9, 5, 2, 14}
Node 14: {9, 13, 3}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
Nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10 all have 6 or more neighbors, so we need to count the number of 3-stars for each of them.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 120

Therefore, the final answer is [120], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 10>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 5, 10>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 10>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 10>
<4, 10, 7>
<5, 7, 10>
