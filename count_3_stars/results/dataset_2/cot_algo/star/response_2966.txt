Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 8 (Degree = 4)
2. Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9 (Degree = 6)
3. Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 8 (Degree = 2)
4. Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 8 (Degree = 4)
5. Node 4 has neighbors: 3, 5 (Degree = 2)
6. Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9 (Degree = 5)
7. Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 1, 8, 9 (Degree = 4)
8. Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 8, 9 (Degree = 3)
9. Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 (Degree = 6)
10. Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7 (Degree = 4)

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors who can form 3-star subgraphs: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4C3 = 4
- Node 1: inom{6}{3} = 6C3 = 20
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4C3 = 4
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 5C3 = 10
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4C3 = 4
- Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 6C3 = 20
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4C3 = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 66

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [66].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 9>
