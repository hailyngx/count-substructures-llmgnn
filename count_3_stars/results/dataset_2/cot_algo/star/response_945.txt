Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 29) (13, 18) (22, 26) (22, 17) (15, 0) (15, 25) (15, 14) (27, 14) (27, 10) (27, 2) (2, 27) (2, 29) (2, 10) (29, 13) (29, 2) (29, 0) (3, 25) (3, 26) (3, 8) (25, 15) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 16) (25, 4) (4, 25) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 10) (21, 7) (21, 20) (21, 5) (20, 25) (20, 21) (20, 17) (20, 6) (19, 6) (19, 23) (26, 22) (26, 3) (26, 0) (1, 5) (1, 28) (1, 8) (17, 22) (17, 20) (17, 6) (28, 1) (28, 9) (28, 12) (28, 24) (8, 3) (8, 1) (11, 7) (6, 20) (6, 19) (6, 17) (6, 14) (14, 15) (14, 27) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 24) (9, 12) (0, 15) (0, 29) (0, 26) (5, 21) (5, 1) (23, 19) (23, 24) (10, 27) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) (16, 25) (16, 18) (24, 28) (24, 9) (24, 23) (18, 13) (18, 16) (12, 28) (12, 9) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: 15, 29, 26
- Node 1: 5, 8, 28
- Node 2: 27, 29, 10
- Node 3: 25, 26, 8
- Node 4: 25, 7, 9, 10
- Node 5: 21, 1
- Node 6: 20, 19, 17, 14
- Node 7: 4, 21, 10, 11
- Node 8: 3, 1
- Node 9: 4, 28, 14, 24, 12
- Node 10: 27, 2, 4, 7
- Node 11: 7
- Node 12: 28, 9
- Node 13: 29, 18
- Node 14: 15, 27, 6, 9
- Node 15: 0, 25, 14
- Node 16: 25, 18
- Node 17: 22, 20, 6
- Node 18: 13, 16
- Node 19: 6, 23
- Node 20: 25, 21, 17, 6
- Node 21: 7, 5, 20
- Node 22: 26, 17
- Node 23: 19, 24
- Node 24: 28, 9, 23
- Node 25: 15, 3, 20, 16, 4
- Node 26: 22, 3, 0
- Node 27: 14, 2, 10
- Node 28: 1, 9, 24, 12
- Node 29: 13, 2, 0

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars:

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 20, 25, 26, 27, 29

Now, we will count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} \]

\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 \]

\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = 81 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [81].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, 15, 25>
- <2, 10, 27>
- <4, 9, 24>
- <6, 14, 20>
- <7, 10, 21>
- <9, 12, 28>
- <14, 15, 27>
- <15, 25, 4>
- <16, 18, 25>
- <20, 21, 5>
- <25, 3, 26>
- <26, 0, 22>
- <27, 2, 29>
