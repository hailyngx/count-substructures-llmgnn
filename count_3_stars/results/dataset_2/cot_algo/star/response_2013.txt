Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 15) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 12) (4, 19) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 17) (0, 5) (14, 2) (14, 13) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 13) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 18) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 18) (17, 0) (17, 1) (19, 4) (19, 7) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 16) (7, 2) (16, 9) (16, 7) (16, 12) (12, 9) (12, 16) (10, 13) (10, 2) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 10) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node. 

Node 0 neighbors: 6, 5, 17
Node 1 neighbors: 11, 17, 18
Node 2 neighbors: 4, 7, 10, 14
Node 3 neighbors: 15, 11, 18
Node 4 neighbors: 19, 2
Node 5 neighbors: 15, 0, 13
Node 6 neighbors: 9, 7, 8, 0
Node 7 neighbors: 6, 19, 16, 2
Node 8 neighbors: 6, 11
Node 9 neighbors: 15, 6, 16, 12
Node 10 neighbors: 13, 2
Node 11 neighbors: 3, 8, 1, 18
Node 12 neighbors: 9, 16
Node 13 neighbors: 15, 14, 5, 10
Node 14 neighbors: 2, 13
Node 15 neighbors: 3, 9, 13, 5
Node 16 neighbors: 9, 7, 12
Node 17 neighbors: 1, 0
Node 18 neighbors: 3, 11, 1
Node 19 neighbors: 4, 7

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 5, 17>,
<2, 10, 14>,
<6, 7, 8>,
<7, 16, 9>,
<9, 12, 16>,
<11, 1, 18>,
<13, 5, 15>,
<15, 3, 9>.
