Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 19) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 8) (15, 8) (15, 12) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 2) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 16) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 17) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 19) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 0) (10, 5) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 17) (19, 16) (19, 7) (19, 6) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 4) (1, 16) (1, 0) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 8) (13, 9) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {11, 14, 1}
- Node 1: {16, 0}
- Node 2: {11, 7, 18, 13}
- Node 3: {17, 14, 8}
- Node 4: {7, 12, 5}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 12, 10, 4}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 18, 19}
- Node 7: {4, 2, 6, 19}
- Node 8: {3, 15, 17}
- Node 9: {5, 17, 13}
- Node 10: {5}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 14}
- Node 12: {15, 5, 4}
- Node 13: {9, 2}
- Node 14: {11, 3, 0}
- Node 15: {8, 12}
- Node 16: {1, 18, 19}
- Node 17: {3, 9, 18, 8}
- Node 18: {16, 2, 6, 17}
- Node 19: {16, 7, 6}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 13 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 33, so we have [33].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 11, 1>, <2, 11, 14>, <2, 11, 7>, <2, 11, 13>, <2, 7, 18>, <2, 7, 19>, <2, 13, 9>, <3, 14, 0>, <5, 9, 4>, <5, 9, 12>, <5, 9, 10>, <5, 6, 4>, <5, 6, 12>, <5, 6, 10>, <5, 12, 4>, <5, 12, 10>, <6, 7, 4>, <6, 7, 19>, <6, 18, 16>, <6, 18, 17>, <7, 19, 16>, <8, 3, 15>, <8, 3, 17>, <8, 15, 12>, <8, 17, 9>, <8, 17, 13>, <11, 0, 1>, <14, 3, 0>, <16, 1, 0>, <17, 3, 8>, <17, 3, 13>, <17, 3, 9>, <17, 9, 13>, <18, 16, 19>, <18, 17, 9>, <18, 17, 13>
