Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 11, 5, 12, 13
- Node 1: 9, 3, 13, 4, 7
- Node 2: 9, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 6, 1, 2, 5, 12
- Node 4: 1, 7, 2
- Node 5: 3, 10, 0
- Node 6: 9, 14, 3, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 12, 11, 14
- Node 8: 6, 9, 2, 14
- Node 9: 6, 8, 2, 1, 14
- Node 10: 11, 5
- Node 11: 7, 10, 0
- Node 12: 3, 7, 14, 0
- Node 13: 1, 0, 14
- Node 14: 6, 9, 7, 8, 12, 13

Now, let's identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1, 3-stars: <1, (9, 3, 13)>
- Node 3, 3-stars: <3, (6, 1, 2)>
- Node 7, 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 12)>
- Node 9, 3-stars: <9, (6, 8, 2)>
- Node 12, 3-stars: <12, (3, 7, 14)>
- Node 14, 3-stars: <14, (6, 9, 13)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars formed gives us [6].
