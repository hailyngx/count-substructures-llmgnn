Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 11) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 3) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 25) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 27) (3, 1) (3, 23) (3, 9) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 24) (22, 18) (22, 19) (22, 15) (8, 1) (23, 3) (23, 13) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 9) (11, 5) (28, 11) (28, 17) (28, 12) (28, 10) (6, 24) (6, 12) (6, 19) (21, 20) (21, 26) (21, 24) (26, 21) (26, 16) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 15) (24, 18) (24, 6) (24, 21) (24, 16) (24, 12) (19, 0) (19, 22) (19, 6) (19, 25) (10, 28) (10, 14) (10, 20) (17, 28) (17, 25) (17, 2) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 17) (7, 14) (2, 17) (2, 5) (2, 16) (5, 11) (5, 2) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 2) (29, 4) (20, 1) (20, 21) (20, 10) (15, 22) (15, 9) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 24) (12, 13) (12, 14) (13, 23) (13, 12) (4, 29) (4, 14) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {27, 11, 19}
Node 1: {3, 20, 25, 9, 8}
Node 2: {17, 5, 16}
Node 3: {27, 1, 23, 9}
Node 4: {29, 14}
Node 5: {11, 2}
Node 6: {24, 12, 19}
Node 7: {14}
Node 8: {1}
Node 9: {1, 3, 11, 15}
Node 10: {28, 14, 20}
Node 11: {0, 28, 9, 5}
Node 12: {28, 6, 24, 13, 14}
Node 13: {23, 12}
Node 14: {10, 7, 4, 12}
Node 15: {22, 9}
Node 16: {26, 2, 24}
Node 17: {28, 25, 2}
Node 18: {27, 22, 24}
Node 19: {0, 22, 6, 25}
Node 20: {1, 21, 10}
Node 21: {20, 26, 24}
Node 22: {18, 19, 15}
Node 23: {3, 13}
Node 24: {18, 6, 21, 16, 12}
Node 25: {1, 19, 17}
Node 26: {21, 16}
Node 27: {0, 18, 3}
Node 28: {11, 17, 10, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 27, 28

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 61

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [61].

The unique 3-stars found are as follows:
<0, 11, 27>, 
<1, 3, 9>, 
<1, 3, 23>, 
<1, 8, 9>, 
<1, 9, 11>, 
<3, 9, 11>, 
<6, 12, 24>, 
<12, 13, 28>, 
<12, 14, 28>, 
<12, 14, 4>, 
<12, 14, 7>, 
<12, 28, 11>, 
<14, 10, 28>, 
<14, 4, 29>, 
<14, 7, 4>, 
<18, 22, 24>, 
<19, 0, 22>, 
<19, 0, 25>, 
<19, 6, 24>, 
<19, 6, 25>, 
<19, 22, 25>, 
<20, 10, 28>, 
<20, 10, 21>, 
<22, 18, 24>, 
<22, 18, 27>, 
<24, 12, 6>, 
<24, 12, 28>, 
<24, 16, 26>, 
<24, 16, 2>.
