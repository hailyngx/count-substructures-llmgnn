Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 2) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 10, 12, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 10, 13}
- Node 5: {6, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 11, 13}
- Node 9: {2}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 4, 11}
- Node 11: {6, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 5, 11}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 5, 6, 13}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes {4, 12, 14}
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes {10, 12, 8}
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with nodes {13, 8, 14}
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with nodes {10, 2, 13}
- Node 6: Forms a 3-star with nodes {11, 14, 2}
  
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (4, 12, 14)>
<1, (10, 12, 8)>
<3, (13, 8, 14)>
<4, (10, 2, 13)>
<6, (11, 14, 2)>
