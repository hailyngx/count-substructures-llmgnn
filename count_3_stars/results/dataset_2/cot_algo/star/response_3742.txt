Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 29) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 23) (0, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 11) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 28) (13, 7) (12, 27) (12, 10) (12, 24) (12, 11) (20, 29) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 5) (2, 15) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 28) (21, 25) (21, 19) (21, 26) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 1) (26, 21) (26, 14) (29, 15) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 19) (9, 15) (9, 29) (14, 5) (14, 26) (14, 22) (14, 19) (14, 10) (16, 15) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 17) (19, 21) (19, 18) (19, 29) (19, 14) (19, 28) (28, 13) (28, 2) (28, 16) (28, 19) (28, 22) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 2) (17, 16) (17, 24) (17, 4) (24, 8) (24, 12) (24, 17) (1, 25) (1, 18) (22, 14) (22, 28) (22, 10) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 22) (4, 3) (4, 17) (11, 25) (11, 12) (23, 27) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 2
Node 1: 18, 25
Node 2: 0, 7, 15, 28
Node 3: 4, 10
Node 4: 3, 17
Node 5: 6, 14, 16, 18
Node 6: 5
Node 7: 2, 8, 13
Node 8: 7, 13, 24
Node 9: 15, 29
Node 10: 3, 12, 14, 22
Node 11: 12, 25
Node 12: 10, 11, 24, 27
Node 13: 7, 8, 28
Node 14: 5, 10, 19, 22, 26
Node 15: 2, 9, 16, 27, 29
Node 16: 5, 15, 17, 28
Node 17: 4, 16, 24
Node 18: 1, 5, 19
Node 19: 14, 18, 21, 26, 28, 29
Node 20: 29
Node 21: 19, 25, 26
Node 22: 14, 28
Node 23: 27
Node 24: 8, 12, 17
Node 25: 1, 11, 21
Node 26: 14, 19, 21
Node 27: 12, 15, 23
Node 28: 2, 13, 16, 19, 22
Node 29: 9, 15, 19, 20

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 20, 23
Nodes with more than 3 neighbors (to apply \( \binom{n}{3} \)): 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 5
Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 14 * \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 56

Total 3-stars: 5 + 56 = 61

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [61].
