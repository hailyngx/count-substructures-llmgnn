Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 5, 9, 7, 6
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 4, 7, 3, 6
- Node 3: 7, 6, 2, 8
- Node 4: 5, 9, 7, 8, 2
- Node 5: 9, 1, 4, 0, 7
- Node 6: 9, 3, 2, 0
- Node 7: 5, 4, 0, 3, 2
- Node 8: 9, 4, 3
- Node 9: 5, 9, 6, 8, 0

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: 0 (Not enough neighbors for a 3-star)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 56 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 3)>
- <3, (7, 6, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (9, 4, 7)>
- <6, (9, 3, 2)>
- <7, (5, 4, 0)>
- <9, (5, 7, 4)>
- <10 unique 3-stars in total>
