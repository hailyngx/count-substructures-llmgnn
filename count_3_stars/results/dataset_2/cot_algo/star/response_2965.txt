Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 6) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 1) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 4) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 5}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {4, 7, 12}
- Node 11: {3, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {4, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 6, 11, 13}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 54

Therefore, the final answer is [54] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 6, 14)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (5, 6, 13)>
- <13, (4, 7, 14)>
