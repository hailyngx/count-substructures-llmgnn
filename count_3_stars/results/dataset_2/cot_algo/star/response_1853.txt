Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (14, 9) (14, 11) (17, 16) (17, 12) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 3) (4, 19) (4, 15) (18, 0) (18, 3) (3, 13) (3, 18) (3, 16) (3, 19) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 16) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 15) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 2) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 6) (19, 4) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 2) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {10, 18, 7, 12}
Node 1: {9, 2}
Node 2: {5, 1, 12, 19, 15}
Node 3: {13, 18, 16, 19}
Node 4: {19, 15}
Node 5: {2, 10}
Node 6: {7, 15, 19, 16}
Node 7: {0, 6}
Node 8: {9, 11, 13, 12}
Node 9: {8, 14, 1}
Node 10: {5, 11, 0}
Node 11: {14, 10, 8}
Node 12: {17, 8, 0, 2}
Node 13: {8, 3}
Node 14: {9, 11}
Node 15: {4, 6, 2}
Node 16: {17, 3, 6}
Node 17: {16, 12}
Node 18: {0, 3}
Node 19: {4, 3, 6, 2}

Based on the neighbors we found: 
- Node 0, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, and 19 have 4 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars with them.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For each node with 4 or more neighbors, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 34

So, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 10, 18, 7>, 
<2, 5, 1, 12>, 
<3, 13, 18, 16>, 
<6, 7, 15, 19>, 
<8, 9, 14, 1>, 
<12, 17, 8, 0>, 
<19, 4, 3, 6>.
