Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (15, 3) (15, 2) (15, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 17) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 6) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 17) (1, 9) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (7, 0) (7, 17) (7, 6) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (9, 1) (9, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 4) (11, 15) (11, 12) (11, 9) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 13) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 16) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 4) (16, 13) (16, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: 3, 7
- Node 1: 9, 17
- Node 2: 5, 12, 15, 18
- Node 3: 0, 10, 15
- Node 4: 5, 10, 13, 16, 19
- Node 5: 2, 4, 8, 17, 18
- Node 6: 7, 12, 13
- Node 7: 0, 6, 17
- Node 8: 5, 17, 19
- Node 9: 1, 11
- Node 10: 3, 4, 12
- Node 11: 9, 12, 15
- Node 12: 2, 6, 10, 11
- Node 13: 4, 6, 16
- Node 15: 2, 3, 11
- Node 16: 4, 13
- Node 17: 1, 5, 7, 8, 19
- Node 18: 2, 5
- Node 19: 4, 8, 17

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 5 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Now, we sum up the total number of 3-stars:

\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 39 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [39]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (5, 12, 18)>
- <4, (5, 13, 16)>
- <5, (2, 8, 17)>
- <8, (5, 17, 19)>
- <12, (2, 10, 6)>
- <17, (5, 7, 19)>
