Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

I will first list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {9, 6, 10, 7, 8}
Node 1: {10, 7}
Node 2: {11, 8, 13}
Node 3: {11, 4, 14, 8, 12}
Node 4: {5, 3, 7, 8}
Node 5: {9, 6, 13, 4, 7}
Node 6: {5, 9, 8, 0}
Node 7: {5, 1, 4, 0, 14}
Node 8: {6, 3, 10, 4, 2, 0}
Node 9: {5, 6, 14, 10, 13, 0}
Node 10: {9, 1, 0, 8}
Node 11: {3, 12, 2}
Node 12: {3, 11}
Node 13: {5, 9, 2}
Node 14: {9, 3, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 84

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [84].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (9, 6, 10)>, <3, (11, 4, 14)>, <4, (5, 3, 7)>, <5, (9, 6, 13)>, <7, (5, 1, 4)>, <8, (6, 3, 10)>, <9, (5, 6, 14)>, <10, (9, 1, 0)>
