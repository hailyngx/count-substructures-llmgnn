Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 5) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 12) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 12) (2, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 12) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 14. Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node and then sum them up.

For node 0:
- Neighbors: 9, 3, 4, 12, 5
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 1:
- Neighbors: 10, 14, 13, 4, 12
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 3:
- Neighbors: 0, 14, 5, 12
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 5:
- Neighbors: 10, 0, 14, 3, 4
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 7:
- Neighbors: 6, 9, 11, 2, 13, 8
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

For node 8:
- Neighbors: 10, 11, 7, 12
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 10:
- Neighbors: 11, 8, 1, 5
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 11:
- Neighbors: 10, 7, 13, 8, 4
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 12:
- Neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 8, 13
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 14:
- Neighbors: 9, 3, 1, 5
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 76

Therefore, the final answer is [76] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 12, 14)>
<7, (8, 11, 13)>
