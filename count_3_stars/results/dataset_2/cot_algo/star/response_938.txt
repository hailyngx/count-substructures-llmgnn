Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 10) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 18) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 15) (7, 19) (7, 10) (16, 13) (16, 18) (1, 6) (1, 9) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 15) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 15) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 19) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 17) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 17) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 17) (17, 9) (17, 2) (17, 11) (17, 3) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (13, 0) (13, 16) 

Response:
Given the information provided, first, let's find all the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {6, 11, 13}
- Node 1 neighbors: {6, 9}
- Node 2 neighbors: {5, 4, 17}
- Node 3 neighbors: {8, 9, 17}
- Node 4 neighbors: {6, 12, 11, 2}
- Node 5 neighbors: {6, 2, 15}
- Node 6 neighbors: {5, 1, 4, 0}
- Node 7 neighbors: {19, 10}
- Node 8 neighbors: {10, 12, 3, 18}
- Node 9 neighbors: {17, 1, 3}
- Node 10 neighbors: {14, 8, 7}
- Node 11 neighbors: {0, 4, 17}
- Node 12 neighbors: {8, 4, 15}
- Node 13 neighbors: {0, 16}
- Node 14 neighbors: {10}
- Node 15 neighbors: {5, 12, 18, 19}
- Node 16 neighbors: {13, 18}
- Node 17 neighbors: {9, 2, 11, 3}
- Node 18 neighbors: {8, 16, 15, 19}
- Node 19 neighbors: {7, 18, 15}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors → 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors → 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors → 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors → 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors → 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors → 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors → 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors → 1 3-star
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors → 1 3-star
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors → 1 3-star
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors → 4 3-stars
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors → 4 3-stars
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors → 4 3-stars
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors → 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].
