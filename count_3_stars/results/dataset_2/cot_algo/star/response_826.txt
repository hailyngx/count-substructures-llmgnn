Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 3) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 13) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 13) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 11) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 8, 11}
- Node 6: {1, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {0, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 12: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 13: {4, 6, 10, 11, 9}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 7, 10}

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 9

Number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 0 = 5

Therefore, the final count is [5].

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (6, 10, 12)>, <7, (1, 11, 14)>, <9, (0, 13, 4)>, <1, (7, 10, 12)>, <1, (6, 10, 13)>
