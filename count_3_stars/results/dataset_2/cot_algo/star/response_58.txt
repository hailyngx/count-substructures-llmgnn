Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 2
Node 2 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 9
Node 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 7
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 9
Node 6 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9
Node 7 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 0, 3
Node 9 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 7

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 3: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 4: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 6: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 9: inom(4, 3) = 4

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (5, 4, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 2, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 6, 3)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (5, 4, 9)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
