Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (4, 15) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 18) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 5) (13, 16) (13, 14) (17, 18) (19, 9) (19, 18) (0, 6) (0, 16) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 5) (18, 8) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 14) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 12) (12, 15) (12, 11) (12, 2) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 5) (5, 10) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) 

Response:
The 3-star graph in this case can be found by examining the neighbor sets for each node. 
From the given edges, we construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: {6, 16}
- Node 1 neighbors: {5, 11, 14, 15}
- Node 2 neighbors: {3, 9, 12, 15}
- Node 3 neighbors: {2}
- Node 4 neighbors: {7, 15}
- Node 5 neighbors: {1, 10, 14, 16}
- Node 6 neighbors: {0, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 7 neighbors: {4, 10, 14}
- Node 8 neighbors: {6, 18}
- Node 9 neighbors: {2, 6, 19}
- Node 10 neighbors: {5, 7, 11}
- Node 11 neighbors: {1, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 12 neighbors: {2, 11, 15}
- Node 13 neighbors: {14, 16}
- Node 14 neighbors: {1, 7, 13, 18, 5}
- Node 15 neighbors: {1, 2, 4, 12}
- Node 16 neighbors: {0, 5, 13}
- Node 17 neighbors: {18}
- Node 18 neighbors: {8, 14, 17, 19}
- Node 19 neighbors: {9, 18}

Now, we look at the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 14, Node 15, Node 18 have 4 or more neighbors. We'll calculate \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 \times 5 = 20 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (5, 11, 15)>
- <2, (9, 12, 15)>
- <14, (1, 7, 18)>
- <15, (1, 4, 12)>
- <18, (8, 14, 19)>
