Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 6}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 6, 7}

Next, we will identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a single 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
  - <1, (0, 2, 4)>
  - <1, (0, 2, 7)>
  - <1, (2, 4, 7)>
  - <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
  - <2, (0, 1, 3)>
  - <2, (0, 1, 6)>
  - <2, (0, 3, 6)>
  - <2, (0, 1, 7)>
  - <2, (0, 6, 7)>
  - <2, (1, 3, 7)>
  - <2, (1, 6, 7)>
  - <2, (3, 6, 7)>
  - <2, (1, 4, 7)>
  - <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars:
  - <3, (2, 5, 6)>
  - <3, (2, 5, 7)>
  - <3, (2, 6, 7)>
  - <3, (2, 6, 9)>
  - <3, (5, 6, 9)>
  - <3, (5, 7, 9)>
  - <3, (6, 7, 9)>
  - <3, (7, 8, 9)>
  - <3, (5, 8, 9)>
  - <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars:
  - <6, (2, 4, 8)>
  - <6, (2, 7, 8)>
  - <6, (3, 4, 6)>
  - <6, (3, 4, 8)>
  - <6, (3, 7, 8)>
  - <6, (3, 6, 7)>
  - <6, (3, 6, 9)>
  - <6, (4, 7, 8)>
  - <6, (4, 6, 8)>
  - <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars:
  - <7, (0, 1, 9)>
  - <7, (2, 3, 9)>
  - <7, (2, 6, 9)>
  - <7, (3, 6, 9)>
  - <7, (3, 5, 9)>
  - <7, (3, 8, 9)>
  - <7, (5, 8, 9)>
  - <7, (6, 8, 9)>
  - <7, (4, 6, 8)>
  - <7, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars:
  - <9, (0, 5, 7)>
  - <9, (0, 5, 8)>
  - <9, (0, 6, 7)>
  - <9, (0, 6, 8)>
  - <9, (3, 5, 8)>
  - <9, (3, 6, 7)>
  - <9, (3, 6, 8)>
  - <9, (5, 6, 8)>
  - <9, (7, 8, 9)>
  - <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 55
Therefore, the final number is [55].
