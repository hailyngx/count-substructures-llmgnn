Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, we'll find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5, 6}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors → \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 4 neighbors → \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: 4 neighbors → \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 5 neighbors → \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 neighbors → \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 4 neighbors → \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 neighbors → \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 5 neighbors → \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors → \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 44

So, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>
