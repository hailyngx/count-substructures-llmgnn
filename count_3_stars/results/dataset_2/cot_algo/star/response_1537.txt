Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 3: {4, 12}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 8, 12}
- Node 8: {1, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 8, 10}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 9, 10}
- Node 14: {0, 5, 6, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed from each of these nodes:

- Node 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 14 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 5 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 5 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [17]

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 1, 14>
- <1, 2, 7>
- <2, 6, 12>
- <6, 10, 13>
- <6, 12, 14>
- <12, 3, 4>
