Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 4) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 13) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 10) (1, 9) (1, 13) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {9, 13}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {7, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 8, 12}
- Node 10: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 11: {5, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 11>
<0, 4, 12>
<0, 4, 14>
<0, 11, 12>
<0, 11, 14>
<0, 12, 14>
<3, 7, 12>
<3, 7, 14>
<3, 9, 12>
<3, 9, 13>
<4, 10, 12>
<4, 10, 14>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 8, 11>
<7, 10, 12>
<9, 12, 13>
