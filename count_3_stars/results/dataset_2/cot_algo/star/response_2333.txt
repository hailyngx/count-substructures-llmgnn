Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 9) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 15) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 19) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 18) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 5) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 19) (19, 9) (19, 17) (19, 11) (5, 14) (5, 17) (5, 12) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 18) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 10) (12, 0) (12, 5) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 16) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 10) (18, 13) (18, 6) (18, 10) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:

Node 0: {14, 7, 17, 12}
Node 1: {15}
Node 2: {7, 16, 10}
Node 3: {7, 9}
Node 4: {15, 8, 11}
Node 5: {14, 17, 12}
Node 6: {14, 7, 18}
Node 7: {3, 0, 14, 6, 2}
Node 8: {4, 9, 11}
Node 9: {3, 8, 19}
Node 10: {2, 18, 16}
Node 11: {4, 8, 19}
Node 12: {0, 5}
Node 13: {15, 16, 18}
Node 14: {0, 6, 7, 5}
Node 15: {1, 13, 4}
Node 16: {2, 13, 10}
Node 17: {0, 19, 5}
Node 18: {13, 6, 10}
Node 19: {9, 17, 11}

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

\( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26$

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (7, 14, 17)>
- <4, (8, 15, 11)>
- <7, (0, 6, 14)>
- <14, (0, 5, 7)>
- <17, (0, 5, 19)>
