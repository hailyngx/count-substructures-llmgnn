Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 15) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 2) (26, 25) (26, 8) (5, 23) (5, 1) (5, 16) (14, 24) (17, 16) (17, 28) (17, 23) (17, 2) (18, 27) (18, 0) (18, 12) (22, 11) (22, 20) (22, 3) (3, 22) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 6) (3, 29) (25, 26) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 4) (0, 18) (0, 29) (0, 1) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 20) (13, 15) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 10) (20, 22) (20, 13) (20, 11) (29, 3) (29, 0) (29, 12) (21, 13) (8, 26) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 16) (4, 25) (12, 18) (12, 29) (28, 17) (11, 22) (11, 20) (11, 24) (11, 19) (11, 2) (24, 14) (24, 3) (24, 11) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 19) (2, 26) (2, 17) (2, 6) (2, 11) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 23) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 27) (7, 6) (7, 27) (27, 18) (27, 16) (27, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 18, 29}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 19}
- Node 2: {6, 11, 17, 26}
- Node 3: {6, 22, 24, 25, 29}
- Node 4: {25}
- Node 5: {1, 16, 17, 23}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 7, 16}
- Node 7: {6, 27}
- Node 8: {26}
- Node 9: {15, 26}
- Node 10: {15}
- Node 11: {2, 19, 20, 22, 24}
- Node 12: {18, 29}
- Node 13: {15, 20, 21, 26}
- Node 14: {24}
- Node 15: {9, 10, 13}
- Node 16: {1, 6, 17, 27}
- Node 17: {2, 5, 16, 23, 28}
- Node 18: {0, 27}
- Node 19: {1, 11, 23}
- Node 20: {11, 13, 22}
- Node 21: {13}
- Node 22: {3, 11, 20}
- Node 23: {5, 17, 19, 25}
- Node 24: {3, 11, 14}
- Node 25: {3, 4, 23, 26}
- Node 26: {2, 8, 9, 13, 25}
- Node 27: {16, 18, 7}
- Node 28: {17}
- Node 29: {0, 3, 12}

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: []
- Node 1: []
- Node 2: []
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: []
- Node 5: []
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: []
- Node 8: []
- Node 9: []
- Node 10: []
- Node 11: [1]
- Node 12: []
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 14: []
- Node 15: [1]
- Node 16: []
- Node 17: []
- Node 18: []
- Node 19: []
- Node 20: []
- Node 21: []
- Node 22: []
- Node 23: [1]
- Node 24: []
- Node 25: [1]
- Node 26: [1]
- Node 27: []
- Node 28: []
- Node 29: []

There are 5 unique 3-stars found in this graph: <3, (6, 24, 11)>, <6, (1, 16, 5)>, <11, (2, 19, 23)>, <13, (15, 20, 26)>, <23, (5, 17, 25)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
