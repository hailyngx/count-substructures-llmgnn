Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 4) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 10) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 8) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 13) (18, 9) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 17) (12, 7) (0, 10) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 13) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 4) (9, 18) (9, 4) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 1) (4, 16) (4, 19) (4, 9) (4, 6) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 14) (6, 11) (6, 10) (6, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {10, 14}
- Node 1: {5, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 13, 16}
- Node 3: {10, 11, 14, 15, 17}
- Node 4: {6, 9, 16, 19}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 10}
- Node 6: {4, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {1, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {7, 16, 17, 19}
- Node 9: {4, 18}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 5, 6, 15}
- Node 11: {3, 6, 17}
- Node 12: {7, 17}
- Node 13: {2, 14, 18}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 7, 13}
- Node 15: {3, 10}
- Node 16: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 17: {3, 11, 12, 17}
- Node 18: {9, 13}
- Node 19: {4, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 3 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 17 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 40. 

Therefore, the final answer is [40], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (10, 14, 15)>
- <4, (6, 16, 19)>
- <5, (1, 10, 2)>
- <7, (8, 12, 14)>
- <8, (16, 17, 19)>
- <10, (0, 6, 15)>
- <11, (6, 17, 3)>
- <13, (2, 14, 18)>
- <14, (0, 7, 3)>
- <16, (2, 4, 8)>
- <17, (3, 11, 12)>
