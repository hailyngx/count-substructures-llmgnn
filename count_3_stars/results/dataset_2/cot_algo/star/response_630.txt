Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0 neighbors: 5, 9, 6, 2
Node 1 neighbors: 5, 9, 2 
Node 2 neighbors: 9, 4, 6, 0, 1, 3
Node 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 8, 6, 2
Node 4 neighbors: 8, 7, 6, 2, 3
Node 5 neighbors: 6, 1, 0
Node 6 neighbors: 5, 4, 3, 2, 0
Node 7 neighbors: 9, 3, 8
Node 8 neighbors: 4, 7, 3
Node 9 neighbors: 2, 1, 7, 0

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 4, 6}. So, we have one 3-star: <2, (9, 4, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
