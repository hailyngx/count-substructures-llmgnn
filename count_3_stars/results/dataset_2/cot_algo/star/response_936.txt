Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7
Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 8
Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 7
Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 6: 4, 5
Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8
Node 8: 1, 7
Node 9: 3, 4, 5

Now, we will identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
Node 5: \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20 3-stars
Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 54, so [54].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
