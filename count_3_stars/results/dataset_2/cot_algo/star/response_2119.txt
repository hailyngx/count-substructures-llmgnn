Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 0) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 12) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 9) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 14) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (14, 2) (14, 10) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {13, 6, 12}
- Node 1: {13, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 8, 6, 4, 14}
- Node 3: {10, 2, 5}
- Node 4: {5, 2, 11, 10}
- Node 5: {3, 13, 6, 4, 10}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {8, 6, 11, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 13, 2, 9, 7, 11}
- Node 9: {1, 8, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 9, 12, 4, 14}
- Node 11: {8, 7, 4}
- Node 12: {0, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 8, 5, 0}
- Node 14: {2, 10}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves {3, 8, 14} <2, (3, 8, 14)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves {3, 13, 6} <5, (3, 13, 6)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves {1, 13, 9} <8, (1, 13, 9)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with leaves {3, 5, 9} <10, (3, 5, 9)>

Since there is only one 3-star for each of the identified nodes, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
