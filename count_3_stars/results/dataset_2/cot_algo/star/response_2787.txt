Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 13) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 3) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 13) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 5) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 12) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 7) (12, 10) (19, 15) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 16) (17, 5) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 13) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 16) (8, 6) (8, 10) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 14) (7, 9) (7, 15) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (14, 16) (14, 13) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated as follows:

For each node, we determine its neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 17, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 13, 16}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 18}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 10, 11, 18}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 18, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors {11, 17, 16}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 8, 9, 17}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9, 15}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 10}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 7, 13, 15}
- Node 10: Neighbors {3, 8, 12, 15}
- Node 11: Neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 12: Neighbors {10}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {13, 16}
- Node 15: Neighbors {9, 10, 7, 19}
- Node 16: Neighbors {1, 5, 14, 17}
- Node 17: Neighbors {6, 0, 16, 5}
- Node 18: Neighbors {2, 3, 4}
- Node 19: Neighbors {15}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 10, 15)>, 
<3, (0, 10, 13)>,
<3, (0, 11, 10)>, 
<3, (10, 13, 14)>, 
<4, (6, 13, 18)>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
