Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 28) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 19) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 5) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 9) (17, 23) (3, 25) (3, 29) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 15) (18, 22) (18, 14) (8, 3) (8, 23) (8, 5) (23, 14) (23, 17) (23, 8) (23, 2) (15, 25) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 11) (20, 17) (20, 11) (5, 14) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 27) (6, 21) (6, 29) (6, 10) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 4) (26, 19) (26, 10) (26, 4) (19, 22) (19, 26) (19, 0) (29, 17) (29, 3) (29, 6) (4, 1) (4, 26) (4, 24) (27, 5) (27, 28) (27, 16) (0, 19) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 21) (7, 0) (7, 24) (7, 2) (21, 6) (21, 0) (21, 11) (16, 27) (16, 0) (2, 22) (2, 23) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 10) (12, 10) (9, 17) (9, 15) (28, 13) (28, 27) (10, 6) (10, 26) (10, 2) (10, 12) (24, 4) (24, 7) (11, 15) (11, 20) (11, 21) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {19, 7, 21, 16}
- Node 1: {14, 2, 4}
- Node 2: {22, 23, 1, 7, 10}
- Node 3: {25, 29, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 26, 24}
- Node 5: {14, 8, 15, 27}
- Node 6: {21, 29, 10}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 24}
- Node 8: {3, 23, 5}
- Node 9: {17, 15}
- Node 10: {6, 26, 2, 12}
- Node 11: {15, 20, 21}
- Node 12: {10}
- Node 13: {22, 28}
- Node 14: {1, 18, 23, 5}
- Node 15: {25, 9, 5, 11}
- Node 16: {27, 0}
- Node 17: {29, 20, 9, 23}
- Node 18: {22, 14}
- Node 19: {26, 0, 22}
- Node 20: {17, 11}
- Node 21: {6, 0, 11}
- Node 22: {13, 18, 2, 19}
- Node 23: {14, 17, 8, 2}
- Node 24: {4, 7}
- Node 25: {3, 15}
- Node 26: {19, 4, 10}
- Node 27: {5, 16, 28}
- Node 28: {13, 27}
- Node 29: {17, 3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <2, (1, 4, 26)>
- <5, (8, 14, 15)>
- <7, (0, 2, 24)>
- <10, (2, 6, 26)>
- <14, (1, 5, 23)>
- <15, (3, 9, 17)>
- <17, (9, 20, 29)>
- <23, (2, 8, 14)>
- <26, (4, 10, 19)>
