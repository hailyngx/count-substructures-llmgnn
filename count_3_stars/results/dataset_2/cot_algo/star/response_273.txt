Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 7, 8, 3}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 2, 9}
- Node 2: {7, 1, 8}
- Node 3: {9, 4, 0}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 0, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 0, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 1, 3, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 4 and Node 9 both have 6 neighbors, so they can form 6 3-stars each.
- Node 7 and Node 8 both have 5 neighbors, so they can form 10 3-stars each.
- Node 0 and Node 1 both have 5 neighbors, so they can form 10 3-stars each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6 + 6 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [42].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph:
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (1, 7, 8)>
- <7, (2, 1, 4)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
