Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 2) (8, 17) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 1) (0, 19) (3, 12) (11, 7) (5, 12) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 14) (4, 13) (4, 15) (4, 17) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 15) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 16) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 16) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 17) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 18) (19, 0) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 10) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 14) (16, 1) (16, 6) (10, 19) (10, 18) (10, 14) (18, 15) (18, 10) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: [2, 1, 15, 19]
Node 1: [0, 6, 16]
Node 2: [8, 0, 9, 13]
Node 3: [12]
Node 4: [13, 15, 17]
Node 5: [12]
Node 6: [1, 17, 16]
Node 7: [11, 19, 9, 17]
Node 8: [2, 17]
Node 9: [2, 7, 14]
Node 10: [19, 18, 14]
Node 11: [7]
Node 12: [3, 5, 17, 15]
Node 13: [2, 4, 14]
Node 14: [13, 9, 10]
Node 15: [0, 4, 12, 19, 18]
Node 16: [1, 6]
Node 17: [8, 4, 12, 6, 7]
Node 18: [15, 10]
Node 19: [0, 7, 15, 10]

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [26].
