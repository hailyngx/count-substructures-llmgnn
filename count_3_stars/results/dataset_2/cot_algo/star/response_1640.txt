Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 5) (11, 8) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 16) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 4) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 15) (7, 0) (7, 16) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 9) (12, 18) (18, 1) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 13) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 17) (19, 18) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 9) (15, 0) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 14) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 18) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can represent the graph as follows:

```
     1---9
    /|  /|
   8 |  |18
  /  |  |/
 8---2---19
 | / | /
11   16
 |   /|
 2--13-6
 |/  
 16  
/|
0-7
|/
15
```

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 8, 9, and 18. Thus, there is 1 3-star.
2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 8, 13, 16, and 19. Thus, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <2, (8, 13, 16)>, <2, (8, 13, 19)>, <2, (8, 16, 19)>, <2, (13, 16, 19)>.
3. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3, 9, 10, and 17. Thus, there are 4 3-stars: <4, (3, 9, 10)>, <4, (3, 9, 17)>, <4, (3, 10, 17)>, <4, (9, 10, 17)>.
4. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 6, 10, 18, and 18. Thus, there are 4 3-stars: <5, (6, 10, 18)>, <5, (6, 18, 18)>, <5, (10, 18, 18)>, <5, (6, 10, 18)>.
5. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 11, and 16. Thus, there are 4 3-stars: <8, (1, 2, 11)>, <8, (1, 2, 16)>, <8, (1, 11, 16)>, <8, (2, 11, 16)>.
6. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 14, and 16. Thus, there are 4 3-stars: <9, (1, 4, 14)>, <9, (1, 4, 16)>, <9, (1, 14, 16)>, <9, (4, 14, 16)>.
7. Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, and 18. Thus, there is 1 3-star.
8. Node 16 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 7, 9, and 16. Thus, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <16, (0, 2, 7)>, <16, (0, 2, 9)>, <16, (0, 2, 16)>, <16, (0, 7, 9)>, <16, (0, 7, 16)>, <16, (0, 9, 16)>, <16, (2, 7, 9)>, <16, (2, 7, 16)>, <16, (2, 9, 16)>, <16, (7, 9, 16)>.
9. Node 18 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 12, 13, and 19. Thus, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <18, (1, 5, 12)>, <18, (1, 5, 13)>, <18, (1, 5, 19)>, <18, (1, 12, 13)>, <18, (1, 12, 19)>, <18, (1, 13, 19)>, <18, (5, 12, 13)>, <18, (5, 12, 19)>, <18, (5, 13, 19)>, <18, (12, 13, 19)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 42. 
So, the final answer is [42].
