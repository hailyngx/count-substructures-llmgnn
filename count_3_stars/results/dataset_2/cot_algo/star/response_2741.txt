Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 14) (10, 15) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 18) (11, 6) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 7) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 0) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 0) (16, 17) (16, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 4) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 4) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 13) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 0) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 19) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 17) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors -> {18, 12, 9, 19}
- Node 1: Neighbors -> {6, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors -> {18, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors -> {15, 5, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors -> {16, 14, 17, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors -> {3, 7, 17}
- Node 6: Neighbors -> {11, 2, 1, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors -> {2, 12, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors -> {10, 13, 0}
- Node 10: Neighbors -> {15, 9, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors -> {18, 6}
- Node 12: Neighbors -> {3, 7, 0}
- Node 13: Neighbors -> {1, 9, 4, 19}
- Node 14: Neighbors -> {15, 10, 6, 4}
- Node 15: Neighbors -> {3, 10, 14}
- Node 16: Neighbors -> {17, 4}
- Node 17: Neighbors -> {16, 19, 5, 4}
- Node 18: Neighbors -> {11, 2, 0}
- Node 19: Neighbors -> {17, 13, 0}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 3, Node 5, Node 7, Node 9, Node 10, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up all the 3-stars: 
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 20 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (15, 5, 12)>
- <5, (3, 7, 17)>
- <7, (2, 12, 5)>
- <9, (10, 13, 0)>
- <10, (15, 9, 14)>
- <12, (3, 7, 0)>
- <13, (1, 9, 4)>
- <14, (15, 10, 6)>
- <15, (3, 10, 14)>
- <17, (16, 19, 5)>
- <18, (11, 2, 0)>
- <19, (17, 13, 0)>
