Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 11) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 1) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 12, 13, 14, 2
- Node 1: 6, 7, 9, 10, 11
- Node 2: 0, 8, 13
- Node 3: 4, 8, 10
- Node 4: 3, 7, 9, 11, 14
- Node 5: 6, 7, 13, 14
- Node 6: 1, 5, 12
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5
- Node 8: 2, 3, 10, 13
- Node 9: 1, 4, 11, 12
- Node 10: 1, 3, 8
- Node 11: 1, 4, 9, 13
- Node 12: 6, 9, 13
- Node 13: 0, 2, 5, 11, 12, 14
- Node 14: 0, 4, 5, 8, 13

Next, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 5, Node 14, and Node 13 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.
- Node 4 and Node 1 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars as well.

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars:
- Using the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \):
  - For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - For Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - For Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  - For Node 4: 1 3-star
  - For Node 1: 1 3-star

Adding them up, we get a total of 30 3-stars. So, the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (6, 7, 13)>, <14, (0, 4, 13)>, <13, (0, 12, 14)>, <13, (0, 5, 14)>, <13, (2, 11, 12)>, <13, (2, 8, 11)>, <4, (7, 9, 11)>, <1, (6, 10, 11)>
