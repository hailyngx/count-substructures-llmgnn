Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 6) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 11) (19, 15) (19, 12) (7, 14) (7, 18) (16, 2) (16, 13) (16, 10) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 19) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 18) (0, 2) (0, 17) (0, 3) (0, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 10) (9, 1) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 18) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 1) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 1) (11, 8) (11, 17) (12, 19) 

Response:
Given the information provided, here are the steps to find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Create a list of neighbors for each node:
   - Node 0: {2, 3, 17, 1}
   - Node 1: {0, 9, 14, 18}
   - Node 2: {8, 4, 16, 3, 0}
   - Node 3: {2, 0, 10, 18}
   - Node 4: {2, 6}
   - Node 5: {8, 13, 15, 14}
   - Node 6: {13, 4, 10}
   - Node 7: {14, 18}
   - Node 8: {2, 5, 11}
   - Node 9: {1}
   - Node 10: {16, 3, 6}
   - Node 11: {8, 17}
   - Node 12: {19}
   - Node 13: {5, 17, 16, 6}
   - Node 14: {5, 7, 1}
   - Node 15: {5, 17, 19}
   - Node 16: {2, 13, 10}
   - Node 17: {13, 0, 15, 11}
   - Node 18: {7, 3, 1}
   - Node 19: {15, 12}

2. Identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:
   - Node 0: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 2: 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   - Node 5: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 13: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 14: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star

3. Sum up the total number of 3-stars:
   Total = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 17, 1)>
<2, (8, 4, 16)>
<2, (8, 5, 3)>
<2, (8, 16, 0)>
<2, (4, 16, 3)>
<5, (8, 13, 15)>
<5, (13, 17, 15)>
<5, (13, 17, 19)>
<13, (5, 17, 16)>
<13, (5, 17, 11)>
<13, (5, 16, 6)>
<13, (17, 16, 6)>
<14, (5, 7, 1)>
<15, (5, 17, 19)>
<16, (2, 13, 10)>
