Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (12, 7) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 10}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 9, 14}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {9, 11, 13}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 2, 11}
- Node 11: {8, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {7, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}

Next, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: No 3-star
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 14: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 74

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [74].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 10, 13)>
<1, (3, 9, 14)>
<4, (5, 7, 14)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 12)>
<9, (1, 6, 13)>
<10, (0, 2, 11)>
<13, (0, 8, 11)>
<14, (3, 6, 7)>
