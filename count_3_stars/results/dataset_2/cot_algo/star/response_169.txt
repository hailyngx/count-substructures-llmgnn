Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 24) (22, 1) (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 29) (6, 25) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 24) (9, 7) (10, 26) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 29) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 5) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 2) (20, 26) (20, 8) (20, 27) (0, 15) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 15) (2, 0) (2, 5) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 8) (28, 26) (28, 7) (28, 19) (26, 10) (26, 20) (26, 28) (26, 29) (4, 9) (4, 15) (4, 27) (4, 5) (27, 10) (27, 20) (27, 4) (21, 6) (21, 18) (7, 9) (7, 28) (7, 24) (7, 8) (16, 19) (3, 12) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 1) (12, 3) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 4) (23, 17) (29, 6) (29, 10) (29, 26) (8, 20) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 25) (18, 11) (18, 21) (18, 14) (18, 25) (24, 22) (24, 9) (24, 7) (24, 1) (1, 22) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 24) (25, 6) (25, 8) (25, 18) (19, 17) (19, 28) (19, 16) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 15}
- Node 1: {0, 10, 14, 22, 24}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 15}
- Node 3: {12}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 15, 27}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 17}
- Node 6: {9, 21, 25, 29}
- Node 7: {8, 9, 24, 28}
- Node 8: {7, 11, 20, 25}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 7, 24}
- Node 10: {1, 20, 26, 27, 29}
- Node 11: {8, 14, 18}
- Node 12: {3}
- Node 13: {22}
- Node 14: {1, 11, 18}
- Node 15: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 16: {19}
- Node 17: {5, 19, 23}
- Node 18: {11, 14, 21, 25}
- Node 19: {16, 17, 28}
- Node 20: {8, 10, 26, 27}
- Node 21: {6, 18}
- Node 22: {1, 13, 24}
- Node 23: {17}
- Node 24: {1, 7, 9, 22}
- Node 25: {6, 8, 18}
- Node 26: {10, 20, 28, 29}
- Node 27: {4, 10, 20}
- Node 28: {7, 19, 26}
- Node 29: {6, 10, 26}

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 and Node 24 both have 4 neighbors, so they each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10, Node 26, and Node 29 each have 4 neighbors, so they each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9, Node 18, and Node 20 each have 5 neighbors, so they each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 24, 22>
- <1, 24, 7>
- <1, 24, 9>
- <1, 24, 22>
- <10, 26, 28>
- <10, 26, 29>
- <10, 26, 20>
- <10, 26, 27>
- <26, 20, 27>
- <26, 20, 10>
- <26, 20, 27>
- <26, 20, 8>
- <9, 24, 7>
- <9, 24, 22>
- <9, 24, 1>
- <9, 24, 7>
- <9, 24, 1>
- <18, 11, 8>
- <18, 11, 14>
- <18, 11, 25>
- <18, 11, 14>
- <18, 25, 6>
