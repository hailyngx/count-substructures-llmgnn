Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 19) (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 15) (9, 5) (1, 13) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 19) (18, 17) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 14) (19, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 15) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 13) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 19) (13, 1) (13, 15) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 18) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will now identify the 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's first list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 12}
- Node 1: {13}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 10}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 8, 12, 17}
- Node 5: {9, 15, 17}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 15}
- Node 7: {8, 12, 14, 15}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 7, 12}
- Node 9: {5}
- Node 10: {2, 12, 19}
- Node 11: {14, 16, 17, 19}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 15}
- Node 14: {7, 11, 19}
- Node 15: {5, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 16: {11, 19}
- Node 17: {4, 5, 11, 18}
- Node 18: {17}
- Node 19: {10, 11, 14, 16}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.

Summing up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (3, 8, 12)>
<6, (0, 2, 15)>
<7, (8, 12, 14)>
<8, (2, 4, 12)>
<11, (14, 16, 17)>
<12, (0, 7, 10)>
<15, (5, 6, 13)>
<17, (4, 5, 18)>
<19, (10, 11, 14)>
