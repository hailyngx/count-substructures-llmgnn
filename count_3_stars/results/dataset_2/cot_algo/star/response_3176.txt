Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 19) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 15) (0, 13) (0, 2) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 17) (10, 4) (10, 15) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 17) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 3) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 1) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (14, 1) (16, 18) (16, 13) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 15) (6, 8) (6, 13) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 14) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 6) 

Response:
The 3-star graph can be determined by examining the neighbors of each node.

Node 0 has 2 neighbors: {2, 13}
Node 1 has 5 neighbors: {5, 9, 14, 18, 19}
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: {0, 7}
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {7, 11, 12, 19}
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {8, 9, 10, 17}
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {9, 12, 1}
Node 6 has 2 neighbors: {8, 13}
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {2, 3, 17}
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {4, 6, 12}
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {5, 4, 1, 19}
Node 10 has 2 neighbors: {4, 15}
Node 11 has 3 neighbors: {3, 13, 15}
Node 12 has 3 neighbors: {5, 8, 3}
Node 13 has 4 neighbors: {11, 0, 16, 6}
Node 14 has 1 neighbor: {1}
Node 15 has 3 neighbors: {11, 10, 17}
Node 16 has 2 neighbors: {18, 13}
Node 17 has 3 neighbors: {4, 7, 15}
Node 18 has 3 neighbors: {19, 1, 16}
Node 19 has 4 neighbors: {9, 3, 18, 1}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 and Node 19 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars each.
- Node 4, Node 9, and Node 13 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars each.

The total number of unique 3-stars is \(10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32\), thus the final answer is [32].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 9, 18)>
<1, (5, 9, 19)>
<1, (5, 14, 18)>
<1, (5, 14, 19)>
<1, (9, 18, 19)>
<1, (14, 18, 19)>
<4, (8, 10, 17)>
<4, (8, 10, 15)>
<4, (8, 17, 15)>
<4, (10, 17, 15)>
<9, (5, 12, 19)>
<9, (9, 4, 19)>
<9, (9, 4, 1)>
<9, (9, 19, 1)>
<13, (11, 0, 16)>
<13, (11, 16, 6)>
<13, (0, 16, 6)>
<19, (1, 18, 16)>
<19, (1, 16, 13)>
<19, (1, 18, 13)>
<19, (18, 16, 13)>
