Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 11) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 12) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph information, let's first calculate the degree of each node:

- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 3

Now, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 2, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 2: {7, 8, 5, 13, 0}
- Node 3: {9, 14, 12}
- Node 4: {7, 13, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {7, 2, 13}
- Node 6: {4, 0, 11, 14, 12}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 9, 10, 1}
- Node 9: {8, 10, 3, 1, 12}
- Node 10: {8, 13, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 6, 12}
- Node 12: {9, 11, 3, 6}
- Node 13: {4, 2, 5, 10}
- Node 14: {10, 3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 5 3-stars

\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = 1 + 4 + 5 = 10 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (7, 8, 10)>
<6, (4, 0, 11)>
<6, (4, 14, 12)>
<6, (0, 11, 12)>
<6, (11, 12, 3)>
<9, (8, 10, 13)>
<9, (8, 10, 14)>
<9, (10, 13, 5)>
<9, (10, 13, 4)>
<9, (10, 13, 2)>
