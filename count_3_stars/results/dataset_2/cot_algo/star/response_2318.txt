Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 7) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 23) (14, 15) (14, 23) (14, 21) (17, 22) (17, 7) (1, 6) (3, 21) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 26) (25, 6) (25, 12) (4, 8) (4, 21) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 6) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 22) (11, 5) (28, 8) (28, 11) (28, 2) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 26) (5, 16) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (21, 14) (21, 3) (21, 4) (21, 10) (21, 29) (29, 20) (29, 21) (29, 9) (29, 19) (9, 13) (9, 29) (9, 19) (9, 24) (9, 0) (10, 21) (10, 24) (10, 16) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 2) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 0) (26, 25) (26, 5) (6, 1) (6, 25) (6, 8) (6, 24) (24, 9) (24, 10) (24, 6) (18, 23) (23, 27) (23, 14) (23, 18) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 2) (19, 29) (19, 9) (22, 17) (22, 11) (12, 25) (2, 28) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

1: {6}
2: {0, 7, 28}
3: {5, 8, 13, 21}
4: {8, 21}
5: {3, 5, 11, 16, 26}
6: {1, 8, 24, 25}
7: {2, 15, 17}
8: {3, 4, 6, 28}
9: {0, 13, 19, 24, 29}
10: {16, 21, 24}
11: {5, 11, 20, 22, 28}
12: {25}
13: {0, 3, 9}
14: {15, 21, 23}
15: {7, 14, 27}
16: {0, 5, 10}
17: {7, 22}
18: {23}
19: {9, 29}
20: {11, 25, 29}
21: {3, 4, 10, 14, 29}
22: {11, 17}
23: {14, 18, 27}
24: {6, 9, 10}
25: {6, 11, 12, 20, 26}
26: {5, 25}
27: {15, 23}
28: {2, 8, 11}
29: {9, 19, 20, 21}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors {0, 7, 28} forming a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors {5, 8, 13, 21} forming 4 3-stars: <3, (5, 8, 13)>, <3, (5, 8, 21)>, <3, (13, 8, 21)>, <3, (5, 13, 21)>.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors {3, 5, 11, 16, 26} forming 10 3-stars: <5, (3, 11, 16)>, <5, (3, 11, 26)>, <5, (3, 16, 26)>, <5, (11, 16, 26)>, <5, (3, 5, 11)>, <5, (3, 5, 16)>, <5, (3, 5, 26)>, <5, (11, 5, 16)>, <5, (11, 5, 26)>, <5, (16, 5, 26)>.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors {3, 4, 6, 28} forming 4 3-stars: <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 28)>, <8, (3, 6, 28)>, <8, (4, 6, 28)>.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors {0, 13, 19, 24, 29} forming 10 3-stars: <9, (0, 13, 19)>, <9, (0, 13, 24)>, <9, (0, 13, 29)>, <9, (0, 19, 24)>, <9, (0, 19, 29)>, <9, (0, 24, 29)>, <9, (13, 19, 24)>, <9, (13, 19, 29)>, <9, (13, 24, 29)>, <9, (19, 24, 29)>.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors {5, 11, 20, 22, 28} forming 10 3-stars: <11, (5, 20, 28)>, <11, (5, 22, 28)>, <11, (5, 11, 20)>, <11, (5, 11, 22)>, <11, (5, 20, 22)>, <11, (20, 22, 28)>, <11, (20, 5, 28)>, <11, (5, 11, 28)>, <11, (11, 22, 28)>, <11, (11, 20, 28)>.
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors {3, 4, 10, 14, 29} forming 10 3-stars: <21, (3, 10, 29)>, <21, (3, 10, 14)>, <21, (3, 10, 4)>, <21, (3, 14, 29)>, <21, (3, 14, 4)>, <21, (3, 29, 4)>, <21, (10, 14, 29)>, <21, (10, 14, 4)>, <21, (10, 29, 4)>, <21, (14, 29, 4)>.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors {6, 11, 12, 20, 26} forming 10 3-stars: <25, (11, 20, 26)>, <25, (11, 12, 26)>, <25, (11, 12, 20)>, <25, (11, 6, 26)>, <25, (11, 6, 20)>, <25, (20, 12, 26)>, <25, (20, 12, 6)>, <25, (20, 6, 26)>, <25, (12, 6, 26)>, <25, (11, 6, 12)>.

Counting all these unique 3-stars, we find a total of 49 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [49].
