Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 8) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 4) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 7}
- Node 1: {7, 10, 11}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 6: {0, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 5, 6, 11}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 12: {2, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {3, 4, 9, 12}

Next, we identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: There is only 1 3-star with node 5.
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: There is only 1 3-star with node 8.
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: There is only 1 3-star with node 12.
- Node 13: There is only 1 3-star with node 13.
- Node 14: There is only 1 3-star with node 14.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 10 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 65. Therefore, the final answer is [65].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (4, 12, 13)>
- <3, (7, 9, 14)>
- <5, (2, 10, 11)>
- <7, (1, 8, 11)>
- <11, (1, 7, 10)>
