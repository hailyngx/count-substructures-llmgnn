Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 2) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 14) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 3, 7, 2}
- Node 1: {5, 14, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {9, 6, 11, 7, 13, 0}
- Node 3: {9, 0, 13, 5}
- Node 4: {9, 1, 10, 7}
- Node 5: {13, 8, 1, 0, 10}
- Node 6: {2, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 12, 0, 2, 13}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 1, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {4, 2, 3}
- Node 10: {5, 11, 4}
- Node 11: {10, 2, 14}
- Node 12: {7, 13, 14, 8}
- Node 13: {5, 3, 7, 12, 2}
- Node 14: {1, 11, 12, 8}

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: Node 8, Node 13
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: None

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 7 nodes * 4 3-stars = 28 3-stars
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 2 nodes * 10 3-stars = 20 3-stars

Adding them together, we have a total of 28 + 20 = 48 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 3, 7)>
<1, (5, 14, 4)>
<2, (9, 6, 11)>
<3, (9, 0, 13)>
<4, (9, 1, 10)>
<5, (13, 8, 1)>
<7, (4, 12, 0)>
<8, (5, 6, 1)>
<13, (5, 3, 7)>
