Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [42]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- <6, (2, 3, 8)>
