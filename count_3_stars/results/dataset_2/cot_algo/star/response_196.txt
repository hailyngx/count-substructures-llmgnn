Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 14) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 2) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 12) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 3, 6, 8, 10, 14
- Node 2: 10, 12, 13
- Node 3: 0, 1, 7, 9, 14
- Node 4: 0, 8, 12
- Node 5: 0, 13, 14
- Node 6: 1, 8, 9, 11
- Node 7: 0, 3, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13
- Node 9: 3, 6, 7, 9, 10
- Node 10: 1, 2, 9, 11
- Node 11: 6, 8, 10, 14
- Node 12: 2, 4, 13
- Node 13: 2, 5, 8, 12, 14
- Node 14: 1, 3, 5, 11, 13

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

\[ \text{Node 0} \Rightarrow \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Node 1} \Rightarrow \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Node 3} \Rightarrow \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Node 8} \Rightarrow \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]
\[ \text{Node 9} \Rightarrow \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Node 13} \Rightarrow \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

Now sum up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 64

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [64].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, 4, 7>
- <1, 3, 14>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <8, 11, 13>
- <9, 6, 10>
- <13, 5, 14>
