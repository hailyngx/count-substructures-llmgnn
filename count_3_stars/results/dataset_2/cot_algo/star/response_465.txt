Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 16) (6, 14) (6, 13) (9, 16) (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 1) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 16) (10, 14) (11, 10) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 8) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 1) (8, 15) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 19) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 12) (17, 13) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 12) (12, 1) (12, 17) (0, 10) (0, 17) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 8) (19, 13) (19, 14) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 19) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: 7, 5, 17, 12

2: 3, 18, 8

3: 15, 2, 15

4: 7, 18

5: 18, 1

6: 14, 13

7: 15, 4, 14, 8, 1

8: 15, 7, 2, 16

9: 16

10: 15, 11, 0, 16, 14

11: 10

12: 1, 17

13: 6, 17, 19

14: 6, 7, 10, 19

15: 3, 10, 7, 8, 16

16: 15, 9, 10, 8

17: 13, 1, 0, 12

18: 4, 2, 5

19: 13, 14

Now, we need to find the number of 3-stars in this graph. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes by applying the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

1: 4 choose 3 = 4

2: 3 choose 3 = 1

3: 3 choose 3 = 1

4: 2 choose 3 = 0

5: 2 choose 3 = 0

7: 5 choose 3 = 10

8: 4 choose 3 = 4

10: 5 choose 3 = 10

12: 2 choose 3 = 0

13: 3 choose 3 = 1

14: 4 choose 3 = 4

15: 5 choose 3 = 10

16: 4 choose 3 = 4

17: 4 choose 3 = 4

18: 3 choose 3 = 1

Now, sum up the total number of 3-stars: 
4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (7, 5, 17)>
<2, (3, 18, 8)>
<3, (15, 2, 16)>
<7, (15, 4, 14)>
<7, (15, 8, 16)>
<10, (15, 11, 14)>
<13, (6, 17, 19)>
<14, (6, 7, 19)>
<15, (3, 7, 8)>
<15, (10, 7, 16)>
<16, (15, 9, 10)>
<17, (13, 1, 12)>
<18, (4, 2, 5)>
