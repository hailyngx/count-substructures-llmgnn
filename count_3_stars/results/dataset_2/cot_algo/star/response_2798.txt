- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 13, 21, 22}, degree 4
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 7, 23}, degree 3
- Node 5: Neighbors {13, 16, 17}, degree 3
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 10, 13, 14, 18}, degree 5
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 6, 25}, degree 3
- Node 8: Neighbors {19, 25}, degree 2
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 12}, degree 2
- Node 10: Neighbors {6, 15, 22, 29}, degree 4
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 12, 14, 28}, degree 4
- Node 12: Neighbors {9, 11, 25}, degree 3
- Node 13: Neighbors {3, 5, 6}, degree 3
- Node 14: Neighbors {6, 11, 29}, degree 3
- Node 15: Neighbors {10, 21, 23}, degree 3
- Node 16: Neighbors {5, 19, 28}, degree 3
- Node 17: Neighbors {5}, degree 1
- Node 18: Neighbors {2, 6, 22, 24}, degree 4
- Node 19: Neighbors {0, 1, 8, 16}, degree 4
- Node 20: Neighbors {21, 25}, degree 2
- Node 21: Neighbors {3, 15, 20}, degree 3
- Node 22: Neighbors {3, 10, 18, 26}, degree 4
- Node 23: Neighbors {4, 15, 24}, degree 3
- Node 24: Neighbors {18, 23}, degree 2
- Node 25: Neighbors {2, 7, 8, 12, 20}, degree 5
- Node 26: Neighbors {22}, degree 1
- Node 27: Neighbors {0}, degree 1
- Node 28: Neighbors {11, 16, 29}, degree 3
- Node 29: Neighbors {10, 14, 28}, degree 3

Calculating the 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 28, 29 

\[
\sum \text{{3-stars}} = \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 19
\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [19].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 19>, <0, 1, 27>, <0, 19, 16>, <0, 19, 8>, <1, 11, 12>, <2, 4, 25>, <3, 13, 22>, <3, 15, 21>, <6, 10, 29>, <6, 13, 18>, <6, 13, 14>, <7, 4, 25>, <10, 6, 14>, <10, 6, 18>, <11, 14, 29>, <15, 21, 20>, <16, 5, 28>, <18, 6, 22>, <22, 10, 29>
