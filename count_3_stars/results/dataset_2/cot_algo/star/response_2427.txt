Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 6
Node 1: 0, 5, 7, 8
Node 2: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 8
Node 4: 5, 6, 7
Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8
Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8
Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 5
Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 9: 2, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 38 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [38].

The unique 3-star configurations are:

<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
