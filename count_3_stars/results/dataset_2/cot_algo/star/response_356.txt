Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9

For each of these nodes, let's calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) where n is the number of neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 58

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 4, 6>
- <1, 3, 7, 8>
- <3, 4, 6, 9>
- <4, 6, 9, 0>
