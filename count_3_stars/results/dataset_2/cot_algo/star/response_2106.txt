Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 15) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 15) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 6) (2, 11) (12, 15) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 17) (17, 8) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 5) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 17) (16, 9) (9, 0) (9, 16) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 12) (5, 18) (5, 17) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node. Then, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars formed by each of these nodes.

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 19, 9}
- Node 1: {14}
- Node 2: {11}
- Node 3: {7, 11, 16}
- Node 4: {7, 0}
- Node 5: {18, 17}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 19, 17}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 6, 13}
- Node 8: {13, 19, 17, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 16}
- Node 10: {13, 11}
- Node 11: {3, 13, 10, 14, 2}
- Node 12: {15}
- Node 13: {7, 8, 16, 11, 10}
- Node 14: {1, 11, 18, 15}
- Node 15: {18, 14, 12}
- Node 16: {3, 13, 17, 9}
- Node 17: {8, 6, 16, 5}
- Node 18: {5, 14, 15}
- Node 19: {8, 0, 6}

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 19.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 forms 2 3-stars: <7, (4, 3, 6)> and <7, (13, 6, 8)>
- Node 8 forms 2 3-stars: <8, (13, 19, 6)> and <8, (17, 6, 19)>
- Node 11 forms 4 3-stars: <11, (3, 13, 10)>, <11, (3, 13, 14)>, <11, (13, 10, 14)>, <11, (14, 18, 15)>
- Node 13 forms 4 3-stars: <13, (7, 16, 10)>, <13, (7, 16, 11)>, <13, (7, 11, 10)>, <13, (16, 17, 9)>
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star
- Node 16 forms 2 3-stars: <16, (3, 13, 17)> and <16, (9, 13, 7)>
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
