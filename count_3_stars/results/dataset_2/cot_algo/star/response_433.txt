Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 25) (27, 19) (27, 23) (18, 15) (18, 22) (18, 23) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 16) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 20) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 2) (0, 10) (0, 2) (20, 10) (20, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 29) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 12) (21, 28) (21, 19) (21, 29) (28, 21) (28, 4) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 4) (24, 26) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 14) (16, 22) (16, 6) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 9) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 7) (4, 28) (4, 26) (4, 19) (25, 15) (25, 29) (19, 15) (19, 27) (19, 21) (19, 4) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (3, 7) (7, 24) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (14, 24) (14, 1) (14, 29) (23, 27) (23, 18) (23, 9) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 23) (9, 12) (12, 6) (12, 24) (12, 11) (12, 9) (8, 20) (8, 7) (29, 5) (29, 21) (29, 25) (29, 14) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

1. Node 0: {2, 6, 10}
2. Node 1: {5, 7, 14}
3. Node 2: {0, 5, 13, 17}
4. Node 3: {7}
5. Node 4: {19, 26, 28}
6. Node 5: {1, 2, 29}
7. Node 6: {10, 12, 16}
8. Node 7: {1, 3, 8, 11, 24}
9. Node 8: {7, 20}
10. Node 9: {12, 13, 17, 23}
11. Node 10: {0, 6, 17, 20}
12. Node 11: {7, 12}
13. Node 12: {6, 9, 11, 24}
14. Node 13: {2, 9, 17}
15. Node 14: {1, 24, 29}
16. Node 15: {18, 19, 25}
17. Node 16: {6, 22}
18. Node 17: {2, 9, 10, 13}
19. Node 18: {15, 22, 23, 27}
20. Node 19: {4, 19, 21, 27}
21. Node 20: {8, 10}
22. Node 21: {19, 28, 29}
23. Node 23: {9, 18, 27}
24. Node 24: {4, 7, 12, 14}
25. Node 26: {4, 22, 24}
26. Node 27: {18, 19, 21, 23}
27. Node 28: {4, 21, 28}
28. Node 29: {1, 14, 21, 25}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9, Node 10, Node 12, Node 13, Node 17, Node 19, Node 21, Node 24, Node 26, Node 27, Node 28, Node 29

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{17}{3} = 680 \]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 10)>, <2, (0, 5, 13)>, <5, (1, 2, 29)>, <6, (10, 12, 16)>, <7, (1, 8, 11)>, <9, (12, 13, 17)>, <10, (0, 17, 20)>, <12, (6, 9, 11)>, <13, (2, 9, 17)>, <17, (9, 10, 13)>, <19, (4, 21, 27)>, <21, (19, 28, 29)>, <24, (7, 12, 14)>, <26, (4, 22, 24)>, <27, (18, 21, 23)>, <28, (4, 21, 29)>, <29, (1, 14, 25)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [680].
