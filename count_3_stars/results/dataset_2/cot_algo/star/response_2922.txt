Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 2) (16, 0) (16, 25) (8, 22) (8, 7) (13, 7) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 23) (4, 18) (4, 22) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 1) (21, 10) (21, 26) (28, 1) (28, 27) (28, 20) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 3) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (20, 28) (20, 29) (20, 19) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 26) (0, 9) (22, 8) (22, 4) (22, 15) (22, 7) (14, 11) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 12) (23, 17) (23, 26) (23, 25) (23, 1) (26, 21) (26, 0) (26, 23) (26, 15) (9, 0) (9, 25) (9, 27) (24, 15) (25, 16) (25, 23) (25, 9) (25, 12) (15, 0) (15, 22) (15, 26) (15, 24) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 12) (19, 29) (19, 20) (27, 28) (27, 9) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 22) (7, 5) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 29) (5, 0) (5, 7) (12, 14) (12, 25) (12, 6) (1, 18) (1, 28) (1, 23) 

Response:
Let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {5, 9, 15, 16, 26}
Node 1: {18, 23, 28}
Node 2: {3, 6, 11}
Node 3: {2, 6}
Node 4: {5, 18, 22}
Node 5: {0, 7, 11, 18, 29}
Node 6: {2, 3, 12, 14}
Node 7: {5, 8, 13, 22}
Node 8: {7, 22}
Node 9: {0, 25, 27}
Node 10: {14, 17, 21}
Node 11: {2, 5, 14}
Node 12: {6, 12, 14, 25}
Node 13: {7}
Node 14: {6, 10, 11, 12}
Node 15: {0, 22, 24, 26}
Node 16: {0, 25}
Node 17: {10, 23}
Node 18: {1, 4, 5}
Node 19: {20, 29}
Node 20: {19, 28, 29}
Node 21: {10, 26}
Node 22: {4, 7, 8, 15}
Node 23: {1, 17, 26}
Node 24: {15}
Node 25: {9, 12, 16, 23}
Node 26: {0, 15, 21, 23}
Node 27: {9, 28}
Node 28: {1, 20, 27}
Node 29: {5, 19, 20}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 50, thus the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
