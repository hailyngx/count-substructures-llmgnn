Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors can potentially form 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9: <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7: <3, (1, 5, 7)>

Since there are 2 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
