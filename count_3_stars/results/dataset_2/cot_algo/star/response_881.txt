Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
Based on the provided edges, we can map out the graph connections for each node:

Node 0: {4, 11, 12, 2}
Node 1: {6, 9, 14, 10}
Node 2: {6, 9, 11, 7, 0}
Node 3: {4, 11, 13}
Node 4: {12, 13, 0, 3}
Node 5: {6, 8, 12}
Node 6: {9, 5, 1, 11, 8}
Node 7: {9, 2}
Node 8: {6, 5, 12}
Node 9: {6, 2, 10, 1, 7}
Node 10: {9, 1, 14, 13}
Node 11: {6, 3, 14, 0, 2}
Node 12: {4, 8, 5, 14, 0}
Node 13: {4, 3, 10}
Node 14: {11, 12, 1, 10}

Now we need to find the number of 3-star subgraphs in this network.
From the neighbor sets:
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, hence there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars passing through Node 1.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, hence there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars passing through Node 2.
Node 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12 also have more than 3 neighbors, so we need to calculate  \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of them:

Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 58 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (6, 9, 10)>
<2, (6, 9, 11)>
<4, (12, 14, 0)>
<6, (1, 9, 11)>
<9, (1, 6, 11)>
<10, (1, 9, 14)>
<11, (2, 6, 14)>
<12, (4, 8, 5)>
<14, (10, 12, 1)>
