Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 8, Node 9

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <5, 8, 9>
