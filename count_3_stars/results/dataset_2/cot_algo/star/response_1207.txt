Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 18) (4, 7) (4, 16) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 13) (3, 10) (3, 19) (3, 18) (11, 9) (11, 13) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 1) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 15) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 15) (0, 9) (0, 12) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 6) (15, 2) (15, 12) (19, 3) (19, 2) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 18) (6, 14) (6, 16) (6, 8) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 18) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 1) (18, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, the nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

1: {13, 10, 18}
2: {17, 5, 12, 19, 15}
3: {10, 19, 18}
4: {16, 7}
5: {2, 7, 16}
6: {14, 16, 8}
7: {4, 5, 13}
8: {10, 6, 18}
9: {0, 10, 11}
10: {1, 3, 9, 8}
11: {9, 13}
12: {0, 2, 15, 16}
13: {1, 7, 11}
14: {6, 17}
15: {2, 12}
16: {4, 6, 12, 5}
17: {14, 2, 18}
18: {8, 3, 1, 17}
19: {2, 3}

Now, let's check for each node how many 3-stars can be formed:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
1: {13, 10, 18} - 1 3-star
3: {10, 19, 18} - 1 3-star
4: {16, 7} - 1 3-star
5: {2, 7, 16} - 1 3-star
6: {14, 16, 8} - 1 3-star
11: {9, 13} - 1 3-star
13: {1, 7, 11} - 1 3-star
15: {2, 12} - 1 3-star
17: {14, 2, 18} - 1 3-star
18: {8, 3, 1, 17} - 4 3-stars
19: {2, 3, 10} - 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, 10, 18>
<3, 10, 19>
<4, 7, 16>
<5, 7, 16>
<6, 14, 16>
<11, 9, 13>
<13, 1, 7>
<15, 2, 12>
<17, 2, 14>
<18, 1, 8>
<18, 3, 8>
<18, 1, 17>
<19, 2, 3>
