Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 7) (4, 7) (7, 17) (7, 4) (7, 19) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 15) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 0) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 2) (1, 15) (1, 16) (15, 5) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 9) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 8) (0, 13) (0, 15) (0, 9) (6, 17) (6, 16) (6, 8) (9, 15) (9, 0) (10, 19) (10, 16) (16, 14) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 8) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 6) (8, 16) (2, 3) (2, 11) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {13, 15, 9}
- Node 1: {15, 16}
- Node 2: {3, 11}
- Node 3: {2, 11, 13}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {18, 12, 13, 15}
- Node 6: {17, 16, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 17, 19}
- Node 8: {11, 12, 6, 16}
- Node 9: {0, 15}
- Node 10: {19, 16}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 12: {5, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 5, 12, 15}
- Node 14: {16, 17}
- Node 15: {0, 1, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 16: {1, 6, 10, 14, 17, 8}
- Node 17: {14, 16, 19, 6, 7}
- Node 18: {5}
- Node 19: {17, 7, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to find potential 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 7, 16, 17, 5, 13, 8, 15

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors:
  - 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - 16: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  - 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 59

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [59].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
