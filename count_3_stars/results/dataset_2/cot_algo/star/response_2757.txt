Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, we will apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>.
