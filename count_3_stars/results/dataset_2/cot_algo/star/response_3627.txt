Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
Given the information about the graph, we can first determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {3, 4, 6}
Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 6}
Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 7}
Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 9}
Node 4: {1, 5, 7, 9}
Node 5: {2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
Node 7: {2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 8: {5, 6, 7}
Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 6 and Node 9 are the only nodes with 4 neighbors, so we will calculate the 3-stars formed by each of them:

For Node 6:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
So, there are 4 unique 3-stars with Node 6 as the center.

For Node 9:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
So, there are 4 unique 3-stars with Node 9 as the center.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 = 8, which can be written as [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
