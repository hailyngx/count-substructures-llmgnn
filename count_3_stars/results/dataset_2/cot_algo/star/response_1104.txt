Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 
Node 1: 4, 5, 7, 2 
Node 2: 1, 6, 9 
Node 3: 4, 7, 0 
Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 0 
Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9 
Node 6: 2, 5, 7, 9 
Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 6, 0 
Node 8: 4, 5 
Node 9: 2, 5, 6, 0 

Now we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 64

Therefore, there are 64 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
