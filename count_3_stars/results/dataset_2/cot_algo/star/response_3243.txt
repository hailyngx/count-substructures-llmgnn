Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}

Next, we will identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6, 8, 9} forms \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars.
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5, 9} forms \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars.
- Node 8: {1, 2, 7, 9} forms \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars.
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 5, 8} forms \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 34\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <2, (0, 4, 6, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 7, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4, 5, 8)>
