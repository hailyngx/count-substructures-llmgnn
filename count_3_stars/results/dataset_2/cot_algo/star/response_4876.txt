Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {21}
- Node 1: {9, 18, 25}
- Node 2: {18, 27, 10, 23, 29}
- Node 3: {6, 7, 14}
- Node 4: {10, 11, 16, 22}
- Node 5: {14, 25}
- Node 6: {3, 9, 19}
- Node 7: {3, 8, 14, 15}
- Node 8: {7, 21}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 20, 27}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 23}
- Node 11: {4, 16, 18, 24, 28}
- Node 12: {21, 26}
- Node 13: {19, 25, 28}
- Node 14: {3, 5, 7, 23, 29}
- Node 15: {7, 19, 24}
- Node 16: {4, 11}
- Node 17: {22}
- Node 18: {1, 2, 9, 11, 20}
- Node 19: {6, 13, 15, 25}
- Node 20: {9, 18}
- Node 21: {0, 8, 12}
- Node 22: {4, 17, 18, 26}
- Node 23: {2, 10, 14}
- Node 24: {11, 15, 28}
- Node 25: {1, 5, 13, 19}
- Node 26: {12, 22}
- Node 27: {2, 9}
- Node 28: {11, 13}
- Node 29: {2, 14}

For finding the 3-stars, we need to consider nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1, 2, 4, 9, 11, 14, 18, 25 have 5 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 9, 18, 25>
- <2, 18, 23, 29>
- <4, 10, 22, 27>
- <9, 18, 20, 27>
- <11, 13, 15, 25>
- <14, 23, 29, 5>
