Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 2) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 13) (29, 15) (29, 13) (29, 18) (18, 29) (18, 22) (18, 27) (18, 21) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 11) (23, 25) (23, 27) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 10) (12, 27) (12, 17) (27, 18) (27, 22) (27, 23) (27, 12) (27, 7) (28, 6) (28, 14) (24, 26) (24, 7) (24, 14) (26, 24) (26, 0) (26, 4) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 8) (17, 12) (17, 1) (21, 3) (21, 18) (21, 5) (13, 2) (13, 29) (13, 25) (14, 28) (14, 24) (14, 19) (7, 27) (7, 24) (7, 16) (7, 10) (16, 7) (16, 25) (16, 19) (0, 26) (0, 25) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 7) (19, 14) (19, 16) (19, 11) (11, 22) (11, 19) (11, 8) (25, 23) (25, 13) (25, 16) (25, 0) (5, 1) (5, 21) (5, 20) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 11) (4, 26) (4, 20) (20, 9) (20, 5) (20, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {25, 26}
- Node 1: {5, 8, 17}
- Node 2: {3, 13, 15}
- Node 3: {2, 8, 15, 21}
- Node 4: {20, 26}
- Node 5: {1, 20, 21}
- Node 6: {9, 10, 28}
- Node 7: {10, 16, 24, 27}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 11}
- Node 9: {6, 10, 20}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 11: {8, 19, 22}
- Node 12: {17, 27}
- Node 13: {2, 25, 29}
- Node 14: {19, 24, 28}
- Node 15: {2, 3, 29}
- Node 16: {7, 19, 25}
- Node 17: {1, 12}
- Node 18: {21, 22, 27}
- Node 19: {11, 14, 16}
- Node 20: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 21: {3, 5, 18}
- Node 22: {11, 18, 27}
- Node 23: {25, 27}
- Node 24: {7, 14, 26}
- Node 25: {0, 13, 16, 23}
- Node 26: {0, 4, 24}
- Node 27: {7, 12, 18, 22, 23}
- Node 28: {6, 14}
- Node 29: {13, 15}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with them:

- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 21: 1 3-star
- Node 22: 1 3-star
- Node 25: 1 3-star
- Node 26: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 1 3-star
- Node 29: 1 3-star

There is a total of 16 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [16].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, 2, 15>
- <5, 1, 8>
- <7, 10, 16>
- <8, 3, 11>
- <9, 6, 10>
- <10, 6, 7>
- <11, 8, 19>
- <14, 19, 24>
- <15, 2, 29>
- <16, 7, 25>
- <18, 21, 22>
- <21, 3, 5>
- <22, 11, 27>
- <25, 13, 16>
- <26, 0, 24>
- <27, 12, 18>
