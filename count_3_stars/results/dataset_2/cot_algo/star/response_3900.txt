Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 12) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 11) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 9, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 8, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 9, 10}
- Node 4: {1, 10, 13}
- Node 5: {6, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 8, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 6, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 4, 5, 11, 12}
- Node 14: {1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-star formed (2 neighbors)
- Node 1: No 3-star formed (6 neighbors)
- Node 2: No 3-star formed (4 neighbors)
- Node 3: 1 3-star formed
- Node 4: 1 3-star formed
- Node 5: 1 3-star formed
- Node 6: 1 3-star formed
- Node 7: No 3-star formed (1 neighbor)
- Node 8: 1 3-star formed
- Node 9: 1 3-star formed
- Node 10: No 3-star formed (4 neighbors)
- Node 11: 1 3-star formed
- Node 12: 1 3-star formed
- Node 13: No 3-star formed (5 neighbors)
- Node 14: 1 3-star formed

Total number of 3-stars = 7

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [7], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (0, 1, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 13)>
- <5, (6, 13, 14)>
- <6, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 14)>
- <11, (1, 2, 13)>
- <12, (0, 1, 14)>
