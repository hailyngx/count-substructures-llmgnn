Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {1, 7, 4, 8, 9}
Node 1 neighbors: {3, 5, 0, 8, 7}
Node 2 neighbors: {3, 5, 9}
Node 3 neighbors: {1, 6, 9, 2, 5, 4}
Node 4 neighbors: {3, 0}
Node 5 neighbors: {1, 3, 6, 2}
Node 6 neighbors: {3, 5, 8}
Node 7 neighbors: {1, 0, 9, 8}
Node 8 neighbors: {1, 6, 0, 7}
Node 9 neighbors: {3, 0, 2, 7}

Now, let's check the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars each can form:

Node 0 can form 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 1 can form 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 3 can form 3-stars = inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 5 can form 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6 can form 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 7 can form 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 8 can form 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 9 can form 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up the 3-stars from all these nodes gives: 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 57

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [57]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 9, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 5)>
<3, (5, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 0, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 0, 2)>
