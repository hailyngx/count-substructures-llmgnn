Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 14) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 8) (10, 9) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 10) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 8, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 7, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 12, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 12, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 8, 12}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 7, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 11: Neighbors {3, 8, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {4, 6, 8, 13}

Now, for nodes with at least 3 neighbors, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated for each node: 
\[10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 106\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [106]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 12)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 12)>, <0, (4, 5, 12)>, <1, (7, 8, 12)>, <1, (7, 8, 13)>, <1, (7, 10, 13)>, <1, (8, 10, 13)>, <3, (7, 8, 13)>, <4, (5, 6, 12)>, <4, (5, 12, 14)>, <4, (6, 12, 14)>, <5, (6, 12, 13)>, <13, (8, 11, 14)>
