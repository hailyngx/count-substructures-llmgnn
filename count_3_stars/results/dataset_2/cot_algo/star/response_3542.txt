Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 28) (13, 14) (22, 11) (22, 7) (22, 12) (22, 1) (4, 8) (4, 23) (7, 22) (7, 29) (7, 19) (2, 18) (2, 26) (2, 24) (2, 11) (29, 7) (29, 27) (10, 19) (10, 23) (17, 1) (17, 16) (18, 2) (18, 27) (18, 25) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 26) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 26) (14, 11) (14, 5) (1, 22) (1, 17) (1, 0) (1, 28) (6, 21) (6, 15) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 6) (21, 11) (16, 17) (16, 28) (16, 23) (28, 13) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 16) (26, 2) (26, 8) (26, 14) (11, 22) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 21) (11, 27) (3, 20) (27, 29) (27, 18) (27, 11) (27, 24) (27, 23) (15, 6) (15, 25) (23, 4) (23, 10) (23, 16) (23, 27) (9, 24) (9, 19) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 9) (5, 14) (12, 22) (12, 24) (24, 2) (24, 27) (24, 9) (24, 12) (24, 25) (20, 8) (20, 3) (25, 18) (25, 15) (25, 24) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 21, 28}
- Node 1: {0, 13, 17, 22, 28}
- Node 2: {11, 18, 24, 26}
- Node 3: {20}
- Node 4: {8, 23}
- Node 5: {14}
- Node 6: {15, 21}
- Node 7: {19, 22, 29}
- Node 8: {4, 20, 26}
- Node 9: {19, 24}
- Node 10: {19, 23}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 14, 21, 22, 27}
- Node 12: {22, 24}
- Node 13: {1, 14, 21, 28}
- Node 14: {5, 11, 13, 26}
- Node 15: {6, 25}
- Node 16: {17, 23, 28}
- Node 17: {1, 16}
- Node 18: {2, 25, 26, 27}
- Node 19: {7, 9, 10}
- Node 20: {3, 8}
- Node 21: {0, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 22: {1, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 23: {4, 10, 16, 27}
- Node 24: {2, 9, 12, 25, 27}
- Node 25: {15, 18, 24}
- Node 26: {2, 8, 14}
- Node 27: {2, 11, 23, 24}
- Node 28: {0, 1, 13, 16}
- Node 29: {7, 27}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and determine the number of 3-stars each forms:

- Node 1 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 5 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get:  
\[ 4 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 23 \]

The final answer is:  
[23]

Unique 3-stars found:
