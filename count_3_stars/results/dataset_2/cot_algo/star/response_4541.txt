Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 8) (13, 7) (13, 0) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {7, 5, 8, 13}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {9, 6, 8, 2}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {11, 3, 1, 6}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {11, 2, 6, 14}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {7, 12, 10, 5, 14, 9}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {4, 10, 0, 8}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {11, 3, 1, 14, 2}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {4, 12, 0, 13}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {0, 5, 1}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {4, 1}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {4, 11, 12, 5, 14}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {10, 3, 6, 2}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {4, 7, 10, 14}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {7, 0}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {4, 10, 12, 3, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 4 forms 1 3-star with neighbors {7, 12, 10} <4, (7, 12, 10)>
- Node 10 also forms 1 3-star with neighbors {4, 11, 12} <10, (4, 11, 12)>
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star with neighbors {4, 7, 14} <12, (4, 7, 14)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star with neighbors {11, 3, 14} <6, (3, 11, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
