Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 0) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 10) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (3, 8) (3, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

1: {5, 8, 9, 14}
2: {6, 8, 11, 12, 13}
3: {8, 14}
4: {7, 9, 13}
5: {1, 6, 8}
6: {2, 5, 9, 10, 11}
7: {4, 10, 12}
8: {1, 2, 3, 5, 11}
9: {1, 4, 6, 13, 14}
10: {6, 7, 12, 14}
11: {2, 6, 8}
12: {2, 7, 10, 0}
13: {2, 4, 9, 13, 14}
14: {0, 1, 9, 10, 13}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 6 and Node 9 have 5 neighbors, so they can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars each.
Node 1, Node 2, Node 8, Node 13, and Node 14 have 5 neighbors but two of those neighbors are connected, so they can only form 1 3-star each.
Node 4 and Node 12 have 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 3-star each.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (2, 5, 11)>
<6, (2, 10, 11)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (8, 11, 13)>
<8, (1, 5, 11)>
<13, (9, 13, 14)>
<9, (4, 9, 13)>
<12, (7, 10, 12)>
<4, (7, 9, 13)>
