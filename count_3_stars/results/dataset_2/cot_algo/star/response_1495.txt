Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {5, 7, 1, 3, 8}
Node 1: {5, 7, 0, 3, 2}
Node 2: {9, 4, 1, 6, 8}
Node 3: {5, 9, 1, 0}
Node 4: {9, 8, 2}
Node 5: {8, 1, 0, 3}
Node 6: {7, 2}
Node 7: {0, 6, 1}
Node 8: {5, 9, 4, 2, 0}
Node 9: {8, 4, 2, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least three neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 34 \). 

So, the answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 0>
<1, 7, 0>
<1, 7, 6>
<1, 7, 3>
<1, 7, 5>
<8, 5, 1>
<8, 5, 3>
<8, 5, 0>
<8, 9, 4>
<8, 9, 2>
<8, 9, 3>
<8, 9, 5>
<9, 4, 2>
<9, 8, 4>
<9, 8, 2>
<9, 8, 5>
<9, 8, 4>
