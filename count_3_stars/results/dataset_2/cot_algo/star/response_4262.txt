Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 12) (18, 17) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 9) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 15) (0, 12) (0, 9) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 1) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 6) (15, 11) (15, 5) (16, 18) (16, 3) (8, 6) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 8) (6, 10) (17, 18) (17, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 9) (14, 12) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 17) (9, 1) (2, 7) (2, 19) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (10, 6) 

Response:
The central nodes that have at least three neighbors are: 4, 6, 9, 11, 12, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each central node:

For node 4 (with neighbors 18, 9, 13, 1, 3):
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (18, 9, 13)>, <4, (18, 9, 1)>, <4, (18, 9, 3)>, <4, (18, 13, 1)>, <4, (18, 13, 3)>, <4, (18, 1, 3)>

For node 6 (with neighbors 18, 19, 8, 10):
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (18, 19, 8)>, <6, (18, 19, 10)>, <6, (18, 8, 10)>, <6, (19, 8, 10)>

For node 9 (with neighbors 4, 3, 0, 17, 1):
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (4, 3, 0)>, <9, (4, 3, 17)>, <9, (4, 3, 1)>, <9, (4, 0, 17)>, <9, (4, 0, 1)>, <9, (4, 17, 1)>

For node 11 (with neighbors 3, 7, 1, 15):
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <11, (3, 7, 1)>, <11, (3, 7, 15)>, <11, (3, 1, 15)>, <11, (7, 1, 15)>

For node 12 (with neighbors 18, 0, 14, 13):
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <12, (18, 0, 14)>, <12, (18, 0, 13)>, <12, (18, 14, 13)>, <12, (0, 14, 13)>

For node 18 (with neighbors 4, 16, 6, 12, 17):
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <18, (4, 16, 6)>, <18, (4, 16, 12)>, <18, (4, 16, 17)>, <18, (4, 6, 12)>, <18, (4, 6, 17)>, <18, (4, 12, 17)>

For node 19 (with neighbors 7, 5, 2, 6):
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <19, (7, 5, 2)>, <19, (7, 5, 6)>, <19, (7, 2, 6)>, <19, (5, 2, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [46].
