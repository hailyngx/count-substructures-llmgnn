Response:
There are several nodes with 3 or more neighbors, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes.

1. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: {4, 6, 23, 25, 20}. Therefore, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center.
2. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {1, 5, 7, 21}. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
3. Node 12 has 3 neighbors: {2, 13, 25}. Therefore, there is 1 3-star with node 12 as the center.
4. Node 13 has 4 neighbors: {2, 12, 25, 26}. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 13 as the center.
5. Node 14 has 3 neighbors: {17, 21, 22}. Therefore, there is 1 3-star with node 14 as the center.
6. Node 16 has 4 neighbors: {1, 15, 19, 27}. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 16 as the center.
7. Node 21 has 4 neighbors: {6, 14, 26, 27}. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 21 as the center.
8. Node 22 has 4 neighbors: {11, 14, 20, 26}. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 22 as the center.
9. Node 23 has 3 neighbors: {5, 8, 19}. Therefore, there is 1 3-star with node 23 as the center.
10. Node 24 has 4 neighbors: {9, 15, 28, 29}. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 24 as the center.
11. Node 25 has 5 neighbors: {2, 5, 12, 13, 17}. Therefore, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 25 as the center.
12. Node 26 has 4 neighbors: {18, 21, 22, 13}. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 26 as the center.
13. Node 27 has 3 neighbors: {16, 21, 28}. Therefore, there is 1 3-star with node 27 as the center.
14. Node 28 has 3 neighbors: {10, 24, 27}. Therefore, there is 1 3-star with node 28 as the center.
15. Node 29 has 2 neighbors: {15, 24}. Node 29 cannot form a 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed around each node, we get a total of 48 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [48].
