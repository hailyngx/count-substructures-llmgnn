Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 23) (26, 15) (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 4) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 19) (1, 29) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 0) (25, 15) (25, 21) (8, 13) (8, 27) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 18) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 28) (12, 21) (12, 22) (12, 15) (2, 27) (2, 28) (2, 15) (23, 9) (23, 26) (23, 11) (23, 17) (10, 16) (10, 22) (10, 20) (21, 16) (21, 25) (21, 12) (24, 18) (24, 14) (29, 1) (29, 7) (29, 27) (29, 5) (29, 0) (17, 6) (17, 23) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 29) (19, 6) (15, 26) (15, 25) (15, 13) (15, 12) (15, 2) (27, 8) (27, 2) (27, 29) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 24) (22, 12) (22, 10) (28, 12) (28, 2) (28, 20) (5, 1) (5, 29) (5, 18) (18, 13) (18, 24) (18, 5) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 1) (20, 10) (20, 28) 

Response:
First, we need to construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges. Then we will identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Node 0 Neighbors: {9, 3, 29}
Node 1 Neighbors: {29, 5, 4}
Node 2 Neighbors: {27, 28, 15}
Node 3 Neighbors: {0}
Node 4 Neighbors: {1, 11, 16}
Node 5 Neighbors: {1, 29, 18}
Node 6 Neighbors: {9, 17, 19}
Node 7 Neighbors: {12, 29, 14}
Node 8 Neighbors: {13, 27}
Node 9 Neighbors: {0, 26, 6, 23}
Node 10 Neighbors: {16, 22, 20}
Node 11 Neighbors: {4, 16, 23}
Node 12 Neighbors: {7, 21, 15, 22, 28}
Node 13 Neighbors: {8, 15, 14, 18}
Node 14 Neighbors: {13, 7, 24, 18}
Node 15 Neighbors: {26, 25, 13, 12, 2}
Node 16 Neighbors: {11, 21, 10, 4}
Node 17 Neighbors: {6, 23}
Node 18 Neighbors: {5, 13, 24}
Node 19 Neighbors: {6}
Node 20 Neighbors: {10, 28}
Node 21 Neighbors: {16, 25, 12}
Node 22 Neighbors: {12, 10}
Node 23 Neighbors: {9, 26, 11, 17}
Node 24 Neighbors: {14, 18}
Node 25 Neighbors: {15, 21}
Node 26 Neighbors: {9, 26, 15}
Node 27 Neighbors: {8, 2, 29}
Node 28 Neighbors: {2, 12, 20}
Node 29 Neighbors: {1, 7, 27, 5, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 33
Thus, the final answer is [33].
