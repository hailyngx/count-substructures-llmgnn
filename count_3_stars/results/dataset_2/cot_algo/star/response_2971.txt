Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (26, 14) (26, 16) (26, 12) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 25) (15, 28) (15, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 20) (8, 4) (8, 29) (8, 6) (8, 22) (8, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 29) (12, 26) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (17, 29) (17, 13) (17, 25) (29, 8) (29, 7) (29, 17) (29, 21) (21, 29) (21, 13) (21, 5) (21, 18) (28, 15) (28, 18) (0, 7) (0, 10) (20, 4) (20, 11) (20, 10) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 20) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 11) (13, 24) (13, 19) (19, 13) (19, 24) (19, 6) (23, 24) (23, 27) (16, 26) (16, 1) (14, 26) (14, 5) (25, 15) (25, 17) (25, 1) (11, 20) (11, 13) (11, 6) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 23) (1, 16) (1, 25) (1, 2) (1, 22) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 1) (18, 8) (18, 21) (18, 28) (22, 8) (22, 1) (5, 21) (5, 14) (27, 3) (27, 23) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 11) 

Response:
Given the information provided about the graph, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: [7, 10]
- Node 1: [16, 25, 2, 22]
- Node 2: [3, 15, 1]
- Node 3: [2, 15, 27]
- Node 4: [8, 12, 20]
- Node 5: [14, 21]
- Node 6: [8, 11, 19]
- Node 7: [12, 29, 0]
- Node 8: [4, 6, 18, 22, 29]
- Node 10: [0, 12, 15, 20]
- Node 11: [6, 13, 20]
- Node 12: [4, 7, 10, 26]
- Node 13: [11, 17, 19, 24]
- Node 14: [5, 26]
- Node 15: [2, 3, 10, 25, 28]
- Node 16: [1, 26]
- Node 17: [13, 25, 29]
- Node 18: [8, 21, 28]
- Node 19: [6, 13, 24]
- Node 20: [4, 10, 11]
- Node 21: [5, 18, 29]
- Node 22: [1, 8]
- Node 23: [24, 27]
- Node 24: [13, 19, 23]
- Node 25: [1, 15, 17]
- Node 26: [12, 14, 16]
- Node 27: [3, 23]
- Node 28: [15, 18]
- Node 29: [7, 8, 17, 21]

Now, we will identify the nodes that form 3-star subgraphs (nodes with exactly 3 neighbors):

- Node 5: <5, (14, 21, 18)>
- Node 6: <6, (8, 11, 19)>
- Node 8: <8, (4, 6, 18)>, <8, (6, 11, 19)>, <8, (18, 21, 29)>, <8, (29, 17, 7)>
- Node 13: <13, (11, 17, 19)>, <13, (17, 25, 1)>, <13, (24, 19, 6)>
- Node 14: <14, (5, 21, 18)>
- Node 16: <16, (1, 25, 26)>
- Node 21: <21, (5, 14, 18)>, <21, (18, 8, 29)>
- Node 24: <24, (13, 19, 23)>
- Node 29: <29, (7, 17, 21)>, <29, (8, 18, 21)>

Counting up the total number of 3-star subgraphs, we have a total of [19].
