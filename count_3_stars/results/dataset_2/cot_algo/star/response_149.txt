Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 13) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 13) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 0) (5, 12) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {2, 5, 11}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 3, 6, 12}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 13}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 2, 6, 10}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 12}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 3, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 7: neighbors {8, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 4, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 9: neighbors {4, 6, 7}
- Node 10: neighbors {3, 6, 13}
- Node 11: neighbors {0, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 12: neighbors {1, 5, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 13: neighbors {2, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 14: neighbors {7, 8, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: forms 1 3-star
- Node 3: forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: forms 1 3-star
- Node 8: forms 1 3-star
- Node 12: forms 1 3-star
- Node 13: forms 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is 7, and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, 2, 3>
<6, 1, 12>
<2, 8, 4>
<12, 11, 13>
<13, 2, 7>
<6, 3, 10>
<8, 14, 7>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
