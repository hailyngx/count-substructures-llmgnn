Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 19) (3, 6) (3, 15) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 8) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 13) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 19) (19, 6) (19, 12) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 1) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 12) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 16) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 2) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 4) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 11) (18, 15) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first need to identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {9, 10, 2}
Node 1: Neighbors {9, 10, 7, 16}
Node 2: Neighbors {0, 11, 4}
Node 3: Neighbors {6, 15, 8}
Node 4: Neighbors {11, 2}
Node 5: Neighbors {9, 14}
Node 6: Neighbors {14, 3, 19}
Node 7: Neighbors {9, 1, 13, 12}
Node 8: Neighbors {3, 15, 11}
Node 9: Neighbors {5, 1, 0, 12}
Node 10: Neighbors {17, 0, 1, 16}
Node 11: Neighbors {14, 8, 4, 2}
Node 12: Neighbors {9, 7, 13, 19}
Node 13: Neighbors {17, 7, 12}
Node 14: Neighbors {5, 6, 11}
Node 15: Neighbors {3, 16, 8, 18}
Node 16: Neighbors {15, 10, 1}
Node 17: Neighbors {10, 13}
Node 18: Neighbors {15}
Node 19: Neighbors {6, 12}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and determine how many 3-stars can be formed:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 2: No 3-stars can be formed with 2 neighbors
Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 4: No 3-stars can be formed with 2 neighbors
Node 5: No 3-stars can be formed with 2 neighbors
Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 14: No 3-stars can be formed with 2 neighbors
Node 15: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 16: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 17: No 3-stars can be formed with 2 neighbors
Node 18: No 3-stars can be formed with 1 neighbor
Node 19: [inom{2}{3}] = 0

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 4 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 4 (Node 9) + 4 (Node 10) + 4 (Node 11) + 4 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 4 (Node 15) + 1 (Node 16) = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (9, 10, 2)>, <1, (9, 10, 7)>, <3, (6, 15, 8)>, <6, (14, 3, 19)>, <7, (9, 1, 13)>, <9, (5, 1, 0)>, <10, (17, 0, 1)>, <11, (14, 8, 4)>, <12, (9, 7, 13)>, <13, (17, 7, 12)>, <15, (3, 16, 8)>.
