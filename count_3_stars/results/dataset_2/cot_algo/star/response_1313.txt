Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) 

Response:
First, we will create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 6, 7, 8, 1
Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 2: 6, 9
Node 3: 1, 6, 8, 9
Node 4: 1, 7, 9
Node 5: 1, 7
Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 9
Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 9
Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 2

Now, we will look for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

Node 1: <1, (0, 4, 5)> => There is 1 3-star.
Node 3: <3, (1, 6, 9)> => There is 1 3-star.
Node 6: <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)> => There are 3 3-stars.
Node 9: <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 8, 6)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)> => There are 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 9. 
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
