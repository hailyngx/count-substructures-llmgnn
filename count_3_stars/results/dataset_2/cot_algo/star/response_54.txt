Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 9) (3, 11) (3, 10) (15, 1) (15, 17) (14, 0) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 5) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (9, 16) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 19) (9, 12) (18, 19) (19, 2) (19, 9) (19, 18) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 5) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 13) (7, 17) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (6, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (4, 16) (4, 2) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will first construct the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {14, 5, 13}
- Node 1: {15, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {16, 17, 19, 4}
- Node 3: {11, 10}
- Node 4: {16, 2}
- Node 5: {0, 8, 1, 10}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {17, 9, 6, 13}
- Node 8: {11, 9, 5}
- Node 9: {16, 8, 7, 19, 12}
- Node 10: {3, 1, 5}
- Node 11: {16, 3, 8}
- Node 12: {16, 9, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 12, 7}
- Node 14: {0}
- Node 15: {1, 17}
- Node 16: {11, 12, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 17: {15, 2, 7}
- Node 18: {19}
- Node 19: {2, 9, 18}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <1, (5, 10, 13)>, <1, (5, 13, 15)>, <1, (10, 13, 15)>, <1, (5, 10, 15)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <2, (17, 4, 16)>, <2, (16, 4, 19)>, <2, (17, 16, 19)>, <2, (17, 4, 19)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <5, (1, 10, 13)>, <5, (0, 1, 10)>, <5, (0, 1, 13)>, <5, (0, 10, 13)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <7, (17, 13, 9)>, <7, (17, 9, 6)>, <7, (13, 7, 9)>, <7, (17, 7, 9)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <9, (16, 12, 19)>, <9, (16, 12, 13)>, <9, (16, 19, 8)>, <9, (16, 8, 7)>, <9, (16, 12, 8)>, <9, (16, 19, 12)>, <9, (16, 7, 19)>, <9, (16, 7, 13)>, <9, (12, 19, 13)>, <9, (8, 7, 13)>

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (5, 10, 13)>, <1, (5, 13, 15)>, <1, (10, 13, 15)>, <1, (5, 10, 15)>, 
<2, (17, 4, 16)>, <2, (16, 4, 19)>, <2, (17, 16, 19)>, <2, (17, 4, 19)>, 
<5, (1, 10, 13)>, <5, (0, 1, 10)>, <5, (0, 1, 13)>, <5, (0, 10, 13)>, 
<7, (17, 13, 9)>, <7, (17, 9, 6)>, <7, (13, 7, 9)>, <7, (17, 7, 9)>, 
<9, (16, 12, 19)>, <9, (16, 12, 13)>, <9, (16, 19, 8)>, <9, (16, 8, 7)>, <9, (16, 12, 8)>, <9, (16, 19, 12)>, <9, (16, 7, 19)>, <9, (16, 7, 13)>, <9, (12, 19, 13)>, <9, (8, 7, 13)>
