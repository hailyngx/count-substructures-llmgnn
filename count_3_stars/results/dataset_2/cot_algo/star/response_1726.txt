Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 6) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 12) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 9) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 12) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 13) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 8, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 10, 0
- Node 2: 3, 11, 13, 6
- Node 3: 1, 9, 2, 5, 4
- Node 4: 3, 11, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 12
- Node 6: 11, 2, 8, 7, 13
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 11, 9, 0, 6, 12
- Node 9: 3, 8, 0, 4, 12
- Node 10: 1, 13, 14
- Node 11: 14, 6, 8, 4, 2
- Node 12: 8, 9, 13, 5, 14
- Node 13: 10, 2, 12, 6
- Node 14: 10, 11, 12

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 12: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 58

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 11>, <6, 8, 12>, <6, 8, 13>, <8, 9, 11>, <8, 9, 12>, <8, 9, 4>, <9, 12, 13>, <9, 12, 14>, <9, 12, 5>, <9, 8, 11>, <9, 8, 6>, <12, 13, 14>, <12, 13, 6>, <12, 13, 2>, <12, 13, 5>
