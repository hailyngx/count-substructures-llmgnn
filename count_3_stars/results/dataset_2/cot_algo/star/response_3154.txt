Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 also has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 20 + 10 = 30, so the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <9, (3, 4, 8)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
