Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 4) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 2) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 14. 

Based on the given edges, the neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 11}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 9, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 11}
- Node 4: {2, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 10}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 10: {0, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 13: {2, 5, 10}
- Node 14: {2, 7, 10, 11}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed with the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 74 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [74] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 10)>, <0, (1, 8, 10)>, <0, (3, 8, 10)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 12)>, <2, (4, 9, 12)>, <2, (5, 9, 12)>, <2, (5, 12, 13)>, <2, (9, 12, 13)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 12, 13)>, <5, (8, 9, 10)>, <5, (9, 10, 13)>, <5, (9, 12, 13)>, <7, (9, 11, 14)>, <7, (11, 14, 10)>, <10, (11, 14, 7)>, <10, (13, 12, 0)>.
