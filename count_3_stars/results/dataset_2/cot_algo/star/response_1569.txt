Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 9, 4, 7, 5
- Node 1: 7, 8, 2
- Node 2: 6, 4, 7, 8, 1
- Node 3: 6, 4, 8
- Node 4: 6, 8, 0, 3, 2
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8, 0
- Node 6: 5, 3, 2, 4
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5, 1
- Node 8: 9, 4, 2, 5, 3, 1
- Node 9: 8, 0

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node. 
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 8: [inom{6}{3}] = 6 choose 3 = 20

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, 4, 7, 5>, <2, 4, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 5, 8>, <2, 4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7, 8>
