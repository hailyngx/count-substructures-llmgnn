Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 2) (22, 13) (22, 2) (22, 4) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 29) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 8) (27, 0) (27, 7) (27, 1) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 25) (28, 3) (28, 29) (28, 9) (29, 15) (29, 28) (29, 25) (20, 17) (20, 26) (21, 0) (1, 15) (1, 27) (1, 23) (1, 19) (17, 20) (17, 2) (17, 7) (24, 26) (24, 12) (24, 9) (24, 19) (26, 20) (26, 24) (26, 4) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 7) (19, 1) (19, 24) (2, 13) (2, 22) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 16) (14, 18) (14, 9) (7, 0) (7, 27) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 6) (11, 5) (11, 6) (4, 22) (4, 26) (4, 23) (4, 16) (12, 24) (12, 10) (16, 2) (16, 4) (9, 28) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 25) (25, 8) (25, 29) (25, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (23, 1) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 10) (6, 7) (6, 11) (10, 12) (10, 23) 

Response:
Let's first find the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 8, 21, 27}
- Node 1: {15, 19, 23, 27}
- Node 2: {3, 13, 16, 17, 22}
- Node 3: {2, 15, 28}
- Node 4: {16, 22, 23, 26}
- Node 5: {8, 11}
- Node 6: {7, 11}
- Node 7: {0, 17, 18, 27}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 13, 25}
- Node 9: {14, 24, 25, 28}
- Node 10: {12, 23}
- Node 11: {5, 6}
- Node 12: {10, 24}
- Node 13: {2, 8, 22}
- Node 14: {9, 18}
- Node 15: {1, 3, 29}
- Node 16: {2, 4}
- Node 17: {2, 7, 20}
- Node 18: {7, 14, 23}
- Node 19: {1, 24}
- Node 20: {17, 26}
- Node 21: {0}
- Node 22: {2, 4, 13}
- Node 23: {1, 4, 10, 18}
- Node 24: {9, 12, 19}
- Node 25: {8, 9, 29}
- Node 26: {4, 20, 24}
- Node 27: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 28: {3, 9, 15, 29}
- Node 29: {15, 25, 28}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: <4, (2, 16, 22)>
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: <9, (24, 25, 28)>
- Node 15: [1]
- Node 17: [1]
- Node 18: [1]
- Node 22: [1]
- Node 23: <23, (1, 4, 10)>
- Node 24: [1]
- Node 25: [1]
- Node 26: [1]
- Node 28: [1]
- Node 29: [1]

The total number of 3-stars in the given 30-node graph is [19].
