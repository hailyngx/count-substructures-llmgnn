Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (1, 6) (1, 11) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 2) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 12) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 10) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {4, 13, 3, 2}
- Node 1: {6, 11}
- Node 2: {7, 13, 0, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 13, 0, 10}
- Node 4: {9, 8, 0, 14, 11}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {8, 1, 3}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 2}
- Node 8: {4, 10, 6, 12}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 10, 7, 12}
- Node 10: {9, 8, 3, 14, 12}
- Node 11: {4, 1, 2}
- Node 12: {9, 8, 10}
- Node 13: {5, 2, 3, 0, 14}
- Node 14: {4, 13, 2, 10}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, 9, 10>, <4, 9, 12>, <4, 9, 8>, <4, 9, 11>, <4, 9, 14>, <8, 10, 9>, <8, 10, 12>, <8, 10, 14>, <8, 10, 3>, <8, 10, 4>, <9, 10, 12>, <9, 10, 8>, <9, 10, 14>, <9, 10, 3>, <9, 10, 4>, <9, 12, 10>, <9, 12, 8>, <9, 12, 10>, <9, 12, 8>, <9, 12, 10>, <9, 12, 8>, <9, 12, 10>, <9, 12, 8>, <9, 12, 10>, <9, 12, 8>, <13, 5, 3>, <13, 5, 14>, <13, 5, 0>, <13, 5, 2>, <13, 5, 6>, <13, 2, 14>, <13, 2, 0>, <13, 2, 11>, <13, 2, 6>, <13, 3, 0>, <13, 3, 2>, <13, 3, 10>, <13, 3, 5>, <13, 3, 6>
