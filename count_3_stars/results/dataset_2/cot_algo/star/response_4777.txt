Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 23) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 2) (14, 28) (14, 16) (17, 20) (17, 23) (17, 11) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 27) (0, 27) (0, 29) (0, 19) (27, 1) (27, 0) (27, 19) (22, 23) (22, 26) (23, 3) (23, 17) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 10) (28, 14) (28, 8) (28, 12) (29, 0) (29, 5) (29, 10) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 21) (13, 1) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 6) (5, 29) (5, 13) (5, 11) (20, 17) (20, 9) (18, 26) (18, 9) (18, 8) (7, 25) (25, 7) (25, 21) (8, 3) (8, 28) (8, 18) (8, 19) (19, 0) (19, 27) (19, 8) (19, 10) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 4) (12, 1) (12, 28) (16, 14) (16, 9) (9, 20) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 2) (6, 15) (6, 13) (2, 15) (2, 9) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 11) (10, 23) (10, 29) (10, 13) (10, 19) (21, 26) (21, 25) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors - 27, 29
- Node 1: Neighbors - 3, 13, 12, 27
- Node 2: Neighbors - 15, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors - 15, 1, 23, 8, 4
- Node 4: Neighbors - 3, 15, 11
- Node 5: Neighbors - 29, 13, 11
- Node 6: Neighbors - 15, 13
- Node 7: Neighbors - 25
- Node 8: Neighbors - 3, 28, 18, 19
- Node 9: Neighbors - 20, 18, 16, 2
- Node 10: Neighbors - 23, 29, 13, 19
- Node 11: Neighbors - 17, 5, 4
- Node 12: Neighbors - 1, 28
- Node 13: Neighbors - 1, 26, 5, 10, 6
- Node 14: Neighbors - 28, 16
- Node 15: Neighbors - 3, 6, 4, 2
- Node 16: Neighbors - 14, 9
- Node 17: Neighbors - 20, 23, 11
- Node 18: Neighbors - 26, 9, 8
- Node 19: Neighbors - 27, 0, 8, 10
- Node 20: Neighbors - 17, 9
- Node 21: Neighbors - 26, 25
- Node 22: Neighbors - 23, 26
- Node 23: Neighbors - 3, 17, 22, 26, 10
- Node 25: Neighbors - 7, 21
- Node 26: Neighbors - 22, 23, 13, 18, 21
- Node 27: Neighbors - 1, 0, 19
- Node 28: Neighbors - 14, 8, 12
- Node 29: Neighbors - 0, 5, 10

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 42

Unique 3-stars:
- <8, (3, 28, 18)>
- <13, (1, 26, 5)>
- <15, (3, 6, 4)>
- <19, (27, 0, 8)>
- <23, (3, 17, 22)>
- <26, (22, 13, 18)>
