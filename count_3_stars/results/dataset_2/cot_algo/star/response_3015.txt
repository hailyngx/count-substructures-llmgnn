Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 19) (22, 11) (22, 17) (22, 25) (22, 8) (9, 26) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 25) (26, 27) (26, 0) (0, 26) (0, 27) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (27, 26) (27, 0) (27, 15) (27, 11) (15, 9) (15, 27) (15, 23) (8, 22) (8, 21) (23, 15) (23, 7) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 24) (10, 25) (17, 22) (17, 3) (29, 1) (29, 3) (2, 0) (2, 19) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 5) (18, 4) (18, 28) (18, 21) (18, 3) (16, 13) (28, 18) (21, 8) (21, 10) (21, 18) (21, 11) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 29) (3, 17) (3, 29) (3, 18) (3, 14) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 12) (14, 3) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 19) (7, 9) (7, 23) (7, 20) (20, 7) (20, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 20) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 25) (24, 10) (11, 22) (11, 27) (11, 21) (11, 6) (25, 22) (25, 26) (25, 10) (25, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 2, 5, 6, 27
Node 1: 9, 10, 29
Node 2: 0, 19
Node 3: 14, 17, 18, 29
Node 4: 5, 9, 18
Node 5: 0, 4, 12
Node 6: 0, 11, 12, 19
Node 7: 9, 20, 23
Node 8: 21, 22
Node 9: 1, 4, 7, 15, 26
Node 10: 1, 21, 24, 25
Node 11: 6, 21, 22, 27
Node 12: 5, 6, 20
Node 13: 16, 19
Node 14: 3
Node 15: 9, 23, 27
Node 16: 13
Node 17: 3, 22
Node 18: 3, 4, 21, 28
Node 19: 2, 6, 13, 25
Node 20: 7, 12
Node 21: 8, 10, 11, 18
Node 22: 8, 11, 17, 25
Node 23: 7, 15
Node 24: 10
Node 25: 10, 19, 22, 26
Node 26: 9, 25, 27
Node 27: 0, 11, 15, 26
Node 28: 18
Node 29: 1, 3

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get 50. Therefore, the answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, 14, 17, 18>, <3, 14, 17, 29>, <3, 17, 18, 29>, <4, 5, 9, 18>, <6, 11, 21, 22>, <9, 15, 26, 27>, <10, 21, 25, 11>, <18, 21, 11, 22>, <19, 13, 25, 6>, <19, 25, 6, 22>, <21, 18, 3, 11>, <22, 8, 17, 25>, <4, 5, 18, 12>, <3, 14, 29, 18>, <17, 3, 22, 25>, <21, 10, 11, 25>, <21, 18, 28, 11>, <11, 6, 21, 27>, <9, 7, 15, 23>, <18, 21, 28, 3>
