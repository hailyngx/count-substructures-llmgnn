Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9, 6, 8
- Node 1: 9, 6, 2
- Node 2: 5, 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 5, 6, 2
- Node 4: 5, 7
- Node 5: 9, 2, 4, 0, 3, 7
- Node 6: 9, 7, 1, 3, 2, 0
- Node 7: 5, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 9, 7, 0
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8, 1, 0

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 64

So, the final answer is [64].
