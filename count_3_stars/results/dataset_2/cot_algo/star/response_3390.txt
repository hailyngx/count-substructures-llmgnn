- Node 25 is connected to nodes 18, 20, and 27.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 6 and 27.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 19, 23, 25, and 26.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 5, 18, and 29.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 23 and 28.

Next, we need to identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 9, 16, 17. Possible 3-stars: <3, (9, 16, 17)>.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 28. Possible 3-stars: <5, (2, 6, 28)>.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 13, 21. Possible 3-stars: <8, (0, 13, 21)>.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 9, 19, 22. Possible 3-stars: <10, (9, 19, 22)>.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 19, 20, 23. Possible 3-stars: <11, (19, 20, 23)>.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 17, 19, 24. Possible 3-stars: <12, (17, 19, 24)>.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 3, 14, 17. Possible 3-stars: <16, (3, 14, 17)>.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 10, 11, 27. Possible 3-stars: <19, (10, 11, 27)>.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors: 11, 12, 21. Possible 3-stars: <20, (11, 12, 21)>.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 8, 20, 24. Possible 3-stars: <21, (8, 20, 24)>.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 10. Possible 3-stars: <22, (2, 4, 10)>.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors: 11, 17, 27. Possible 3-stars: <23, (11, 17, 27)>.

The total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [12].
