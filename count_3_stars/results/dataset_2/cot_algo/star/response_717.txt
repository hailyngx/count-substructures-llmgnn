Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 22) (11, 13) (11, 5) (16, 14) (3, 25) (3, 7) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 6) (25, 29) (22, 11) (22, 23) (22, 24) (23, 22) (23, 6) (23, 19) (8, 19) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 29) (12, 20) (12, 18) (12, 0) (27, 4) (27, 9) (4, 27) (4, 18) (4, 10) (29, 25) (29, 13) (18, 12) (18, 4) (18, 6) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 21) (14, 16) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 24) (14, 10) (26, 28) (26, 10) (28, 26) (28, 1) (28, 24) (1, 8) (1, 28) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 1) (15, 19) (19, 23) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 24) (9, 25) (9, 27) (9, 20) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 26) (10, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 20) (6, 25) (6, 23) (6, 18) (6, 14) (6, 10) (2, 1) (2, 21) (20, 12) (20, 9) (20, 5) (20, 21) (21, 0) (21, 2) (21, 20) (21, 24) (24, 22) (24, 14) (24, 28) (24, 19) (24, 21) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {12, 14, 21}
- Node 1: {8, 15, 2, 28}
- Node 2: {1, 21}
- Node 3: {25, 7}
- Node 4: {27, 18, 10}
- Node 5: {11, 7, 20}
- Node 6: {25, 23, 18, 14, 10}
- Node 7: {11, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 19}
- Node 9: {25, 27, 20}
- Node 10: {4, 14, 26, 6}
- Node 11: {7, 22, 13, 5}
- Node 12: {0, 20, 18}
- Node 13: {11, 29}
- Node 14: {16, 0, 6, 24, 10}
- Node 15: {1, 19}
- Node 16: {14}
- Node 18: {12, 4, 6}
- Node 19: {23, 8, 15, 24}
- Node 20: {12, 9, 5, 21}
- Node 21: {0, 2, 20, 24}
- Node 22: {11, 23, 24}
- Node 23: {22, 6, 19}
- Node 24: {16, 14, 28, 19, 21}
- Node 25: {3, 9, 29, 6}
- Node 26: {28, 10}
- Node 27: {4, 9}
- Node 28: {26, 1, 24}
- Node 29: {25, 13}

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 (26 nodes)
- Total number of 3-stars = 26 * \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 26

Thus, the final number of 3-stars is [26].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (12, 14, 21)>
- <1, (8, 15, 2)>
- <3, (25, 7, 9)>
- <4, (27, 18, 10)>
- <5, (11, 7, 20)>
- <6, (25, 23, 18)>
- <7, (11, 3, 5)>
- <8, (1, 19, 15)>
- <9, (25, 27, 20)>
- <10, (4, 14, 26)>
- <11, (7, 13, 22)>
- <12, (0, 20, 18)>
- <13, (11, 29)>
- <15, (1, 19, 8)>
- <18, (12, 4, 6)>
- <19, (23, 8, 15)>
- <20, (12, 9, 5)>
- <21, (0, 2, 20)>
- <22, (11, 23, 24)>
- <24, (16, 14, 28)>
- <25, (3, 9, 29)>
- <26, (28, 10, 26)>
- <27, (4, 9, 27)>
- <28, (26, 1, 24)>
- <29, (25, 13, 29)>
