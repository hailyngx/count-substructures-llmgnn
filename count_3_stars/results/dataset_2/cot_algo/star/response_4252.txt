Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 7) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 10) (8, 16) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 2) (12, 17) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (0, 2) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 10) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 19) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 17) (5, 15) (5, 19) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 14) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 13) (17, 12) (17, 15) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 13) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 14) (3, 18) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 13) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 4, 16, 19
- Node 2: 0, 10, 12, 19
- Node 3: 18
- Node 4: 1, 15, 18
- Node 5: 15, 19
- Node 6: 9, 11
- Node 7: 9, 10, 14
- Node 8: 10, 16
- Node 9: 6, 7, 11, 18
- Node 10: 2, 7, 8, 13
- Node 11: 6, 9, 13, 18
- Node 12: 2, 17
- Node 13: 10, 11, 14, 16
- Node 14: 7, 13, 16, 19
- Node 15: 4, 5, 17
- Node 16: 1, 8, 13, 14
- Node 17: 12, 15
- Node 18: 3, 4, 9, 11
- Node 19: 2, 5, 1, 14

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 1, Node 13, Node 16, and Node 19 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 7 and Node 14 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 3-stars each.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4, Node 9, and Node 11 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 3-stars each.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 16, 19)>, <13, (10, 11, 14)>, <16, (1, 13, 14)>, <19, (1, 14, 16)>, <7, (9, 10, 14)>, <14, (7, 13, 16)>, <10, (2, 7, 10)>, <2, (10, 12, 19)>, <4, (1, 15, 18)>, <9, (6, 7, 11)>, <11, (6, 9, 13)>.
