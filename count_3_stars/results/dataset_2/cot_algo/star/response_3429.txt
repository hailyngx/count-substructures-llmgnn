Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes in the graph. Let's go through each node to find its neighbors:

Node 0 neighbors: {9}
Node 1 neighbors: {9, 8, 6, 4}
Node 2 neighbors: {5, 8, 3}
Node 3 neighbors: {9, 2, 8, 7, 6}
Node 4 neighbors: {5, 9, 1, 6}
Node 5 neighbors: {9, 2, 4, 7}
Node 6 neighbors: {7, 1, 3, 4}
Node 7 neighbors: {5, 8, 3, 6}
Node 8 neighbors: {9, 2, 3, 1, 7}
Node 9 neighbors: {5, 8, 4, 3, 1, 0}

Now, let's check which nodes form 3-stars:

Node 1 forms 3-stars: <1, (9, 8, 6)>, <1, (9, 4, 6)>
Node 3 forms 3-stars: <3, (9, 2, 8)>, <3, (9, 7, 6)>, <3, (8, 7, 6)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (7, 1, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
