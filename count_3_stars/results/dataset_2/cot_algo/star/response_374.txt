Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 4) (22, 23) (22, 9) (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 8) (27, 15) (27, 25) (27, 21) (27, 3) (27, 26) (4, 13) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 23) (7, 26) (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 1) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 26) (10, 11) (23, 22) (23, 7) (23, 19) (20, 1) (12, 7) (12, 9) (12, 28) (12, 29) (9, 22) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 17) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 18) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 25) (0, 6) (2, 24) (25, 27) (25, 0) (25, 1) (25, 26) (25, 24) (24, 16) (24, 2) (24, 25) (1, 11) (1, 20) (1, 25) (5, 3) (8, 15) (8, 29) (8, 21) (28, 12) (28, 0) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 18) (14, 6) (14, 3) (3, 27) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 14) (19, 23) (19, 21) (21, 27) (21, 8) (21, 19) (21, 29) (29, 12) (29, 8) (29, 21) (26, 27) (26, 7) (26, 16) (26, 25) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list all the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 25, 28
- Node 1: 10, 11, 20, 25
- Node 2: 24
- Node 3: 5, 6, 14, 27
- Node 4: 7, 9, 13, 17
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 3, 14, 18
- Node 7: 0, 4, 12, 23, 26
- Node 8: 15, 18, 21, 29
- Node 9: 4, 12, 17, 22
- Node 10: 1, 11
- Node 11: 1, 10, 16, 25, 26
- Node 12: 7, 9, 28, 29
- Node 13: 4
- Node 14: 3, 6
- Node 15: 8, 18, 21, 27
- Node 16: 11, 24, 26
- Node 17: 4, 9, 18
- Node 18: 6, 8, 17, 15
- Node 19: 21, 23
- Node 20: 1
- Node 21: 8, 15, 19, 27, 29
- Node 22: 9, 23
- Node 23: 7, 19, 22, 27
- Node 24: 2, 16, 25
- Node 25: 1, 24, 26, 27
- Node 26: 7, 11, 16, 25, 27
- Node 27: 3, 15, 21, 23, 25, 26
- Node 28: 0, 12
- Node 29: 8, 12, 21

Now, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:
- Node 7: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 11: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 15: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 21: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 25: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 26: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 27: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 72

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [72].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<7, (0, 23, 26)>
<9, (4, 12, 17)>
<11, (1, 16, 26)>
<15, (8, 18, 21)>
<21, (8, 15, 29)>
<25, (1, 24, 26)>
<26, (7, 16, 27)>
<27, (3, 21, 25)>
