Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 4) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 3) (10, 19) (10, 12) (10, 9) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 4) (16, 0) (16, 9) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 17) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 18) (6, 18) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 3) (17, 8) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 6) (17, 9) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 6) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 0) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 17) (12, 10) (12, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be counted as follows:

Node 0: Neighbors {16, 17, 4, 11} -> 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 2: Neighbors {11, 3, 4} -> 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
Node 3: Neighbors {13, 2, 19, 6} -> 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 4: Neighbors {2, 19, 0} -> 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
Node 5: Neighbors {15, 19, 7} -> 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
Node 6: Neighbors {18, 17, 3, 14} -> 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 7: Neighbors {8, 5, 18} -> 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
Node 17: Neighbors {8, 0, 18, 6, 9} -> 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 26

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].

And the unique 3-stars found are:
