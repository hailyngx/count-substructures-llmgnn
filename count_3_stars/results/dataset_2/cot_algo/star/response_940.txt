Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 13) (6, 2) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 13) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 16) (17, 12) (17, 2) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 13) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 0) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 7) (12, 19) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 10) (2, 6) (2, 17) (10, 0) (10, 16) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 1) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 4) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 19) (4, 11) (4, 19) (19, 12) (19, 1) (19, 4) (16, 14) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 1) (5, 3) (5, 18) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 14, 13, 10
- Node 1: 9, 18, 11, 16, 19
- Node 2: 6, 17
- Node 3: 15, 5, 12
- Node 4: 11, 19
- Node 5: 3, 18
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 12, 11
- Node 8: 15, 3, 13
- Node 9: 1, 18, 13
- Node 10: 0, 16
- Node 11: 7, 1, 4
- Node 12: 3, 17, 7, 19
- Node 13: 15, 9, 8, 0
- Node 14: 0, 18, 16
- Node 15: 3, 8, 13
- Node 16: 14, 10, 18, 1
- Node 17: 2, 12
- Node 18: 9, 14, 5, 16, 1
- Node 19: 12, 1, 4

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of unique 3-stars for each such node by applying \( \binom{n}{3} \). 

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (13, 14, 16)>
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: 
  <1, (9, 11, 16)>, <1, (9, 11, 18)>, <1, (9, 11, 19)>, <1, (9, 16, 18)>, <1, (9, 16, 19)>, 
  <1, (9, 18, 16)>, <1, (11, 16, 18)>, <1, (11, 16, 19)>, <1, (11, 18, 16)>, <1, (16, 18, 19)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (8, 12, 15)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <8, (3, 13, 15)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <9, (13, 18, 1)>
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
  <12, (3, 17, 19)>, <12, (7, 17, 19)>, <12, (7, 12, 19)>, <12, (7, 12, 17)>
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
  <13, (0, 8, 15)>, <13, (0, 8, 9)>, <13, (0, 9, 15)>, <13, (8, 9, 15)>
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <14, (0, 16, 18)>
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
  <16, (1, 14, 18)>, <16, (1, 14, 10)>, <16, (1, 18, 10)>, <16, (14, 18, 10)>
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: 
  <18, (1, 9, 16)>, <18, (1, 9, 19)>, <18, (1, 16, 19)>, <18, (9, 16, 19)>,
  <18, (5, 14, 16)>, <18, (5, 14, 0)>, <18, (5, 0, 16)>, <18, (14, 0, 16)>, 
  <18, (16, 1, 19)>, <18, (16, 14, 0)>
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <19, (1, 4, 12)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of 36 unique 3-stars, so the final answer is [36].
