Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 21) (2, 4) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 10) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 6) (27, 29) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 20) (27, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 23) (10, 29) (10, 13) (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 7) (22, 0) (26, 5) (26, 3) (24, 12) (24, 15) (6, 12) (6, 7) (6, 3) (21, 2) (21, 27) (21, 23) (21, 14) (28, 18) (28, 23) (5, 12) (5, 26) (5, 11) (0, 17) (0, 22) (0, 11) (0, 19) (15, 24) (19, 29) (19, 0) (19, 25) (23, 4) (23, 21) (23, 28) (3, 8) (3, 26) (3, 6) (3, 14) (14, 21) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 16) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 20) (1, 9) (20, 27) (20, 1) (20, 9) (20, 11) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 18) (25, 19) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 20) (16, 8) (16, 14) (9, 27) (9, 1) (9, 20) (18, 17) (18, 28) (18, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 17, 19, 22}
- Node 1: {9, 13, 14, 20}
- Node 2: {4, 21}
- Node 3: {6, 8, 14, 26}
- Node 4: {2, 8, 23}
- Node 5: {11, 12, 26}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 12}
- Node 7: {6, 17, 18}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 16}
- Node 9: {1, 20, 27}
- Node 10: {13, 17, 29}
- Node 11: {0, 5, 13, 20}
- Node 12: {5, 6, 24, 27}
- Node 13: {1, 10, 11}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 16, 21}
- Node 15: {24}
- Node 16: {8, 14}
- Node 17: {0, 7, 10, 18}
- Node 18: {7, 17, 28}
- Node 19: {0, 25, 29}
- Node 20: {1, 9, 11, 27}
- Node 21: {2, 14, 23, 27}
- Node 22: {0}
- Node 23: {4, 21, 28}
- Node 24: {12, 15}
- Node 25: {19}
- Node 26: {3, 5}
- Node 27: {9, 12, 20, 21, 29}
- Node 28: {18, 23}
- Node 29: {10, 19, 27}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors
- Node 20: 4 neighbors
- Node 21: 4 neighbors
- Node 23: 3 neighbors
- Node 27: 5 neighbors
- Node 28: 2 neighbors
- Node 29: 3 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \sum_{\text{Nodes with 3 or more neighbors}} \binom{n}{3} = \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} =  1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 53 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 17, 19>
- <1, 11, 13>
- <3, 7, 14>
- <4, 8, 21>
- <5, 11, 12>
- <7, 17, 18>
- <11, 20, 27>
- <12, 20, 24>
- <13, 17, 20>
- <14, 16, 21>
- <17, 18, 28>
- <19, 25, 29>
- <23, 28, 21>
- <27, 21, 29>
