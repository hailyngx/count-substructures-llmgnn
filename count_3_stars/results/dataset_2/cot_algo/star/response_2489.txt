Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 1) (3, 13) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 6, 11, 2}
- Node 1: {5, 3, 12, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 13, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 4, 10, 1, 13}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 13, 14, 3}
- Node 5: {8, 1, 0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {10, 2, 12, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 4, 10, 2}
- Node 8: {5, 1, 13, 14, 12}
- Node 9: {11, 13}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 3}
- Node 11: {9, 0}
- Node 12: {6, 1, 8, 14}
- Node 13: {9, 4, 3, 8, 2}
- Node 14: {4, 8, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the 3-stars attached to each:

- For Node 0, there are 4 neighbors, so we can form \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
- For Node 1, there are 4 neighbors, so we can form \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
- For Node 2, there are 4 neighbors, so we can form \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
- For Node 3, there are 5 neighbors, so we can form \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars.
- For Node 4, there are 5 neighbors, so we can form \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars.
- For Node 5, there are 5 neighbors, so we can form \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars.
- For Node 6, there are 5 neighbors, so we can form \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars.
- For Node 8, there are 5 neighbors, so we can form \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars.
- For Node 13, there are 5 neighbors, so we can form \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars.
  
Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 72\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [72].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 5, 3>
- <0, 5, 1>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 3, 13>
- <1, 8, 12>
- <1, 8, 14>
- <2, 6, 10>
- <2, 6, 12>
- <2, 13, 8>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 4, 13>
- <3, 10, 7>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 13>
- <4, 7, 10>
- <5, 7, 10>
- <5, 7, 4>
- <5, 8, 12>
- <5, 8, 14>
- <6, 10, 7>
- <6, 10, 3>
- <6, 12, 8>
- <6, 12, 1>
- <7, 4, 13>
- <8, 13, 2>
- <8, 13, 4>
- <8, 13, 3>
- <8, 14, 12>
