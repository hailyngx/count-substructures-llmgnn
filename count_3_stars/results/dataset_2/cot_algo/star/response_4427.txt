Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 5) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 15) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 2) (17, 15) (6, 9) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 10) (4, 11) (4, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 19) (5, 16) (5, 17) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 13) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 13) (18, 12) (18, 10) (19, 12) (19, 1) (19, 13) (3, 7) (3, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 19) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 3) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 19) (0, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {12}
- Node 1: {8, 14, 19}
- Node 2: {3, 16, 17}
- Node 3: {2, 7}
- Node 4: {9, 11}
- Node 5: {16, 17}
- Node 6: {9, 12}
- Node 7: {3, 12, 16}
- Node 8: {1, 11}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 10, 15}
- Node 10: {9, 13, 15, 18}
- Node 11: {4, 8, 14, 17}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 7, 18, 19}
- Node 13: {10, 15, 19}
- Node 14: {11, 15}
- Node 15: {9, 10, 13, 14, 17}
- Node 16: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 17: {2, 5, 11, 15}
- Node 18: {10, 12}
- Node 19: {1, 12, 13}

Now, we need to identify the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Calculating \( inom{n}{3} \) for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 9: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<9, (4, 6, 10)>
<10, (9, 13, 15)>
<12, (0, 7, 18)>
<15, (9, 10, 13)>
