Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 25) (16, 22) (16, 27) (1, 11) (1, 21) (1, 14) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 13) (21, 5) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 20) (9, 11) (9, 18) (7, 21) (7, 29) (7, 24) (26, 10) (8, 28) (8, 29) (8, 22) (23, 10) (23, 13) (23, 28) (17, 6) (17, 29) (17, 15) (29, 7) (29, 8) (29, 17) (29, 27) (3, 18) (0, 28) (0, 25) (0, 18) (25, 11) (25, 0) (4, 2) (12, 2) (12, 18) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 20) (10, 26) (10, 23) (10, 24) (10, 5) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 12) (28, 8) (28, 23) (28, 0) (13, 21) (13, 23) (13, 20) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 5) (15, 24) (19, 15) (19, 20) (27, 16) (27, 29) (27, 5) (20, 6) (20, 2) (20, 13) (20, 19) (24, 7) (24, 10) (24, 15) (24, 14) (14, 1) (14, 24) (22, 16) (22, 8) (22, 5) (5, 21) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 27) (5, 22) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {18, 25, 28}
- Node 1: {11, 14, 21}
- Node 2: {4, 12, 15, 20}
- Node 3: {18}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {10, 15, 21, 22, 27}
- Node 6: {17, 18, 20}
- Node 7: {21, 24, 29}
- Node 8: {22, 28, 29}
- Node 9: {11, 18}
- Node 10: {5, 23, 24, 26}
- Node 11: {1, 9, 25}
- Node 12: {2, 18}
- Node 13: {20, 21, 23}
- Node 14: {1, 24}
- Node 15: {2, 5, 17, 19, 24}
- Node 16: {22, 27}
- Node 17: {6, 15, 29}
- Node 18: {0, 3, 6, 9, 12}
- Node 19: {15, 20}
- Node 20: {2, 6, 13, 19}
- Node 21: {1, 5, 7, 13}
- Node 22: {5, 8, 16}
- Node 23: {10, 13, 28}
- Node 24: {7, 10, 14, 15}
- Node 25: {0, 11}
- Node 26: {10}
- Node 27: {5, 16, 29}
- Node 28: {0, 8, 23}
- Node 29: {7, 17, 27}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 1
- Node 2: 1
- Node 5: 5
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 1
- Node 10: 1
- Node 11: 1
- Node 15: 5
- Node 18: 5
- Node 20: 1
- Node 21: 1
- Node 22: 1
- Node 24: 1
- Node 27: 1
- Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (18, 25, 28)>, <1, (11, 14, 21)>, <2, (4, 12, 15)>, <5, (10, 15, 22)>, <5, (10, 15, 27)>, <5, (10, 22, 27)>, <5, (15, 22, 27)>, <5, (21, 22, 27)>, <7, (24, 29, 7)>, <8, (22, 28, 8)>, <10, (10, 23, 24)>, <11, (1, 9, 11)>, <15, (5, 15, 24)>, <15, (5, 15, 17)>, <15, (17, 15, 24)>, <15, (15, 19, 24)>, <15, (15, 5, 24)>, <18, (18, 6, 9)>, <18, (9, 18, 12)>, <18, (18, 0, 12)>, <18, (18, 3, 12)>, <18, (18, 12, 0)>, <20, (13, 20, 21)>, <21, (5, 21, 13)>, <22, (5, 22, 16)>, <24, (24, 14, 1)>, <27, (27, 5, 16)>, <29, (7, 29, 17)>
