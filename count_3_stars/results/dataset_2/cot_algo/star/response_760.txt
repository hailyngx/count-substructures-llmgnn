Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 2) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (11, 8) (11, 0) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 3) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 8, 10, 11
- Node 1: 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 10, 12
- Node 3: 4, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14
- Node 4: 1, 3, 7, 13, 14
- Node 5: 0, 7, 8, 9, 13
- Node 6: 3, 9, 13
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 9, 11
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8, 12
- Node 10: 0, 2, 3, 13
- Node 11: 0, 8
- Node 12: 2, 3, 9, 14
- Node 13: 3, 4, 5, 6, 10
- Node 14: 3, 4, 12

Now, we will check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 12, 13

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 74

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [74].
