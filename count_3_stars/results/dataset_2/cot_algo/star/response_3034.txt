Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 15) (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 6) (17, 18) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 4) (10, 11) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 4) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 5) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 1) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 15) (9, 18) (9, 1) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 19) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 6) (15, 16) (15, 12) (15, 6) (5, 11) (5, 18) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {7, 8, 6}
Node 1: {4, 8, 9}
Node 2: {4, 10, 18}
Node 3: {7, 8, 12}
Node 4: {1, 2, 13}
Node 5: {11, 18}
Node 6: {0, 15, 17, 19}
Node 7: {0, 3}
Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 12, 13}
Node 9: {1, 18}
Node 10: {2, 11}
Node 11: {5, 16, 19, 10}
Node 12: {3, 8, 15, 16}
Node 13: {4, 8, 14}
Node 14: {13, 19}
Node 15: {6, 12, 16}
Node 16: {11, 12, 15}
Node 17: {6, 18}
Node 18: {2, 5, 9, 17}
Node 19: {6, 11, 14}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star per node
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars per node
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars per node

Adding all the 3-stars together:
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 10>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 1, 8>
<6, 0, 15>
<6, 17, 18>
<6, 17, 19>
<6, 15, 16>
<8, 3, 12>
<8, 12, 13>
<11, 5, 18>
<11, 5, 19>
<11, 10, 16>
<12, 3, 8>
<12, 8, 13>
<12, 15, 16>
<18, 2, 5>
<18, 2, 9>
<18, 5, 11>
<18, 9, 17>
<19, 6, 11>
<19, 6, 14>
