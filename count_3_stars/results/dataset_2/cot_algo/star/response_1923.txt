Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 15) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 10) (17, 11) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 15) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 19) (7, 9) (7, 15) (7, 16) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 7) (18, 12) (18, 0) (19, 6) (19, 12) (14, 4) (14, 11) (0, 6) (0, 18) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:
There are two steps involved in determining the number of 3-stars in this graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges:

Step 1: Finding all nodes with their neighbors
- Node 0: {6, 18}
- Node 1: {5, 11, 15}
- Node 2: {11, 13}
- Node 3: {5, 11, 16}
- Node 4: {9, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 12}
- Node 6: {0, 9, 17, 19}
- Node 7: {9, 15, 16}
- Node 8: {13, 16, 17}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 10: {12, 17}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 3, 14}
- Node 12: {5, 10, 18, 19}
- Node 13: {2, 4, 8, 15}
- Node 14: {4, 11}
- Node 15: {1, 7, 13}
- Node 16: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 17: {6, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 18: {0, 12}
- Node 19: {6, 12}

Step 2: Calculating the number of 3-stars
- Node 6, 12, and 17 each have 4 neighbors, so they each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- Node 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 13 each have 3 neighbors, so they each form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 19 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (0, 9, 17)>
<12, (5, 10, 18)>
<17, (6, 8, 10)>
<1, (5, 11, 15)>
<3, (5, 11, 16)>
<7, (9, 15, 16)>
<8, (13, 16, 17)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<13, (2, 4, 15)>
<11, (1, 3, 14)>
