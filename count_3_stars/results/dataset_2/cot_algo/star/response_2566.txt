Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 18) (16, 15) (9, 28) (9, 17) (9, 13) (26, 10) (26, 6) (26, 7) (26, 12) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 18) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 1) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 29) (22, 7) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 7) (23, 28) (15, 16) (15, 22) (15, 20) (15, 24) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 10) (17, 9) (17, 29) (17, 24) (29, 22) (29, 17) (29, 25) (28, 9) (28, 23) (28, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 25) (7, 26) (7, 22) (7, 23) (7, 0) (7, 2) (3, 0) (3, 21) (3, 27) (3, 18) (21, 22) (21, 3) (10, 26) (10, 20) (10, 1) (19, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 25) (4, 2) (12, 26) (12, 4) (25, 29) (25, 0) (25, 4) (2, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (5, 23) (5, 28) (5, 2) (6, 11) (6, 26) (14, 4) (14, 27) (27, 20) (27, 3) (27, 14) (1, 13) (1, 10) (24, 15) (24, 17) (18, 16) (18, 8) (18, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 7, 3, 25
- Node 1 neighbors: 13, 10
- Node 2 neighbors: 7, 4, 5
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 21, 27, 18
- Node 4 neighbors: 12, 14, 25, 2
- Node 5 neighbors: 23, 28, 2
- Node 6 neighbors: 11, 26
- Node 7 neighbors: 26, 22, 23, 0, 2
- Node 8 neighbors: 13, 19, 18
- Node 9 neighbors: 28, 17, 13
- Node 10 neighbors: 26, 20, 1
- Node 11 neighbors: 13, 6
- Node 12 neighbors: 26, 4
- Node 13 neighbors: 11, 9, 8, 1
- Node 14 neighbors: 4, 27
- Node 15 neighbors: 16, 22, 20, 24
- Node 16 neighbors: 18, 15
- Node 17 neighbors: 9, 29, 24
- Node 18 neighbors: 16, 8, 3
- Node 19 neighbors: 8
- Node 20 neighbors: 15, 27, 10
- Node 21 neighbors: 22, 3
- Node 22 neighbors: 23, 15, 29, 7, 21
- Node 23 neighbors: 22, 5, 7, 28
- Node 24 neighbors: 15, 17
- Node 25 neighbors: 29, 0, 4
- Node 26 neighbors: 10, 6, 7, 12
- Node 27 neighbors: 20, 3, 14
- Node 28 neighbors: 9, 23, 5
- Node 29 neighbors: 22, 17, 25

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 5: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 8: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 10: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 13: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 15: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 17: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 18: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 22: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 23: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 26: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 27: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 28: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 29: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Total number of 3-stars formed: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<22, (23, 15, 7)>
<26, (6, 12, 7)>
<26, (10, 1, 13)>
<15, (16, 24, 20)>
<4, (12, 25, 2)>
<15, (16, 18, 22)>
<23, (5, 28, 7)>
<3, (0, 27, 21)>
<20, (27, 3, 14)>
<9, (17, 13, 28)>
<17, (9, 29, 24)>
