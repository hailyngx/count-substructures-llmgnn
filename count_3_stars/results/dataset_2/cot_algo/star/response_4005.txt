Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, we'll determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 7
- Node 3: 2, 8, 9
- Node 4: 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 7, 8

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 7, and Node 8 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 1 and Node 5 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
10 3-stars from Node 0
4 3-stars from Node 1
4 3-stars from Node 5
10 3-stars from Node 7
10 3-stars from Node 8
4 3-stars from Node 9

Total = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 42 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found are:
