Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (10, 4) (10, 11) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 14) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 5) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {11, 13, 6, 12}
- Node 1: {6, 2, 5}
- Node 2: {13, 1, 12, 5, 14}
- Node 3: {11, 6, 9, 5}
- Node 4: {9, 10, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 3, 1, 2, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {8, 3, 1, 0}
- Node 7: {11, 14, 9}
- Node 8: {11, 13, 9, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 8, 3, 14}
- Node 10: {4, 11}
- Node 11: {7, 10, 3, 0, 8}
- Node 12: {2, 5, 14, 0}
- Node 13: {8, 2, 0}
- Node 14: {7, 9, 2, 12, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 2, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13 do not have 3 or more neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.
- Node 0, 4, 8 have exactly 3 neighbors each, so they each form 1 3-star.
- Node 3, 5, 9, 11, 14 have more than 3 neighbors, so we will calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each:
  - Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  - Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 57

Therefore, the final answer is [57], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 6, 11>, <0, 8, 13>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 11, 13>, <3, 5, 12>, <3, 5, 14>, <3, 9, 14>, <3, 11, 14>, <3, 9, 4>, <5, 2, 12>, <5, 2, 14>, <5, 12, 14>, <5, 2, 14>, <5, 12, 14>, <9, 4, 7>, <9, 4, 14>, <9, 7, 11>, <9, 3, 11>, <9, 14, 7>, <11, 7, 14>
