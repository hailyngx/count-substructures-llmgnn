Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 23) (0, 6) (27, 22) (27, 10) (27, 16) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 14) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 20) (8, 21) (28, 11) (28, 25) (28, 20) (29, 9) (29, 19) (2, 8) (2, 10) (11, 28) (11, 17) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 21) (9, 3) (9, 7) (17, 11) (17, 6) (7, 9) (7, 24) (16, 27) (16, 24) (16, 18) (19, 29) (22, 27) (22, 25) (22, 1) (10, 27) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 18) (26, 10) (26, 12) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 23) (24, 4) (24, 7) (24, 16) (6, 0) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 18) (25, 28) (25, 9) (25, 22) (25, 1) (25, 15) (15, 0) (15, 25) (15, 14) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 15) (1, 13) (1, 22) (1, 25) (20, 8) (20, 28) (23, 0) (23, 3) (23, 21) (12, 5) (12, 26) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 6) (21, 4) (21, 8) (21, 9) (21, 23) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 6, 15, 23}
- Node 1: {13, 22, 25}
- Node 2: {8, 10}
- Node 3: {0, 9, 23}
- Node 4: {8, 14, 21, 24}
- Node 5: {12, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 14, 17, 18}
- Node 7: {9, 24}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 10, 20, 21}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 21, 25, 29}
- Node 10: {2, 8, 18, 26, 27}
- Node 11: {17, 28}
- Node 12: {5, 26}
- Node 13: {1, 5}
- Node 14: {4, 6, 15}
- Node 15: {0, 14, 25}
- Node 16: {6, 18, 24, 27}
- Node 17: {6, 11}
- Node 18: {6, 10, 16}
- Node 19: {29}
- Node 20: {8, 28}
- Node 21: {4, 8, 9, 23}
- Node 22: {1, 25, 27}
- Node 23: {0, 3, 21}
- Node 24: {4, 7, 14, 16}
- Node 25: {1, 9, 15, 22, 28}
- Node 26: {10, 12}
- Node 27: {10, 16, 22}
- Node 28: {11, 20, 25}
- Node 29: {9, 19}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 8 is connected to 5 nodes (2, 4, 10, 20, 21), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars through node 8.
- Node 9 is connected to 5 nodes (3, 7, 21, 25, 29), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars through node 9.
- Node 10 is connected to 5 nodes (2, 8, 18, 26, 27), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars through node 10.
- Node 14 is connected to 3 nodes (4, 6, 15), so there is 1 3-star through node 14.
- Node 16 is connected to 4 nodes (6, 18, 24, 27), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars through node 16.
- Node 21 is connected to 4 nodes (4, 8, 9, 23), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars through node 21.
- Node 25 is connected to 5 nodes (1, 9, 15, 22, 28), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars through node 25.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 49 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [49], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<8, (2, 4, 21)>, <8, (2, 10, 27)>, <8, (2, 18, 10)>, <8, (4, 21, 23)>, <8, (9, 21, 25)>, <9, (3, 7, 29)>, <9, (3, 21, 25)>, <9, (7, 24, 25)>, <9, (21, 23, 25)>, <10, (2, 18, 27)>, <10, (8, 18, 27)>, <16, (6, 18, 27)>, <16, (6, 24, 27)>, <21, (4, 9, 23)>, <21, (4, 21, 23)>, <25, (9, 21, 28)>, <25, (15, 22, 28)>
