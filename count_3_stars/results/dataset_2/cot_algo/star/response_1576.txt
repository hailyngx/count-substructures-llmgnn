Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 25) (9, 28) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 25) (26, 21) (3, 15) (3, 7) (15, 26) (15, 3) (15, 16) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 24) (0, 8) (0, 20) (0, 2) (20, 8) (20, 0) (20, 4) (12, 27) (12, 16) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 21) (2, 0) (2, 22) (2, 13) (2, 11) (11, 23) (11, 2) (11, 28) (11, 14) (28, 9) (28, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (13, 2) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 18) (21, 26) (21, 27) (21, 6) (21, 29) (21, 24) (4, 20) (4, 27) (4, 19) (4, 16) (29, 21) (29, 1) (29, 25) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 17) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 4) (1, 6) (1, 29) (1, 19) (1, 18) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 22) (14, 7) (10, 5) (18, 6) (18, 1) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 17) (17, 22) (17, 7) (25, 9) (25, 26) (25, 29) (19, 12) (19, 4) (19, 1) (24, 23) (24, 21) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {8, 20, 2}
Node 1: {6, 29, 19, 18}
Node 2: {0, 22, 13, 11}
Node 3: {15, 7}
Node 4: {20, 27, 19, 16}
Node 5: {10, 14}
Node 6: {13, 21, 1, 18}
Node 7: {3, 14, 17}
Node 8: {23, 20, 0}
Node 9: {26, 25, 28}
Node 10: {5}
Node 11: {23, 2, 28, 14}
Node 12: {27, 16, 19}
Node 13: {2, 6}
Node 14: {11, 5, 22, 7}
Node 15: {26, 3, 16}
Node 16: {15, 12, 4}
Node 17: {7, 22}
Node 18: {6, 1}
Node 19: {12, 4, 1}
Node 20: {8, 0, 4}
Node 21: {26, 27, 6, 29, 24}
Node 22: {2, 14, 17}
Node 23: {8, 11, 24}
Node 24: {23, 21}
Node 25: {9, 26, 29}
Node 26: {9, 15, 21, 25}
Node 27: {12, 4, 21}
Node 28: {9, 11}
Node 29: {21, 1, 25}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <9, (26, 25, 28)>. 
Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <15, (26, 3, 16)>. 
Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <21, (26, 27, 6)>, <21, (26, 27, 29)>, <21, (26, 6, 24)>, <21, (26, 29, 24)>, <21, (27, 6, 24)>, <21, (27, 29, 24)>, <21, (6, 29, 24)>, <21, (26, 27, 29)>, <21, (26, 6, 29)>, <21, (27, 6, 29)>. 

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 = 12.
So, the final number of 3-stars is [12].
