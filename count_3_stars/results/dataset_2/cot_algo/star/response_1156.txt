Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can start by listing the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {4, 7, 9, 8, 2}
Node 1: {4, 6}
Node 2: {7, 5, 0, 3}
Node 3: {9, 5, 2}
Node 4: {7, 9, 5, 1, 0}
Node 5: {4, 6, 2, 3}
Node 6: {9, 5, 1, 8}
Node 7: {4, 0, 2, 8}
Node 8: {7, 6, 9, 0}
Node 9: {4, 6, 8, 3, 0}

Now, we can identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Summing up the 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 9, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<2, 7, 4>
<2, 7, 5>
<2, 7, 0>

<3, 9, 6>
<3, 9, 5>
<3, 5, 4>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 9, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
<6, 9, 5>
