Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 6) (13, 16) (13, 3) (13, 0) (10, 12) (10, 5) (17, 15) (17, 4) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 15) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 14) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 0) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 2) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 1) (1, 8) (1, 19) (2, 11) (2, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 2) (4, 3) (9, 14) (9, 7) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 15) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 14) (18, 12) (18, 15) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 15) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 5) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph.

First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {13, 6}
- Node 1: {8, 19}
- Node 2: {11, 4}
- Node 3: {13, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {17, 19, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {10, 11, 3}
- Node 6: {8, 19, 0}
- Node 7: {8, 9, 15}
- Node 8: {7, 16, 1, 6}
- Node 9: {14, 7}
- Node 10: {12, 5}
- Node 11: {19, 2, 5}
- Node 12: {10, 16, 18, 15}
- Node 13: {16, 3, 0}
- Node 14: {16, 9, 15}
- Node 15: {17, 12, 7, 18, 14}
- Node 16: {8, 13, 12, 14}
- Node 17: {15, 4}
- Node 18: {12, 15}
- Node 19: {6, 11, 4, 1}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 8 forms 3-stars with nodes: <8, 7, 16>, <8, 6, 19>, <8, 1, 19>, <8, 6, 0>
- Node 12 forms 3-stars with nodes: <12, 10, 15>
- Node 15 forms 3-stars with nodes: <15, 17, 18>
  
Total number of 3-stars = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
