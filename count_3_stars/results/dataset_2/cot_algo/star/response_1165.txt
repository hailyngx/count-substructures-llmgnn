Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 8}

Now, we identify which nodes can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: Yes (neighbor set size = 5)
- Node 1: Yes (neighbor set size = 5)
- Node 2: Yes (neighbor set size = 6)
- Node 3: No (neighbor set size = 4)
- Node 4: Yes (neighbor set size = 3)
- Node 5: No (neighbor set size = 3)
- Node 6: No (neighbor set size = 4)
- Node 7: No (neighbor set size = 4)
- Node 8: No (neighbor set size = 3)
- Node 9: No (neighbor set size = 3)

There are 3-stars formed by nodes 0, 1, and 2. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1].

The unique 3-star found:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
