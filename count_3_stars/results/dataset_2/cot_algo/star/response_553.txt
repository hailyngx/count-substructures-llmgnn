Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 6, 8, 3}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 4, 6, 2}
- Node 2: {8, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 8, 2, 0}
- Node 4: {8, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 1, 0, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 3, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 2, 0, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 1, 7}

Now, let's apply the combinatorial calculation to each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (8, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, 
<8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (4, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (4, 3, 9)>, 
<9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>
