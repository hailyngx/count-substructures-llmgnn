Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 17) (7, 10) (7, 17) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 10) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 18) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 2) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 0) (15, 13) (15, 12) (15, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (9, 3) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 16) (6, 1) (6, 2) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 14) (16, 5) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 12) (17, 4) (17, 7) (2, 19) (2, 15) (2, 6) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 4, 10
- Node 1: 6, 11, 14, 16
- Node 2: 6, 15, 19
- Node 3: 9, 10, 11
- Node 4: 0, 17
- Node 5: 10, 13, 16, 19
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 10, 17
- Node 8: 16, 19
- Node 9: 3
- Node 10: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 11: 1, 3, 19
- Node 12: 14, 15, 16
- Node 13: 5, 14, 15, 18
- Node 14: 1, 12, 13, 18
- Node 15: 2, 12, 13
- Node 16: 1, 5, 8, 12
- Node 17: 4, 7
- Node 18: 13, 14, 19
- Node 19: 2, 5, 8, 11, 18

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <1, (6, 14, 16)>, <1, (11, 14, 16)>, <1, (11, 14, 12)>, <1, (16, 12, 14)>
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) <2, (6, 15, 19)>
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <5, (10, 16, 19)>, <5, (13, 16, 18)>, <5, (13, 15, 18)>, <5, (16, 12, 18)>
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <10, (3, 5, 7)>, <10, (5, 16, 19)>, <10, (3, 11, 19)>, <10, (5, 16, 12)>
Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) <11, (1, 19, 14)>
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) <12, (14, 15, 16)>
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <13, (5, 15, 18)>, <13, (5, 16, 18)>, <13, (15, 12, 18)>, <13, (14, 15, 18)>
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <14, (1, 12, 16)>, <14, (1, 12, 15)>, <14, (1, 16, 18)>, <14, (12, 15, 18)>
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <16, (1, 12, 14)>, <16, (1, 5, 12)>, <16, (1, 5, 14)>, <16, (5, 12, 14)>
Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) <19, (2, 8, 18)>, <19, (2, 11, 18)>, <19, (2, 15, 18)>, <19, (2, 6, 18)>, <19, (5, 8, 18)>, <19, (5, 11, 18)>, <19, (5, 15, 18)>, <19, (5, 16, 18)>, <19, (8, 15, 18)>, <19, (11, 16, 18)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 37

Therefore, the final answer is [37].
