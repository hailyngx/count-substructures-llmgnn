Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 20) (2, 11) (18, 19) (18, 20) (18, 1) (19, 18) (19, 29) (19, 27) (26, 7) (26, 0) (26, 4) (21, 24) (21, 13) (21, 25) (24, 21) (24, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (22, 6) (22, 29) (22, 1) (22, 8) (4, 26) (4, 27) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 3) (27, 19) (27, 4) (0, 26) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 8) (7, 26) (7, 0) (7, 25) (7, 10) (7, 5) (25, 21) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 6) (25, 15) (16, 0) (11, 2) (11, 24) (11, 8) (11, 17) (5, 7) (5, 23) (5, 17) (5, 10) (23, 5) (23, 29) (23, 20) (13, 21) (13, 9) (13, 10) (28, 10) (3, 4) (8, 22) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 15) (1, 18) (1, 22) (1, 4) (1, 25) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 12) (29, 19) (29, 22) (29, 23) (20, 2) (20, 18) (20, 23) (6, 22) (6, 25) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 28) (12, 9) (12, 17) (15, 25) (15, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {26, 7, 16, 8}
- Node 1: {18, 22, 4, 25}
- Node 2: {20, 11}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {26, 27, 1, 14, 3}
- Node 5: {7, 23, 17, 10}
- Node 6: {22, 25}
- Node 7: {26, 0, 25, 10, 5}
- Node 8: {22, 0, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {13, 12}
- Node 10: {7, 5, 13, 28}
- Node 11: {2, 24, 8, 17}
- Node 12: {9, 17}
- Node 13: {21, 9, 10}
- Node 14: {4, 8, 15}
- Node 15: {25, 14}
- Node 16: {0}
- Node 17: {11, 5, 12}
- Node 18: {19, 20, 1}
- Node 19: {18, 29, 27}
- Node 20: {2, 18, 23}
- Node 21: {24, 13, 25}
- Node 22: {6, 29, 1, 8}
- Node 23: {5, 29, 20}
- Node 24: {21, 11}
- Node 25: {21, 1, 6, 15, 7}
- Node 26: {7, 0, 4}
- Node 27: {19, 4}
- Node 28: {10}
- Node 29: {19, 22, 23}

Now, we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 53

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].

- <4, 8, 22>
- <7, 25, 10>
- <7, 25, 5>
