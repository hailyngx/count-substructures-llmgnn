Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 11}
- Node 2: {0, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 8, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {6, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 4, 5, 9, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 4, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 4, 10}

Next, let's identify nodes with at least three neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 4, Node 5, Node 8, Node 9, Node 12, and Node 14 have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = 4
- Node 4 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars = 10
- Node 5 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = 4
- Node 8 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = 4
- Node 9 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = 4
- Node 12 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars = 10
- Node 14 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 12, 14)>, 
<4, (0, 11, 12)>, 
<5, (1, 8, 11)>, 
<8, (0, 5, 9)>, 
<9, (6, 11, 13)>, 
<12, (3, 4, 11)>, 
<14, (0, 10, 4)>
