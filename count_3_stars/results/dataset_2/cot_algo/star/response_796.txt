Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:

1. Node 0: {21, 12}
2. Node 1: {2, 25}
3. Node 2: {7, 22, 1, 27}
4. Node 3: {4, 16, 12}
5. Node 4: {8, 24, 21, 3}
6. Node 5: {13, 12, 17, 27}
7. Node 6: {9}
8. Node 7: {11, 13, 2}
9. Node 8: {4, 28, 10, 15}
10. Node 9: {6, 24, 16}
11. Node 10: {8, 29, 26}
12. Node 11: {28, 23, 7, 15}
13. Node 12: {5, 21, 3}
14. Node 13: {5, 16, 23, 7, 18}
15. Node 14: {29, 22, 18}
16. Node 15: {8, 11}
17. Node 16: {9, 13, 24, 3}
18. Node 17: {5, 26, 24, 27}
19. Node 18: {13, 23, 14}
20. Node 19: {22, 20}
21. Node 20: {19, 27}
22. Node 21: {4, 0, 12}
23. Node 22: {14, 2, 19, 25}
24. Node 23: {11, 13, 18}
25. Node 24: {4, 16, 17}
26. Node 25: {1, 22}
27. Node 26: {10, 17}
28. Node 27: {5, 2, 20, 17}
29. Node 28: {8, 11}
30. Node 29: {14, 10}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

1. Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
2. Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
6. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
7. Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-stars.
8. Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
9. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
10. Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
11. Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
12. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
13. Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
14. Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
15. Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
16. Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
17. Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
18. Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
19. Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
20. Node 19 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
21. Node 20 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
22. Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
23. Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
24. Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
25. Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
26. Node 25 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
27. Node 26 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
28. Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
29. Node 28 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
30. Node 29 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 
4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44].
