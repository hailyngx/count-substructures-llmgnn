Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 3) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 0) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 13) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, we will create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 neighbors: 5, 8, 11, 3, 4
- Node 1 neighbors: 9, 13, 14
- Node 2 neighbors: 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14
- Node 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 8, 9, 14
- Node 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 7
- Node 6 neighbors: 2, 9, 10
- Node 7 neighbors: 3, 5
- Node 8 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 12, 14
- Node 9 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 13
- Node 10 neighbors: 3, 6, 13
- Node 11 neighbors: 0, 2, 12, 14
- Node 12 neighbors: 3, 8, 11
- Node 13 neighbors: 1, 2, 9, 10
- Node 14 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 11

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 8, 13, 14

Calculating \( \binom{3}{3} \) for each node gives us:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)

Adding these up gives us a total of \( 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 35 = 83 \) 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [83], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 4, 14>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 8, 12>
- <0, 8, 14>
- <1, 9, 13>
- <1, 9, 14>
- <2, 6, 10>
- <2, 6, 13>
- <2, 9, 13>
- <2, 11, 12>
- <2, 11, 14>
- <3, 7, 5>
- <3, 7, 14>
- <3, 10, 13>
- <3, 12, 8>
- <3, 12, 11>
- <3, 12, 14>
- <4, 9, 6>
- <4, 9, 13>
- <8, 12, 11>
- <8, 14, 11>
- <13, 10, 3>
