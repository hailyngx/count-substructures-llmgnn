Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 3) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 3) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 12) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 12) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {4, 7, 10, 8, 3}
- Node 1: neighbors {8, 2, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {8, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {7, 2, 0, 6}
- Node 4: neighbors {7, 8, 0, 11, 6}
- Node 5: neighbors {10, 13, 12, 14}
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 11, 3, 13, 12}
- Node 7: neighbors {4, 0, 3, 10}
- Node 8: neighbors {4, 2, 0, 1}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 1}
- Node 10: neighbors {7, 11, 0, 13, 5}
- Node 11: neighbors {4, 10, 14, 6}
- Node 12: neighbors {5, 13, 14, 6}
- Node 13: neighbors {10, 5, 6, 12}
- Node 14: neighbors {11, 5, 12}

Now, let's identify which nodes are part of a 3-star:

- Node 0, 5, 10, and 13 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 28 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [28], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 7, 10>, <0, 4, 7, 8>, <0, 4, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 10, 13>, <0, 7, 3, 6>, <5, 10, 13, 12>
