Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 10) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 10, 12
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 6, 13
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 10, 12, 13
- Node 4: 1, 3, 10, 11, 14
- Node 5: 2, 7, 14
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7, 12
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 9, 10
- Node 9: 7, 8, 12, 13
- Node 10: 1, 3, 4, 8, 11, 14
- Node 11: 4, 10
- Node 12: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 13: 2, 3, 9, 14
- Node 14: 4, 5, 10, 13

Next, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 11

Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{1}{3} = 1 + 10 + 0 = 11 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 14)>, <11, (4, 10, 14)>
