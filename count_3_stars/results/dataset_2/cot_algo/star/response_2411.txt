Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 24) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 7) (2, 29) (2, 15) (29, 2) (29, 1) (29, 0) (29, 23) (6, 13) (28, 4) (28, 18) (21, 19) (21, 22) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 27) (22, 9) (22, 21) (14, 26) (14, 12) (14, 19) (26, 14) (26, 20) (26, 3) (17, 16) (17, 27) (17, 11) (25, 1) (11, 17) (0, 29) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 24) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 12) (1, 18) (27, 8) (27, 17) (27, 24) (27, 18) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 4) (20, 26) (20, 3) (4, 28) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 23) (24, 5) (24, 10) (24, 27) (24, 12) (24, 23) (18, 5) (18, 28) (18, 1) (18, 27) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 24) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 15) (7, 5) (7, 9) (19, 21) (19, 14) (23, 29) (23, 4) (23, 24) (23, 3) (3, 26) (3, 16) (3, 20) (3, 13) (3, 23) (15, 2) (15, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {10, 29}
- Node 1: {25, 12, 18, 29}
- Node 2: {15, 29}
- Node 3: {13, 16, 20, 23, 26}
- Node 4: {13, 16, 23, 28}
- Node 5: {7, 9, 18, 24}
- Node 6: {13}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {10, 12, 27}
- Node 9: {5, 7, 22}
- Node 10: {0, 13, 24, 8}
- Node 11: {17}
- Node 12: {1, 14, 24, 8}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 10, 15, 6}
- Node 14: {19, 12, 26}
- Node 15: {2, 13}
- Node 16: {3, 4, 17}
- Node 17: {11, 16, 27}
- Node 18: {1, 5, 27, 28}
- Node 19: {21, 14}
- Node 20: {3, 26}
- Node 21: {19, 22}
- Node 22: {9, 21}
- Node 23: {3, 4, 24, 29}
- Node 24: {10, 12, 23, 27, 5}
- Node 25: {1}
- Node 26: {3, 14, 20}
- Node 27: {8, 17, 24, 18}
- Node 28: {18, 4}
- Node 29: {0, 2, 23, 1}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 5, Node 9, Node 18, Node 24, and Node 29 have 4 or more neighbors. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <5, 7, 9>
- <9, 5, 22>
- <18, 1, 5>
- <18, 5, 27>
- <24, 5, 10>
- <24, 5, 12>
- <24, 5, 27>
- <24, 12, 27>
- <24, 18, 27>
- <29, 2, 1>
- <29, 2, 0>
- <29, 2, 23>
- <29, 0, 23>
