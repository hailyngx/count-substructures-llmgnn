Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 0) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 3) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 10}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 6, 8, 14}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 6}
- Node 10: {1, 2}
- Node 11: {1, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {1, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 4, 11}
- Node 14: {3, 6, 7, 12}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars: <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 13)>, <4, (1, 13, 3)>, <4, (1, 13, 14)>, <4, (7, 8, 5)>, <4, (7, 8, 14)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 5, 3)>, <4, (7, 5, 14)>, <4, (7, 5, 6)>, <4, (7, 14, 3)>, <4, (7, 6, 9)>, <4, (8, 5, 3)>, <4, (8, 5, 7)>, <4, (8, 5, 14)>, <4, (8, 7, 14)>, <4, (8, 7, 6)>, <4, (5, 3, 13)>, <4, (5, 7, 14)>, <4, (5, 14, 6)>
- Node 6 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 14)>, <6, (0, 7, 14)>, <6, (2, 10, 1)>, <6, (2, 10, 11)>, <6, (2, 10, 1)>, <6, (2, 1, 12)>, <6, (4, 7, 14)>, <6, (7, 14, 3)>
- Node 7 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <7, (4, 6, 14)>, <7, (4, 8, 5)>, <7, (4, 8, 14)>, <7, (4, 5, 3)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (6, 9, 4)>, <7, (6, 14, 3)>, <7, (6, 14, 12)>, <7, (6, 3, 14)>, <7, (8, 5, 14)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 13)>

Adding these up, we get a total of 41 3-stars, so the final answer is [41].
