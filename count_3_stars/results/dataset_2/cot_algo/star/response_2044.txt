Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 19) (15, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (17, 10) (17, 16) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (11, 14) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 18) (8, 15) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 14) (18, 0) (18, 19) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 16) (16, 17) (16, 0) (16, 19) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 14) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 10, 5, 16, 18}
- Node 1: {5, 13, 8}
- Node 2: {7, 6, 11}
- Node 4: {12, 9, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 1, 6, 0}
- Node 6: {10, 5, 2}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {15, 1, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 8, 14}
- Node 10: {17, 0, 6, 12}
- Node 11: {14, 2}
- Node 12: {4, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {11, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 15: {19, 8}
- Node 16: {17, 0, 19}
- Node 17: {10, 16}
- Node 18: {0, 19}
- Node 19: {15, 18, 16}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing these up: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 26 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (7, 10, 5)>, <0, (7, 10, 18)>, <0, (7, 5, 6)>, <0, (10, 5, 16)>, <0, (5, 1, 13)>, <0, (5, 6, 2)>, <5, (4, 1, 6)>, <5, (4, 7, 6)>, <5, (1, 7, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 0)>, <14, (9, 12, 13)>, <16, (17, 0, 19)>, <19, (15, 18, 16)>.
