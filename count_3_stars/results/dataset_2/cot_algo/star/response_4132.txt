Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (0, 3) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 12) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {9, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 5: {1, 8, 10}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 13}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {4, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {3, 8, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 13: {1, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 2}
- Node 14: {3, 8, 11, 13}

Next, we will count the 3-stars that can be formed:

- The nodes that can form 3-stars:
  - Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- The unique 3-stars are:
  - <1, (3, 4, 5)>
  - <1, (3, 4, 12)>
  - <1, (3, 4, 13)>
  - <1, (3, 5, 12)>
  - <1, (3, 5, 13)>
  - <1, (3, 12, 13)>
  - <1, (4, 5, 12)>
  - <1, (4, 5, 13)>
  - <1, (4, 12, 13)>
  - <1, (5, 12, 13)>

Total number of 3-stars = 10, so the final answer is [10].
