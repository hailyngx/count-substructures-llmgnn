Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 10) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 0) (7, 0) (7, 11) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 10) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 12) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: (1, 14, 7, 10)
- Node 1: (3, 2, 13, 4, 9, 0)
- Node 2: (1, 5, 12)
- Node 3: (1, 11, 6, 8)
- Node 4: (1, 8, 10, 14, 6)
- Node 5: (13, 6, 2, 11, 10)
- Node 6: (3, 4, 5, 12)
- Node 7: (0, 11)
- Node 8: (3, 4, 9, 14, 12)
- Node 9: (1, 8, 12, 10)
- Node 10: (13, 4, 5, 0, 9)
- Node 11: (3, 5, 7)
- Node 12: (8, 6, 2, 9)
- Node 13: (1, 5, 10)
- Node 14: (8, 4, 0)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 0: (1, 14, 7, 10) -> [ \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 ] 3-stars
- Node 1: (3, 2, 13, 4, 9, 0) -> [ \( \binom{6}{3} \) = 20 ] 3-stars
- Node 4: (1, 8, 10, 14, 6) -> [ \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10 ] 3-stars
- Node 5: (13, 6, 2, 11, 10) -> [ \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10 ] 3-stars
- Node 8: (3, 4, 9, 14, 12) -> [ \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10 ] 3-stars
- Node 9: (1, 8, 12, 10) -> [ \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 ] 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 58

So, the final answer is [58]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 14, 10)>, <0, (1, 14, 7)>, <0, (1, 14, 0)>, <0, (1, 7, 10)>, <1, (3, 2, 13)>, <1, (3, 2, 4)>, <1, (3, 2, 9)>, <1, (3, 2, 0)>, <1, (3, 13, 4)>, <1, (3, 13, 9)>, <1, (3, 13, 0)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 0)>, <1, (3, 9, 0)>, <1, (2, 13, 4)>, <1, (2, 13, 9)>, <1, (2, 13, 0)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 0)>, <1, (2, 9, 0)>, <1, (13, 4, 9)>, <1, (13, 4, 0)>, <1, (13, 9, 0)>, <1, (4, 9, 0)>, <4, (8, 10, 14)>, <4, (8, 10, 6)>, <4, (8, 10, 5)>, <4, (8, 10, 0)>, <4, (8, 14, 6)>, <4, (8, 14, 5)>, <4, (8, 14, 0)>, <4, (8, 6, 5)>, <4, (8, 6, 0)>, <4, (8, 5, 0)>, <4, (10, 14, 6)>, <4, (10, 14, 5)>, <4, (10, 14, 0)>, <4, (10, 6, 5)>, <4, (10, 6, 0)>, <4, (10, 5, 0)>, <5, (13, 6, 2)>, <5, (13, 6, 11)>, <5, (13, 6, 10)>, <5, (13, 2, 11)>, <5, (13, 2, 10)>, <5, (13, 11, 10)>, <5, (6, 2, 11)>, <5, (6, 2, 10)>, <5, (6, 11, 10)>, <5, (2, 11, 10)>, <8, (4, 9, 14)>, <8, (4, 9, 12)>, <8, (4, 9, 10)>, <8, (4, 14, 12)>, <8, (4, 14, 10)>, <8, (4, 12, 10)>, <8, (9, 14, 12)>, <8, (9, 14, 10)>, <8, (9, 12, 10)>, <8, (14, 12, 10)>, <9, (1, 8, 12)>, <9, (1, 8, 10)>, <9, (1, 12, 10)>.
