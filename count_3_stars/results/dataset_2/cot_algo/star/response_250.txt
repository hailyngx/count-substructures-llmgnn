Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 3}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the inom{n}{3} formula for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the final answer is [48], and the unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, 1, 5, 9>
<0, 3, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 8, 9>
