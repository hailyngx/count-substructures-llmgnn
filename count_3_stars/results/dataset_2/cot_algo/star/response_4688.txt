Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: {6, 8, 2, 5}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 6, 9, 3}
- Node 2: {9, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 3: {4, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 4: {7, 6, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 9, 1, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 9, 1}
- Node 8: {4, 3, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {7, 6, 2, 1}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) where \( n \) is the number of neighbors for that node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: Not eligible (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: Not eligible (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: Not eligible (exactly 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 36

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 8, 6)>, <0, (2, 8, 1)>, <0, (3, 7, 6)>, <0, (3, 7, 1)>.
