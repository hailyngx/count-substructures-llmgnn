Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 4, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1: 6 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed: 
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Finally, sum up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of 50 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as [50].
