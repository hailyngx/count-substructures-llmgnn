Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 23) (1, 9) (21, 19) (21, 15) (14, 4) (14, 5) (17, 24) (17, 12) (3, 19) (3, 8) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 6) (25, 12) (20, 25) (20, 18) (20, 16) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 29) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 29) (12, 17) (12, 25) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 23) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 9) (5, 14) (5, 11) (6, 25) (6, 16) (15, 21) (15, 7) (19, 21) (19, 3) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 29) (26, 0) (4, 14) (4, 27) (4, 9) (7, 1) (7, 25) (7, 15) (7, 24) (18, 20) (18, 28) (18, 29) (16, 20) (16, 13) (16, 6) (16, 28) (16, 22) (28, 18) (28, 16) (2, 27) (2, 11) (9, 1) (9, 27) (9, 4) (9, 10) (22, 16) (22, 10) (22, 0) (29, 8) (29, 13) (29, 26) (29, 18) (29, 10) (0, 26) (0, 22) (0, 24) (24, 17) (24, 7) (24, 0) (10, 9) (10, 22) (10, 29) (23, 1) (23, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {26, 24}
Node 1: {7, 23, 9}
Node 2: {27, 11}
Node 3: {19, 8}
Node 4: {14, 27, 9}
Node 5: {14, 11}
Node 6: {25, 16}
Node 7: {1, 25, 15, 24}
Node 8: {3, 13, 29}
Node 9: {1, 27, 4, 10}
Node 10: {9, 22, 29}
Node 11: {5, 2}
Node 12: {17, 25, 13, 27, 23}
Node 13: {8, 12, 16, 29}
Node 14: {4, 5}
Node 15: {21, 7}
Node 16: {20, 13, 6, 28, 22}
Node 17: {24, 12}
Node 18: {20, 28, 29}
Node 19: {21, 3, 26}
Node 20: {25, 18, 16}
Node 21: {19, 15}
Node 22: {16, 10, 0}
Node 23: {1, 12}
Node 24: {17, 7, 0}
Node 25: {20, 6, 7, 12}
Node 26: {19, 29, 0}
Node 27: {2, 4, 9, 12}
Node 28: {18, 16}
Node 29: {8, 13, 26, 18, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 7: <7, (1, 15, 24)>
- Node 12: <12, (17, 25, 27)>, <12, (13, 23, 25)>, <12, (13, 16, 29)>
- Node 13: <13, (8, 12, 29)>, <13, (16, 29, 18)>
- Node 16: <16, (13, 6, 28)>, <16, (13, 20, 22)>, <16, (29, 18, 22)>
- Node 18: <18, (20, 28, 29)>
- Node 19 <19, (21, 3, 26)>
- Node 25: <25, (20, 7, 12)>
- Node 29: <29, (13, 18, 26)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [11].
