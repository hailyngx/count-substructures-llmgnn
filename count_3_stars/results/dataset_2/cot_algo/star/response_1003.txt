Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 6) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 3) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 1) (10, 0) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (1, 8) (1, 12) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 10) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 9, 10, 11
Node 1: 8, 12
Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 7
Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 9, 11
Node 4: 7, 8, 12, 13, 14
Node 5: 2, 3, 7, 10
Node 6: 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13
Node 7: 2, 4, 5, 6, 13
Node 8: 1, 4, 6, 11, 14
Node 9: 0, 3, 13
Node 10: 0, 5, 6, 12
Node 11: 1, 3, 8
Node 12: 1, 4, 10, 14
Node 13: 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 14: 4, 8, 12

Now, we'll identify nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

Node 0: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 2: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 3: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 4: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 5: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 6: 6 neighbors -> [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
Node 7: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 8: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 10: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 12: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 13: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 74

Therefore, the final answer is [74], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (10, 11, 12)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 11)>, <4, (7, 8, 12)>, <6, (3, 6, 13)>, <7, (2, 4, 13)>, <8, (1, 11, 14)>, <10, (0, 6, 12)>, <12, (1, 4, 14)>, <13, (4, 6, 9)>.
