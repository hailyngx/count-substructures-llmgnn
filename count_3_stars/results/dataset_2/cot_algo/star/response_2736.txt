Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 18) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 16) (17, 9) (17, 5) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 12) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 2) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 16) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 0) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (1, 10) (1, 16) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 9) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (19, 11) (19, 7) (13, 11) (13, 6) (16, 14) (16, 6) (16, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {7, 11, 12, 14}
Node 1: {8, 10, 16}
Node 2: {5, 7}
Node 3: {5, 10, 15}
Node 4: {9}
Node 5: {2, 3, 17}
Node 6: {11, 13, 14, 16}
Node 7: {0, 2, 12, 18, 19}
Node 8: {1, 9, 10, 14}
Node 9: {4, 8, 15, 17}
Node 10: {1, 3, 8}
Node 11: {0, 6, 13, 19}
Node 12: {0, 7, 18}
Node 13: {6, 11}
Node 14: {0, 6, 8, 16}
Node 15: {3, 9, 18}
Node 16: {1, 6, 14}
Node 17: {5, 9}
Node 18: {7, 12, 15}
Node 19: {7, 11}


Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each:

Node 0: has 4 neighbors --> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: has 5 neighbors --> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: has 4 neighbors --> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: has 4 neighbors --> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 10: has 3 neighbors --> 1 3-star
Node 11: has 4 neighbors --> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: has 3 neighbors --> 1 3-star
Node 14: has 4 neighbors --> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 15: has 3 neighbors --> 1 3-star
Node 16: has 3 neighbors --> 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (7, 11, 12)>, <7, (0, 12, 18)>, <8, (1, 10, 16)>, <9, (4, 8, 15)>, <10, (1, 3, 8)>, <11, (0, 6, 13)>, <12, (0, 7, 18)>, <14, (6, 8, 16)>, <15, (3, 9, 18)>, <16, (1, 6, 14)>.
