Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (10, 5) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 8) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 12) (0, 15) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 2) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 16) (13, 4) (13, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 1) (12, 4) (11, 9) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 2) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 3) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 8) (18, 10) (8, 17) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 3) (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated as follows:

1. First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {15}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 12, 17}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 8, 16, 3}
- Node 3: {8, 2, 19}
- Node 4: {12, 13, 19}
- Node 5: {1, 9, 10, 14, 16}
- Node 6: {2, 8, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 10}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 7, 15, 17}
- Node 9: {5, 11, 14}
- Node 10: {5, 7, 17, 18}
- Node 11: {9, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 4}
- Node 13: {4, 6}
- Node 14: {5, 9, 11}
- Node 15: {0, 8, 16, 19}
- Node 16: {2, 5, 15}
- Node 17: {1, 8, 10}
- Node 18: {10}
- Node 19: {3, 4, 15}

2. Now, let's check which nodes can form 3-stars:
- Node 1, Node 5, Node 14, Node 15, and Node 17 have 5 or more neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars.

3. Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 15 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

4. Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 5, 7, (10, 17)>
- <1, 5, 12, (4, 19)>
- <1, 5, 17, (8, 2)>
- <1, 7, 2, (6, 8)>
- <1, 7, 10, (5, 17)>
- <1, 7, 17, (8, 2)>
- <5, 9, 11, 14>
- <5, 9, 14, 11>
- <5, 10, 17, 1>
- <5, 14, 9, 11>
- <5, 14, 11, 9>
- <15, 0, 8, (19, 3)>
- <15, 8, 3, (2, 16)>
- <15, 8, 6, (2, 7)>
- <15, 8, 17, (1, 5)>
- <15, 16, 2, (7, 10)>
- <17, 1, 8, (15, 0)>
- <17, 8, 3, (2, 16)>
- <17, 8, 6, (2, 7)>
- <17, 8, 15, (0, 1)>
- <15, 3, 19, (4, 12)>
