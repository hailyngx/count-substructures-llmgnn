Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 1) (29, 27) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 22) (17, 18) (10, 2) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 7) (11, 26) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 28) (21, 8) (1, 29) (1, 6) (1, 27) (3, 24) (3, 23) (3, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 27) (4, 26) (8, 21) (8, 4) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 22) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 22) (9, 16) (22, 17) (22, 0) (22, 9) (13, 12) (13, 15) (26, 11) (26, 4) (27, 29) (27, 1) (27, 4) (15, 13) (15, 25) (15, 28) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 15) (23, 3) (23, 25) (23, 20) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 12) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 25) (16, 9) (16, 25) (19, 2) (19, 10) (5, 3) (5, 24) (5, 20) (24, 3) (24, 5) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 8) (20, 23) (20, 5) (25, 15) (25, 23) (25, 12) (25, 16) 

Response:
Based on the provided edges, we can determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {14, 22}
- Node 1: {6, 27, 29}
- Node 2: {4, 10, 19, 29}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 23, 24}
- Node 4: {2, 8, 26, 27}
- Node 5: {3, 20, 23, 24}
- Node 6: {1, 12, 17}
- Node 7: {10, 11, 28}
- Node 8: {4, 18, 21}
- Node 9: {3, 16, 17, 22}
- Node 10: {2, 11, 19, 7}
- Node 11: {7, 10, 26, 28}
- Node 12: {6, 13, 25}
- Node 13: {12, 15}
- Node 14: {0, 17, 18}
- Node 15: {13, 25, 28}
- Node 16: {9, 25}
- Node 17: {14, 16, 18, 22}
- Node 18: {8, 14, 17}
- Node 19: {2, 10}
- Node 20: {5, 23}
- Node 21: {8}
- Node 22: {0, 9, 17}
- Node 23: {3, 5, 20, 25}
- Node 24: {3, 5}
- Node 25: {12, 15, 16, 23}
- Node 26: {4, 11}
- Node 27: {1, 4, 29}
- Node 28: {7, 11, 15}
- Node 29: {1, 2, 27}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars. Nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 22, 23, 25, and 27.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 2, 19, 22, 24, 27 (5 in total, each forms 1 unique star, so 5*1 = 5 stars)
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 8, 16, 20, 23, 26, 29 (6 in total, each forms 4 unique stars, so 6*4 = 24 stars)
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 28 (9 in total, each forms 10 unique stars, so 9*10 = 90 stars)
- Node with 6 neighbors: 5 (1 in total, forms 20 unique stars)
- Node with 7 neighbors: 15 (1 in total, forms 35 unique stars)

Adding these up, we have a total of 5 + 24 + 90 + 20 + 35 = 174 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [174]. 

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<2, 4, 19, 29>, <3, 5, 9, 23>, <3, 5, 24, 25>, <3, 9, 16, 25>, <3, 9, 22, 25>, <4, 8, 18, 27>, <6, 12, 17, 28>, <7, 10, 11, 28>, <10, 11, 26, 28>, <17, 18, 22, 25>.
