Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 11) (18, 20) (18, 16) (22, 18) (22, 19) (22, 0) (22, 17) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 11) (0, 22) (0, 14) (0, 23) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (21, 28) (21, 27) (21, 25) (21, 15) (28, 21) (28, 11) (28, 27) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 28) (1, 15) (1, 20) (1, 10) (1, 9) (15, 21) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 13) (15, 12) (3, 20) (17, 22) (17, 5) (25, 21) (25, 10) (25, 2) (19, 22) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 9) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 29) (7, 2) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 23) (16, 18) (16, 29) (24, 8) (24, 12) (24, 13) (20, 18) (20, 1) (20, 3) (20, 12) (2, 25) (2, 19) (2, 7) (23, 0) (23, 15) (23, 29) (6, 14) (12, 15) (12, 24) (12, 20) (27, 21) (27, 28) (13, 0) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 24) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 25) (10, 19) (9, 1) (9, 19) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {22, 14, 23, 13}
- Node 1: {15, 20, 10, 9}
- Node 2: {25, 19, 7}
- Node 3: {20}
- Node 4: {8, 10, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 17, 7}
- Node 6: {14}
- Node 7: {5, 2, 29}
- Node 8: {4, 24, 11}
- Node 9: {1, 19}
- Node 10: {4, 1, 25, 19}
- Node 11: {18, 8, 28}
- Node 12: {15, 24, 20}
- Node 13: {0, 15, 19, 24}
- Node 14: {0, 6}
- Node 15: {1, 21, 23, 13, 12}
- Node 16: {18, 29}
- Node 17: {22, 5}
- Node 18: {22, 11, 20, 16}
- Node 19: {22, 2, 10, 13, 9}
- Node 20: {18, 1, 3, 12}
- Node 21: {28, 27, 25, 15}
- Node 22: {18, 19, 0, 17}
- Node 23: {0, 15, 29}
- Node 24: {8, 12, 13}
- Node 25: {21, 10, 2}
- Node 27: {21, 28}
- Node 28: {21, 11, 27}
- Node 29: {7, 16, 23}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph by counting the number of combinations each node can form:
- Nodes 0, 11, 18, 15, 19, and 21 can each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 8, 10, 13, and 24 can each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 1 and 20 can each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 2, 5, 7, and 12 can each form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Nodes 9 and 16 can each form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 3, 4, 6, 14, 17, 22, 23, 25, 27, and 29 do not have enough neighbors to form 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get: \(10+10+10+4+4+4+4+1+1+1+1 = 45\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [45].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph include:
- <0, 22, 14, 23>
- <11, 18, 8, 28>
- <15, 21, 1, 20>
- <19, 22, 10, 13>
- <22, 18, 0, 17>
- <10, 19, 1, 25>
- <2, 25, 21, 10>
- <5, 4, 8, 10>
- <7, 5, 17, 2>
- <12, 15, 24, 13>
- <16, 18, 29>
- <20, 18, 1, 3>
