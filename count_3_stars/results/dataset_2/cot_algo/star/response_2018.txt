Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 27) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 7) (3, 25) (3, 9) (3, 5) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 8) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 21) (2, 11) (29, 2) (0, 26) (0, 13) (20, 7) (20, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (26, 0) (24, 16) (24, 18) (24, 19) (28, 22) (28, 27) (27, 14) (27, 25) (27, 28) (27, 18) (27, 9) (10, 14) (10, 20) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 21) (16, 17) (16, 24) (15, 19) (15, 4) (19, 24) (19, 15) (19, 13) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 23) (5, 4) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 4) (23, 5) (23, 21) (6, 14) (6, 22) (7, 17) (7, 20) (7, 1) (9, 3) (9, 27) (18, 24) (18, 27) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 19) (8, 25) (8, 11) (8, 21) (8, 22) (22, 28) (22, 6) (22, 8) (21, 2) (21, 12) (21, 23) (21, 8) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 5) (4, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {26, 13}
Node 1: {11, 7, 12}
Node 2: {29, 5, 13, 21, 11}
Node 3: {25, 9, 5}
Node 4: {17, 15, 5, 11}
Node 5: {3, 2, 12, 23, 4}
Node 6: {14, 22}
Node 7: {17, 20, 1}
Node 8: {25, 11, 21, 22}
Node 9: {3, 27}
Node 10: {14, 20}
Node 11: {17, 2, 1, 8, 4}
Node 12: {1, 5, 21}
Node 13: {2, 0, 19}
Node 14: {17, 6, 27, 10}
Node 15: {19, 4}
Node 16: {17, 24}
Node 17: {14, 16, 11, 4, 7}
Node 18: {24, 27}
Node 19: {24, 15, 13}
Node 20: {7, 10}
Node 21: {2, 12, 23, 8}
Node 22: {28, 6, 8}
Node 23: {5, 21}
Node 24: {16, 18, 19}
Node 25: {3, 27, 8}
Node 26: {0}
Node 27: {14, 25, 28, 18, 9}
Node 28: {22, 27}
Node 29: {2}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: None 
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 8, 13, 19 
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 11, 17, 21 
Nodes with 6 neighbors: 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 stars: 2, 5, 8, 13, 19, 11, 17, 21 

Finally, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \binom{2}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{13}{3} + \binom{19}{3} + \binom{11}{3} + \binom{17}{3} + \binom{21}{3} = 1 + 10 + 56 + 286 + 969 + 165 + 680 + 1330 = 3437 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3437].
