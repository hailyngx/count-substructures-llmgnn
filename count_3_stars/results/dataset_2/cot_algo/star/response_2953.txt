Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 77. 

Therefore, the final answer is [77].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <1, 2, 3>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <3, 4, 9>
