Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 18) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 19) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 7) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 10) (16, 5) (16, 0) (7, 17) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 8) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (12, 13) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 19) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 2) (14, 5) (14, 8) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 19) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 14) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 10, 16}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 10}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 10, 17, 19}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 18, 19}
- Node 5: Neighbors {14, 16}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 8, 11, 15}
- Node 7: Neighbors {8, 17}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 7, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 13}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 19}
- Node 11: Neighbors {6, 13, 18, 19}
- Node 12: Neighbor {13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {9, 11, 12, 17, 19}
- Node 14: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 15: Neighbors {6, 17, 18}
- Node 16: Neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 17: Neighbors {2, 7, 13, 15}
- Node 18: Neighbors {3, 11, 15}
- Node 19: Neighbors {1, 3, 10, 11, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 6, 10)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 19, 18)>
- Node 6 forms 2 3-stars: <6, (1, 8, 11)>, <6, (8, 15, 17)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (6, 14, 7)>
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star: <10, (1, 2, 19)>
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star: <11, (6, 13, 18)>
- Node 13 forms 2 3-stars: <13, (9, 11, 19)>, <13, (11, 17, 19)>
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star: <15, (6, 17, 18)>
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star: <17, (2, 13, 15)>
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star: <18, (3, 15, 11)>
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star: <19, (1, 13, 10)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 12, so the answer is [12].
