Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 2) (7, 19) (7, 14) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 8) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 15) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 17) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 18) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 18) (15, 14) (15, 9) (8, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 8) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 19) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 6) (6, 19) (6, 17) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 6) (17, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 16) (16, 4) 

Response:
First, we will create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 12, 14, 18}
- Node 1: {3, 4}
- Node 2: {0, 3}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 17}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 13, 16, 17}
- Node 5: {4, 8, 11, 17}
- Node 6: {17, 19}
- Node 7: {14, 19}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 12}
- Node 9: {8, 11, 15}
- Node 10: {12, 13, 18}
- Node 11: {5, 9, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {4, 10, 18}
- Node 14: {0, 7, 15}
- Node 15: {9, 14}
- Node 16: {4}
- Node 17: {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 18: {0, 10, 13, 19}
- Node 19: {6, 7, 18}

Next, calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( C(4,3) = 4 \)
- Node 4: only 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star
- Node 5: \( C(4,3) = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( C(3,3) = 1 \)
- Node 9: only 2 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 10: \( C(3,3) = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( C(4,3) = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( C(3,3) = 1 \)
- Node 14: only 2 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 17: \( C(4,3) = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( C(4,3) = 4 \)
- Node 19: only 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4
The total number of 3-stars is 20, so the answer is [20].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 12, 18)>
- <0, (2, 14, 18)>
- <0, (12, 8, 14)>
- <0, (12, 10, 18)>
- <4, (1, 5, 17)>
- <4, (1, 13, 17)>
- <4, (5, 8, 17)>
- <4, (5, 11, 17)>
- <12, (8, 10, 11)>
- <17, (3, 5, 6)>
- <18, (0, 10, 13)>
- <18, (0, 13, 19)>
- <18, (10, 13, 19)>
- <18, (13, 19, 6)>
