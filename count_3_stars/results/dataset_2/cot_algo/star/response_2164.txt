Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 16) (5, 6) (5, 26) (5, 8) (17, 12) (29, 19) (29, 22) (29, 12) (29, 24) (21, 28) (21, 0) (21, 19) (21, 8) (21, 22) (28, 21) (28, 27) (28, 25) (13, 0) (26, 5) (26, 16) (26, 4) (15, 22) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 16) (25, 28) (25, 27) (25, 23) (25, 0) (27, 28) (27, 25) (27, 24) (27, 18) (16, 3) (16, 26) (16, 8) (0, 21) (0, 13) (0, 25) (0, 18) (10, 3) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 22) (11, 20) (14, 11) (14, 24) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 27) (18, 0) (2, 23) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 29) (12, 19) (20, 11) (20, 23) (4, 26) (4, 2) (19, 9) (19, 29) (19, 21) (19, 12) (24, 29) (24, 27) (24, 14) (24, 22) (22, 29) (22, 21) (22, 15) (22, 11) (22, 24) (23, 25) (23, 2) (23, 20) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 13, 21, 25
Node 1: 3, 11, 12, 18
Node 2: 4, 23
Node 3: 1, 10, 16
Node 4: 2, 26
Node 5: 6, 8, 26
Node 6: 5, 9
Node 8: 5, 9, 16, 21
Node 9: 6, 8, 18, 19
Node 10: 3
Node 11: 1, 14, 20, 22
Node 12: 1, 17, 19, 29
Node 13: 0
Node 14: 11, 24
Node 15: 22
Node 16: 3, 8, 26
Node 17: 12
Node 18: 1, 9, 27, 0
Node 19: 9, 12, 21, 29
Node 20: 11, 23
Node 21: 8, 19, 22, 28, 0
Node 22: 11, 15, 21, 24, 29
Node 23: 2, 20, 25
Node 24: 14, 22, 27, 29
Node 25: 0, 23, 27, 28
Node 26: 4, 5, 16
Node 27: 18, 24, 25, 28
Node 28: 21, 25, 27
Node 29: 12, 19, 22, 24

Now, let's look at nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 26
Therefore, the final answer is [26].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, 3, 11>
<8, 5, 26>
<9, 6, 5>
<12, 1, 17>
<21, 8, 28>
<22, 11, 20>
<24, 14, 27>
<27, 18, 21>
<21, 19, 29>
<22, 15, 11>
