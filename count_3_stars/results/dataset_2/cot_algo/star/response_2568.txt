Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {6, 7, 1, 3}
Node 1: {5, 9, 8, 0}
Node 2: {5, 6, 8, 3}
Node 3: {6, 4, 2, 0, 7}
Node 4: {9, 3}
Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 1}
Node 6: {5, 9, 3, 2, 0}
Node 7: {9, 8, 0, 3}
Node 8: {2, 1, 7}
Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 1, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. 
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars. 
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars. 
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 50. Therefore, the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 6, 2, 5>
<0, 6, 2, 9>
<0, 7, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 9, 2>
<1, 5, 9, 6>
<1, 8, 2, 7>
<1, 8, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 6, 5>
<3, 7, 6, 9>
