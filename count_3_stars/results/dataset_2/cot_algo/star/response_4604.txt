Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 8) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9, 7, 13
- Node 1: 11, 13, 12
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 5, 11, 7, 14
- Node 4: 11, 8, 13
- Node 5: 9, 11, 0, 3, 14
- Node 6: 14, 7, 2, 8
- Node 7: 6, 3, 0, 2
- Node 8: 6, 4, 14, 12
- Node 9: 5, 14, 10, 13, 0
- Node 10: 9, 11, 12, 13
- Node 11: 5, 1, 3, 10, 4
- Node 12: 1, 10, 8
- Node 13: 9, 1, 10, 4, 0
- Node 14: 5, 9, 6, 3, 8

Now, let's check how many 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors => Only 1 3-star can be formed
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors => Only 1 3-star can be formed
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 72

Therefore, the final answer is [72].

Unique 3-stars found:
