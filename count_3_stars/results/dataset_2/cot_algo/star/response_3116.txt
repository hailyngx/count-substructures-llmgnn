Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 19) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 7) (17, 6) (17, 9) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 18) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 13) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 2) (2, 19) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 15) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 16) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 5) (16, 6) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 16) (6, 15) (9, 17) (9, 0) (15, 12) (15, 6) (15, 13) (5, 16) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 15) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 7, 18, 19, 9
Node 1: 3, 4
Node 2: 19
Node 3: 1, 4, 8
Node 4: 1, 3, 19
Node 5: 16
Node 6: 15, 16, 17, 7, 18
Node 7: 0, 6, 8, 18
Node 8: 3, 7, 14
Node 9: 0, 17
Node 10: 12, 13, 16
Node 11: 14
Node 12: 10, 15, 16
Node 13: 10, 15, 18
Node 14: 8, 11, 16
Node 15: 6, 12, 13
Node 16: 6, 10, 12, 14, 5
Node 17: 6, 9
Node 18: 0, 6, 7, 13, 19
Node 19: 0, 4, 18, 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Node 18: <18, (0, 7, 19)>, <18, (6, 13, 19)>
Node 6: <6, (7, 16, 18)>, <6, (15, 16, 6)>
Node 16: <16, (10, 12, 14)>, <16, (5, 6, 16)>
Node 0: <0, (7, 18, 19)> 

It seems that only these nodes have enough neighbors to form 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
