Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 1) (0, 3) (0, 11) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 14) (2, 12) (2, 5) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 10) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we first need to find the neighbors of each node:

1. Node 0: {3, 11}
2. Node 1: {6, 7, 8, 9, 14}
3. Node 2: {5, 12}
4. Node 3: {0, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14}
5. Node 4: {7, 10, 12}
6. Node 5: {2, 10, 11, 13}
7. Node 6: {1, 3, 11, 13}
8. Node 7: {1, 4, 12}
9. Node 8: {1, 3, 9, 13, 14}
10. Node 9: {1, 8, 10}
11. Node 10: {4, 5, 9, 12, 14}
12. Node 11: {0, 3, 5, 6, 14}
13. Node 13: {5, 6, 8}
14. Node 14: {1, 3, 8, 10, 11}

Now, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1, Node 3, Node 8, Node 10, and Node 14 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 5, Node 6, and Node 13 have 4 neighbors each.

For nodes with 5 neighbors, each forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Thus, 5 nodes can form a total of 50 3-stars.

For nodes with 4 neighbors, each forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Thus, 3 nodes can form a total of 12 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 50 + 12 = 62.

So, the final answer is [62], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (6, 8, 14)>, <3, (1, 8, 14)>, <5, (2, 10, 11)>, <6, (1, 8, 11)>, <13, (6, 8, 14)>.
