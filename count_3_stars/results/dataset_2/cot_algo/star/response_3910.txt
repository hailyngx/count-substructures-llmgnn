Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 8) (27, 0) (27, 18) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (21, 0) (21, 7) (21, 15) (22, 23) (22, 24) (22, 1) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 1) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 6) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 26) (3, 22) (3, 10) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 2) (18, 27) (18, 26) (18, 12) (26, 17) (26, 18) (26, 25) (26, 16) (20, 12) (20, 2) (29, 9) (29, 13) (9, 7) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 24) (9, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 24) (28, 8) (15, 21) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 4) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 24) (19, 12) (25, 26) (25, 9) (25, 6) (24, 22) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 19) (14, 8) (14, 19) (12, 18) (12, 20) (12, 19) (6, 10) (6, 25) (1, 22) (1, 23) (1, 5) (1, 16) (16, 26) (16, 1) (16, 4) (4, 15) (4, 16) (13, 29) (13, 9) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 20) 

Response:
Since there are 30 nodes in the graph, we will first list the neighborhood sets for each node:

- Node 0: {27, 21, 8}
- Node 1: {22, 23, 5}
- Node 2: {17, 11, 20}
- Node 3: {22, 10, 11}
- Node 4: {15, 16}
- Node 5: {8, 1}
- Node 6: {10, 25}
- Node 7: {21, 11, 10, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 28, 14, 24}
- Node 9: {7, 29, 25, 24, 13}
- Node 10: {7, 3, 6}
- Node 11: {7, 3, 2}
- Node 12: {18, 20, 19}
- Node 13: {29, 9}
- Node 14: {8, 19}
- Node 15: {21, 17, 19, 4}
- Node 16: {26, 1, 4}
- Node 17: {2, 15, 26}
- Node 18: {27, 26, 12}
- Node 19: {15, 14, 24, 12}
- Node 20: {22, 2, 12}
- Node 21: {0, 7, 15}
- Node 22: {23, 24, 1, 3}
- Node 23: {22, 1}
- Node 24: {22, 9, 8, 19}
- Node 25: {26, 6, 9}
- Node 26: {17, 18, 25, 16}
- Node 27: {0, 18}
- Node 28: {8}
- Node 29: {7, 9, 13}

Next, we identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 8: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 15: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 19: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 24: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 26: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the final answer is [36], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<8, (0, 5, 28)>, <8, (0, 5, 14)>, <8, (0, 5, 24)>, <8, (0, 28, 14)>, <8, (0, 28, 24)>, <8, (0, 14, 24)>, <8, (5, 28, 14)>, <8, (5, 28, 24)>, <8, (5, 14, 24)>, <8, (28, 14, 24)>, <9, (7, 29, 25)>, <9, (7, 29, 24)>, <9, (7, 29, 13)>, <9, (7, 25, 13)>, <9, (29, 25, 13)>, <15, (17, 19, 12)>, <15, (17, 19, 24)>, <15, (17, 12, 24)>, <15, (19, 12, 24)>, <19, (14, 24, 12)>, <24, (9, 8, 19)>, <24, (9, 8, 12)>, <24, (9, 8, 14)>, <24, (9, 19, 12)>, <24, (9, 19, 14)>, <24, (9, 12, 14)>, <24, (8, 19, 12)>, <24, (8, 19, 14)>, <24, (8, 12, 14)>, <24, (19, 12, 14)>, <26, (17, 18, 25)>, <26, (17, 18, 16)>, <26, (17, 25, 16)>, <26, (18, 25, 16)>, <26, (18, 25, 6)>, <26, (25, 16, 6)>
