Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. To find the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph, we need to analyze the neighbor sets of each node.

After examining the neighbor sets, we find that the nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-star subgraphs they are a part of using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where n is the number of neighbors for that node.

Calculating the number of 3-star subgraphs for each node:
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star subgraphs.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star subgraphs.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star subgraph.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star subgraphs.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star subgraph.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star subgraphs.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star subgraphs.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star subgraphs.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star subgraphs.
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star subgraphs.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star subgraph.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star subgraphs.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star subgraphs.

Summing up all the 3-star subgraphs we found, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is:
\[ 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 45 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45].

Unique 3-stars found are: 
<8, (2, 9, 23)>, <9, (8, 24, 21)>, <12, (1, 4, 3)>, <13, (4, 23, 28)>, <14, (10, 15, 28)>, <16, (3, 10, 29)>, <20, (8, 9, 25)>, <21, (9, 11, 29)>, <23, (8, 13, 28)>, <24, (4, 7, 17)>, <25, (11, 18, 20)>, <28, (13, 14, 19)>, <29, (16, 21, 6)>
