Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 28) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 14) (9, 23) (20, 26) (20, 6) (20, 28) (25, 6) (25, 29) (25, 4) (25, 21) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 19) (28, 5) (28, 20) (28, 29) (28, 12) (28, 27) (29, 9) (29, 25) (29, 28) (29, 8) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 27) (26, 20) (26, 19) (26, 3) (26, 0) (22, 7) (1, 15) (1, 16) (15, 1) (15, 4) (15, 21) (10, 2) (10, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 23) (13, 7) (17, 13) (17, 4) (17, 7) (0, 26) (6, 20) (6, 25) (6, 2) (6, 24) (6, 4) (24, 6) (24, 23) (11, 23) (23, 9) (23, 13) (23, 24) (23, 11) (8, 29) (8, 3) (8, 27) (21, 25) (21, 15) (21, 14) (27, 28) (27, 19) (27, 8) (16, 1) (16, 10) (12, 28) (3, 26) (3, 13) (3, 8) (7, 22) (7, 13) (7, 17) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 21) (4, 25) (4, 2) (4, 15) (4, 17) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor (26)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (15, 16, 2)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (18, 6, 10, 14, 4)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (26, 13, 8, 23)
- Node 4: 6 neighbors (25, 15, 17, 6, 2, 21)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (9, 28)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (20, 25, 2, 24, 4)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (22, 13, 17)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (29, 3, 27)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (5, 29, 14, 23)
- Node 10: 2 neighbors (2, 16)
- Node 11: 1 neighbor (23)
- Node 12: 1 neighbor (28)
- Node 13: 4 neighbors (17, 3, 23, 7)
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (9, 2, 21)
- Node 15: 3 neighbors (1, 21, 4)
- Node 16: 2 neighbors (1, 10)
- Node 17: 3 neighbors (13, 4, 7)
- Node 18: 2 neighbors (2, 19)
- Node 19: 3 neighbors (18, 26, 27)
- Node 20: 4 neighbors (26, 6, 28, 25)
- Node 21: 3 neighbors (25, 15, 14)
- Node 22: 1 neighbor (7)
- Node 23: 5 neighbors (9, 13, 24, 11, 3)
- Node 24: 2 neighbors (6, 23)
- Node 25: 5 neighbors (6, 29, 4, 21, 20)
- Node 26: 4 neighbors (20, 19, 3, 0)
- Node 27: 3 neighbors (28, 19, 8)
- Node 28: 5 neighbors (5, 20, 29, 12, 27)
- Node 29: 4 neighbors (9, 25, 28, 8)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2, Node 4, Node 6, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 17, Node 19, Node 21, Node 25, and Node 28 each have 5 or more neighbors, so we'll check for 3-stars among their neighbors.
- Total number of 3-stars is [9].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <2, (18, 4, 6)>
- <4, (25, 15, 17)>
- <6, (20, 2, 25)>
- <13, (17, 3, 23)>
- <14, (21, 2, 9)>
- <15, (1, 4, 21)>
- <17, (13, 4, 7)>
- <19, (18, 26, 27)>
- <21, (15, 25, 14)>
