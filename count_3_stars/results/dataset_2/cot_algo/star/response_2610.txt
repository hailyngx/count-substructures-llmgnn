Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 4) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 13) (13, 7) (13, 4) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are: 5, 9, 1, 3, 10, 11, 0, 2, 7, 8, 6, 12. 

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are involved in.

Starting with node 5:
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 9, 2, 12, 10, 14
Number of 3-stars involving node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Unique 3-stars involving node 5: 
<5, (9, 2, 12)> <5, (9, 2, 10)> <5, (9, 2, 14)> <5, (9, 12, 10)> <5, (9, 12, 14)>
<5, (9, 10, 14)> <5, (2, 12, 10)> <5, (2, 12, 14)> <5, (2, 10, 14)> <5, (12, 10, 14)>

Moving on to node 9:
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 11, 11, 14
Number of 3-stars involving node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars involving node 9:
<9, (5, 11, 14)> <9, (11, 5, 14)> <9, (11, 5, 11)> <9, (5, 11, 5)>

...

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 35

Thus, the final total number of 3-stars is [35].
