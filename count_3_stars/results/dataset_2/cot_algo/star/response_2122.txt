Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 20) (22, 13) (22, 10) (22, 3) (1, 23) (3, 22) (3, 12) (8, 15) (8, 25) (8, 7) (23, 1) (23, 4) (23, 9) (6, 28) (6, 19) (28, 6) (28, 11) (28, 10) (0, 17) (0, 18) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 21) (11, 28) (11, 9) (11, 12) (17, 0) (17, 20) (17, 26) (20, 13) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 19) (7, 8) (7, 18) (25, 13) (25, 8) (25, 26) (19, 6) (19, 20) (19, 18) (19, 4) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 12) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 26) (26, 17) (26, 20) (26, 25) (26, 10) (26, 27) (9, 23) (9, 11) (9, 27) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 24) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 21) (16, 2) (24, 2) (27, 26) (27, 9) (27, 29) (27, 21) (29, 27) (29, 15) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 29) (4, 23) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 21) (21, 14) (21, 5) (21, 27) (21, 4) (21, 12) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 21) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {17, 18}
- Node 1: {23}
- Node 2: {5, 16, 24}
- Node 3: {12, 22}
- Node 4: {14, 19, 21, 23}
- Node 5: {2, 14, 21}
- Node 6: {10, 19, 28}
- Node 7: {8, 18}
- Node 8: {7, 15, 25}
- Node 9: {11, 23, 27}
- Node 10: {22, 26, 28}
- Node 11: {9, 12, 28}
- Node 12: {3, 18, 21}
- Node 13: {20, 22, 25}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 15, 21}
- Node 15: {8, 14, 29}
- Node 16: {2}
- Node 17: {0, 20, 26}
- Node 18: {0, 7, 12, 19}
- Node 19: {4, 6, 18, 20}
- Node 20: {13, 17, 19, 26}
- Node 21: {4, 5, 12, 14, 27}
- Node 22: {3, 10, 13}
- Node 23: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 24: {2}
- Node 25: {8, 13, 26}
- Node 26: {10, 17, 20, 25, 27}
- Node 27: {9, 21, 26, 29}
- Node 28: {6, 10, 11}
- Node 29: {15, 27}

Next, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 4, 5, 12, 14, 18, 19, 21, 26, and 27 have 4 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- Node 4 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 12 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 14 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 18 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 19 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 21 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 26 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 27 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 41. 

Therefore, the answer is [41].

Unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (14, 19, 23)>
- <5, (14, 21, 27)>
- <12, (18, 21, 27)>
- <14, (4, 15, 21)>
- <18, (0, 12, 19)>
- <19, (4, 6, 20)>
- <21, (4, 5, 12)>
- <21, (4, 12, 27)>
- <21, (5, 12, 27)>
- <21, (12, 14, 27)>
- <26, (10, 20, 27)>
- <26, (17, 20, 25)>
- <26, (20, 25, 27)>
- <26, (20, 26, 27)>
- <26, (25, 27, 29)>
- <27, (9, 21, 26)>
