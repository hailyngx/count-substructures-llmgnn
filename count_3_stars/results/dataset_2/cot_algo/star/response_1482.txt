Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 15) (0, 29) (27, 4) (27, 18) (27, 2) (7, 21) (7, 19) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 9) (18, 27) (18, 9) (18, 20) (22, 19) (22, 6) (22, 3) (1, 26) (1, 29) (1, 5) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 17) (2, 27) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 17) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 23) (24, 26) (24, 3) (24, 12) (24, 13) (4, 27) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 3) (10, 8) (10, 13) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 14) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 23) (19, 7) (19, 22) (19, 15) (19, 5) (9, 21) (9, 18) (9, 8) (9, 20) (6, 21) (6, 22) (6, 29) (6, 23) (17, 26) (17, 8) (17, 16) (29, 0) (29, 1) (29, 6) (23, 28) (23, 5) (23, 6) (23, 25) (23, 12) (3, 22) (3, 24) (3, 4) (14, 2) (14, 15) (14, 20) (16, 4) (16, 17) (20, 18) (20, 9) (20, 14) (12, 28) (12, 24) (12, 23) (13, 24) (13, 10) (25, 23) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {15, 29}
- Node 1: {26, 29, 5}
- Node 2: {27, 8, 14, 4}
- Node 3: {22, 24, 4}
- Node 4: {27, 2, 16, 3}
- Node 5: {1, 19, 23}
- Node 6: {21, 22, 29, 23}
- Node 7: {21, 19}
- Node 8: {2, 9, 10, 17}
- Node 9: {21, 18, 8, 20}
- Node 10: {8, 13}
- Node 11: {28}
- Node 12: {28, 24, 23}
- Node 13: {24, 10}
- Node 14: {2, 15, 20}
- Node 15: {0, 19, 14}
- Node 16: {4, 17}
- Node 17: {26, 8, 16}
- Node 18: {27, 9, 20}
- Node 19: {7, 22, 15, 5}
- Node 20: {18, 9, 14}
- Node 21: {7, 6, 9}
- Node 22: {21, 6, 3}
- Node 23: {28, 5, 6, 25, 12}
- Node 24: {26, 3, 12, 13}
- Node 25: {23}
- Node 26: {1, 24, 17}
- Node 27: {4, 18, 2}
- Node 28: {11, 23, 12}
- Node 29: {0, 1, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Nodes that can form 1 3-star: 0, 25
- Nodes that can form 4 3-stars: 11, 13, 22, 28
- Nodes that can form 5 3-stars: 5, 6, 12, 15, 16, 20, 26
- Nodes that can form 6 3-stars: 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 18, 24, 27
- Nodes that can form 0 3-stars: 2, 4, 8, 9, 19, 21, 23, 29

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 1 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 16 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [16].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 15, 19>
- <5, 1, 19>
- <6, 22, 23>
- <12, 23, 28>
- <15, 0, 19>
- <16, 4, 17>
- <20, 9, 18>
- <26, 1, 29>
