Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 (Degree: 5)
Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 8 (Degree: 4)
Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8, 9 (Degree: 6)
Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 7 (Degree: 4)
Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 6 (Degree: 4)
Node 5: 2, 9 (Degree: 2)
Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 (Degree: 6)
Node 7: 0, 3 (Degree: 2)
Node 8: 1, 2, 6 (Degree: 3)
Node 9: 0, 2, 5, 6 (Degree: 4)

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 2, and Node 6 has 6 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 20 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
