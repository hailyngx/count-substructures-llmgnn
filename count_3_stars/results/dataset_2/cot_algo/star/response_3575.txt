Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 15) (1, 16) (1, 12) (3, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 7) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 15) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 9) (7, 13) (7, 0) (17, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 15) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 19) (19, 0) (19, 4) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 15) (18, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 18) (9, 0) (9, 17) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 15) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 8, 7, 12, 19
- Node 1: 16, 12
- Node 2: 16, 3, 15
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 11, 16, 5, 19
- Node 5: 11, 6, 4
- Node 6: 5, 14, 10, 15
- Node 7: 13, 0
- Node 8: 14, 10, 0
- Node 9: 17, 0
- Node 10: 8, 6, 18
- Node 11: 16, 14, 5, 4
- Node 12: 1, 13, 0, 15
- Node 13: 12, 7
- Node 14: 11, 8, 6, 15
- Node 15: 16, 6, 14, 12, 2
- Node 16: 11, 1, 2, 15, 4
- Node 17: 9
- Node 18: 10
- Node 19: 0, 4

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16

For these nodes, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they form. Since each 3-star involves the central node and 3 of its neighbors, we need to calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each central node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 46 \) 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars identified are:
- <0, (8, 7, 12)>
- <0, (8, 7, 19)>
- <0, (8, 12, 19)>
- <0, (7, 12, 19)>
- <4, (11, 5, 19)>
- <4, (11, 16, 5)>
- <4, (11, 16, 19)>
- <4, (5, 6, 14)>
- <5, (11, 6, 4)>
- <6, (5, 14, 15)>
- <10, (6, 18, 15)>
- <11, (14, 5, 16)>
- <12, (1, 13, 15)>
- <14, (8, 15, 6)>
- <15, (2, 6, 16)>
- <16, (15, 2, 6)>
