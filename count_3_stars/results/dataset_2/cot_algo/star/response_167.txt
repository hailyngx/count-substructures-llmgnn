Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 0) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 14) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 6) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
In this graph, the node degrees are as follows:  
Node 0: 4  
Node 1: 3  
Node 2: 2  
Node 3: 5  
Node 4: 4  
Node 5: 5  
Node 6: 4  
Node 7: 4  
Node 8: 3  
Node 9: 4  
Node 10: 6  
Node 11: 3  
Node 12: 3  
Node 13: 5  
Node 14: 6  

Now let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 10 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 6, 12, and 13: <10, (6, 12, 13)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 4, and 6: <13, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 4, and 6: <14, (3, 4, 6)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of 3. Therefore, the final answer is [3].
