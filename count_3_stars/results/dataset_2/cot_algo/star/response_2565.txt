Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 9, 10}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {5, 10, 11}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 10}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 10}
- Node 14: {3, 6, 7, 11}

Next, count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [62].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- <1, (3, 10, 9)>
- <11, (3, 7, 14)>
- <0, (4, 7, 12)>
- <10, (8, 11, 13)>
