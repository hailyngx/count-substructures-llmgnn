Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 11) (10, 18) (10, 16) (2, 18) (2, 8) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 7) (6, 5) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 19) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 15) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 15) (16, 10) (15, 5) (15, 11) (15, 7) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 13) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 19) (13, 12) (1, 19) 

Response:
After exploring the neighbor nodes for each node and identifying the nodes with three or more neighbors, we find that nodes 5, 6, 7, 11, 14, 17, and 18 have three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph:

1. Node 5 has three neighbors: 9, 6, and 15. This node forms 1 3-star.
2. Node 6 has five neighbors: 5, 18, 11, 12, and 4. Since it has more than 3 neighbors, it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 7 has four neighbors: 14, 18, 0, and 15. Since it has more than 3 neighbors, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 11 has four neighbors: 17, 6, 3, and 15. Since it has more than 3 neighbors, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 14 has three neighbors: 17, 0, and 7. This node forms 1 3-star.
6. Node 17 has four neighbors: 14, 12, 11, and 7. Since it has more than 3 neighbors, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 18 has five neighbors: 10, 2, 6, 7, and 8. Since it has more than 3 neighbors, it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars formed by each node, we get a total of 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 34 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<5, 9, 6>, <6, 5, 18>, <6, 11, 12>, <6, 4, 19>, <7, 14, 0>, <11, 17, 7>, <17, 14, 0>, <17, 12, 7>, <18, 10, 2>, <18, 10, 16>, <18, 10, 6>, <18, 10, 7>, <18, 2, 6>, <18, 2, 10>, <18, 2, 7>, <18, 6, 10>, <18, 7, 10>, <18, 7, 0>, <18, 7, 15>, <18, 7, 14>.
