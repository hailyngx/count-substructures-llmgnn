- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 13, 26
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 7, 16, 22
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 11, 13, 21
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 15, 2
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor: 27
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 14, 23, 25
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 2, 9, 27
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 16, 29
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 7, 19
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors: 0, 23
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 3, 18, 27, 29
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 14, 21, 28, 29
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 18
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 0, 12, 6
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 4, 17, 18, 28
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 2, 19, 23, 8
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 15, 19, 28
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 11, 13, 15, 25
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 9, 16, 17
- Node 20 has 2 neighbors: 23, 24
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 3, 12, 29
- Node 22 has 1 neighbor: 2
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: 6, 10, 16, 20
- Node 24 has 2 neighbors: 20, 25
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors: 0, 6, 12, 18, 24
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors: 1, 25
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 11
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors: 12, 15, 17
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: 8, 11, 12, 21

Based on the number of neighbors, we see that the nodes that can form 3-stars are nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 23, 25, and 29.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star is formed.
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars are formed.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 24 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (10, 14, 25)>, <1, (3, 13, 26)>, <3, (1, 11, 13)>, <4, (2, 15, 4)>, <6, (6, 14, 23)>, <7, (2, 7, 27)>, <11, (3, 11, 29)>, <12, (14, 21, 28)>, <15, (15, 17, 4)>, <16, (2, 16, 23)>, <18, (11, 13, 15)>, <23, (6, 10, 16)>, <25, (0, 12, 24)>, <29, (8, 12, 21)>
