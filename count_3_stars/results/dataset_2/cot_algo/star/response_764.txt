Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 2) (15, 16) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 16) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 16) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (6, 14) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 15) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 14) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (9, 0) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 19) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 13) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 14) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 11) (13, 4) (13, 16) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node. 

Node 0 neighbors: {6, 7, 9, 11}
Node 1 neighbors: {14, 15, 17}
Node 2 neighbors: {5, 15, 18}
Node 3 neighbors: {8, 12, 15}
Node 4 neighbors: {7, 13, 16, 19}
Node 5 neighbors: {2, 10, 11, 12}
Node 6 neighbors: {0, 14}
Node 7 neighbors: {0, 4, 19}
Node 8 neighbors: {3, 15}
Node 9 neighbors: {0}
Node 10 neighbors: {5, 17}
Node 11 neighbors: {0, 5, 12}
Node 12 neighbors: {3, 5, 11}
Node 13 neighbors: {4, 16}
Node 14 neighbors: {1, 6, 19}
Node 15 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 8, 16}
Node 16 neighbors: {4, 15, 17, 18, 13}
Node 17 neighbors: {1, 10, 16}
Node 18 neighbors: {2, 16}
Node 19 neighbors: {4, 7, 14}

Now, we apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <4, 7, 19>, <4, 13, 16>, <4, 16, 19>, <7, 16, 19>
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <2, 5, 12>, <5, 10, 11>, <5, 11, 12>, <5, 12, 11>
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 12

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
