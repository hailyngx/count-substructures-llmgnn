Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}
Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 8}
Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 7}
Node 5: {1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
Node 6: {5, 8}
Node 7: {0, 4, 5}
Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 6}
Node 9: {1, 2, 5}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 5>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 5>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>
