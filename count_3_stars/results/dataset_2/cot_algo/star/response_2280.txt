Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 4, 6, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 3, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 7, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 4, 1, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8, 0, 3, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 6, 0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 7, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 4, 6, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 4, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 1}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with {5, 6, 4} and {5, 3, 2} (2 possible 3-stars)
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star with {4, 7, 8} and {4, 3, 0} (2 possible 3-stars)
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with {5, 4, 1} and {5, 2, 8} (2 possible 3-stars)
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with {7, 5, 6} and {7, 3, 2} (2 possible 3-stars)
- Node 5: Forms a 3-star with {9, 6, 0} and {9, 3, 7} (2 possible 3-stars)
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with {5, 4, 6} and {5, 2, 8} (2 possible 3-stars)
- Node 8: Forms a 3-star with {9, 4, 1} and {9, 3, 2} (2 possible 3-stars)
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with {5, 8, 1} and {5, 3, 7} (2 possible 3-stars)

Number of unique 3-stars = 2 * 8 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 4)>, <0, (5, 3, 2)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 3, 0)>, <3, (5, 4, 1)>, <3, (5, 2, 8)>, <4, (7, 5, 6)>, <4, (7, 3, 2)>, <5, (9, 6, 0)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>, <7, (5, 4, 6)>, <7, (5, 2, 8)>, <8, (9, 4, 1)>, <8, (9, 3, 2)>, <9, (5, 8, 1)>, <9, (5, 3, 7)>.
