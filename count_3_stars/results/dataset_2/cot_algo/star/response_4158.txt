Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 1) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 3) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 3) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a representation of the graph based on the given edge list. This will help us visualize the connections between the nodes.

The nodes are numbered from 0 to 14. Here is the adjacency list representation of the graph:

- Node 0: neighbors {5, 14, 10, 1}
- Node 1: neighbors {8, 13, 12, 0}
- Node 2: neighbors {8, 12, 3}
- Node 3: neighbors {5, 4, 2, 11, 10}
- Node 4: neighbors {6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 3}
- Node 5: neighbors {9, 12, 0, 3, 10}
- Node 6: neighbors {11, 4, 13}
- Node 7: neighbors {4, 12, 10, 14}
- Node 8: neighbors {9, 4, 2, 1}
- Node 9: neighbors {5, 8, 11}
- Node 10: neighbors {5, 7, 12, 0, 3}
- Node 11: neighbors {9, 6, 3}
- Node 12: neighbors {5, 7, 2, 10, 1}
- Node 13: neighbors {6, 4, 1}
- Node 14: neighbors {4, 7, 0}

Next, we will count the number of 3-stars in this graph by checking each node that has three or more neighbors.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 10: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 12: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 83

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [83]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 5, 10>
- <1, 8, 12>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <3, 4, 10>
- <3, 4, 14>
- <4, 6, 13>
- <5, 9, 12>
- <7, 10, 12>
- <8, 9, 4>
- <10, 5, 7>
- <10, 5, 12>
- <10, 7, 12>
- <12, 5, 7>
