Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 2) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 17) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 11) (9, 19) (1, 14) (1, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 14) (18, 16) (13, 15) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 0) (17, 15) (17, 13) (17, 7) (8, 19) (8, 7) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 8) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (12, 14) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 2) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 7) 

Response:
The graph described has the following neighbor sets:
- Node 0 neighbors: {10, 13} (2 neighbors)
- Node 1 neighbors: {4, 14} (2 neighbors)
- Node 2 neighbors: {6, 7, 10, 11, 16} (5 neighbors)
- Node 3 neighbors: {6, 14, 15} (3 neighbors)
- Node 4 neighbors: {1, 5, 14} (3 neighbors)
- Node 5 neighbors: {4, 6, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Node 6 neighbors: {2, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Node 7 neighbors: {2, 8, 17} (3 neighbors)
- Node 8 neighbors: {7, 19} (2 neighbors)
- Node 9 neighbors: {11, 19} (2 neighbors)
- Node 10 neighbors: {0, 2, 11} (3 neighbors)
- Node 11 neighbors: {2, 9, 10, 15, 16} (5 neighbors)
- Node 12 neighbors: {14} (1 neighbor)
- Node 13 neighbors: {0, 5, 15, 17} (4 neighbors)
- Node 14 neighbors: {1, 3, 4, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Node 15 neighbors: {3, 11, 13, 17, 19} (5 neighbors)
- Node 16 neighbors: {2, 11, 18} (3 neighbors)
- Node 17 neighbors: {7, 13, 15} (3 neighbors)
- Node 18 neighbors: {16} (1 neighbor)
- Node 19 neighbors: {8, 9, 15} (3 neighbors)

Applying the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes with three or more neighbors, we find that nodes 2, 11, and 15 can each form 10 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([3 \times 10] = [30]\).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (6, 10, 16)>
- <11, (9, 10, 16)>
- <15, (13, 17, 19)>
