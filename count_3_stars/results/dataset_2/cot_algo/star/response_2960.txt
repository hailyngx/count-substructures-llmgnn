Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node. 

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:
Node 0: {1, 2, 8, 9}
Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 9}
Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
Node 3: {2, 8, 9}
Node 4: {7}
Node 5: {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 6: {1, 5, 7, 8}
Node 7: {4, 5, 6, 9}
Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}
Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 5, 7}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
For nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 48.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 8, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 9, 5>, <2, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 9, 7>, <5, 9, 8>, <6, 7, 8>, <8, 9, 5>

Therefore, the final answer, to be put inside brackets, is [48].
