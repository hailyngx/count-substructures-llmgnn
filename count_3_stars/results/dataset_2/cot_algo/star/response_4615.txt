Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 22) (9, 5) (9, 3) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (27, 28) (27, 8) (2, 29) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 4) (20, 21) (20, 3) (25, 2) (25, 16) (25, 10) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 8) (14, 7) (14, 21) (17, 28) (17, 22) (17, 18) (13, 0) (13, 4) (13, 23) (13, 18) (26, 16) (26, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 19) (7, 23) (7, 1) (8, 27) (8, 6) (8, 15) (8, 21) (10, 0) (10, 25) (12, 26) (12, 19) (4, 29) (4, 13) (4, 15) (22, 5) (22, 17) (22, 15) (22, 24) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 24) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 15) (23, 5) (23, 13) (23, 7) (23, 28) (19, 7) (19, 12) (28, 27) (28, 17) (28, 23) (21, 20) (21, 14) (21, 8) (3, 9) (3, 20) (3, 16) (18, 17) (18, 13) (18, 16) (18, 24) (24, 22) (24, 1) (24, 18) (16, 25) (16, 26) (16, 3) (16, 18) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 22) (15, 11) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {7, 10, 13}
- Node 1: {7, 11, 24}
- Node 2: {4, 25, 29}
- Node 3: {9, 16, 20}
- Node 4: {13, 15, 29}
- Node 5: {6, 9, 22, 23}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 11}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 14, 19, 23}
- Node 8: {6, 15, 21, 27}
- Node 9: {3, 5}
- Node 10: {0, 25}
- Node 11: {1, 6, 15}
- Node 12: {19, 26}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 18, 23}
- Node 14: {7, 21}
- Node 15: {4, 8, 11, 22}
- Node 16: {3, 18, 25, 26}
- Node 17: {18, 22, 28}
- Node 18: {13, 16, 17, 24}
- Node 19: {7, 12}
- Node 20: {3, 21}
- Node 21: {14, 8, 20}
- Node 22: {5, 15, 17, 24}
- Node 23: {5, 7, 13, 28}
- Node 24: {1, 18, 22}
- Node 25: {2, 10, 16}
- Node 26: {12, 16}
- Node 27: {8, 28}
- Node 28: {17, 23, 27}
- Node 29: {2, 4}

Next, let's identify nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (6, 9, 22)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (1, 23, 14)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (6, 15, 21)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (4, 18, 23)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (8, 11, 22)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star: <16, (3, 18, 25)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star: <18, (13, 17, 24)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star: <22, (15, 17, 24)>
- Node 23 forms a 3-star: <23, (7, 13, 28)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of 9 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
