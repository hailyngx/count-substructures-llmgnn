Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 27) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 14) (1, 16) (1, 21) (21, 1) (21, 4) (0, 27) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 2) (27, 11) (27, 0) (27, 13) (27, 23) (3, 10) (18, 5) (18, 29) (22, 12) (20, 0) (20, 14) (20, 28) (19, 26) (19, 4) (19, 24) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 25) (9, 24) (9, 14) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 10) (28, 23) (6, 15) (6, 4) (8, 16) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 7) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 4) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 25) (12, 11) (12, 22) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 15) (7, 8) (7, 13) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 25) (4, 21) (4, 19) (4, 6) (4, 5) (29, 18) (29, 24) (10, 3) (10, 28) (10, 8) (24, 19) (24, 9) (24, 12) (24, 29) (24, 13) (23, 27) (23, 28) (25, 0) (25, 26) (25, 2) (25, 15) (17, 8) (17, 5) (14, 16) (14, 20) (14, 9) (14, 13) (13, 27) (13, 7) (13, 24) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes which have three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29. 
For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with them.

For node 0: Inom{4}{3} = 4

For node 4: Inom{4}{3} = 4

For node 8: Inom{4}{3} = 4

For node 10: Inom{3}{3} = 1

For node 11: Inom{3}{3} = 1

For node 12: Inom{5}{3} = 10

For node 13: Inom{4}{3} = 4

For node 14: Inom{5}{3} = 10

For node 15: Inom{3}{3} = 1

For node 16: Inom{3}{3} = 1

For node 18: Inom{3}{3} = 1

For node 19: Inom{3}{3} = 1

For node 20: Inom{3}{3} = 1

For node 24: Inom{5}{3} = 10

For node 25: Inom{4}{3} = 4

For node 26: Inom{3}{3} = 1

For node 27: Inom{4}{3} = 4

For node 28: Inom{4}{3} = 4

For node 29: Inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding up all the 3-star configurations calculated for each node: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 61

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [61].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (27, 11, 20)>, <4, (21, 19, 6)>, <8, (16, 17, 10)>, <10, (3, 28, 8)>, <11, (27, 5, 12)>, <12, (22, 24, 15)>, <13, (27, 7, 24)>, <14, (16, 20, 9)>, <15, (6, 12, 25)>, <16, (1, 14, 8)>, <18, (5, 29, 24)>, <19, (26, 4, 24)>, <20, (0, 14, 28)>, <24, (19, 29, 13)>, <25, (15, 2, 26)>, <26, (19, 25, 28)>, <27, (11, 0, 13)>, <28, (10, 23, 25)>, <29, (18, 24, 9)>.
