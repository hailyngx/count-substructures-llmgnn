Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 24) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 20) (8, 10) (8, 21) (8, 26) (23, 25) (23, 0) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 13) (20, 3) (20, 15) (17, 27) (17, 26) (29, 6) (29, 21) (29, 18) (4, 28) (18, 29) (18, 27) (18, 0) (18, 28) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 5) (26, 8) (26, 17) (26, 22) (26, 24) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 22) (9, 0) (24, 1) (24, 26) (24, 25) (0, 23) (0, 18) (0, 9) (0, 5) (7, 25) (7, 10) (25, 23) (25, 24) (25, 7) (25, 2) (21, 8) (21, 29) (21, 28) (21, 13) (21, 27) (28, 4) (28, 18) (28, 21) (28, 19) (12, 16) (12, 14) (16, 12) (16, 5) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (13, 15) (13, 21) (13, 11) (6, 29) (6, 22) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 2) (19, 28) (19, 14) (19, 27) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 16) (27, 17) (27, 18) (27, 21) (27, 19) (10, 8) (10, 7) (2, 25) (2, 11) (2, 14) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

1: {3, 11, 24, 9}
3: {1, 20, 15}
8: {10, 21, 26}
23: {25, 0}
15: {20, 9, 13}
20: {3, 15}
17: {27, 26}
29: {6, 21, 18}
4: {28}
18: {29, 27, 0, 28}
22: {26, 9, 6, 5}
26: {8, 17, 22, 24}
9: {1, 15, 22, 0}
24: {1, 26, 25}
0: {23, 18, 9, 5}
7: {25, 10}
25: {23, 24, 7, 2}
21: {8, 29, 28, 13, 27}
28: {4, 18, 21, 19}
12: {16, 14}
16: {12, 5}
11: {1, 13, 2}
13: {15, 21, 11}
6: {29, 22}
14: {12, 19, 2}
19: {28, 14, 27}
5: {22, 0, 16}
27: {17, 18, 21, 19}
10: {8, 7}
2: {25, 11, 14}

Now, we can identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the number of 3-stars:

Possible 3-star formations:
Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 ways
<1, (3, 11, 24)>, <1, (3, 11, 9)>, <1, (3, 24, 9)>, <1, (11, 24, 9)>

Node 28: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 ways
<28, (4, 18, 21)>, <28, (4, 18, 19)>, <28, (4, 21, 19)>, <28, (18, 21, 19)>

Node 10: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 ways (less than 3 neighbors)

Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 way
<2, (25, 11, 14)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].
