Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 6) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 8) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 0) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 5, 4, 14, 3
Node 1: 10, 12
Node 2: 11, 8, 14
Node 3: 5, 9, 4, 12, 0
Node 4: 13, 0, 6, 3
Node 5: 9, 6, 0, 3
Node 6: 5, 4, 7, 10, 14
Node 7: 9, 12, 6
Node 8: 10, 2, 12
Node 9: 5, 11, 3, 7
Node 10: 6, 8, 1, 13
Node 11: 9, 13, 2
Node 12: 7, 13, 14, 3, 1, 8
Node 13: 4, 10, 11, 12, 14
Node 14: 12, 2, 0, 6, 13

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves (5, 4, 14)
Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves (11, 8, 14)
Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves (5, 9, 4)
Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves (5, 0, 14)
Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves (5, 4, 7)
Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves (5, 10, 14)
Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves (4, 7, 14)
Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves (7, 10, 14)
Node 12 forms a 3-star with leaves (7, 13, 14)
Node 12 forms a 3-star with leaves (12, 1, 8)
Node 12 forms a 3-star with leaves (12, 8, 2)
Node 12 forms a 3-star with leaves (1, 8, 2)
Node 12 forms a 3-star with leaves (12, 13, 14)
Node 13 forms a 3-star with leaves (4, 10, 11)
Node 13 forms a 3-star with leaves (10, 11, 12)
Node 13 forms a 3-star with leaves (11, 12, 14)
Node 14 forms a 3-star with leaves (0, 6, 13)

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [16].
