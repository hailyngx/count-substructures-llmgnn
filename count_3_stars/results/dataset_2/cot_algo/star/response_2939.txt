Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 3) (1, 11) (15, 7) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 7) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 14) (9, 12) (18, 9) (18, 3) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 12) (11, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (16, 19) (16, 2) (16, 6) (6, 19) (6, 16) (6, 0) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 10) (3, 8) (3, 18) (3, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 12) (2, 17) (2, 16) (12, 17) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 14) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following degrees for each node:  
Node 0: 4  
Node 1: 1  
Node 2: 2  
Node 3: 3  
Node 4: 4  
Node 5: 4  
Node 6: 3  
Node 7: 3  
Node 8: 4  
Node 9: 4  
Node 10: 3  
Node 11: 1  
Node 12: 5  
Node 13: 4  
Node 14: 3  
Node 15: 1  
Node 16: 3  
Node 17: 4  
Node 18: 2  
Node 19: 4

\( \text{Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:} \)  
Nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 17, 19  

Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{11}{3} + \binom{10}{3} \times 2 + \binom{9}{3} + \binom{9}{3} + \binom{5}{3} \times 2 + \binom{4}{3} \)  
Total number of 3-stars: \( 165 + 180 + 84 + 84 + 20 + 4 = 537 \)  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars inside brackets is [537].  

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (4, 5, 6)>  
<3, (8, 10, 12)>  
<4, (8, 9, 14)>  
<5, (4, 0, 10)>  
<7, (17, 10, 15)>  
<8, (4, 9, 3)>  
<9, (4, 8, 14)>  
<12, (17, 19, 3)>  
<13, (17, 19, 0)>  
<17, (13, 12, 7)>  
<19, (13, 16, 6)>
