Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 16) (22, 18) (22, 6) (22, 0) (22, 12) (22, 3) (4, 27) (4, 3) (8, 15) (8, 12) (1, 26) (1, 2) (1, 0) (26, 18) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 13) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 27) (21, 24) (28, 21) (28, 16) (28, 17) (28, 5) (19, 26) (19, 10) (13, 26) (13, 24) (13, 15) (13, 7) (6, 22) (6, 21) (16, 18) (16, 28) (16, 15) (16, 9) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 16) (9, 16) (9, 29) (9, 11) (29, 9) (29, 14) (11, 9) (11, 23) (11, 7) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 14) (27, 4) (27, 21) (27, 5) (0, 22) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 12) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 5) (17, 28) (5, 28) (5, 23) (5, 27) (5, 7) (25, 2) (2, 1) (2, 25) (2, 24) (2, 14) (3, 22) (3, 4) (3, 14) (14, 29) (14, 23) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 24) (12, 22) (12, 8) (12, 10) (24, 21) (24, 13) (24, 2) (24, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 10, 22
- Node 1: 0, 2, 26
- Node 2: 1, 14, 24, 25
- Node 3: 4, 14, 22
- Node 4: 3, 27
- Node 5: 7, 23, 27, 28
- Node 6: 21, 22
- Node 7: 5, 11, 13, 23
- Node 8: 10, 12, 15
- Node 9: 11, 16, 29
- Node 10: 0, 12, 19
- Node 11: 7, 9, 23
- Node 12: 8, 10, 22
- Node 13: 7, 15, 24, 26
- Node 14: 2, 3, 23, 24, 29
- Node 15: 8, 13, 16
- Node 16: 9, 15, 18, 28
- Node 17: 28
- Node 18: 16, 22, 26
- Node 19: 10, 26
- Node 21: 6, 21, 24, 27
- Node 22: 0, 6, 12, 16, 18, 26
- Node 23: 5, 7, 11, 14
- Node 24: 2, 13, 14, 21
- Node 25: 2
- Node 26: 1, 13, 18, 19, 26
- Node 27: 4, 5, 21, 27
- Node 28: 5, 16, 17, 21
- Node 29: 9, 14

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. We will only consider nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: No 3-star can be formed with less than 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: No 3-star can be formed with less than 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed with less than 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 1
- Node 10: No 3-star can be formed with less than 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 1
- Node 12: No 3-star can be formed with less than 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 1
- Node 14: 1
- Node 15: No 3-star can be formed with less than 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 1
- Node 17: No 3-star can be formed with less than 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 1
- Node 19: No 3-star can be formed with less than 3 neighbors
- Node 21: 1
- Node 22: 1
- Node 23: 1
- Node 24: 1
- Node 25: No 3-star can be formed with less than 3 neighbors
- Node 26: 1
- Node 27: 1
- Node 28: 1
- Node 29: No 3-star can be formed with less than 3 neighbors

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is given by the sum of 1s for each node that can form a 3-star, which is 16. So, the final number of 3-stars is [16]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 26>
- <1, 2, 26>
- <2, 14, 24>
- <3, 4, 22>
- <5, 7, 27>
- <7, 11, 23>
- <9, 11, 23>
- <13, 14, 26>
- <14, 23, 24>
- <16, 18, 26>
- <16, 28, 5>
- <18, 22, 26>
- <21, 24, 27>
- <22, 0, 12>
- <22, 12, 16>
- <26, 18, 19>
