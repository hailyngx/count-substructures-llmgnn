Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 12) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 3) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 13) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 12) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 8, 7, 2}
- Node 1: {7, 14, 10, 2}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 12, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {6, 4, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 11, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 8, 12, 4}
- Node 6: {3, 11, 12}
- Node 7: {0, 11, 1}
- Node 8: {5, 4, 0, 14}
- Node 9: {5, 10, 0}
- Node 10: {9, 1, 2, 12}
- Node 11: {6, 4, 7, 13}
- Node 12: {5, 6, 2, 10, 14, 3}
- Node 13: {3, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {8, 1, 2, 12, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: Can form a 3-star with neighbors {9, 8, 2}: <0, (9, 8, 2)>
- Node 12: Can form 3-stars with neighbors {5, 6, 2}, {5, 10, 14}, and {2, 10, 14}: <12, (5, 6, 2)>, <12, (5, 10, 14)>, <12, (2, 10, 14)>

Since these are the only nodes with 3 or more neighbors, the total number of 3-stars is 4. So, the final answer is [4].
