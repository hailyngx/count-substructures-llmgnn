Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 13) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 12) (4, 9) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 7) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 10) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 18) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 1) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 12) (2, 3) (19, 1) (19, 3) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 18) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 3) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 3) (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 13) (3, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 11, 16, 18
Node 1: 7, 17, 19
Node 2: 3
Node 3: 2, 13, 18, 19
Node 4: 9
Node 5: 6, 9, 15, 18
Node 6: 5, 14, 17
Node 7: 1, 9, 16
Node 9: 4, 5, 7, 12
Node 10: 11, 13, 15
Node 11: 0, 10, 16
Node 12: 9, 13, 14, 17, 18
Node 13: 3, 10, 12
Node 14: 6, 12, 18
Node 15: 5, 10, 16
Node 16: 0, 7, 11, 15
Node 17: 1, 6, 12
Node 18: 0, 5, 12, 14, 18, 3
Node 19: 1, 3

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node:

Nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18

Number of 3-stars formed around each of the above nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 44 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].
