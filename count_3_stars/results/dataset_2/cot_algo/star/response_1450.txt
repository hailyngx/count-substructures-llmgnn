Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 13) (26, 18) (26, 21) (26, 0) (26, 17) (5, 9) (5, 19) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 24) (18, 12) (22, 15) (22, 12) (8, 13) (8, 25) (8, 11) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 25) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 25) (11, 8) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 17) (0, 26) (0, 21) (0, 12) (20, 27) (28, 29) (28, 6) (29, 28) (29, 4) (2, 12) (2, 27) (6, 10) (6, 28) (6, 7) (4, 29) (4, 27) (27, 20) (27, 2) (27, 4) (27, 1) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 14) (19, 23) (1, 27) (1, 16) (1, 24) (12, 18) (12, 22) (12, 0) (12, 2) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 16) (16, 10) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 14) (24, 18) (24, 11) (24, 1) (3, 8) (17, 26) (17, 11) (17, 23) (23, 18) (23, 19) (23, 17) (23, 14) (23, 25) (21, 26) (21, 0) (21, 19) (15, 9) (15, 22) (25, 8) (25, 13) (25, 10) (25, 23) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 23) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more visual way to help with the analysis:

```
 1 --- 2 --- 6 --- 7 --- 11 --- 8 --- 3
 |           |           |             |
27 --- 20    28          16            25
 |     |     |           |       |     |
 \     |     |           |       |     /
  19 -- 5 -- 10 --- 25 --- 13 --- 9 -- 15
 |             |           |             |
 |             |           |             |
 14            4 --- 29    17 --- 26    22
 |             |             \     /     |
 23 --- 18    27            21 -- 0     12
                    |                   |
                    24 ----------------- 
```  

Now, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 1: {2, 27}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 27, 12}
- ...
- Node 29: {4, 6, 27}

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars from nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Finally, sum up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [24]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
- <8, 11, 24>

- <8, 13, 25>
- <8, 3, 10>
- <11, 17, 23>
- <11, 17, 26>
- <11, 24, 1>
- <11, 24, 18>
