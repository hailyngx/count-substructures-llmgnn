Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 14) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 7, 13, 10}
- Node 1: {6, 11, 2}
- Node 2: {6, 5, 1, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 12, 11, 3}
- Node 5: {6, 13, 2}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 1, 14, 2}
- Node 7: {4, 12, 0, 13}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 3}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 13, 0, 12}
- Node 10: {12, 0, 2, 14}
- Node 11: {4, 1, 14}
- Node 12: {9, 4, 7, 10}
- Node 13: {9, 7, 5, 0}
- Node 14: {6, 10, 11, 3, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0: [1] (Cannot form a 3-star)
- Node 1: [1] (Cannot form a 3-star)
- Node 2: [1] (Cannot form a 3-star)
- Node 3: [1] (Cannot form a 3-star)
- Node 4: [1] (Cannot form a 3-star)
- Node 5: [1] (Cannot form a 3-star)
- Node 6: [1] (Cannot form a 3-star)
- Node 7: [1] (Cannot form a 3-star)
- Node 8: [1] (Cannot form a 3-star)
- Node 9: [1] (Cannot form a 3-star)
- Node 10: [1] (Cannot form a 3-star)
- Node 11: [1] (Cannot form a 3-star)
- Node 12: [2] (<12, 7, 4>, <12, 10, 0>)
- Node 13: [2] (<13, 9, 7>, <13, 5, 0>)
- Node 14: [1] (Cannot form a 3-star)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <12, 7, 4>
- <12, 10, 0>
- <13, 9, 7>
- <13, 5, 0>
