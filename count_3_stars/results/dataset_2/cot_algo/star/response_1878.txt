Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 11) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 11) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 1) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 12) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {9, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 11}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {3, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 12: {7, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 3, 4}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 73 \]

So the final answer is [73].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (3, 6, 13)>
- <3, (1, 5, 14)>
- <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <7, (5, 11, 12)>
- <9, (1, 6, 12)>
- <11, (3, 7, 8)>
- <14, (1, 3, 4)>
