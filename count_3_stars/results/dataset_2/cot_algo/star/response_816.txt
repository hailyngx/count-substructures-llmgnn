Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to analyze the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 7, 8}

Now, we find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars (need at least 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <7, 5, 6>.
