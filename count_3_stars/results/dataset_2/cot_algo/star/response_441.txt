Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, we need to find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 3, 6}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 2, 6}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 8, 1, 6, 3}
- Node 3: {5, 2, 8, 0}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 0, 2}
- Node 5: {8, 1, 4, 3}
- Node 6: {7, 2, 0, 1}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 0, 6}
- Node 8: {5, 2, 3}
- Node 9: {2, 1, 7}

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 each have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (4, 7, 3)>
- <1, (5, 9, 2)>
- <2, (9, 4, 8)>
- <3, (5, 2, 8)>
- <4, (5, 7, 0)>
- <5, (8, 1, 4)>
- <6, (7, 2, 0)>
- <7, (9, 4, 0)>
