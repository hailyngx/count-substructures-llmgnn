Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (16, 11) (16, 23) (16, 9) (16, 19) (15, 27) (15, 4) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 21) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 22) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 29) (12, 9) (12, 3) (23, 16) (23, 21) (23, 10) (0, 7) (0, 25) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 7) (6, 0) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 18) (28, 6) (28, 4) (28, 24) (19, 16) (19, 24) (26, 5) (26, 29) (26, 21) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 2) (4, 15) (4, 28) (4, 22) (4, 25) (4, 20) (22, 5) (22, 4) (22, 10) (22, 17) (24, 6) (24, 28) (24, 19) (24, 3) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 29) (1, 29) (29, 13) (29, 26) (29, 18) (29, 1) (21, 15) (21, 27) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 26) (20, 4) (3, 12) (3, 24) (3, 2) (25, 0) (25, 4) (17, 22) (10, 23) (10, 22) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 6, 7, 25}
- Node 1: {29}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 12, 24}
- Node 4: {15, 20, 22, 25, 28}
- Node 5: {9, 22, 26}
- Node 6: {0, 18, 24, 28}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 14, 18}
- Node 8: {9, 13}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 12, 13, 16}
- Node 10: {22, 23}
- Node 11: {14, 16}
- Node 12: {3, 9}
- Node 13: {8, 9, 21, 29}
- Node 14: {7, 11}
- Node 15: {4, 21, 27}
- Node 16: {9, 11, 19, 23}
- Node 17: {22}
- Node 18: {6, 7, 29}
- Node 19: {16, 24}
- Node 20: {4}
- Node 21: {13, 15, 23, 26, 27}
- Node 22: {4, 5, 10, 17}
- Node 23: {16, 21}
- Node 24: {3, 6, 19, 28}
- Node 25: {0, 4}
- Node 26: {5, 21, 29}
- Node 27: {15, 21}
- Node 28: {4, 6, 24}
- Node 29: {1, 13, 18, 26}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<9, (5, 8, 12)>, <9, (5, 8, 13)>, <9, (5, 8, 16)>, <9, (5, 12, 13)>, <9, (5, 12, 16)>, <9, (5, 13, 16)>, <9, (8, 12, 13)>, <9, (8, 12, 16)>, <9, (8, 13, 16)>, <9, (12, 13, 16)>, <13, (8, 9, 21)>, <13, (8, 9, 29)>, <13, (8, 21, 29)>, <13, (9, 21, 29)>, <16, (11, 19, 23)>, <16, (9, 11, 19)>, <16, (9, 11, 23)>, <16, (9, 19, 23)>, <21, (13, 15, 27)>, <21, (13, 15, 26)>, <21, (13, 15, 21)>, <21, (13, 27, 26)>, <21, (15, 27, 26)>, <22, (4, 10, 17)>, <24, (3, 6, 28)>, <24, (3, 6, 19)>, <24, (3, 6, 24)>, <24, (3, 19, 28)>, <24, (6, 19, 28)>, <26, (5, 21, 29)>, <29, (1, 18, 26)>
