Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 22) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 11) (2, 29) (2, 16) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 14) (18, 12) (18, 25) (22, 5) (22, 9) (22, 8) (15, 16) (15, 24) (20, 12) (4, 10) (28, 9) (28, 29) (28, 0) (28, 13) (17, 3) (17, 21) (17, 7) (19, 5) (19, 29) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 6) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 14) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 8) (6, 19) (6, 14) (23, 25) (23, 10) (26, 21) (26, 27) (26, 7) (21, 17) (21, 16) (21, 26) (21, 11) (21, 25) (0, 28) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 8) (24, 2) (24, 15) (24, 16) (11, 9) (11, 21) (14, 29) (14, 16) (14, 6) (14, 10) (27, 29) (27, 26) (12, 18) (12, 20) (12, 1) (13, 28) (25, 18) (25, 23) (25, 21) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 26) (7, 8) (10, 4) (10, 23) (10, 14) (8, 22) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
Given the provided graph information, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {28}
- Node 1: {19, 8, 12}
- Node 2: {29, 16, 24}
- Node 3: {5, 17, 8}
- Node 4: {10}
- Node 5: {9, 19, 22, 3}
- Node 6: {19, 14}
- Node 7: {17, 19, 26, 8}
- Node 8: {22, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 22, 28, 11}
- Node 10: {4, 23, 14}
- Node 11: {9, 21}
- Node 12: {18, 20, 1}
- Node 13: {28}
- Node 14: {29, 16, 6, 10}
- Node 15: {16, 24}
- Node 16: {2, 15, 21, 24, 14}
- Node 17: {3, 21, 7}
- Node 18: {12, 25}
- Node 19: {5, 29, 7, 1, 6}
- Node 20: {12}
- Node 21: {17, 16, 26, 11, 25}
- Node 22: {5, 9, 8}
- Node 23: {10, 25}
- Node 24: {2, 15, 16}
- Node 25: {18, 23, 21}
- Node 26: {21, 27, 7}
- Node 27: {29, 26}
- Node 28: {9, 29, 0, 13}
- Node 29: {2, 29, 28, 19, 14}

Next, we identify nodes with at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 5: <5, (9, 19, 22)>
- Node 9: <9, (5, 22, 28)>
- Node 19: <19, (5, 29, 7)> and <19, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 21: <21, (17, 16, 26)>

Counting the unique 3-stars formed, we have a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
