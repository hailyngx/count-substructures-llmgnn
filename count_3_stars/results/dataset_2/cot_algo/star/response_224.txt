Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a visualization of the graph based on the given edges:

```
    0 -- 1 -- 2 -- 6
    |    | / | / |
    4 -- 3 -- 5 -- 9
     \     |       /
       \   |     /
          7 -- 8
```

By looking at the graph and the given edges, we can identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 0
- Node 2
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 58

Therefore, the final answer is [58], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <9, (0, 2, 6)>
