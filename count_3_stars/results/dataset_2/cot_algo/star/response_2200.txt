Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 12) (16, 17) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 18) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (19, 18) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (18, 14) (18, 19) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 1) (12, 16) (12, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 4) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 4) (2, 3) (15, 13) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 4) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 11, 17}
- Node 5: {0, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 7, 17}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {9, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 10: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 11: {4, 14, 17}
- Node 12: {1, 16}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 7, 8, 15}
- Node 14: {0, 8, 11, 18}
- Node 15: {13}
- Node 16: {12, 17}
- Node 17: {4, 6, 11, 16}
- Node 18: {14, 19}
- Node 19: {18}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 14: <14, 11, 18>, <14, 8, 0>, <14, 18, 19>
- Node 13: <13, 1, 10>, <13, 1, 12>, <13, 5, 0>, <13, 7, 9>, <13, 7, 10>
- Node 7: <7, 3, 9>, <7, 3, 2>, <7, 6, 17>, <7, 6, 4>
- Node 4: <4, 1, 17>, <4, 11, 17>, <4, 6, 17>, <4, 1, 6>
- Node 6: <6, 0, 4>, <6, 0, 17>, <6, 17, 16>
- Node 1: <1, 4, 12>
- Node 17: <17, 6, 4>
- Node 0: <0, 5, 6>
- Node 16: <16, 17, 12>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of 18. So, the final answer is [18].
