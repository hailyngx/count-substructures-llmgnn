Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 17) (16, 23) (16, 4) (16, 20) (9, 25) (9, 2) (26, 15) (26, 8) (26, 6) (4, 16) (4, 12) (4, 28) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 10) (21, 18) (21, 29) (18, 21) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 25) (18, 29) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 1) (22, 8) (2, 9) (2, 18) (12, 4) (12, 7) (8, 26) (8, 22) (8, 24) (8, 20) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 5) (6, 26) (6, 21) (6, 10) (6, 27) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 6) (1, 22) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 20) (3, 13) (28, 4) (28, 22) (28, 3) (28, 5) (17, 11) (17, 24) (25, 9) (25, 18) (25, 19) (5, 14) (5, 28) (5, 20) (23, 16) (23, 29) (15, 26) (27, 6) (27, 29) (29, 21) (29, 18) (29, 23) (29, 27) (29, 24) (24, 8) (24, 3) (24, 17) (24, 29) (24, 13) (19, 11) (19, 25) (20, 16) (20, 8) (20, 3) (20, 5) (13, 3) (13, 24) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 14}
- Node 1: {22}
- Node 2: {9, 18}
- Node 3: {13, 20, 24, 28}
- Node 4: {12, 16, 28}
- Node 5: {14, 20, 28}
- Node 6: {10, 21, 26, 27}
- Node 7: {0, 10, 12, 21}
- Node 8: {20, 22, 24, 26}
- Node 9: {2, 25}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 21}
- Node 11: {17, 19}
- Node 12: {4, 7}
- Node 13: {3, 24}
- Node 14: {0, 5}
- Node 15: {26}
- Node 16: {4, 20, 23}
- Node 17: {11, 24}
- Node 18: {2, 21, 22, 25, 29}
- Node 19: {11, 25}
- Node 20: {3, 5, 8, 16}
- Node 21: {6, 7, 10, 18, 29}
- Node 22: {1, 8, 18, 28}
- Node 23: {16, 29}
- Node 24: {3, 8, 13, 17, 29}
- Node 25: {9, 18, 19}
- Node 26: {6, 8, 15}
- Node 27: {6, 29}
- Node 28: {3, 4, 5, 22}
- Node 29: {18, 21, 23, 27, 24}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with neighbors {21, 22, 29} <18, (21, 22, 29)>.
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 10, 18} <21, (7, 10, 18)>.
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with neighbors {8, 17, 29} <24, (8, 17, 29)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
