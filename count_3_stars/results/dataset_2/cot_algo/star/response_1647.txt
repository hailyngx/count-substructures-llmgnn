Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 4) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 14) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 5) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 15) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (9, 11) (9, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 14) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 18) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 18) (7, 1) (7, 3) (15, 17) (15, 19) (19, 15) (19, 0) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 16) (6, 4) (14, 16) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 18) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 6) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {12, 19, 5}
- Node 1: {11, 8, 2, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 14}
- Node 3: {7, 4, 18}
- Node 4: {11, 3, 6}
- Node 5: {10, 2, 0, 14}
- Node 6: {16, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 3}
- Node 8: {16, 13, 9, 17, 1}
- Node 9: {11, 8}
- Node 10: {17, 12, 5}
- Node 11: {1, 9, 4}
- Node 12: {10, 0, 18}
- Node 13: {8, 17}
- Node 14: {16, 2, 5, 18}
- Node 15: {17, 19}
- Node 16: {8, 6, 14}
- Node 17: {8, 13, 10, 15}
- Node 18: {12, 3, 14}
- Node 19: {15, 0}

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 22 \), so the final answer is [22].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, 2, 8, 7>
- <1, 2, 8, 5>
- <1, 2, 8, 14>
- <1, 7, 3, 4>
- <5, 2, 14, 18>
- <8, 10, 12, 17>
- <8, 10, 5, 17>
- <8, 13, 17, 10>
- <8, 13, 17, 15>
- <17, 10, 12, 5>
- <17, 10, 15, 19>
- <17, 15, 19, 0>
- <8, 16, 6, 14>
- <11, 1, 8, 9>
- <11, 1, 8, 4>
- <11, 1, 2, 8>
- <14, 5, 10, 17>
- <14, 18, 12, 10>
- <14, 18, 3, 12>
- <18, 14, 2, 5>
- <18, 14, 5, 0>
- <18, 14, 3, 4>
