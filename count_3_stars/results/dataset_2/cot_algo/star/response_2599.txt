Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's apply the \( \binom{n}{3} \) calculation for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing these up gives us a total of 66 3-stars: [66]

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- <9, (3, 5, 7)>
