Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 4) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 5, 13, 14, 11, 2
Node 1: 9, 3, 11, 12, 7
Node 2: 3, 7, 0, 6
Node 3: 9, 1, 11, 7, 2, 4
Node 4: 9, 3, 12, 10
Node 5: 9, 6, 0, 10
Node 6: 5, 7, 10, 2
Node 7: 1, 3, 13, 6, 2
Node 8: 13
Node 9: 5, 4, 10, 3, 1
Node 10: 5, 9, 14, 6, 4
Node 11: 1, 3, 0
Node 12: 1, 4
Node 13: 8, 14, 7, 0
Node 14: 13, 0, 10

Next, let's identify nodes with at least three neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 13: No 3-star formed
Node 14: No 3-star formed

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 68

Unique 3-stars found:
