Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 0) (11, 12) (2, 7) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 18) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 13) (5, 4) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 7) (13, 10) (13, 5) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 5) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (15, 17) (15, 18) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 19) (7, 8) (16, 10) (16, 3) (16, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 18) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 16) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 9, 11, 18}
- Node 1: {6, 8}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {16, 18, 19, 5}
- Node 4: {14, 17, 5}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 13, 19}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 8, 17, 19}
- Node 8: {1, 7, 16}
- Node 9: {0, 6}
- Node 10: {12, 13, 16}
- Node 11: {0, 12}
- Node 12: {10, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {10, 5}
- Node 14: {4, 12, 17}
- Node 15: {17, 18}
- Node 16: {3, 8, 10}
- Node 17: {14, 15, 4, 7}
- Node 18: {3, 15, 0}
- Node 19: {3, 5, 7}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 0, 7, 12, 17, 3, 5, 10
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: None

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars per node
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars per node

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 \times 6 + 10 = 34 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (6, 9, 18)>, <3, (16, 18, 19)>, <3, (5, 13, 19)>, <3, (4, 5, 17)>, <5, (3, 13, 19)>, <5, (3, 4, 19)>, <5, (4, 13, 17)>, <10, (12, 13, 16)>, <10, (3, 13, 16)>, <17, (4, 14, 15)>, <17, (7, 14, 15)>
