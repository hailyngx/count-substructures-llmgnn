Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 22) (1, 27) (21, 0) (21, 26) (21, 15) (0, 21) (0, 22) (0, 18) (27, 1) (27, 28) (27, 3) (10, 26) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 7) (2, 17) (2, 7) (8, 29) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 23) (26, 21) (26, 10) (9, 25) (9, 4) (9, 28) (22, 1) (22, 0) (22, 16) (22, 25) (3, 27) (3, 11) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (5, 13) (5, 24) (5, 20) (13, 19) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 18) (15, 1) (15, 21) (16, 22) (16, 28) (16, 24) (16, 29) (28, 27) (28, 9) (28, 16) (28, 4) (28, 18) (14, 11) (14, 12) (24, 5) (24, 16) (24, 7) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 24) (7, 29) (7, 6) (29, 8) (29, 16) (29, 7) (25, 9) (25, 22) (25, 23) (25, 4) (6, 7) (6, 23) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 25) (4, 20) (20, 5) (20, 4) (20, 18) (23, 19) (23, 25) (23, 6) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 28) (18, 20) (18, 12) (12, 14) (12, 18) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 21, 22, 18
- Node 1 neighbors: 15, 22, 27
- Node 2 neighbors: 17, 7
- Node 3 neighbors: 27, 11
- Node 4 neighbors: 9, 28, 25, 20
- Node 5 neighbors: 13, 24, 20
- Node 6 neighbors: 7, 23
- Node 7 neighbors: 17, 2, 24, 29, 6
- Node 8 neighbors: 29
- Node 9 neighbors: 25, 4, 28
- Node 10 neighbors: 26
- Node 11 neighbors: 3, 13, 14
- Node 12 neighbors: 14, 18
- Node 13 neighbors: 19, 11, 5, 18
- Node 14 neighbors: 11, 12
- Node 15 neighbors: 1, 21
- Node 16 neighbors: 22, 28, 24, 29
- Node 17 neighbors: 19, 2, 7
- Node 18 neighbors: 0, 13, 28, 20, 12
- Node 19 neighbors: 17, 13, 23
- Node 20 neighbors: 5, 4, 18
- Node 21 neighbors: 0, 26, 15
- Node 22 neighbors: 1, 0, 16, 25
- Node 23 neighbors: 19, 25, 6
- Node 24 neighbors: 5, 16, 7
- Node 25 neighbors: 9, 22, 23
- Node 26 neighbors: 21, 10
- Node 27 neighbors: 1, 28, 3
- Node 28 neighbors: 27, 9, 16, 4, 18
- Node 29 neighbors: 8, 16, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 1, 10, 11, 21, 26
- 3-stars for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
  - Node 1: <1, 15, 22, 27>
  - Node 10: <10, 21, 26, 15>
  - Node 11: <11, 3, 13, 14>
  - Node 21: <21, 0, 26, 15>
  - Node 26: <26, 21, 10, 15>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
