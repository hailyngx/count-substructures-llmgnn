Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 0 (As they need at least 4 neighbors to form a 3-star)
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 3-stars = 5 (4 choose 3)
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 3-stars = 14 (5 choose 3)
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: 3-stars = 4 (6 choose 3)

Total 3-stars = 0 + 5 + 14 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 3, 7>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <7, 8, 9>
