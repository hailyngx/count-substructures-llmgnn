Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. 

First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {7, 8}

Now, we will determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars. <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 4, 8)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 6, 9)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (8, 0, 1)>
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars. <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 2)>, <7, (9, 8, 2)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 1, 8)>
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars. <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 8)>, <8, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 2)>
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the given graph is [50].
