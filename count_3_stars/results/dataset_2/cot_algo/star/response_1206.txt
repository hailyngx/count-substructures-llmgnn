Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9, 6
- Node 1: 7, 3
- Node 2: 4, 7, 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 4, 1, 2, 8
- Node 4: 9, 7, 8, 6, 3, 2
- Node 5: 8, 0
- Node 6: 9, 4, 2, 0
- Node 7: 9, 4, 2, 1
- Node 8: 5, 9, 4, 3, 2
- Node 9: 6, 8, 4, 7, 0

Next, we will identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (9, 7, 8)>
- <8, (5, 9, 4)>
