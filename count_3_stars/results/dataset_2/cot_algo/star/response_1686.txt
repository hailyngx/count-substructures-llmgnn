Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (1, 14) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 4) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 4) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 4) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 13) (4, 14) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {9, 12, 8, 11, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {14}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {12, 8, 13, 0, 4}
- Node 4: {14, 0, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 10}
- Node 6: {9, 10, 2}
- Node 7: {12, 11, 14, 8, 2}
- Node 8: {7, 2, 0, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 10, 0}
- Node 10: {5, 9, 6, 13}
- Node 11: {7, 12, 14, 0}
- Node 12: {7, 0, 11, 3}
- Node 13: {5, 2, 3, 10}
- Node 14: {7, 2, 1, 11, 4}

Now, let's list the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with {9, 8, 12}, {9, 8, 3}, and {12, 0, 11}.
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with {6, 7, 8} and {7, 14, 2}.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with {12, 0, 8}.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with {14, 0, 3}.

Since each 3-star is counted twice in the neighbor sets, we need to divide the total count by 2 to get the actual number of 3-stars. 

The total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (9, 8, 12)>, <0, (9, 8, 3)>, <0, (12, 0, 11)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, and <4, (14, 0, 3)>.
