Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 20) (3, 26) (15, 3) (15, 23) (15, 6) (15, 13) (0, 20) (0, 24) (27, 13) (18, 22) (18, 17) (18, 25) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 5) (7, 16) (7, 24) (7, 23) (21, 24) (5, 22) (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 28) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 1) (10, 1) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 29) (20, 3) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 6) (28, 5) (28, 29) (29, 11) (29, 28) (29, 26) (29, 4) (14, 2) (14, 25) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 20) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 24) (4, 5) (4, 29) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 19) (16, 7) (16, 9) (16, 19) (17, 18) (17, 25) (17, 8) (25, 18) (25, 14) (25, 17) (25, 8) (8, 18) (8, 17) (8, 25) (26, 3) (26, 11) (26, 20) (26, 29) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 13) (19, 12) (19, 16) (19, 2) (19, 13) (23, 15) (23, 7) (24, 0) (24, 7) (24, 21) (24, 1) (13, 15) (13, 27) (13, 2) (13, 19) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges. Then, we will identify the number of 3-stars formed in the graph.

The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {20, 24}
- Node 1: {9, 10, 24}
- Node 2: {13, 14, 19}
- Node 3: {15, 20, 26}
- Node 4: {5, 12, 29}
- Node 5: {4, 9, 22, 28}
- Node 6: {9, 15, 20}
- Node 7: {16, 23, 24}
- Node 8: {17, 18, 25}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 6, 16}
- Node 10: {1}
- Node 11: {22, 26, 29}
- Node 12: {4, 19}
- Node 13: {2, 15, 19, 27}
- Node 14: {2, 25}
- Node 15: {3, 6, 13, 23}
- Node 16: {7, 9, 19}
- Node 17: {8, 18, 25}
- Node 18: {8, 17, 22, 25}
- Node 19: {2, 12, 13, 16}
- Node 20: {0, 3, 6, 26}
- Node 21: {24}
- Node 22: {5, 11, 18}
- Node 23: {7, 15}
- Node 24: {0, 1, 7, 21}
- Node 25: {8, 14, 17}
- Node 26: {3, 11, 20, 29}
- Node 27: {13}
- Node 28: {5, 29}
- Node 29: {4, 11, 26, 28}

Since all nodes with three or more neighbors form potential 3-stars, we need to calculate the total number of 3-stars.

For nodes with three neighbors (of degree 3):
- Node 3 forms 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 22 forms 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 24 forms 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 20 forms 1 unique 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, 15, 20, 26>, <13, 2, 19, 16>, <22, 5, 18, 11>, <26, 3, 11, 29>, <18, 17, 25, 8>, <5, 4, 29, 28>, <24, 0, 1, 7>, <9, 1, 10, 6>, <20, 3, 6, 26>.
