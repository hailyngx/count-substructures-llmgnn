Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 10) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 2) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 2: {0, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 8, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {8, 9, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 7, 11}
- Node 10: {3, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 12: {7, 10}
- Node 13: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 4, 6}

We can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, and 14 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes. 
Let's go through each of them:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars 
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 9, 11)>, 
<3, (5, 10, 11)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 13)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (8, 9, 7)>, 
<5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (8, 7, 13)>, <5, (8, 9, 7)>, <5, (7, 8, 13)>, <6, (1, 10, 11)>, 
<7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 10)>, <7, (9, 10, 12)>, <7, (10, 12, 13)>, <7, (8, 9, 12)>, 
<7, (10, 13, 12)>, <9, (0, 1, 11)>, <9, (1, 11, 6)>, <9, (7, 10, 12)>, <9, (10, 12, 7)>, 
<11, (0, 1, 9)>, <11, (1, 6, 9)>, <11, (0, 3, 9)>, <11, (3, 6, 9)>, <14, (2, 3, 4)>, 
<14, (2, 4, 6)>, <14, (4, 6, 3)>, <14, (3, 6, 2)>.
