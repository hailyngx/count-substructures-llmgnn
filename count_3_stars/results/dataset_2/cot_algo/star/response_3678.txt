Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 3) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 12}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 10}
- Node 3: {0, 10, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 6: {4, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 11}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {3, 7, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {1, 8, 11}
- Node 13: {3, 8, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {3, 5, 9, 10, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get a total of 68 3-stars. So, the final answer is [68].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, 10, 13>, <4, 9, 13>, <5, 9, 14>, <8, 9, 13>, <10, 11, 13>, <3, 9, 14>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 8, 13>, <5, 9, 10>, <4, 9, 14>, <5, 9, 13>, <10, 11, 14>, <11, 13, 14>, <3, 9, 13>, <9, 13, 14>.
