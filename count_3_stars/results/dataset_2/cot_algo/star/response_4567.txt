Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we need to first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars formed:

- Node 1: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (8, 5, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 2)>, <4, (7, 9, 6)>, <4, (8, 9, 5)>, <5, (8, 1, 9)>, <5, (8, 4, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 2)>, <9, (6, 7, 4)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>
