Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and their neighboring nodes:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}

Now, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 \).

Therefore, the final result is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 2, 9>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <1, 3, 8>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <5, 7, 9>
