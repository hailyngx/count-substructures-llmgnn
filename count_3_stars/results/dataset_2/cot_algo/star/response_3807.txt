Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 2) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 13) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 1) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 9) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 16) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 2) (8, 5) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 11) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 17) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 17) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 17) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {14, 7}
- Node 1: {15, 18, 14, 13, 9}
- Node 2: {15, 16, 17}
- Node 3: {6, 9}
- Node 4: {18, 11}
- Node 5: {13, 8, 12}
- Node 6: {3, 18, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {18, 0, 9}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {3, 14, 7, 1}
- Node 10: {15, 12, 16}
- Node 11: {6, 4, 17}
- Node 12: {5, 13, 10, 17}
- Node 13: {5, 6, 12, 1}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 15: {1, 10, 2}
- Node 16: {10, 17, 2}
- Node 17: {16, 12, 2, 11}
- Node 18: {6, 4, 7, 1}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 27
Therefore, the answer is [27], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (15, 13, 9)>, <12, (5, 13, 10)>, <13, (5, 6, 12)>, <15, (1, 10, 2)>, <17, (16, 12, 2)>, <18, (6, 4, 7)>
