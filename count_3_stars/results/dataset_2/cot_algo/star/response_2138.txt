Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 9) (3, 14) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 3: {9, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 5: {1, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 5, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {4, 7, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 12: {2, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {4, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 13}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 

\[ 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 102 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [102].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 14)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 8, 13)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (2, 12, 13)>, <9, (7, 11, 12)>, <12, (8, 9, 10)>, <13, (4, 6, 7)>
