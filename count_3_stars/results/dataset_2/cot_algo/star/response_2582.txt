Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {10, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 11}
- Node 3: {5, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 9, 12}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 10, 12}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {4, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 8, 11}
- Node 10: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 11}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 7, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 have 6 neighbors, so each can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1, 9, 10, 11, 14 have 5 neighbors, so they can't form any 3-stars.
- Node 0, 2, 3, 13 have less than 3 neighbors, so they also can't form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 6 * 6 * 20 = 720

Therefore, the final answer is [720].
