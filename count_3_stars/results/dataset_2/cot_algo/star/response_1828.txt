Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {4, 6, 1, 8, 2}
- Node 1: neighbors {5, 9, 3, 0, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {7, 8, 0}
- Node 3: neighbors {9, 7, 6, 1, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {5, 7, 0}
- Node 5: neighbors {9, 6, 8, 1, 4}
- Node 6: neighbors {5, 3, 0}
- Node 7: neighbors {4, 3, 2}
- Node 8: neighbors {5, 1, 3, 2, 0}
- Node 9: neighbors {5, 3, 1}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 50, and we can list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 8>
