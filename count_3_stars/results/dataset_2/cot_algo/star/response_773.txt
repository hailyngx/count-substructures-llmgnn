Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (9, 21) (9, 14) (9, 20) (9, 1) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 24) (17, 14) (17, 10) (15, 27) (15, 8) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 19) (27, 8) (20, 9) (20, 21) (20, 6) (25, 26) (25, 2) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (6, 20) (6, 1) (6, 3) (21, 9) (21, 20) (21, 28) (21, 29) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 2) (28, 23) (22, 26) (22, 0) (26, 25) (26, 22) (3, 6) (3, 13) (18, 14) (18, 24) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 12) (19, 27) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 16) (2, 15) (2, 25) (2, 28) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 13) (16, 19) (16, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 24) (7, 8) (0, 11) (0, 28) (0, 22) (8, 15) (8, 27) (8, 7) (8, 24) (24, 14) (24, 18) (24, 7) (24, 8) (4, 19) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 23) (29, 21) (29, 23) (23, 14) (23, 28) (23, 13) (23, 29) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 28, 22}
- Node 1: {9, 6, 19, 12}
- Node 2: {15, 25, 28, 12}
- Node 3: {6, 13}
- Node 4: {19}
- Node 5: {11}
- Node 6: {20, 1, 3}
- Node 7: {10, 11, 24, 8}
- Node 8: {15, 27, 7, 24}
- Node 9: {21, 14, 20, 1}
- Node 10: {17, 7}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 0}
- Node 12: {1, 2, 16, 13}
- Node 13: {3, 12, 23}
- Node 14: {9, 17, 18, 23, 24}
- Node 15: {27, 8, 2}
- Node 16: {19, 12}
- Node 17: {14, 10}
- Node 18: {14, 24}
- Node 19: {27, 1, 16, 4}
- Node 20: {9, 21, 6}
- Node 21: {9, 20, 28, 29}
- Node 22: {26, 0}
- Node 23: {14, 28, 13, 29}
- Node 24: {14, 7, 8}
- Node 25: {26, 2}
- Node 26: {25, 22}
- Node 27: {15, 19, 8}
- Node 28: {21, 2, 23, 0}
- Node 29: {21, 23}

Now, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9, Node 12, Node 14, Node 19, Node 21, Node 23, Node 24, and Node 27.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [41].
