Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 21) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 23) (26, 15) (26, 17) (26, 8) (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 27) (5, 14) (7, 29) (7, 1) (21, 9) (21, 28) (21, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 19) (8, 26) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 19) (10, 17) (10, 0) (17, 26) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 23) (17, 2) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 12) (20, 4) (25, 20) (25, 2) (0, 10) (0, 20) (0, 11) (4, 21) (4, 20) (4, 27) (18, 6) (18, 28) (18, 29) (28, 21) (28, 18) (28, 15) (14, 5) (27, 9) (27, 5) (27, 4) (27, 23) (15, 26) (15, 1) (15, 28) (15, 23) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 22) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 27) (23, 15) (23, 6) (22, 19) (22, 11) (16, 17) (24, 12) (24, 2) (29, 7) (29, 18) (12, 20) (12, 24) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 22) (11, 6) (2, 17) (2, 25) (2, 24) (6, 18) (6, 23) (6, 11) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges based on their starting nodes:

- Node 9: {26, 5, 21, 27}
- Node 26: {9, 23, 15, 17, 8}
- Node 5: {9, 11, 27, 14}
- Node 7: {29, 1}
- Node 21: {9, 28, 4}
- Node 1: {7, 3, 15, 19}
- Node 3: {1, 19}
- Node 8: {26, 13}
- Node 13: {8, 19}
- Node 10: {17, 0}
- Node 17: {26, 10, 16, 23, 2}
- Node 20: {25, 0, 12, 4}
- Node 25: {20, 2}
- Node 0: {10, 20, 11}
- Node 4: {21, 20, 27}
- Node 18: {6, 28, 29}
- Node 28: {21, 18, 15}
- Node 14: {5}
- Node 27: {9, 5, 4, 23}
- Node 15: {26, 1, 28, 23}
- Node 19: {1, 3, 13, 22}
- Node 23: {26, 17, 27, 15, 6}
- Node 22: {19, 11}
- Node 16: {17}
- Node 24: {12, 2}
- Node 29: {7, 18}
- Node 12: {20, 24}
- Node 11: {5, 0, 22, 6}
- Node 2: {17, 25, 24}
- Node 6: {18, 23, 11}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <9, (26, 5, 21)>, <9, (26, 5, 27)>, <9, (5, 21, 27)>, <9, (26, 21, 27)>
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <26, (9, 23, 15)>, <26, (9, 23, 17)>, <26, (9, 23, 8)>, <26, (9, 15, 17)>, <26, (9, 15, 8)>, <26, (9, 17, 8)>, <26, (23, 15, 17)>, <26, (23, 15, 8)>, <26, (23, 17, 8)>, <26, (15, 17, 8)>
- The same logic applies to other nodes with 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
4 (from node 9) + 10 (from node 26) + 4 (from node 5) + 0 (from node 7) + 0 (from node 21) + 4 (from node 1) + 0 (from node 3) + 0 (from node 8) + 0 (from node 13) + 0 (from node 10) + 10 (from node 17) + 4 (from node 20) + 0 (from node 25) + 0 (from node 0) + 0 (from node 4) + 0 (from node 18) + 0 (from node 28) + 0 (from node 14) + 4 (from node 27) + 4 (from node 15) + 0 (from node 19) + 10 (from node 23) + 0 (from node 22) + 0 (from node 16) + 0 (from node 24) + 0 (from node 29) + 0 (from node 12) + 4 (from node 11) + 0 (from node 2) + 0 (from node 6) = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].
