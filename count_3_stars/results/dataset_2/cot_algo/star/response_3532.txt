Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 25) (1, 2) (25, 1) (25, 28) (25, 22) (25, 2) (10, 19) (10, 16) (11, 24) (11, 22) (11, 26) (0, 24) (0, 23) (20, 4) (20, 6) (20, 16) (3, 27) (3, 29) (14, 26) (14, 7) (14, 24) (26, 11) (26, 14) (26, 5) (5, 26) (5, 22) (5, 27) (5, 7) (2, 1) (2, 25) (2, 17) (12, 19) (16, 10) (16, 20) (16, 21) (21, 16) (21, 27) (8, 24) (8, 18) (28, 25) (28, 17) (28, 22) (28, 18) (24, 11) (24, 0) (24, 14) (24, 8) (24, 23) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 27) (15, 9) (15, 23) (15, 6) (15, 4) (23, 0) (23, 24) (23, 15) (23, 4) (6, 20) (6, 15) (6, 29) (29, 3) (29, 6) (29, 13) (29, 22) (19, 10) (19, 12) (27, 3) (27, 5) (27, 21) (27, 9) (27, 17) (13, 9) (13, 29) (7, 14) (7, 5) (22, 25) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 28) (22, 29) (17, 2) (17, 28) (17, 27) (4, 20) (4, 15) (4, 23) (18, 8) (18, 28) 

Response:
Given a graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we need to find the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {24, 23}
- Node 1: Neighbors {25, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 25, 17}
- Node 3: Neighbors {27, 29}
- Node 4: Neighbors {20, 15, 23}
- Node 5: Neighbors {26, 22, 27, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {20, 15, 29}
- Node 7: Neighbors {14, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {24, 18}
- Node 9: Neighbors {15, 13, 27}
- Node 10: Neighbors {19, 16}
- Node 11: Neighbors {24, 22, 26}
- Node 12: Neighbors {19}
- Node 13: Neighbors {9, 29}
- Node 14: Neighbors {26, 24, 7}
- Node 15: Neighbors {9, 23, 4, 6}
- Node 16: Neighbors {10, 20, 21}
- Node 17: Neighbors {2, 28, 27}
- Node 18: Neighbors {8, 28}
- Node 19: Neighbors {10, 12}
- Node 20: Neighbors {4, 6, 16}
- Node 21: Neighbors {16, 27}
- Node 22: Neighbors {11, 5, 28, 29}
- Node 23: Neighbors {0, 24, 15, 4}
- Node 24: Neighbors {11, 0, 14, 8, 23}
- Node 25: Neighbors {1, 28, 22}
- Node 26: Neighbors {11, 14, 5}
- Node 27: Neighbors {3, 21, 17, 9, 5}
- Node 28: Neighbors {25, 17, 22, 18}
- Node 29: Neighbors {3, 6, 13, 22}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Node 1: 23 3-stars
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 0 3-stars
- Node 6: 0 3-stars
- Node 7: 0 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 0 3-stars
- Node 10: 0 3-stars
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 0 3-stars
- Node 13: 0 3-stars
- Node 14: 0 3-stars
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 0 3-stars
- Node 17: 0 3-stars
- Node 18: 0 3-stars
- Node 19: 0 3-stars
- Node 20: 0 3-stars
- Node 21: 0 3-stars
- Node 22: 1 3-star
- Node 23: 0 3-stars
- Node 24: 3 3-stars
- Node 25: 1 3-star
- Node 26: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 1 3-star
- Node 28: 0 3-stars
- Node 29: 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 23 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 25, 28>
<2, 17, 28>
<4, 15, 23>
<8, 18, 28>
<11, 22, 29>
<15, 4, 23>
<24, 0, 23>
<24, 8, 18>
<24, 14, 7>
<25, 28, 17>
<26, 11, 14>
<27, 9, 15>
