Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
The 3-star graph can be visualized as follows:

```
   1 -- 7 -- 0 -- 3
   |     |    |     
   9 -- 2 -- 4 -- 8
          |    |    
          5 -- 6
```

Upon examining the given graph, we can determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 also has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 30 3-stars in the given graph: [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- <9, (2, 5, 6)>
