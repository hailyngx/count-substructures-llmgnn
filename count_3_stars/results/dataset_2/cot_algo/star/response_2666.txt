Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: 5, 6, 3, 8, 2, 1
- Node 1: 5, 9, 4, 3, 2
- Node 2: 1, 8, 0
- Node 3: 7, 6, 1, 0, 8
- Node 4: 9, 8, 1, 6
- Node 5: 8, 1, 0
- Node 6: 9, 4, 3, 0
- Node 7: 3, 8
- Node 8: 5, 4, 7, 3, 2, 0
- Node 9: 6, 4, 1

From the given graph, we observe that nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9 have 6 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing these up: 
\[ 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 65 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [65].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
