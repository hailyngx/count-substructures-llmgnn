Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 22) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 25) (9, 6) (22, 4) (22, 23) (22, 29) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 21) (23, 16) (23, 0) (21, 23) (21, 20) (21, 18) (21, 24) (28, 26) (28, 20) (26, 28) (26, 2) (26, 3) (0, 23) (3, 7) (3, 26) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 17) (5, 23) (5, 24) (17, 6) (17, 11) (17, 2) (15, 25) (2, 4) (2, 26) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 25) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 29) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 20) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 16) (20, 21) (20, 28) (20, 14) (12, 29) (12, 1) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 24) (18, 21) (18, 1) (27, 10) (16, 23) (16, 19) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 12) (29, 24) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 18) (25, 6) (25, 22) (25, 15) (25, 2) (13, 11) (13, 19) (24, 21) (24, 5) (24, 10) (24, 29) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {23}
- Node 1: {10, 12, 14, 18}
- Node 2: {4, 10, 17, 25, 26}
- Node 3: {7, 8, 10, 11, 26}
- Node 4: {2, 22}
- Node 5: {23, 24}
- Node 6: {9, 17, 22, 25}
- Node 7: {3, 11}
- Node 8: {3, 8, 14, 29}
- Node 9: {6}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 3, 24, 27}
- Node 11: {7, 13, 17, 3}
- Node 12: {1, 29}
- Node 13: {11, 19}
- Node 14: {1, 8, 19, 20}
- Node 15: {25}
- Node 16: {19, 23}
- Node 17: {2, 6, 11}
- Node 18: {1, 21}
- Node 19: {13, 14, 16}
- Node 20: {14, 21, 28}
- Node 21: {18, 20, 23}
- Node 22: {4, 6, 23, 25, 29}
- Node 23: {0, 5, 16, 21, 22}
- Node 24: {5, 10, 29}
- Node 25: {2, 6, 15, 22}
- Node 26: {2, 3, 28}
- Node 27: {10}
- Node 28: {20, 26}
- Node 29: {12, 22, 24, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Nodes {1, 14, 19, 20} each have 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each of them.
- Nodes {2, 3, 10, 11, 17, 22, 25} each have 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for each of them.
- Nodes {8, 24, 29} each have 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each of them.

Calculating the total number of unique 3-stars:
\[ 4*4 + 7*10 + 3*4 = 16 + 70 + 12 = 98 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [98]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <1, (14, 19, 20)>
- <14, (1, 19, 20)>
- <19, (1, 14, 20)>
- <20, (1, 14, 19)>
- <2, (3, 10, 17)>
- <3, (2, 10, 17)>
- <10, (2, 3, 17)>
- <11, (3, 13, 17)>
- <17, (2, 3, 10)>
- <22, (6, 23, 25)>
- <25, (2, 6, 22)>
- <8, (3, 14, 29)>
- <24, (5, 10, 29)>
- <29, (8, 12, 24)>
