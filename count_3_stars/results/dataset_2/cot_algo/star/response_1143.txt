Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 1}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 0: In total, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars using node 0.
Node 2: In total, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars using node 2.
Node 5: In total, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars using node 5.
Node 7: In total, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars using node 7.
Node 4 and Node 9 each do not form any 3-stars as they only have 4 neighbors each and need at least 3 additional neighbors to form a 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 54 \)

So, the final number of 3-stars is [54].

The unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <5, 6, 7>
