Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges for each node:

Node 0: {7, 3, 5, 2, 9}
Node 1: {4, 3, 6, 5}
Node 2: {3, 6, 0}
Node 3: {1, 9, 2, 5, 0}
Node 4: {8, 9, 1, 6}
Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 0}
Node 6: {4, 1, 5, 2, 8}
Node 7: {0, 9, 8}
Node 8: {4, 7, 6}
Node 9: {4, 7, 3, 0}

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it is part of:

Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Adding these results together gives us a total of 42 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 0>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 8, 7>, <6, 8, 4>, <6, 8, 1>, <6, 9, 7>, <6, 9, 4>, <7, 8, 4>, <7, 8, 6>, <7, 0, 9>.
