Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 21) (29, 2) (29, 27) (29, 11) (1, 3) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (22, 26) (22, 15) (22, 24) (26, 22) (26, 13) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 15) (13, 9) (17, 20) (17, 5) (17, 18) (20, 17) (20, 8) (20, 4) (20, 6) (8, 20) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 23) (9, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 19) (7, 5) (16, 13) (16, 19) (12, 3) (12, 18) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 0) (28, 4) (28, 15) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 6) (10, 6) (10, 24) (10, 25) (5, 17) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 20) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 11) (24, 22) (24, 13) (24, 10) (27, 29) (27, 21) (14, 3) (14, 5) (23, 9) (23, 4) (21, 2) (21, 27) (4, 20) (4, 28) (4, 23) (4, 25) (15, 22) (15, 13) (15, 28) (11, 29) (11, 6) (25, 10) (25, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {9, 19, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 19}
- Node 2: {29, 21}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 14, 12}
- Node 4: {20, 28, 23, 25}
- Node 5: {17, 8, 7, 14}
- Node 6: {20, 0, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {3, 9, 19, 5}
- Node 8: {20, 9, 5}
- Node 9: {13, 8, 7, 23, 0}
- Node 10: {6, 24, 25}
- Node 11: {29, 6}
- Node 12: {3, 18}
- Node 13: {26, 16, 24, 15, 9}
- Node 14: {3, 5}
- Node 15: {22, 13, 28}
- Node 16: {13, 19}
- Node 17: {20, 5, 18}
- Node 18: {17, 12, 19}
- Node 19: {1, 7, 16, 18, 0}
- Node 20: {17, 8, 4, 6}
- Node 21: {2, 27}
- Node 22: {26, 15, 24}
- Node 23: {9, 4}
- Node 24: {22, 13, 10}
- Node 25: {10, 4}
- Node 26: {22, 13}
- Node 27: {29, 21}
- Node 28: {4, 15}

Next, let's identify any nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: [3 stars]
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) [4 stars]
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) [4 stars]
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) [4 stars]
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) [4 stars]
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: [3 stars]
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) [10 stars]
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) [10 stars]
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: [3 stars]
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: [3 stars]
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: [3 stars]
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) [10 stars]
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) [4 stars]
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: [3 stars]
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors: [3 stars]

Summing up the total number of unique 3-stars, we get 58, therefore the answer is [58].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 9, 19>, <0, 6, 20>, <0, 19, 1>, <0, 19, 18>, <4, 20, 6>, <4, 20, 23>, <4, 20, 6>, <4, 20, 25>, <5, 17, 8>, <5, 17, 18>, <5, 17, 8>, <5, 17, 14>, <6, 10, 24>, <6, 11, 29>, <7, 3, 1>, <7, 3, 14>, <7, 3, 12>, <7, 3, 18>, <8, 5, 17>, <8, 5, 14>, <8, 9, 13>, <9, 13, 26>, <9, 13, 16>, <9, 13, 24>, <9, 13, 15>, <15, 22, 13>, <15, 28, 4>, <19, 1, 3>, <19, 1, 16>, <19, 1, 18>, <19, 1, 0>, <19, 7, 3>, <19, 7, 18>, <19, 16, 13>, <19, 18, 12>, <20, 17, 5>, <20, 17, 14>, <20, 4, 23>, <20, 4, 25>
