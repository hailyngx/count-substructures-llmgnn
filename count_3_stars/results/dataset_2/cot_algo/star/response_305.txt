Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can determine the total number of 3-stars formed.

Let's first list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 66.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [66].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
