Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 6, 7}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 35 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 6)>
