Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 3) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 18) (13, 10) (13, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 16) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 2) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 16) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 18) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 16) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 3) (15, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 15) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 14, 2}
- Node 1: {17, 7, 16}
- Node 2: {5, 0, 19, 15}
- Node 3: {9, 17, 18}
- Node 4: {9, 8, 16}
- Node 5: {9, 0, 17, 14, 2}
- Node 6: {9, 10, 8}
- Node 7: {12, 1}
- Node 8: {6, 4, 13, 19, 18}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 18, 3, 4}
- Node 10: {6, 11, 13}
- Node 11: {10, 12}
- Node 12: {11, 7}
- Node 13: {10, 8}
- Node 14: {5, 0}
- Node 15: {2}
- Node 16: {4, 1, 19}
- Node 17: {5, 3, 1}
- Node 18: {9, 8, 3}
- Node 19: {8, 2, 16}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with {0, 14, 2}
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with {6, 4, 19}
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with {6, 18, 4}
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with {3, 1, 5}
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with {0, 19, 15}
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with {16, 1, 8}

Counting the 3-stars we found, we get a total of 6. So, the final answer is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (0, 14, 2)>, <8, (6, 4, 19)>, <9, (6, 18, 4)>, <17, (3, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 19, 15)>, <4, (16, 1, 8)>
