Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find all the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 7, 1, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {8, 6, 0, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 8, 9, 3, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 8, 6, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8, 0, 3, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 7, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 2, 0, 9, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 2, 9, 5, 3, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8, 2, 0, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 4 neighbors
- Node 1, 4 neighbors
- Node 2, 5 neighbors
- Node 3, 4 neighbors
- Node 7, 5 neighbors
- Node 8, 6 neighbors
- Node 9, 4 neighbors

Now, we sum up the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
\[ \sum_{i=0}^{6} \binom{n_i}{3} = \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 56\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <2, 4, 3>
- <2, 8, 9>
- <2, 8, 3>
- <2, 9, 3>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 4, 2>
- <7, 1, 8>
- <7, 1, 0>
- <7, 1, 6>
- <7, 1, 9>
- <7, 2, 9>
- <8, 4, 3>
- <8, 4, 2>
- <8, 4, 9>
- <8, 5, 3>
- <8, 5, 1>
- <8, 5, 9>
- <8, 2, 9>
- <8, 2, 3>
- <8, 9, 3>
- <9, 2, 7>
- <9, 0, 7>
- <9, 0, 1>
