Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 27) (9, 7) (9, 27) (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 18) (12, 26) (27, 6) (27, 9) (27, 26) (10, 23) (10, 28) (10, 20) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 26) (21, 4) (28, 10) (28, 21) (28, 24) (19, 8) (19, 22) (19, 25) (26, 12) (26, 27) (26, 21) (26, 16) (7, 9) (7, 25) (7, 29) (25, 19) (25, 7) (3, 21) (3, 13) (11, 2) (11, 29) (23, 10) (23, 5) (23, 0) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 29) (2, 6) (2, 11) (22, 14) (22, 19) (22, 16) (24, 28) (24, 8) (24, 18) (24, 20) (1, 29) (1, 16) (1, 5) (29, 7) (29, 11) (29, 8) (29, 1) (5, 23) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 20) (16, 26) (16, 22) (16, 1) (16, 4) (0, 23) (0, 5) (0, 18) (13, 3) (13, 20) (18, 6) (18, 17) (18, 24) (18, 0) (20, 10) (20, 24) (20, 5) (20, 13) (4, 21) (4, 5) (4, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: {5, 18, 23}
- Node 1: {5, 16, 29}
- Node 2: {6, 11}
- Node 3: {13, 21}
- Node 4: {5, 16, 21}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 20, 23, 1}
- Node 6: {2, 18, 27}
- Node 7: {9, 25, 29}
- Node 8: {14, 17, 19, 24, 29}
- Node 9: {7, 27}
- Node 10: {20, 23, 28}
- Node 11: {2, 29}
- Node 12: {26}
- Node 13: {3, 20}
- Node 14: {8, 17, 22}
- Node 16: {1, 4, 21, 22, 26}
- Node 17: {8, 14, 18}
- Node 18: {0, 6, 17, 24}
- Node 19: {8, 22, 25}
- Node 20: {5, 10, 13, 24}
- Node 21: {3, 4, 16, 26, 28}
- Node 22: {14, 16, 19}
- Node 23: {0, 5, 10}
- Node 24: {8, 18, 20, 28}
- Node 25: {7, 19}
- Node 26: {12, 16, 21, 27}
- Node 27: {6, 9, 26}
- Node 28: {10, 21, 24}
- Node 29: {1, 7, 8, 11}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with {0, 20, 1}.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with {24, 29, 19}.
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with {1, 4, 22}.
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with {24, 0, 17}.
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with {10, 13, 24}.
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with {3, 28, 26}.
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with {10, 18, 28}.
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with {16, 21, 27}.
- Node 29 forms a 3-star with {8, 1, 7}.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 8, and they are:
<5, 0, 20, 1>, <8, 24, 29, 19>, <16, 1, 4, 22>, <18, 24, 0, 17>, <20, 10, 13, 24>, <21, 3, 28, 26>, <24, 10, 18, 28>, <26, 16, 21, 27>.

So, the final answer is [8].
