Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 25) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 23) (15, 21) (15, 12) (21, 15) (21, 17) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 24) (13, 28) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 17) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 22) (20, 4) (25, 9) (25, 20) (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 29) (3, 18) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 5) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 27) (28, 13) (28, 16) (28, 18) (28, 23) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 4) (19, 10) (19, 6) (19, 0) (6, 19) (6, 14) (6, 4) (24, 8) (24, 13) (24, 29) (23, 26) (23, 28) (23, 29) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 6) (14, 2) (7, 20) (7, 1) (7, 17) (29, 3) (29, 16) (29, 24) (29, 23) (29, 4) (22, 20) (22, 27) (27, 9) (27, 16) (27, 22) (17, 21) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 20) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 29) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 28) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {3, 19}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 20, 26}
- Node 2: {6, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 12, 18, 29}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 20, 29}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 12}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 14, 19}
- Node 7: {1, 17, 20}
- Node 8: {10, 13, 24}
- Node 9: {25, 26, 27}
- Node 10: {2, 8, 11, 19}
- Node 11: {10, 17}
- Node 12: {3, 5, 15}
- Node 13: {8, 24, 28}
- Node 14: {2, 6}
- Node 15: {12, 21}
- Node 16: {3, 27, 28, 29}
- Node 17: {7, 11, 21}
- Node 18: {3, 28}
- Node 19: {6, 10}
- Node 20: {1, 4, 7, 22, 25}
- Node 21: {15, 17}
- Node 22: {20, 27}
- Node 23: {26, 28, 29}
- Node 24: {8, 13, 29}
- Node 25: {9, 20}
- Node 26: {1, 9, 23}
- Node 27: {16, 22, 27}
- Node 28: {13, 16, 18, 23}
- Node 29: {3, 4, 16, 23, 24}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 7, Node 10, Node 20, and Node 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 33 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (5, 7, 20)>, <4, (5, 6, 20)>, <7, (1, 17, 20)>, <10, (2, 11, 19)>, <20, (1, 22, 25)>, <29, (4, 23, 24)>,
