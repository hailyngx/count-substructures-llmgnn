Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {9, 4, 7, 8, 1}
- Node 1 neighbors: {6, 9, 7, 5}
- Node 2 neighbors: {6, 4}
- Node 3 neighbors: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 4 neighbors: {6, 9, 7, 0, 5, 2}
- Node 5 neighbors: {4, 1}
- Node 6 neighbors: {9, 1, 3, 2, 4}
- Node 7 neighbors: {9, 4, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 8 neighbors: {9, 0, 3}
- Node 9 neighbors: {6, 8, 4, 1, 7, 0}

Applying the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 31

Thus, the final answer is [31].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (6, 9, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 2)>
<7, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (8, 1, 7)>
