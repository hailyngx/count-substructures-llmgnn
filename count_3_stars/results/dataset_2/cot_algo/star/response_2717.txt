Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
   1 --- 3 --- 9 --- 0 --- 2
   |     |     |     |     |
   4 --- 8 --- 5 --- 7 --- 6
```

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 has neighbors {9, 2, 8, 7, 4, 6}. There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars including node 0.

2. Node 1 has neighbors {3, 4, 8}. There is 1 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (3, 4, 8)>.

3. Node 2 has neighbors {0, 6, 7, 4}. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars including node 2.

4. Node 3 has neighbors {9, 1, 4}. There is 1 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (1, 9, 4)>.

5. Node 4 has neighbors {9, 1, 3, 2, 0}. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars including node 4.

6. Node 5 has neighbors {9, 8, 7}. There is 1 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (9, 8, 7)>.

7. Node 6 has neighbors {2, 0, 7}. There is 1 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (2, 0, 7)>.

8. Node 7 has neighbors {5, 2, 8, 0, 6}. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars including node 7.

9. Node 8 has neighbors {5, 1, 0, 7}. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars including node 8.

10. Node 9 has neighbors {5, 4, 3, 0}. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars including node 9.

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we get a total of 46 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [46].
