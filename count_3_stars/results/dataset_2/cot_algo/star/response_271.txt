Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 7}

Now, we need to check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors to potentially form a 3-star. Nodes 1, 3, and 9 have 6 neighbors each, while nodes 0, 4, 6, and 7 have 5 neighbors each. 

For nodes with 6 neighbors (1, 3, 9), we apply \( \binom{6}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

For nodes with 5 neighbors (0, 4, 6, 7), they do not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 20 + 20 + 20 = 60

Thus, the final answer is [60], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 4, 6, 8>
- <1, 4, 6, 9>
- <1, 4, 7, 9>
- <1, 6, 7, 9>
- <3, 0, 6, 7>
- <3, 1, 6, 7>
- <3, 1, 6, 8>
- <3, 1, 7, 9>
- <3, 6, 7, 9>
- <9, 1, 4, 6>
- <9, 1, 4, 7>
- <9, 1, 6, 7>
- <9, 3, 0, 7>
- <9, 3, 1, 7>
