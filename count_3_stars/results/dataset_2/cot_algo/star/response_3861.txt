Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\)
- Node 1: There are exactly 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 2: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\)
- Node 5: There are exactly 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 8: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\)

Adding these up: 20 + 20 + 20 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
