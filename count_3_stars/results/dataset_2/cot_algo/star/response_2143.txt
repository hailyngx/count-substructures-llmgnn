Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 25) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 24) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 19) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 3) (23, 22) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 20) (4, 17) (4, 26) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 29) (26, 4) (26, 28) (26, 11) (26, 0) (28, 26) (28, 8) (28, 13) (17, 4) (17, 2) (20, 4) (20, 1) (20, 14) (20, 24) (3, 22) (3, 21) (21, 3) (21, 24) (7, 9) (25, 15) (25, 19) (25, 11) (6, 10) (6, 11) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 28) (11, 26) (11, 25) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 24) (14, 5) (14, 20) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (24, 5) (24, 20) (24, 21) (24, 11) (24, 13) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 19) (0, 26) (1, 20) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 12) (29, 18) (29, 16) (29, 13) (29, 12) (13, 28) (13, 24) (13, 29) (19, 9) (19, 25) (19, 2) (19, 1) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 16) (16, 18) (16, 29) (16, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 29) 

Response:
Looking at the given graph, we can determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {26}
- Node 1: {10, 12, 19, 20}
- Node 2: {5, 17, 19}
- Node 3: {21, 22}
- Node 4: {17, 18, 20, 22, 26}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 14, 24}
- Node 6: {10, 11}
- Node 7: {8, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 28}
- Node 9: {7, 8, 19, 25}
- Node 10: {1, 6, 14, 16}
- Node 11: {6, 14, 24, 25, 26}
- Node 12: {1, 29}
- Node 13: {10, 24, 28, 29}
- Node 14: {5, 10, 11, 12, 20}
- Node 15: {25}
- Node 16: {10, 29}
- Node 17: {2, 4}
- Node 18: {4, 16, 29}
- Node 19: {1, 2, 9, 25}
- Node 20: {1, 4, 14, 24}
- Node 21: {3, 24}
- Node 22: {3, 4, 23}
- Node 23: {22}
- Node 24: {5, 11, 13, 14, 20, 21}
- Node 25: {9, 11, 15, 19}
- Node 26: {4, 11, 0, 28}
- Node 28: {8, 13, 26}
- Node 29: {12, 13, 16, 18}

Now we need to find the 3-stars in the graph. By enumerating all the 3-stars, we find the following unique ones:

- <4, 17, 18>
- <3, 21, 24>
- <1, 12, 29>
- <1, 19, 20>
- <1, 10, 14>
- <26, 11, 28>
- <26, 4, 22>
- <24, 11, 14>
- <24, 5, 20>
- <29, 12, 13>
- <16, 10, 29>

Summing up the total number of unique 3-stars, we have a total of [11].
