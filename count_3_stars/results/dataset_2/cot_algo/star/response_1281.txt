Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 11) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 6, 8, 13
Node 1: 2, 8, 10, 13, 14
Node 2: 1, 4, 13
Node 3: 4, 7, 8, 11, 14
Node 4: 2, 3, 12
Node 5: 7, 9, 10, 12, 13
Node 6: 0, 11, 12
Node 7: 3, 5, 8, 9, 11
Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 7, 9
Node 9: 5, 7, 8, 11
Node 10: 1, 5, 12
Node 11: 3, 6, 7, 9, 12
Node 12: 4, 6, 10, 11, 5
Node 13: 1, 2, 5, 8
Node 14: 1, 3

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors: Nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, they form 1 unique 3-star each. 
For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to count the number of unique 3-stars.
Since nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13 have 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 79

So, the final answer is [79], and the unique 3-stars found are:
