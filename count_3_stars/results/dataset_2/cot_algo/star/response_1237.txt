Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 8, 9}
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 6, 8}

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2, so the final answer is [2]. 
Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <5, (1, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 6, 8)>
