Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 7) (2, 13) (2, 20) (18, 27) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 17) (28, 8) (28, 6) (28, 1) (28, 12) (9, 22) (9, 12) (9, 24) (9, 14) (22, 9) (22, 0) (22, 25) (3, 27) (3, 5) (11, 13) (11, 19) (11, 15) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 21) (27, 18) (27, 3) (27, 21) (27, 5) (1, 28) (1, 25) (1, 24) (15, 8) (15, 11) (15, 10) (10, 15) (10, 23) (10, 5) (21, 6) (21, 4) (21, 27) (21, 23) (17, 6) (17, 0) (19, 11) (19, 4) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 29) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 20) (12, 28) (12, 9) (12, 16) (12, 29) (29, 7) (29, 12) (29, 25) (0, 22) (0, 17) (0, 25) (0, 23) (20, 2) (20, 16) (23, 10) (23, 21) (23, 0) (25, 13) (25, 22) (25, 1) (25, 29) (25, 0) (14, 9) (14, 24) (24, 9) (24, 4) (24, 1) (24, 14) (5, 3) (5, 27) (5, 10) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {22, 23, 25, 17}
- Node 1: {24, 25, 28}
- Node 2: {13, 20}
- Node 3: {5, 27}
- Node 4: {19, 21, 24}
- Node 5: {3, 10, 27}
- Node 6: {17, 21, 28}
- Node 7: {13, 16, 29}
- Node 8: {13, 15, 28}
- Node 9: {12, 14, 22, 24}
- Node 10: {5, 15, 23}
- Node 11: {13, 15, 19}
- Node 12: {9, 16, 28, 29}
- Node 13: {2, 7, 8, 11, 25}
- Node 14: {9, 24}
- Node 15: {8, 10, 11}
- Node 16: {7, 12, 20}
- Node 17: {0, 6}
- Node 18: {27}
- Node 19: {4, 11}
- Node 20: {2, 16}
- Node 21: {4, 6, 27, 23}
- Node 22: {0, 9, 25}
- Node 23: {0, 10, 21}
- Node 24: {4, 9, 14, 1}
- Node 25: {0, 13, 22, 29, 1}
- Node 27: {3, 5, 18, 21}
- Node 28: {1, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 29: {7, 12, 25}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 13, with 5 neighbors, forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8, with 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21, with 4 neighbors, forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12, with 4 neighbors, forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25, with 5 neighbors, forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 29. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <8, 13, 25>
- <13, 25, 29>
- <13, 2, 7>
- <13, 2, 8>
- <13, 7, 29>
- <13, 7, 25>
- <8, 13, 11>
- <8, 15, 11>
- <8, 15, 13>
- <8, 13, 28>
- <21, 23, 0>
- <21, 23, 10>
- <21, 27, 5>
- <21, 27, 3>
- <12, 28, 1>
- <12, 28, 6>
- <12, 29, 7>
- <12, 9, 24>
- <25, 1, 24>
- <25, 1, 28>
- <25, 0, 22>
- <25, 0, 23>
- <25, 0, 14>
- <25, 29, 7>
- <11, 19, 4>
- <11, 15, 10>
- <11, 15, 8>
- <12, 16, 20>
- <12, 16, 7>
