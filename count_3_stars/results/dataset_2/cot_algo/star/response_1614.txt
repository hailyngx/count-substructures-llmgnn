Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 12) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 0) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 1: {9, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 6: {0, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 6, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 5, 11}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 5, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {1, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 6, 7}

Next, we identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed. Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 8, 11)>, <0, (6, 8, 11)>, <0, (8, 11, 4)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed. Unique 3-stars: <1, (9, 12, 13)>, <1, (9, 13, 14)>, <1, (12, 13, 14)>, <1, (13, 14, 9)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed. Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (8, 9, 3)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed. Unique 3-stars: <3, (2, 7, 14)>, <3, (2, 10, 13)>, <3, (7, 10, 14)>, <3, (10, 13, 2)>
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed. Unique 3-stars: <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 10)>, <5, (2, 9, 10)>, <5, (8, 9, 10)>, <5, (8, 9, 11)>, <5, (8, 10, 11)>, <5, (9, 10, 11)>, <5, (9, 10, 13)>, <5, (9, 11, 13)>, <5, (10, 11, 13)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed. Unique 3-stars: <7, (3, 6, 14)>, <7, (4, 6, 14)>, <7, (4, 6, 7)>, <7, (4, 7, 14)>
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed. Unique 3-stars: <8, (4, 5, 11)>, <8, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 11, 5)>, <8, (5, 11, 8)>, <8, (5, 11, 10)>, <8, (5, 8, 10)>, <8, (11, 10, 5)>, <8, (11, 10, 12)>, <8, (11, 5, 12)>, <8, (10, 5, 12)>
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed. Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 13, 14)>, <9, (1, 13, 9)>, <9, (1, 14, 13)>, <9, (13, 14, 9)>, <9, (13, 14, 10)>, <9, (13, 9, 10)>, <9, (14, 9, 10)>, <9, (14, 10, 1)>, <9, (14, 10, 13)>, <9, (10, 1, 13)>
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed. Unique 3-stars: <11, (0, 6, 8)>, <11, (0, 6, 11)>, <11, (0, 8, 6)>, <11, (6, 8, 11)>, <11, (6, 8, 14)>, <11, (6, 11, 14)>, <11, (8, 14, 11)>, <11, (8, 14, 0)>, <11, (8, 11, 0)>, <11, (14, 11, 0)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars formed: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].
