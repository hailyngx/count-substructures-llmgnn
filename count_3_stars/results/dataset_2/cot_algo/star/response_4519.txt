Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 7) (9, 23) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 22) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 21) (27, 18) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 19) (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 8) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 19) (4, 21) (8, 25) (8, 4) (8, 17) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 28) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 18) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 24) (21, 27) (21, 4) (21, 23) (14, 20) (14, 26) (14, 24) (26, 14) (26, 15) (26, 6) (26, 12) (3, 28) (3, 19) (28, 2) (28, 3) (6, 26) (6, 22) (6, 15) (22, 0) (22, 4) (22, 6) (16, 20) (16, 1) (16, 24) (16, 29) (24, 7) (24, 14) (24, 16) (24, 18) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 3) (15, 26) (15, 6) (15, 13) (29, 27) (29, 16) (29, 12) (23, 9) (23, 17) (23, 21) (12, 26) (12, 29) (13, 15) (18, 27) (18, 17) (18, 24) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 7, 22, 27}
- Node 1: {16, 17}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 28}
- Node 3: {19, 28}
- Node 4: {8, 19, 21, 22}
- Node 5: {2, 11}
- Node 6: {15, 22, 26}
- Node 7: {0, 9, 10, 11, 24}
- Node 8: {4, 17, 25}
- Node 9: {7, 11, 23}
- Node 10: {7}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 19}
- Node 12: {26, 29}
- Node 13: {15}
- Node 14: {20, 24, 26}
- Node 15: {6, 13, 26}
- Node 16: {1, 20, 24, 29}
- Node 17: {1, 8, 18, 19, 23}
- Node 18: {17, 24, 27}
- Node 19: {3, 4, 11, 17}
- Node 20: {14, 16, 25}
- Node 21: {4, 23, 27}
- Node 22: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 23: {9, 17, 21}
- Node 24: {7, 14, 16, 18}
- Node 25: {8, 20}
- Node 26: {6, 12, 14, 15}
- Node 27: {0, 18, 21, 29}
- Node 28: {2, 3}
- Node 29: {12, 16, 27}

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 4, Node 7, Node 17, Node 26, Node 27, Node 29

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 37 \)

Therefore, the final answer is: [37]

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 7, 22)>
- <4, (8, 19, 21)>
- <7, (9, 11, 24)>
- <17, (8, 18, 23)>
- <26, (6, 14, 15)>
- <27, (0, 18, 21)>
- <29, (12, 16, 27)>
