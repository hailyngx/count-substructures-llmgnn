Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 12) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 14) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 10) (12, 0) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 7) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 13, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 11, 10, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 13, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 14, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 13, 10}
- Node 5: {6, 2, 11, 10, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 10, 3, 2, 11}
- Node 7: {13, 5, 2, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {9, 1, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 14, 13}
- Node 10: {6, 1, 5, 4}
- Node 11: {6, 1, 5, 7}
- Node 12: {0}
- Node 13: {9, 4, 2, 0, 7}
- Node 14: {9, 3, 7}

Now, we can see that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 

- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 7
- Node 8
- Node 9
- Node 13

We can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 77

Therefore, there are 77 3-stars in this graph. 

Unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 8, 13>, <1, 3, 11>, <1, 3, 10>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 11, 10>, <2, 6, 11>, <2, 6, 5>, <2, 6, 10>, <2, 6, 3>, <2, 5, 11>, <2, 5, 10>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 14>, <3, 4, 10>, <5, 6, 10>, <7, 13, 14>, <8, 9, 13>, <9, 13, 14>
