Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 13) (15, 17) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 13) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 9) (17, 11) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 1) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 11) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 9) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 1) (18, 6) (4, 16) (4, 10) (9, 17) (9, 12) (9, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph with their respective neighbors are listed below:

- Node 0: {1, 7, 12, 16}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 18}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 3: {13, 15, 18}
- Node 4: {10, 16}
- Node 5: Not enough neighbors
- Node 6: {1, 2, 11, 18}
- Node 7: {0, 12}
- Node 8: {2, 16}
- Node 9: {11, 12, 17}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 13}
- Node 11: {6, 9, 14, 17}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 7, 9, 19}
- Node 13: {3, 10, 14, 15}
- Node 14: {11, 13, 17}
- Node 15: {3, 13, 17}
- Node 16: {0, 4, 8, 19}
- Node 17: {9, 11, 14, 15}
- Node 18: {1, 3, 6, 19}
- Node 19: {12, 16, 18}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 forms 1 3-star. <2, (6, 10, 12)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star. <6, (1, 2, 18)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star. <9, (11, 12, 17)>
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star. <11, (6, 9, 17)>
- Node 12 forms 3 3-stars. <12, (0, 2, 7)>, <12, (2, 9, 19)>, <12, (7, 9, 19)>
- Node 13 forms 4 3-stars. <13, (3, 10, 14)>, <13, (3, 14, 15)>, <13, (10, 14, 15)>, <13, (14, 15, 17)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star. <14, (11, 13, 17)>
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star. <16, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star. <17, (9, 11, 14)>
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star. <18, (1, 3, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars = 14, so the final answer is [14].
