Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node.

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 2, 7}
- Node 1: {9, 4, 2, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 0, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {5, 4, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 4, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 8, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {6, 0, 1}
- Node 8: {6, 4}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 2, 1}

Now, we look at nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each:

- Node 0: 3-stars formed = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 1: 3-stars formed = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 2: 3-stars formed = C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 4: 3-stars formed = C(7, 3) = 35
- Node 5: 3-stars formed = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 6: 3-stars formed = C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 9: 3-stars formed = C(4, 3) = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 35 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 71

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [71].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 5, 6, 2>
<1, 9, 4, 2>
<2, 9, 4, 0>
<4, 5, 6, 8>
<5, 9, 4, 0>
<6, 9, 7, 8>
<9, 5, 6, 2>
