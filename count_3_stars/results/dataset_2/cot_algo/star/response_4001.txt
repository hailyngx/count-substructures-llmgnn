Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 12) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {6, 9, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {11, 8, 12}
- Node 2: {9, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 10, 0, 13}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 14, 3}
- Node 5: {0, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 14, 7, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {6, 4, 3}
- Node 8: {10, 2, 1}
- Node 9: {6, 14, 10, 13, 0, 2}
- Node 10: {9, 11, 3, 8}
- Node 11: {10, 14, 1, 13}
- Node 12: {2, 5, 1}
- Node 13: {9, 11, 2, 3}
- Node 14: {6, 9, 4, 11, 5}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 67

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [67]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (6, 9, 3)>
<2, (9, 8, 12)>
<3, (4, 7, 10)>
<4, (6, 7, 14)>
<6, (9, 14, 7)>
<9, (6, 14, 7)>
<10, (9, 11, 3)>
<12, (2, 5, 1)>
<13, (9, 11, 2)>
<14, (6, 9, 4)>
