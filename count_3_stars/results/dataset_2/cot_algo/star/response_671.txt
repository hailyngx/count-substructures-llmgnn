Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 6, 9, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 9, 3, 4, 8, 7
- Node 2: 6, 9, 4, 8
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 9, 1, 0, 2
- Node 5: 6, 3, 8, 0
- Node 6: 9, 5, 2, 8, 0
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 6, 1, 5, 2, 0
- Node 9: 6, 4, 2, 1, 0

Now let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: 5, 8, 6 (<0, 5, 8, 6>), 4, 9, 6 (<0, 4, 9, 6>)
- Node 1: 4, 9, 1 (<1, 4, 9>), 8, 7, 1 (<1, 8, 7>)
- Node 2: 9, 6, 2 (<2, 9, 6>), 4, 8, 2 (<2, 4, 8>)
- Node 3: No 3-stars can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: 9, 1, 4 (<4, 9, 1>), 2, 8, 4 (<4, 2, 8>), 0, 6, 4 (<4, 0, 6>)
- Node 5: 8, 0, 5 (<5, 8, 0>), 3, 6, 5 (<5, 3, 6>)
- Node 6: 5, 8, 6 (<6, 5, 8>), 0, 4, 6 (<6, 0, 4>), 2, 9, 6 (<6, 2, 9>)
- Node 7: No 3-stars can be formed as it has no valid neighbors.
- Node 8: 0, 5, 8 (<8, 0, 5>), 1, 4, 8 (<8, 1, 4>), 2, 6, 8 (<8, 2, 6>)
- Node 9: 6, 4, 9 (<9, 6, 4>), 1, 2, 9 (<9, 1, 2>), 0, 6, 9 (<9, 0, 6>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
