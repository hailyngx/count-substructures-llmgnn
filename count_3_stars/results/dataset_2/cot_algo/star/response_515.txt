Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 15) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 8) (15, 6) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 16) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 7) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 1) (12, 17) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 19) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 14) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 14) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 19) (2, 19) (2, 14) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 2) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 16) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 2) (10, 4) (18, 0) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 18
- Node 1: 0, 7, 16
- Node 2: 14, 19
- Node 3: 8, 11, 15, 17
- Node 4: 10, 11, 19
- Node 5: 6, 9, 11, 13
- Node 6: 5, 14, 15
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 3, 9, 14, 15
- Node 9: 5, 8, 17
- Node 10: 4
- Node 11: 3, 4, 5, 14
- Node 12: 17
- Node 13: 5, 15, 19
- Node 14: 2, 6, 8, 11
- Node 15: 3, 6, 8, 13, 16
- Node 16: 1, 15, 17, 19
- Node 17: 3, 9, 12, 16
- Node 18: 0
- Node 19: 2, 4, 13, 16

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors from the list above:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 11, 13, 16
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: none

For each node with 3 neighbors, we can form a 3-star. Let's calculate the number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3, and we represent this as [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<11, 4, 14>
<13, 5, 15>
<16, 1, 17>
