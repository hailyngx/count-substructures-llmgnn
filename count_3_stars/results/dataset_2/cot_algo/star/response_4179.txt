Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 11) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 4) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 4) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 17) (16, 4) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (6, 13) (6, 1) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 15) (18, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 17) (9, 15) (9, 10) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 9) (17, 8) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 15) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be found by calculating the number of 3-stars centered at each node with three or more neighbors.

Let's start by listing the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 2 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 5 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 1 neighbor
- Node 17: 5 neighbors
- Node 18: 1 neighbor
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: 1 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of \( 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 58 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (6, 10, 13)>
- <2, (4, 12, 17)>
- <4, (2, 5, 15)>
- <5, (7, 11, 17)>
