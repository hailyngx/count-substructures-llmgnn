Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 6, 2, 7, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 0, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 1, 7, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 9, 1, 2, 0}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 4, 3, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 1, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 1, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 8, 4, 0}

Now, let's list the 3-star configurations:
1. Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 9, 0)>
   - Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (5, 4, 3)>
   - Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (9, 1, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have 3 unique configurations, so the final answer is [3].
