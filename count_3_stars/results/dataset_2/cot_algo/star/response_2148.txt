Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 3}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {6, 1, 0, 2, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 0, 1}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {7, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 7, 6, 1, 3}
- Node 9: {8, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 52 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- <6, (2, 7, 8)>
