Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 6) (7, 12) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 16) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 9) (14, 16) (4, 19) (4, 13) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 17) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 14) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 3) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 13) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 15) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 3) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 17) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 15) (1, 10) (17, 18) (17, 9) (17, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 17) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {16, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {10}
- Node 2: {12, 5, 6, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 13, 5}
- Node 4: {19, 13}
- Node 5: {11, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {11, 2, 3}
- Node 7: {12, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 0, 17}
- Node 9: {0, 14, 15, 17}
- Node 10: {11, 1, 19}
- Node 11: {10, 18, 5, 6}
- Node 12: {7, 2, 16}
- Node 13: {4, 3, 15}
- Node 14: {9, 16}
- Node 15: {18, 19, 9, 13}
- Node 16: {12, 0, 14}
- Node 17: {18, 9, 8}
- Node 18: {11, 15, 17}
- Node 19: {10, 4, 15}

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars around them:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 15, Node 16, and Node 17 have 3 or more neighbors, so we'll calculate 3-stars for them.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 5: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 10: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 11: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 15: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 16: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 17: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (16, 8, 9)>
- <2, (12, 5, 6)>
- <2, (12, 5, 3)>
- <2, (12, 6, 3)>
- <2, (5, 6, 3)>
- <3, (2, 6, 13)>
- <3, (2, 6, 5)>
- <3, (2, 3, 5)>
- <5, (11, 2, 6)>
- <5, (11, 2, 3)>
- <6, (11, 2, 3)>
- <9, (14, 15, 17)>
- <10, (11, 19, 15)>
- <11, (18, 15, 17)>
- <15, (18, 19, 13)>
- <16, (0, 14, 12)>
- <17, (18, 9, 8)>
