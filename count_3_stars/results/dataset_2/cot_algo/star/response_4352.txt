Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 14) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 23) (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 18) (1, 26) (1, 11) (1, 4) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 0) (23, 27) (23, 22) (23, 9) (14, 15) (14, 4) (17, 2) (0, 27) (0, 22) (2, 17) (2, 29) (2, 10) (2, 25) (29, 27) (29, 2) (29, 12) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 8) (12, 29) (12, 13) (12, 9) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 20) (21, 28) (21, 13) (28, 15) (28, 21) (28, 9) (28, 19) (13, 12) (13, 21) (13, 11) (24, 26) (24, 5) (24, 10) (24, 19) (25, 2) (25, 8) (25, 18) (18, 3) (18, 25) (18, 9) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 20) (6, 3) (6, 22) (6, 7) (19, 28) (19, 24) (19, 11) (19, 10) (9, 23) (9, 12) (9, 28) (9, 18) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 19) (11, 4) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 16) (10, 2) (10, 24) (10, 19) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 7) (8, 25) (5, 24) (5, 16) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {27, 22}
- Node 1: {26, 11, 4}
- Node 2: {17, 29, 25}
- Node 3: {6, 16, 18}
- Node 4: {1, 14, 11}
- Node 5: {24, 16}
- Node 6: {3, 22, 7}
- Node 7: {20, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {25, 7}
- Node 9: {23, 12, 28, 18}
- Node 10: {2, 24, 19}
- Node 11: {1, 13, 19, 4}
- Node 12: {29, 13, 9}
- Node 13: {21, 12, 11}
- Node 14: {15, 4}
- Node 15: {27, 14, 28}
- Node 16: {3, 5, 20}
- Node 17: {2}
- Node 18: {3, 25, 9}
- Node 19: {28, 24, 11, 10}
- Node 20: {7, 26, 16}
- Node 21: {28, 13}
- Node 22: {23, 6, 0}
- Node 23: {27, 22, 9}
- Node 24: {26, 10, 19, 5}
- Node 25: {2, 8, 18}
- Node 26: {1, 24, 20}
- Node 27: {15, 0, 29, 23}
- Node 28: {15, 21, 19, 9}
- Node 29: {27, 2, 12}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with leaves 14, 27, and 28: <15, (14, 27, 28)>
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 15, and 29: <27, (0, 15, 29)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 16, and 18: <3, (6, 16, 18)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 11, and 26: <1, (4, 11, 26)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 6, and 23: <22, (0, 6, 23)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 12, 18, and 28: <9, (12, 18, 28)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with leaves 13, 29, and 9: <12, (13, 29, 9)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with leaves 11, 12, and 21: <13, (11, 12, 21)>
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with leaves 10, 19, and 26: <24, (10, 19, 26)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have 8 unique 3-stars in the graph: [8].
