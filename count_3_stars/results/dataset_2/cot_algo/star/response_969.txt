Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7
- Node 3: 0, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them:

- Node 0: 6 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8) -> \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 5, 6) -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 7, 8) -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 6 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7) -> \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 60

Therefore, the final answer is [60], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>

<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>

<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
