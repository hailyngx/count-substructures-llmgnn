Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 14) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, we create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {9, 6, 8, 13}
Node 1: {11, 2, 13, 8}
Node 2: {5, 4, 7, 1}
Node 3: {11, 14, 6}
Node 4: {5, 8, 10, 2}
Node 5: {9, 13, 2, 11, 4}
Node 6: {3, 10, 0}
Node 7: {2, 13, 8}
Node 8: {4, 7, 1, 11, 0, 12}
Node 9: {5, 11, 0}
Node 10: {4, 6, 14}
Node 11: {5, 9, 1, 3, 8, 12}
Node 12: {8, 13, 11, 14}
Node 13: {5, 7, 1, 12, 0}
Node 14: {3, 10, 12}

Now we apply the combination formula to determine the number of 3-stars:

Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 5: 1 3-star
Node 8: 15 3-stars
Node 11: 15 3-stars
Node 12: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 15 + 15 + 1 = 33

Therefore, the final answer is [33]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 11, 13)>
<8, (0, 11, 12)>
<8, (0, 11, 13)>
<8, (0, 11, 14)>
<8, (0, 12, 13)>
<8, (0, 12, 14)>
<8, (0, 13, 14)>
<8, (1, 11, 12)>
<8, (1, 11, 13)>
<8, (1, 11, 14)>
<8, (1, 12, 13)>
<8, (1, 12, 14)>
<8, (1, 13, 14)>
<8, (11, 12, 13)>
<8, (11, 12, 14)>
<11, (5, 9, 13)>
<11, (8, 0, 12)>
<12, (8, 0, 13)>
