Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 8
- Node 5: 2, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 52\)

Therefore, the final answer is [52], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <8, 9, 9>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>
