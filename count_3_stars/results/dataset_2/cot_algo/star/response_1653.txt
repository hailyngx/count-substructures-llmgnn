Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 9) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 3) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 9) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 9) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {3, 11, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {5, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {3, 13, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {10, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9, 12}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9, 10}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8, 9}

Next, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 38, so we put the final result inside brackets: [38].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (1, 3, 12)>
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 12)>
- <0, (1, 6, 12)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 12)>
- <0, (3, 6, 12)>
- <0, (5, 6, 12)>
- <6, (1, 5, 10)>
- <6, (1, 5, 13)>
- <6, (1, 10, 13)>
- <6, (5, 10, 13)>
- <9, (10, 11, 14)>
