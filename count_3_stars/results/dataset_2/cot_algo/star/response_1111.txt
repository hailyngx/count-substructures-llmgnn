Response:
Given the information provided, the graph can be visualized as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 12, 5, and 2
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 11, 12, 2, 14, and 13
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 11, 0, 1, and 13
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 14, and 13
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 5
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 0
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 14, 3, 2, 0
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 11, 10, 5, 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 9, 10, 0
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 11, 8, 13, 14
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 7, 10, 1, 13, 2
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 14, 0, 1
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 10, 11, 3, 1
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 10, 12, 3, 1

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
Considering each node that has 3 or more neighbors, we have the following 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
<0, (6, 8, 12)>, <0, (6, 8, 5)>, <0, (6, 8, 2)>, <0, (6, 12, 5)>, <0, (6, 12, 2)>, <0, (6, 5, 2)>, <0, (8, 12, 5)>, <0, (8, 12, 2)>, <0, (8, 5, 2)>, <0, (12, 5, 2)>
- Node 1 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
<1, (11, 12, 2)>, <1, (11, 12, 14)>, <1, (11, 12, 13)>, <1, (11, 2, 14)>, <1, (11, 2, 13)>, <1, (11, 14, 13)>, <1, (12, 2, 14)>, <1, (12, 2, 13)>, <1, (12, 14, 13)>, <1, (2, 14, 13)>
- Node 6 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
<6, (9, 14, 3)>, <6, (9, 14, 2)>, <6, (9, 14, 0)>, <6, (9, 3, 2)>, <6, (9, 3, 0)>, <6, (9, 2, 0)>, <6, (14, 3, 2)>, <6, (14, 3, 0)>, <6, (14, 2, 0)>, <6, (3, 2, 0)>
- Node 10 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
<10, (7, 11, 8)>, <10, (7, 11, 13)>, <10, (7, 11, 14)>, <10, (7, 8, 13)>, <10, (7, 8, 14)>, <10, (7, 13, 14)>, <10, (11, 13, 14)>, <10, (11, 8, 13)>, <10, (11, 8, 14)>, <10, (13, 8, 14)>
- Node 14 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
<14, (6, 10, 12)>, <14, (6, 10, 3)>, <14, (6, 10, 1)>, <14, (6, 12, 3)>, <14, (6, 12, 1)>, <14, (6, 3, 1)>, <14, (10, 12, 3)>, <14, (10, 12, 1)>, <14, (10, 3, 1)>, <14, (12, 3, 1)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].
