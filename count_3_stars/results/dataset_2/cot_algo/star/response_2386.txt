Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 6, 7}

Now let's find the 3-star configurations:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 50, which is represented as [50].

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <1, 4, 9>
2. <1, 4, 5>
3. <1, 2, 9>
4. <1, 2, 7>
5. <1, 2, 5>
6. <1, 9, 6>
7. <1, 9, 7>
8. <1, 9, 8>
9. <2, 4, 5>
10. <2, 4, 8>
11. <2, 4, 7>
12. <2, 7, 5>
13. <4, 5, 0>
14. <4, 5, 7>
15. <4, 9, 6>
16. <4, 9, 7>
17. <4, 9, 8>
18. <7, 5, 3>
