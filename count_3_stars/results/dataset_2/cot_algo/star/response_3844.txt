Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 23) (17, 5) (17, 22) (9, 22) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 19) (22, 17) (22, 9) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 27) (18, 26) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 25) (26, 18) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 12) (29, 26) (29, 27) (29, 15) (29, 4) (8, 19) (8, 20) (8, 3) (8, 7) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 4) (25, 18) (25, 21) (27, 13) (27, 29) (27, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (28, 1) (28, 10) (28, 2) (2, 27) (2, 28) (23, 17) (23, 26) (23, 0) (12, 14) (12, 26) (12, 0) (16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 10) (7, 18) (7, 8) (7, 11) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 15) (6, 14) (20, 14) (20, 8) (0, 23) (0, 12) (21, 25) (4, 29) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 1) (1, 9) (1, 28) (1, 16) (1, 4) (10, 9) (10, 28) (10, 16) (15, 5) (15, 29) (15, 11) 

Response:
For this graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {23, 12}
- Node 1: {9, 28, 16, 4}
- Node 2: {27, 28}
- Node 3: {5, 8}
- Node 4: {29, 19, 11, 1}
- Node 5: {17, 13, 15, 3}
- Node 6: {14}
- Node 7: {18, 8, 11}
- Node 8: {19, 20, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {22, 10, 1, 19}
- Node 10: {9, 28, 16}
- Node 11: {13, 18, 7, 4, 15}
- Node 12: {14, 26, 0}
- Node 13: {5, 16, 11, 27}
- Node 14: {17, 6, 12, 20}
- Node 15: {5, 29, 11}
- Node 16: {1, 10, 13}
- Node 17: {14, 23, 5}
- Node 18: {26, 11, 7, 25}
- Node 19: {9, 8, 4}
- Node 20: {14, 8}
- Node 21: {25}
- Node 22: {17, 9}
- Node 23: {17, 26, 0}
- Node 25: {18, 21}
- Node 26: {18, 23, 29, 12}
- Node 27: {13, 29, 2}
- Node 28: {1, 10, 2}
- Node 29: {26, 27, 15, 4}

Based on the given edges and the neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 14, 17, 11, and 5 each have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 22 \), so the final answer is [22].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <14, 20, 8, 3>
- <14, 20, 8, 7>
- <14, 6, 12, 26>
- <14, 6, 17, 5>
- <17, 14, 6, 12>
- <17, 14, 6, 20>
- <17, 23, 26, 18>
- <17, 23, 26, 29>
- <11, 15, 29, 16>
- <11, 15, 4, 1>
- <11, 15, 4, 29>
- <11, 15, 7, 18>
- <11, 13, 27, 2>
- <11, 13, 27, 29>
- <11, 13, 5, 3>
- <11, 13, 5, 15>
- <5, 17, 14, 20>
- <5, 17, 23, 26>
- <5, 17, 23, 0>
- <5, 13, 16, 1>
- <5, 13, 11, 4>
- <5, 13, 11, 15>
