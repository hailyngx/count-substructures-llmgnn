Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 9) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (10, 8) (10, 6) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 11}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 10, 12}
- Node 7: {0, 9, 14}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 8, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {6, 8}
- Node 11: {1, 8, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {4, 6, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 14: {4, 7, 11, 12}

Next, we calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 1: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 20
- Node 9: 1
- Node 10: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: 4
- Node 12: 1
- Node 13: 1
- Node 14: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Summing all the 3-stars from each node, we get a total of \( 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 20 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 33 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [33], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 13>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 9, 13>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 8, 9>, <3, 8, 13>, <3, 9, 13>, <6, 8, 11>, <8, 11, 13>, <8, 11, 14>, <8, 12, 14>, <9, 12, 13>, <11, 12, 14>.
