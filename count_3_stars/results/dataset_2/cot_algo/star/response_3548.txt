Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 11) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 15) (7, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 18) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 8) (13, 17) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 14) (19, 8) (19, 1) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (2, 12) (2, 6) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 15) (12, 1) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 0) (18, 10) (18, 12) (3, 6) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 3) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 15) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 16) (16, 4) (16, 1) (15, 4) (15, 12) (15, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list format:

1: 19, 12, 16
2: 12, 6
3: 6
4: 5, 16, 15
5: 14, 4, 11, 8, 15
6: 13, 2, 3
7: 11
8: 10, 11, 19, 5
9: 14, 13, 0
10: 0, 8, 18
11: 17, 7, 5, 8
12: 2, 18, 15, 1
13: 17, 9, 0, 6
14: 17, 9, 19, 5
15: 4, 12, 5
16: 4, 1
17: 14, 13, 11
18: 10, 12
19: 14, 8, 1

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 4, 5, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19.

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

Node 4:
- Neighbors: 5, 16, 15
- Number of 3-stars = 1

Node 5:
- Neighbors: 14, 4, 11, 8, 15
- Number of 3-stars = 1

Node 8:
- Neighbors: 10, 11, 19, 5
- Number of 3-stars = 1

Node 11:
- Neighbors: 17, 7, 5, 8
- Number of 3-stars = 1

Node 12:
- Neighbors: 2, 18, 15, 1
- Number of 3-stars = 1

Node 13:
- Neighbors: 17, 9, 0, 6
- Number of 3-stars = 1

Node 14:
- Neighbors: 17, 9, 19, 5
- Number of 3-stars = 1

Node 15:
- Neighbors: 4, 12, 5
- Number of 3-stars = 1

Node 16:
- Neighbors: 4, 1
- Number of 3-stars = 0

Node 17:
- Neighbors: 14, 13, 11
- Number of 3-stars = 1

Node 19:
- Neighbors: 14, 8, 1
- Number of 3-stars = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 10. Therefore, the final answer is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (5, 15, 16)>
<5, (4, 11, 8)>
<8, (10, 5, 19)>
<11, (17, 5, 8)>
<12, (2, 15, 1)>
<13, (17, 9, 0)>
<14, (17, 19, 5)>
<15, (4, 12, 5)>
<17, (14, 13, 11)>
<19, (14, 8, 1)>
