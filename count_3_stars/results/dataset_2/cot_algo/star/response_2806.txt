Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 8) (13, 21) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 7) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 19) (2, 27) (2, 28) (2, 0) (29, 0) (29, 3) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 6) (21, 13) (21, 7) (21, 23) (21, 8) (20, 22) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 12) (20, 24) (25, 20) (25, 14) (3, 29) (3, 17) (3, 27) (8, 13) (8, 21) (8, 24) (8, 17) (6, 7) (6, 18) (28, 2) (28, 4) (10, 9) (15, 26) (15, 11) (4, 28) (4, 12) (4, 11) (12, 20) (12, 4) (12, 0) (26, 5) (26, 20) (26, 15) (26, 11) (16, 5) (16, 9) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 11) (14, 25) (24, 20) (24, 8) (24, 27) (24, 19) (19, 9) (19, 24) (19, 1) (19, 27) (27, 2) (27, 3) (27, 24) (27, 19) (1, 19) (1, 23) (1, 0) (23, 21) (23, 1) (11, 15) (11, 4) (11, 26) (11, 17) (11, 18) (18, 6) (18, 11) (0, 22) (0, 2) (0, 29) (0, 12) (0, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 12, 22, 29}
- Node 1: {0, 19, 23}
- Node 2: {0, 27, 28}
- Node 3: {17, 27, 29}
- Node 4: {11, 12, 28}
- Node 5: {9, 16, 26}
- Node 6: {7, 18}
- Node 7: {6, 21, 22}
- Node 8: {13, 17, 21, 24}
- Node 9: {5, 10, 16, 19}
- Node 10: {9}
- Node 11: {4, 15, 17, 18, 26}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 20}
- Node 13: {8, 21}
- Node 14: {25}
- Node 15: {11, 26}
- Node 16: {5, 9}
- Node 17: {3, 8, 11, 27}
- Node 18: {6, 11}
- Node 19: {9, 1, 24, 27}
- Node 20: {12, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26}
- Node 21: {7, 8, 13, 21, 23}
- Node 22: {0, 7, 20}
- Node 23: {1, 21}
- Node 24: {8, 19, 20, 27}
- Node 25: {14, 20}
- Node 26: {5, 11, 15, 20}
- Node 27: {2, 3, 19, 24}
- Node 28: {2, 4}
- Node 29: {0, 3}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: [1]
  - <0, (1, 22, 29)>
- Node 2: [3]
  - <2, (0, 27, 29)>, <2, (0, 28, 4)>, <2, (27, 28, 4)>
- Node 20: [1]
  - <20, (12, 22, 24)>
- Node 21: [2]
  - <21, (7, 13, 8)>, <21, (7, 23, 1)>
- Node 24: [1]
  - <24, (8, 19, 27)>
- Node 26: [1]
  - <26, (5, 20, 11)>
- Node 27: [1]
  - <27, (2, 19, 24)>

The total number of 3-stars is 10, which can be represented as [10].
