Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6, 9} (Degree 5)
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 9} (Degree 4)
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 6} (Degree 4)
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 6, 7} (Degree 3)
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 8, 9} (Degree 4)
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7, 9} (Degree 5)
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3} (Degree 4)
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 5, 8} (Degree 3)
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 7, 9} (Degree 3)
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 8, 1} (Degree 5)

Now we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 5, and 9 have a degree of 5, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 1, 2, 4, and 6 have a degree of 4, so they can form 1 3-star each.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is given by \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34 \), so the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
