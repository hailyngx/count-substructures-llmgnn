Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 14) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 19) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (14, 16) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 18) (1, 15) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 15) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 0) (15, 1) (15, 3) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 7) (18, 16) (18, 17) (18, 7) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 0) (13, 9) (13, 14) (4, 9) (4, 14) (0, 6) (0, 19) (0, 8) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 8, 19}
- Node 1: {10, 15}
- Node 2: {7, 10}
- Node 3: {9, 15}
- Node 4: {9, 14}
- Node 5: {9, 11, 19}
- Node 6: {0, 8, 14, 16}
- Node 7: {2, 11, 18}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 12, 17}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 17, 19}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 16}
- Node 12: {8, 19}
- Node 13: {4, 9, 14}
- Node 14: {4, 6, 13, 16}
- Node 15: {1, 3}
- Node 16: {6, 11, 14, 18}
- Node 17: {8, 10, 18}
- Node 18: {7, 16, 17}
- Node 19: {0, 5, 10, 12}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 11, 19} <5, (9, 11, 19)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 8, 14} <6, (0, 8, 14)> and another one with {6, 8, 16} <6, (8, 16, 6)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 6, 17} <8, (0, 6, 17)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 13} <9, (4, 5, 13)> and another one with {3, 4, 15} <9, (3, 4, 15)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 17, 19} <10, (1, 17, 19)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 6, 13} <14, (4, 6, 13)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 14, 18} <16, (6, 14, 18)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 16, 17} <18, (7, 16, 17)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 10, 12} <19, (0, 10, 12)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars identified, we have a total of 9 3-stars in this graph: [9].
