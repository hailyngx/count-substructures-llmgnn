Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 3) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 5) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 10) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 10) (11, 1) (11, 7) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 9) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 9, 13
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 11, 12
- Node 2: 1, 6, 10, 14
- Node 3: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 12
- Node 5: 3, 4, 10, 12, 13
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7, 13, 14
- Node 7: 6, 9, 10, 11, 14
- Node 8: 3, 12
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7, 10, 12, 14
- Node 10: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 11: 1, 7
- Node 12: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 13: 0, 5, 6
- Node 14: 2, 7, 9

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, and 14 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (one 3-star)
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (ten 3-stars)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (four 3-stars)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (four 3-stars)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (ten 3-stars)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (ten 3-stars)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (ten 3-stars)
Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) (twenty 3-stars)
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (ten 3-stars)
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (one 3-star)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 80

Therefore, the final answer is [80].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, 1, 2>, <1, 0, 2>, <1, 0, 6>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 5, 12>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 13>, <1, 9, 12>, <1, 12, 14>, <2, 1, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 10, 14>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 12>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 12>, <3, 8, 12>, <4, 3, 5>, <4, 3, 12>, <4, 5, 12>, <5, 1, 12>, <5, 3, 12>, <5, 4, 12>, <5, 6, 13>, <5, 9, 12>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 1, 13>, <6, 2, 7>, <6, 2, 13>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 13, 14>, <7, 1, 6>, <7, 2, 6>, <7, 6, 9>, <7, 9, 14>, <9, 1, 12>, <9, 5, 12>, <9, 6, 13>, <9, 7, 12>, <9, 9, 14>, <12, 1, 4>, <12, 1, 5>, <12, 4, 5>, <12, 4, 9>, <12, 5, 9>, <14, 1, 2>
