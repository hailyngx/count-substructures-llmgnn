Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 4) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 19) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (7, 3) (7, 16) (7, 2) (15, 4) (15, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 6) (8, 1) (8, 11) (19, 1) (19, 3) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 15) (16, 12) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 10) (12, 14) (12, 16) (12, 10) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 18) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 18) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 15) (18, 10) (18, 11) 

Response:
To solve this problem, we first need to create a list of neighbors for each node based on the provided edge list. Here is the list of neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {10, 16}
- Node 1: {8, 11, 19}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {7, 13, 19}
- Node 4: {9, 15, 17}
- Node 5: {6, 9, 11}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 13, 17}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 16}
- Node 8: {1, 11}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 11}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 12, 18}
- Node 11: {1, 5, 8, 9, 18}
- Node 12: {10, 14, 16}
- Node 13: {3, 6, 17}
- Node 14: {2, 12}
- Node 15: {4, 16}
- Node 16: {0, 7, 12, 15}
- Node 17: {4, 6, 13}
- Node 18: {10, 11}
- Node 19: {1, 3}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph by counting the total number of 3-stars formed.

Looking at the list of neighbor nodes, we can see that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 6, 11, and 16. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 19. 

Therefore, the final answer to the problem is [19], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, 6, 13>, 
<6, 2, 7>, 
<6, 13, 17>, 
<6, 17, 4>, 
<11, 8, 1>, 
<11, 9, 4>, 
<11, 18, 10>, 
<11, 18, 10>, 
<16, 0, 7> , 
<16, 12, 14>, 
<16, 12, 10>, 
<16, 12, 10>, 
<16, 14, 2>, 
<16, 15, 4>, 
<16, 15, 4>, 
<16, 15, 4>.
