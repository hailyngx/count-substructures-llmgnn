- Node 19: Neighbors: 17. (Degree: 1)
- Node 20: Neighbors: 7, 29. (Degree: 2)
- Node 21: Neighbors: 0, 9, 22. (Degree: 3)
- Node 22: Neighbors: 11, 21, 26. (Degree: 3)
- Node 23: Neighbors: 1, 6, 8, 16, 17. (Degree: 5)
- Node 24: Neighbors: 9, 14, 27. (Degree: 3)

Now, let's compute the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1, 23 has 5 neighbors: <1, (23, 6, 16)>. 
- Node 3, 5 has 4 neighbors: <3, (5, 4, 10)>. 
- Node 4, 5 has 4 neighbors: <4, (5, 3, 10)>.
- Node 5, 12 has 4 neighbors: <5, (12, 3, 4)>.
- Node 6, 15 has 3 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 7, 20 has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 11, 26 has 3 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 12, 16 has 4 neighbors: <12, (16, 2, 5)>.
- Node 12, 27 has 3 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 16, 29 has 3 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 17, 28 has 4 neighbors: <17, (28, 13, 23)>.
- Node 23, 17 has 5 neighbors: <23, (17, 1, 6)>.
- Node 24, 27 has 3 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 25, 14 has 3 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 27, 2 has 4 neighbors: <27, (2, 13, 24)>.
- Node 27, 28 has 3 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
