Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 6}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 4, 7, 3}
- Node 3: {6, 2}
- Node 4: {7, 0, 1, 6, 2}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 1}
- Node 6: {9, 4, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 2, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 6, 1}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 1}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding them up, we have a total of 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 55 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [55], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 6)>, <1, (5, 9, 4)>, <1, (5, 9, 7)>, <1, (5, 4, 7)>, <1, (9, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 9, 4)>, <2, (5, 9, 7)>, <2, (5, 4, 7)>, <2, (9, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 3)>, <4, (7, 0, 6)>, <4, (7, 1, 6)>, <4, (7, 6, 2)>, <6, (9, 4, 3)>, <6, (9, 3, 8)>, <6, (4, 3, 8)>, <7, (4, 0, 2)>, <7, (4, 1, 2)>, <7, (4, 2, 3)>, <8, (5, 1, 7)>
