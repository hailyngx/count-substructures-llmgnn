Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 5) (0, 16) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 9) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 5) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 18) (2, 16) (2, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 17) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 6) (13, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 1) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 18) (18, 1) (18, 12) (19, 10) (19, 1) 

Response:
There are 20 nodes and 60 edges in the given graph. The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: {16}
- Node 1: {5, 13, 18, 19}
- Node 2: {6, 16}
- Node 3: {7, 9, 14, 15}
- Node 4: {7, 10, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 8, 13, 17}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {6, 10}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 17}
- Node 10: {4, 5, 8, 11, 19}
- Node 11: {5, 10, 17}
- Node 12: {15, 17, 18}
- Node 13: {1, 6}
- Node 14: {3, 4, 5, 16}
- Node 15: {3, 12}
- Node 16: {0, 2, 14}
- Node 17: {6, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 18: {1, 12}
- Node 19: {1, 10}

Nodes 1 and 14 have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 choose 3 = 4 different 3-stars each. Nodes 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, and 17 each have 5 neighbors, hence they can form 5 choose 3 = 10 different 3-stars each. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2*(4) + 6*(10)] = [68].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<3, (7, 9, 17)>
<4, (7, 10, 14)>
<5, (1, 10, 14)>
<10, (4, 5, 11)>
<11, (5, 10, 17)>
<14, (3, 4, 16)>
<14, (4, 5, 16)>
<14, (3, 5, 16)>
<17, (6, 11, 12)>
<17, (9, 11, 12)>
