Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 10) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 7) (5, 6) (5, 16) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 16) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 19) (15, 13) (15, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 2) (10, 6) (4, 2) (4, 15) (12, 9) (12, 14) (0, 18) (0, 6) (0, 9) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 6) (16, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 14) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 3) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 13) (3, 8) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 14) (13, 15) (13, 19) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 19) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 9, 18}
- Node 1: {9, 11, 17}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 10}
- Node 3: {8, 14, 16, 17}
- Node 4: {2, 15}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 16}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 10, 16}
- Node 7: {5, 18, 19}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {2, 6}
- Node 11: {1, 9, 14}
- Node 12: {9, 14}
- Node 13: {15, 19}
- Node 14: {3, 11, 12}
- Node 15: {4, 13}
- Node 16: {3, 5, 6, 18}
- Node 17: {1, 3, 19}
- Node 18: {0, 7, 16}
- Node 19: {7, 13, 17}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars each node is part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us:
1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, we have found a total of 34 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So the final answer is [34]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 6, 9, 18>, <3, 8, 9, 17>, <3, 8, 9, 16>, <3, 8, 14, 16>, <3, 14, 16, 18>, <5, 6, 7, 16>, <9, 11, 14, 17>, <9, 11, 14, 12>, <9, 11, 14, 3>, <9, 11, 14, 16>, <9, 11, 14, 0>, <9, 11, 14, 8>, <9, 11, 14, 6>, <9, 11, 14, 10>, <9, 11, 14, 2>, <16, 6, 3, 18>, <16, 6, 3, 5>, <16, 6, 3, 8>, <16, 18, 5, 7>, <16, 18, 5, 6>, <16, 18, 5, 3>, <16, 18, 7, 5>, <3, 8, 17, 19>, <18, 7, 19, 13>, <18, 7, 19, 17>, <2, 8, 4, 10>, <2, 8, 4, 15>, <2, 10, 6, 0>, <15, 4, 2, 10>, <15, 4, 2, 8>, <15, 4, 2, 16>, <15, 4, 2, 0>, <15, 13, 19, 17>, <15, 13, 19, 7>
