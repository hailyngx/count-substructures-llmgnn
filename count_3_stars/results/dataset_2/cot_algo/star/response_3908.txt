Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 4) (10, 1) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 4) (17, 7) (7, 17) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 16) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 9) (9, 19) (9, 4) (4, 15) (4, 17) (4, 9) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 18) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 0) (11, 5) (11, 19) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 13) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 13) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 18) (18, 16) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 13) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: {6, 8, 13, 15, 17}
- Node 1: {6, 10, 16, 18}
- Node 2: {5, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 14, 15}
- Node 4: {9, 15, 17}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 11, 16, 19}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 8, 17}
- Node 7: {17}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 19}
- Node 10: {1}
- Node 11: {5, 19}
- Node 13: {0, 14, 18}
- Node 14: {3, 13}
- Node 15: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 16: {1, 5, 18}
- Node 17: {4, 6, 7, 0}
- Node 18: {1, 13, 14, 16}
- Node 19: {5, 9, 11}

Now, we will calculate the number of unique 3-stars in this graph:

From the neighbors list, we find that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for these nodes:
- 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors)
- 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total, we get: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 17>, <0, 8, 15>, <0, 8, 17>, <0, 13, 18>, <0, 13, 15>, <0, 13, 17>, <0, 15, 17>, <1, 6, 16>, <3, 5, 11>, <3, 5, 16>, <3, 5, 19>, <3, 8, 14>, <3, 8, 15>, <3, 8, 5>, <3, 15, 4>, <4, 15, 9>, <5, 11, 19>, <5, 16, 18>, <5, 19, 9>, <6, 17, 4>, <8, 6, 0>, <8, 6, 17>, <8, 6, 1>, <8, 6, 17>, <10, 1, 16>, <13, 14, 18>, <15, 0, 17>, <18, 13, 14>, <19, 9, 11>
