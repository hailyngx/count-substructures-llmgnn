Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 1) (17, 5) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 1) (18, 19) (18, 15) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 19) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 1) (15, 18) (15, 10) (15, 6) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 12) (7, 16) (7, 2) (7, 10) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 3) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 12) (9, 11) (1, 16) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 19) 

Response:
Given that there are 20 nodes and 60 edges in the graph, we can see that this graph can be represented by an adjacency list. We will use this information to find and count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

Upon examining the adjacency list:

1. Node 0: (0, 3) (0, 6)
2. Node 1: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 16)
3. Node 2: (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 7)
4. Node 3: (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 19)
5. Node 4: (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 11)
6. Node 5: (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 17)
7. Node 6: (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 15) (6, 19)
8. Node 7: (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 16)
9. Node 8: (8, 1) (8, 11)
10. Node 9: (9, 11)
11. Node 10: (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 15)
12. Node 11: (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 9)
13. Node 12: (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 19)
14. Node 13: (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 19)
15. Node 15: (15, 6) (15, 10) (15, 18)
16. Node 16: (16, 1) (16, 7)
17. Node 17: (17, 5)
18. Node 18: (18, 15) (18, 19)
19. Node 19: (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 13) (19, 18)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph based on the given edges. 

1. Node 1 has 5 neighbors, making \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 2 has 5 neighbors, making \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, making \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 4 has 3 neighbors exactly, making 1 3-star.
5. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, making \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, making \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 7 has 3 neighbors exactly, making 1 3-star.
8. Node 10 has 3 neighbors exactly, making 1 3-star.
9. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, making \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 12 has 5 neighbors, making \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
11. Node 13 has 3 neighbors exactly, making 1 3-star.
12. Node 15 has 3 neighbors exactly, making 1 3-star.
13. Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
14. Node 18 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
15. Node 19 has 5 neighbors, making \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 12)>
<5, (1, 12, 13)>
<6, (0, 11, 15)>
<10, (1, 7, 15)>
<11, (4, 6, 8)>
<12, (2, 5, 13)>
<13, (5, 12, 19)>
<15, (6, 10, 18)>
