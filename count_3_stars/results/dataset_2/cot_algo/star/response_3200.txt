Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 5, 7, 8  
Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8  
Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 5, 9  
Node 3: 1, 6, 8  
Node 4: 1, 2, 7, 8  
Node 5: 0, 1, 2  
Node 6: 1, 3, 7, 9  
Node 7: 0, 4, 6  
Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4  
Node 9: 0, 2, 6  

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars  
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 47  

Therefore, the final answer is [47].

Unique 3-stars:  
<0, (2, 4, 8)>  
<1, (0, 4, 8)>  
<1, (2, 4, 5)>  
<1, (2, 4, 8)>  
<1, (4, 6, 8)>  
<2, (0, 1, 5)>  
<2, (0, 4, 9)>  
<2, (1, 4, 5)>  
<2, (1, 4, 9)>  
<2, (5, 9, 0)>  
<5, (0, 1, 2)>  
<6, (1, 3, 7)>  
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
