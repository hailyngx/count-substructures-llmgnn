Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 16) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 26) (13, 8) (13, 24) (22, 23) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 27) (22, 17) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 18) (23, 28) (7, 24) (21, 3) (21, 20) (21, 15) (18, 22) (18, 23) (15, 21) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 11) (20, 21) (20, 5) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 5) (26, 8) (26, 22) (9, 16) (9, 12) (11, 23) (11, 15) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 17) (25, 19) (25, 12) (25, 4) (27, 22) (27, 2) (27, 17) (28, 3) (28, 23) (28, 0) (28, 5) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 25) (19, 24) (19, 6) (29, 10) (2, 27) (2, 17) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 9) (24, 13) (24, 7) (24, 19) (10, 29) (10, 4) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 25) (17, 22) (17, 11) (17, 27) (17, 2) (4, 0) (4, 25) (4, 10) (4, 6) (5, 20) (5, 14) (5, 28) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 14, 28}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 8, 16}
- Node 2: Neighbors {17, 27}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 16, 21, 28}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6, 10, 25}
- Node 5: Neighbors {14, 20, 28}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 11, 19}
- Node 7: Neighbor {24}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 13, 26}
- Node 9: Neighbors {10, 12, 16, 25}
- Node 10: Neighbors {4, 9, 29}
- Node 11: Neighbors {6, 15, 17, 19, 23}
- Node 12: Neighbors {9, 15, 25}
- Node 13: Neighbors {8, 24}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 15: Neighbors {11, 12, 19, 21}
- Node 16: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 17: Neighbors {2, 11, 17, 22, 27}
- Node 18: Neighbors {22, 23}
- Node 19: Neighbors {6, 11, 15, 19, 24}
- Node 20: Neighbors {5, 21}
- Node 21: Neighbors {3, 15, 20}
- Node 22: Neighbors {17, 18, 26, 27}
- Node 23: Neighbors {11, 18, 21, 28}
- Node 24: Neighbors {7, 13, 19}
- Node 25: Neighbors {4, 9, 12, 19}
- Node 26: Neighbors {8, 22}
- Node 27: Neighbors {2, 17, 22}
- Node 28: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 23}
- Node 29: Neighbor {10}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 5, and Node 28 have exactly 3 neighbors, so each can form 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 4, Node 6, Node 11, Node 15, and Node 19 have more than 3 neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they can form using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \).

Calculating:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from 0, 3, 5, 28) + 4 (from Node 4) + 10 (from Node 6) + 10 (from Node 11) + 1 (from Node 15) + 10 (from Node 19) = 36
So, the final answer is [36].
