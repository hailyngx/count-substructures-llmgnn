Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 16) (29, 14) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 20) (13, 15) (13, 10) (20, 13) (20, 5) (20, 10) (25, 6) (25, 12) (25, 18) (12, 25) (12, 17) (12, 23) (27, 14) (28, 26) (28, 0) (28, 9) (1, 4) (17, 12) (17, 4) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 6) (26, 28) (26, 16) (26, 0) (26, 7) (22, 2) (22, 5) (22, 15) (9, 28) (9, 18) (9, 21) (18, 25) (18, 9) (18, 21) (16, 29) (16, 26) (16, 24) (24, 2) (24, 16) (24, 23) (24, 15) (5, 8) (5, 20) (5, 3) (5, 22) (5, 15) (0, 28) (0, 26) (6, 25) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 23) (7, 26) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 23) (4, 1) (4, 17) (21, 9) (21, 18) (10, 13) (10, 20) (10, 3) (10, 7) (14, 29) (14, 27) (14, 15) (23, 12) (23, 24) (23, 6) (23, 7) (15, 13) (15, 22) (15, 24) (15, 5) (15, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {28, 26}
Node 1: {4}
Node 2: {29, 22, 24}
Node 3: {8, 11, 10, 5}
Node 4: {1, 17}
Node 5: {8, 20, 3, 22, 15}
Node 6: {25, 11, 7, 23}
Node 7: {26, 6, 10, 23}
Node 8: {13, 5, 3}
Node 9: {28, 18, 21}
Node 10: {13, 20, 3, 7}
Node 11: {3, 6}
Node 12: {25, 17, 23}
Node 13: {8, 20, 15, 10}
Node 14: {29, 27, 15}
Node 15: {5, 22, 24, 14, 13}
Node 16: {29, 26, 24}
Node 17: {12, 4}
Node 18: {25, 9, 21}
Node 20: {13, 5, 10}
Node 21: {9, 18}
Node 22: {2, 5, 15}
Node 23: {12, 6, 7, 24}
Node 24: {2, 16, 15, 23}
Node 25: {6, 12, 18}
Node 26: {28, 16, 7, 0}
Node 27: {14}
Node 28: {26, 9, 0}
Node 29: {2, 16, 14}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 15
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 7, 13, 24
Nodes with 6 neighbors: None

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: 
Each of the six nodes with 4 or 5 neighbors can potentially form inom{4}{3} or inom{5}{3} 3-stars. 

For 2, 5, 6, 7, 13, 24:
Each can form 4 3-stars.

Total 3-stars = 6 * 4 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (5, 15, 22)>
<5, (3, 13, 15)>
<6, (7, 12, 23)>
<7, (6, 10, 23)>
<13, (8, 15, 20)>
<24, (15, 16, 23)>
