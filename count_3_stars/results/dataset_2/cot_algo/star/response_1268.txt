Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors (7, 3, 8, 5)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (3, 5)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (3, 9, 0)
- Node 3: 5 neighbors (1, 0, 2, 5, 8)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (8, 9, 5)
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (4, 7, 1, 3, 6)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (7, 5, 8)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (0, 6, 8, 5)
- Node 8: 7 neighbors (4, 7, 3, 6, 9, 0, 5)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (4, 8, 2)

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, we count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and find the total at the end:

- Node 0:  C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
  <0, (3, 7, 5)>, <0, (3, 8, 5)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (7, 5, 8)>

- Node 2:  C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
  <2, (0, 9, 3)>

- Node 3:  C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
  <3, (1, 8, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 0)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 2)>, <3, (1, 0, 2)>, 
  <3, (1, 0, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 2)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>

- Node 4:  C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
  <4, (9, 8, 5)>

- Node 5:  C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
  <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>,
  <5, (1, 3, 0)>, <5, (1, 0, 7)>, <5, (1, 0, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 0, 7)>

- Node 6:  C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
  <6, (7, 8, 5)>

- Node 7:  C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
  <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 3)>, <7, (6, 5, 8)>

- Node 8:  C(7, 3) = 35 3-stars
  <8, (4, 9, 0)>, <8, (4, 6, 5)>, <8, (4, 3, 6)>, <8, (4, 3, 0)>, <8, (4, 9, 6)>, 
  <8, (4, 9, 5)>, <8, (4, 3, 5)>, <8, (4, 6, 0)>, <8, (4, 5, 0)>, <8, (9, 3, 6)>,
  <8, (9, 3, 0)>, <8, (9, 6, 5)>, <8, (9, 3, 5)>, <8, (9, 6, 0)>, <8, (9, 5, 0)>,
  <8, (3, 6, 5)>, <8, (3, 6, 0)>, <8, (3, 5, 0)>, <8, (6, 5, 0)>, <8, (7, 5, 0)>,
  <8, (7, 0, 5)>, <8, (7, 0, 6)>, <8, (7, 5, 6)>, <8, (7, 0, 3)>, <8, (7, 5, 3)>,
  <8, (7, 6, 3)>, <8, (7, 6, 0)>, <8, (7, 3, 5)>, <8, (7, 3, 0)>, <8, (7, 6, 5)>,
  <8, (7, 8, 5)>, <8, (7, 8, 0)>, <8, (7, 8, 6)>, <8, (7, 8, 3)>, <8, (6, 5, 0)>

- Node 9:  C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
  <9, (4, 8, 2)>

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [67]
