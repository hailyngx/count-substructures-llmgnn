Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 5) (27, 15) (27, 17) (27, 13) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 1) (29, 2) (29, 0) (29, 3) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 28) (7, 23) (7, 8) (12, 21) (12, 11) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 21) (9, 0) (9, 19) (22, 9) (22, 11) (22, 10) (22, 20) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 23) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 14) (13, 27) (13, 25) (13, 4) (17, 27) (17, 6) (17, 24) (17, 21) (3, 29) (3, 28) (0, 29) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 6) (10, 22) (10, 5) (10, 25) (16, 20) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 24) (6, 14) (24, 17) (24, 6) (24, 14) (24, 25) (11, 12) (11, 22) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 10) (4, 13) (4, 23) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 24) (23, 15) (23, 7) (23, 28) (23, 4) (23, 19) (19, 9) (19, 23) (25, 13) (25, 10) (25, 24) (21, 12) (21, 9) (21, 17) (21, 18) (18, 0) (18, 21) (20, 22) (20, 16) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {29, 9, 18, 6}
- Node 1: {15, 2, 26}
- Node 2: {29, 1, 5}
- Node 3: {29, 28}
- Node 4: {13, 23}
- Node 5: {15, 2, 10}
- Node 6: {17, 0, 24, 14}
- Node 7: {23, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 9, 14}
- Node 9: {22, 8, 21, 0, 19}
- Node 10: {22, 5, 25}
- Node 11: {22, 12}
- Node 12: {21, 11}
- Node 13: {27, 25, 4}
- Node 14: {8, 6, 24}
- Node 15: {27, 1, 23, 5}
- Node 16: {20}
- Node 17: {27, 6, 24, 21}
- Node 18: {0, 21}
- Node 19: {9, 23}
- Node 20: {22, 16}
- Node 21: {12, 17, 9, 18}
- Node 22: {9, 20, 11, 10}
- Node 23: {15, 7, 28, 4, 19}
- Node 24: {17, 6, 14, 25}
- Node 25: {13, 10, 24}
- Node 26: {1, 28}
- Node 27: {15, 17, 13}
- Node 28: {29, 26, 3, 23}
- Node 29: {2, 0, 3}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars:
- Node 0, 9, 14, 15, 17, 21, 24, and 28 have 4 neighbors each. 
- Node 2, 5, 6, 22, and 23 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
- We can now calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 56 \]
Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars found in the graph is [56].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, 9, 18, 6>
- <9, 8, 21, 0>
- <9, 21, 18, 0>
- <9, 21, 17, 24>
- <9, 21, 17, 18>
- <9, 24, 25, 13>
- <9, 24, 17, 21>
- <9, 24, 17, 18>
- <14, 8, 6, 24>
- <14, 6, 24, 25>
- <14, 24, 25, 13>
- <15, 27, 1, 23>
- <15, 27, 1, 5>
- <15, 27, 1, 2>
- <15, 23, 7, 8>
- <15, 23, 28, 3>

- <25, 13, 4, 23>
- <25, 13, 27, 17>
- <25, 13, 27, 27>
