Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 5) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 16) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 0) (7, 15) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 9) (1, 17) (1, 10) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 0) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 4) (11, 12) (11, 19) (11, 4) (4, 15) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 5) (10, 14) (10, 18) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 15, 18, 19, 4}
- Node 1: {17, 10}
- Node 3: {15, 0, 16, 9}
- Node 4: {15, 19, 0, 11}
- Node 5: {8, 19, 16}
- Node 7: {15}
- Node 8: {13, 5, 19}
- Node 9: {3, 12}
- Node 10: {14, 18, 1}
- Node 11: {12, 19, 4}
- Node 12: {17, 13, 11, 9}
- Node 13: {14, 8, 12, 16}
- Node 14: {17, 18, 13, 10}
- Node 15: {3, 7, 0, 4}
- Node 16: {3, 13, 5}
- Node 17: {14, 1, 12}
- Node 18: {14, 10, 0}
- Node 19: {8, 5, 11, 4}

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 19, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18

Applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 38

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (3, 15, 18)>
- <0, (3, 15, 19)>
- <0, (3, 18, 19)>
- <0, (15, 18, 19)>
- <3, (0, 15, 16)>
- <3, (0, 15, 9)>
- <3, (0, 16, 9)>
- <15, (3, 0, 16)>
- <15, (3, 0, 9)>
- <15, (0, 16, 9)>
- <13, (8, 12, 16)>
- <13, (8, 12, 19)>
- <13, (8, 16, 19)>
- <13, (12, 16, 19)>
- <14, (10, 18, 1)>
- <17, (12, 13, 14)>
- <0, (4, 11, 19)>
- <5, (8, 16, 19)>
- <19, (8, 11, 4)>
- <19, (8, 11, 5)>
- <19, (8, 4, 5)>
- <19, (11, 4, 5)>
- <19, (11, 4, 0)>
- <19, (4, 5, 0)>
