Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 18) (4, 13) (4, 18) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 19) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 15) (0, 17) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 4) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 2) (6, 12) (6, 5) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 16) (9, 3) (9, 8) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 11) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 10) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 15) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 11) (17, 0) (10, 7) (10, 16) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors.

From the provided edge list, the nodes with at least 3 neighbors are:
- Node 0 with neighbors: 1, 13, 15, 17
- Node 3 with neighbors: 1, 9, 18
- Node 5 with neighbors: 2, 6, 19
- Node 7 with neighbors: 10, 11, 12, 15, 16
- Node 12 with neighbors: 6, 7, 19
- Node 13 with neighbors: 0, 4, 8, 18
- Node 15 with neighbors: 0, 1, 7, 11
- Node 16 with neighbors: 1, 7, 10, 19

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 forms 5 3-stars
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15.

Therefore, the final answer is [15], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 13, 15)>
<0, (1, 13, 17)>
<0, (1, 15, 17)>
<0, (13, 15, 17)>
<3, (1, 9, 18)>
<5, (2, 6, 19)>
<7, (10, 11, 12)>
<7, (10, 11, 15)>
<7, (10, 11, 16)>
<7, (10, 15, 16)>
<7, (11, 15, 16)>
<12, (6, 7, 19)>
<13, (0, 4, 18)>
<15, (0, 7, 11)>
<16, (1, 7, 10)>
