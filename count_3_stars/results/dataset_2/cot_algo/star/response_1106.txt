Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 1) (16, 22) (16, 9) (10, 0) (10, 3) (8, 23) (8, 29) (8, 15) (8, 21) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 9) (2, 23) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 24) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 7) (28, 29) (28, 0) (28, 24) (29, 8) (29, 28) (29, 26) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 1) (26, 29) (26, 22) (22, 16) (22, 26) (22, 12) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 28) (0, 5) (7, 18) (7, 27) (7, 9) (7, 13) (3, 10) (3, 27) (3, 13) (21, 8) (21, 12) (21, 17) (21, 14) (5, 18) (5, 0) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 14) (4, 17) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 9) (12, 22) (12, 21) (12, 20) (20, 12) (20, 27) (20, 9) (9, 16) (9, 23) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 20) (24, 2) (24, 28) (24, 4) (27, 7) (27, 3) (27, 20) (1, 16) (1, 19) (6, 11) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 3) (17, 2) (17, 21) (17, 4) (14, 19) (14, 21) (14, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 11, 10, 28, 5
Node 1: 16, 19
Node 2: 23, 18, 13, 24, 17
Node 3: 10, 27, 13
Node 4: 19, 24, 14, 17
Node 5: 0, 18
Node 6: 11
Node 7: 8, 18, 27, 13
Node 8: 23, 29, 15, 21
Node 9: 16, 23, 7, 15, 20
Node 10: 0, 3
Node 11: 0, 6, 15
Node 12: 22, 21, 20
Node 13: 2, 7, 3
Node 14: 19, 21, 4
Node 15: 11, 8, 9
Node 16: 1, 22, 9
Node 17: 2, 21, 4
Node 18: 2, 5, 7
Node 19: 16, 14, 1, 4
Node 20: 12, 27, 9
Node 21: 8, 12, 17, 14
Node 22: 16, 26, 12
Node 23: 8, 2, 9
Node 24: 2, 4, 28
Node 26: 29, 22
Node 27: 7, 3, 20
Node 28: 8, 24, 29, 0
Node 29: 8, 28, 26

Now, we can identify the 3-star configurations:

Node 8, 23, 29: 1 3-star
Node 9, 16, 23: 1 3-star
Node 2, 18, 24: 1 3-star
Node 21, 12, 17: 1 3-star
Node 4, 19, 14: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 5, so the final number inside brackets is [5].

Unique 3-stars:
<8, 23, 29>
<9, 16, 23>
<2, 18, 24>
<21, 12, 17>
<4, 19, 14>
