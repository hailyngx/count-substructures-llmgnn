Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 = 24

Therefore, the final answer is [24], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
