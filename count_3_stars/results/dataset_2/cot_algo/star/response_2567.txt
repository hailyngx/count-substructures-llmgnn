Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 1: 0, 7, 8, 9
Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 3: 0, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 2, 8
Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 9
Node 6: 2, 5, 8, 9
Node 7: 0, 1
Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9
Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 5, 6, and 9 each have exactly 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 3-star each.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 23, so the answer is [23].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
