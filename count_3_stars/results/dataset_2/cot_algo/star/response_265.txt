Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 3) (8, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 9} 
- Node 8: {3}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 4 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 3 forms 20 3-stars: 
  - <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, 
  - <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, 
  - <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, 
  - <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 2)>
- Node 6 forms 10 3-stars: 
  - <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, 
  - <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 1, 9)>

So, there are a total of 4 + 20 + 10 = 34 3-stars in this graph. 
Therefore, the answer is [34].
