Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 3) (4, 11) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 8) 

Response:
We will first find all the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {9, 11, 7, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {11, 7, 2, 8, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {9, 10, 8, 1, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {6, 8, 14, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbor = {11}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {9, 14, 10, 3, 12}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {10, 12, 0, 1, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {11, 7, 2, 14, 3, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {6, 2, 0}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {6, 11, 7, 2}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {10, 1, 0, 13, 8, 4}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {6, 7, 13, 1}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {11, 12, 3}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {6, 2, 8, 0, 3}

Now, we'll check the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 2, 6, 7, 8, 11, and 14 have three or more neighbors.

For these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars each can form:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from these nodes, we get a total of 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 84.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [84].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 7, 11>, <0, 7, 14>, <0, 8, 11>, <0, 8, 14>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 7, 10>, <2, 7, 14>, <2, 8, 14>, <6, 10, 12>, <6, 10, 14>, <6, 12, 14>, <7, 10, 12>, <7, 10, 14>, <7, 12, 14>, <8, 11, 13>, <8, 11, 4>, <8, 13, 14>, <11, 12, 13>, <11, 13, 14>.
