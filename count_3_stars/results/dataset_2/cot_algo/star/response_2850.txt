Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 18) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 15) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 11) (18, 14) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 15) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 6) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 5) (16, 6) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 16) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 16) (4, 1) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 4) 

Response:
The central nodes of the 3-star graphs are: 1, 3, 10, 11, and 19. 

1. For node 1:
   - Neighbors: 3, 4, 12, 19
   - Possible 3-stars: 1

2. For node 3:
   - Neighbors: 1, 6, 9, 14
   - Possible 3-stars: \[inom{4}{3}\] = 4

3. For node 10:
   - Neighbors: 7, 11, 12, 17
   - Possible 3-stars: \[inom{4}{3}\] = 4

4. For node 11:
   - Neighbors: 9, 10, 18
   - Possible 3-stars: 1

5. For node 19:
   - Neighbors: 1, 2, 8, 15
   - Possible 3-stars: \[inom{4}{3}\] = 4

Total 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 14

<1, 3, 12>
<1, 3, 19>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 19>
<3, 6, 14>
<3, 9, 14>
<10, 7, 17>
<10, 11, 17>
<10, 12, 17>
<10, 11, 12>
<11, 9, 18>
<19, 8, 15>
<19, 1, 15>
<19, 2, 15>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
