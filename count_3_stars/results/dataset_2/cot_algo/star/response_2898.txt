Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 10) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 14) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 14) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's start by identifying the neighbor sets for each node:

1. Node 0: {13, 14, 2, 4}
2. Node 1: {9, 3, 7, 12}
3. Node 2: {5, 6, 10, 13, 0}
4. Node 3: {5, 1, 10, 12, 8}
5. Node 4: {9, 6, 0, 14}
6. Node 5: {9, 2, 8, 3}
7. Node 6: {9, 7, 2, 4}
8. Node 7: {9, 6, 1, 13}
9. Node 8: {5, 3, 14}
10. Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 10, 1, 7}
11. Node 10: {9, 3, 11, 13, 2}
12. Node 11: {10}
13. Node 12: {1, 3, 14}
14. Node 13: {10, 2, 7, 0}
15. Node 14: {8, 12, 0, 4}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

1. Node 2 and Node 6 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form 10 3-stars each.
2. Node 1, Node 3, Node 7, Node 9, and Node 13 have 6 neighbors each, so they can form 20 3-stars each.
3. Node 0 and Node 4 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form 4 3-stars each.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 108.

Therefore, the answer is [108].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
