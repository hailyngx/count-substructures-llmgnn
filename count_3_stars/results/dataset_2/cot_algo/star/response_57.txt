Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (14, 13) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 19) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 18) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 2) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 4) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 18) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 18) (1, 8) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 7) (2, 9) (2, 19) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 8) (18, 13) (18, 15) (18, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 8, 12, 17}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 8, 13, 18}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 9, 19}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 13, 17}
- Node 4: {2, 10, 12}
- Node 5: {3, 13, 19}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 17}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 12}
- Node 10: {4, 12, 15}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 5, 14, 15, 18}
- Node 14: {13}
- Node 15: {10, 13, 18}
- Node 17: {0, 3, 6, 8, 19}
- Node 18: {1, 13, 15}
- Node 19: {2, 5, 17}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars: 

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19

Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{13}{3} = 286 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [286].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 12>, <0, 1, 17>, <0, 8, 17>, <1, 13, 18>, <2, 9, 12>, <3, 5, 13>, <3, 13, 17>, <3, 13, 5>, <3, 17, 19>, <6, 1, 8>, <6, 8, 17>, <8, 1, 6>, <8, 1, 13>, <8, 3, 7>, <12, 0, 4>, <13, 1, 18>, <13, 5, 19>, <13, 15, 18>, <15, 10, 13>
