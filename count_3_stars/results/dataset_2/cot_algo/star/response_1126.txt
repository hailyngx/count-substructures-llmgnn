Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 7) (5, 10) (5, 7) (13, 3) (0, 19) (0, 9) (16, 17) (16, 6) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 2) (6, 17) (6, 16) (6, 7) (6, 15) (1, 2) (1, 19) (19, 0) (19, 11) (19, 1) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 12) (7, 17) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 18) (4, 15) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 18) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 12) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 3) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 3) (18, 17) (18, 7) (18, 15) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {19, 9}
- Node 1: {19, 2}
- Node 2: {1, 11, 9}
- Node 3: {13, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {15}
- Node 5: {10, 7}
- Node 6: {17, 16, 7, 15}
- Node 7: {17, 5, 6, 18}
- Node 8: {14, 15, 12}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 10: {14, 5, 3}
- Node 11: {14, 19, 2}
- Node 12: {14, 8, 3}
- Node 13: {3}
- Node 14: {17, 11, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 15: {6, 8, 4, 18}
- Node 16: {17, 6}
- Node 17: {14, 6, 16, 18, 7}
- Node 18: {17, 7, 15}
- Node 19: {0, 11, 1}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 29 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [29].

The unique 3-stars found are as follows:
- <14, 11, 8, 12>
- <17, 6, 16, 18>
- <6, 8, 15, 18>
- <7, 5, 10, 3>
