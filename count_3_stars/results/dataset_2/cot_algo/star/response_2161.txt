Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 17) (14, 11) (14, 15) (17, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 13) (10, 19) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 18) (8, 19) (8, 0) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 11) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 4) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 18) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 12) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 13) (4, 0) (4, 13) (15, 9) (15, 14) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 4) (18, 7) (18, 6) (18, 16) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 8, 16, 4
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3
- Node 2: 1, 7, 9, 12
- Node 3: 1, 6, 12, 19
- Node 4: 0, 13
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 3, 5, 12, 18
- Node 7: 2, 13, 18
- Node 8: 0, 19
- Node 9: 2, 11, 15, 17
- Node 10: 13, 19
- Node 11: 9, 13, 14, 19
- Node 12: 2, 3, 6
- Node 13: 4, 7, 10, 11, 16
- Node 14: 11, 15
- Node 15: 9, 14
- Node 16: 0, 13, 18
- Node 17: 9
- Node 18: 6, 7, 16
- Node 19: 3, 8, 10, 11

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors, forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: 3 neighbors, does not form any 3-star
- Node 2: 4 neighbors, forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 neighbors, forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 11: 4 neighbors, forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 3 neighbors, does not form any 3-star
- Node 13: 5 neighbors, forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 16: 3 neighbors, does not form any 3-star
- Node 18: 3 neighbors, does not form any 3-star
- Node 19: 4 neighbors, forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30].
