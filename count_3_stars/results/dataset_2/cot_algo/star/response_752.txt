Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 20) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 17) (20, 9) (20, 25) (20, 19) (20, 23) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 12) (25, 10) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 12) (23, 20) (23, 8) (23, 27) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 28) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 24) (18, 28) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 17) (26, 18) (26, 2) (13, 21) (13, 6) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 27) (17, 15) (17, 22) (17, 1) (17, 6) (24, 18) (24, 0) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 20) (10, 25) (10, 21) (10, 14) (21, 13) (21, 10) (21, 29) (27, 5) (27, 25) (27, 23) (27, 1) (2, 5) (2, 22) (2, 26) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 12) (7, 3) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 10) (29, 1) (29, 21) (29, 6) (6, 11) (6, 15) (6, 13) (6, 17) (6, 29) (12, 25) (12, 8) (12, 0) (28, 4) (28, 18) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {3, 24}
- Node 1: {17, 27, 29}
- Node 2: {5, 22, 26}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 15, 22}
- Node 4: {8, 18, 28}
- Node 5: {2, 9, 19, 27}
- Node 6: {11, 13, 15, 17, 29}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {4, 12, 23}
- Node 9: {5, 14, 20}
- Node 10: {14, 21, 25}
- Node 11: {6, 19}
- Node 12: {0, 8, 25}
- Node 13: {6, 21}
- Node 14: {9, 10, 16}
- Node 15: {3, 6, 17}
- Node 16: {14}
- Node 17: {1, 15, 22, 6}
- Node 18: {4, 24, 26, 28}
- Node 19: {5, 11, 20}
- Node 20: {9, 19, 23, 25}
- Node 21: {10, 13, 29}
- Node 22: {2, 3, 17}
- Node 23: {8, 20, 27}
- Node 24: {0, 18}
- Node 25: {10, 12, 20, 27}
- Node 26: {2, 18}
- Node 27: {1, 5, 23, 25}
- Node 28: {4, 18}
- Node 29: {1, 6, 21}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5 and Node 27 each have 4 neighbors, so they form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 6, 9, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 25 each have 5 neighbors, so they form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total 3-stars = 4(2) + 10(9) + 1 = 8 + 90 + 1 = 99

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [99], and they are:
<5, (9, 19, 27)>, <27, (5, 23, 25)>, <6, (15, 17, 29)>, <9, (5, 14, 20)>, <14, (9, 10, 16)>, <17, (1, 15, 22)>, <18, (4, 24, 26)>, <19, (5, 20, 27)>, <20, (9, 19, 25)>, <21, (10, 13, 29)>.
