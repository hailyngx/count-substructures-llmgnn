Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 6) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 12) 

Response:
From the given information, we can first construct the adjacency list representation of the graph, which helps to visualize the connections between nodes:
```plaintext
1: 7, 10
2: 11, 5, 6, 8, 14
3: 14, 6, 9
4: 12, 10, 5
5: 4, 10, 2, 14
6: 7, 3, 2, 0, 12
7: 6, 9, 13, 1
8: 2, 9, 0
9: 7, 3, 8, 0, 13
0: 11, 8, 6, 9
10: 4, 1, 11, 12, 5
11: 10, 0, 13, 2
12: 4, 10, 2, 13, 6
13: 7, 11, 12, 9
14: 3, 2, 5
```

Now, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1 neighbors: (7, 10)
- Node 2 neighbors: (11, 5, 6, 8, 14)
- Node 3 neighbors: (14, 6, 9)
- Node 4 neighbors: (12, 10, 5)
- Node 5 neighbors: (4, 10, 2, 14)
- Node 6 neighbors: (7, 3, 2, 0, 12)
- Node 7 neighbors: (6, 9, 13, 1)
- Node 8 neighbors: (2, 9, 0)
- Node 9 neighbors: (7, 3, 8, 0, 13)
- Node 10 neighbors: (4, 1, 11, 12, 5)
- Node 11 neighbors: (10, 0, 13, 2)
- Node 12 neighbors: (4, 10, 2, 13, 6)
- Node 13 neighbors: (7, 11, 12, 9)
- Node 14 neighbors: (3, 2, 5)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them.
- Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} \) = 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 64

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [64].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <2, (5, 6, 14)>
- <4, (10, 5, 12)>
- <5, (4, 10, 14)>
- <6, (2, 12, 7)>
- <10, (4, 5, 12)>
- <12, (4, 10, 2)>
