Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 13) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 26) (25, 15) (8, 27) (13, 3) (13, 17) (7, 21) (7, 12) (21, 7) (21, 16) (22, 9) (22, 5) (22, 12) (22, 1) (23, 3) (23, 29) (23, 0) (23, 9) (4, 24) (4, 16) (4, 26) (4, 2) (12, 7) (12, 22) (12, 1) (17, 13) (17, 29) (17, 15) (29, 23) (29, 17) (29, 6) (10, 6) (9, 22) (9, 23) (26, 25) (26, 4) (26, 0) (16, 21) (16, 4) (16, 28) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 27) (28, 5) (5, 22) (5, 28) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 24) (14, 27) (14, 24) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 11) (0, 23) (0, 26) (11, 18) (11, 24) (11, 1) (11, 20) (24, 4) (24, 19) (24, 14) (24, 11) (24, 27) (1, 22) (1, 12) (1, 28) (1, 11) (6, 29) (6, 10) (20, 11) (20, 27) (27, 8) (27, 28) (27, 14) (27, 24) (27, 20) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 2) (2, 4) (2, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {23, 26}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {11, 12, 22, 28}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {4, 15}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {13, 23, 25}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {2, 16, 24, 26}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {15, 19, 22, 28}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {10, 29}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {12, 16, 21}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {27}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {22, 23}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {6}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {1, 20, 24}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {1, 7, 22}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {3, 17}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {24, 27}
- Node 15: Neighbors = {2, 5, 17, 18, 25}
- Node 16: Neighbors = {4, 7, 21, 28}
- Node 17: Neighbors = {13, 15, 29}
- Node 18: Neighbors = {11, 15, 19}
- Node 19: Neighbors = {5, 18, 24}
- Node 20: Neighbors = {11, 27}
- Node 21: Neighbors = {7, 16}
- Node 22: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9, 12}
- Node 23: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9, 29}
- Node 24: Neighbors = {4, 11, 14, 19, 27}
- Node 25: Neighbors = {3, 15, 25}
- Node 26: Neighbors = {0, 4, 25}
- Node 27: Neighbors = {8, 14, 20, 24, 28}
- Node 28: Neighbors = {1, 5, 16, 27}
- Node 29: Neighbors = {6, 17, 23}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1, 3-stars: 1 (\(inom{4}{3}\) = 4)
- Node 5, 3-stars: 1 (\(inom{4}{3}\) = 4)
- Node 15, 3-stars: 1 (\(inom{5}{3}\) = 10)
- Node 17, 3-stars: 1 (\(inom{3}{3}\) = 1)
- Node 22, 3-stars: 1 (\(inom{4}{3}\) = 4)
- Node 24, 3-stars: 1 (\(inom{5}{3}\) = 10)
- Node 27, 3-stars: 1 (\(inom{5}{3}\) = 10)
- Node 28, 3-stars: 1 (\(inom{4}{3}\) = 4)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 47

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [47]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 11, 12> 
<5, 15, 28>
<15, 17, 29>
<17, 13, 3>
<22, 1, 12>
<24, 19, 11>
<27, 24, 14>
<28, 1, 11>
