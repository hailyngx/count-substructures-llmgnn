Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (16, 7) (16, 22) (16, 25) (16, 4) (3, 10) (3, 27) (3, 19) (25, 16) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 2) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 29) (13, 20) (15, 20) (15, 22) (15, 17) (15, 2) (20, 13) (20, 15) (20, 6) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 28) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 5) (28, 4) (28, 22) (28, 12) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 0) (6, 20) (6, 21) (6, 17) (21, 13) (21, 6) (21, 26) (21, 14) (9, 8) (9, 22) (9, 29) (22, 16) (22, 15) (22, 28) (22, 9) (22, 24) (17, 15) (17, 5) (17, 6) (29, 13) (29, 9) (29, 1) (29, 27) (26, 18) (26, 21) (26, 23) (7, 16) (7, 23) (7, 14) (7, 27) (24, 22) (23, 26) (23, 7) (23, 12) (2, 25) (2, 15) (12, 28) (12, 23) (10, 3) (1, 25) (1, 29) (27, 3) (27, 29) (27, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 19) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 0) (14, 21) (14, 7) 

Response:
From the given information, we can construct the following neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 5, 19}
- Node 1: {25, 29}
- Node 2: {15, 25}
- Node 3: {10, 27, 19}
- Node 4: {16, 18, 28}
- Node 5: {13, 18, 17, 0}
- Node 6: {20, 21, 17}
- Node 7: {16, 23, 14, 27}
- Node 8: {13, 9, 0}
- Node 9: {8, 22, 29}
- Node 10: {3}
- Node 12: {28, 23}
- Node 13: {8, 5, 21, 20, 29}
- Node 14: {7, 21}
- Node 15: {20, 22, 2, 17}
- Node 16: {7, 25, 4}
- Node 17: {15, 5, 6}
- Node 18: {4, 5, 26}
- Node 19: {3, 25, 0}
- Node 20: {13, 15, 6}
- Node 21: {13, 6, 26, 14}
- Node 22: {16, 15, 28, 9, 24}
- Node 23: {26, 7, 12}
- Node 24: {22}
- Node 25: {16, 1, 19, 2}
- Node 26: {18, 21, 23}
- Node 27: {3, 7, 29}
- Node 28: {4, 22, 12}
- Node 29: {13, 1, 27, 9}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 31 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [31], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<13, (8, 5, 20)>, <13, (8, 5, 21)>, <13, (8, 5, 29)>, <13, (8, 20, 21)>, <13, (8, 20, 29)>, <13, (8, 21, 29)>, <13, (5, 20, 21)>, <13, (5, 20, 29)>, <13, (5, 21, 29)>, <13, (20, 21, 29)>, <5, (13, 18, 17)>, <5, (13, 18, 0)>, <5, (13, 17, 0)>, <5, (18, 17, 0)>, <21, (13, 6, 14)>, <21, (13, 6, 26)>, <21, (13, 14, 26)>, <21, (6, 14, 26)>, <15, (20, 6, 17)>, <15, (20, 6, 22)>, <15, (20, 17, 22)>, <15, (6, 17, 22)>, <7, (16, 23, 14)>, <7, (16, 23, 27)>, <7, (16, 14, 27)>, <7, (23, 14, 27)>, <25, (16, 19, 0)>, <25, (16, 19, 2)>, <25, (16, 0, 2)>, <25, (19, 0, 2)>, <16, (25, 4, 18)>.
