Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 10) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 13) (11, 4) (11, 9) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (5, 0) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 2) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 6, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {8, 9, 13, 2}
- Node 2: {1, 10}
- Node 3: {10, 12}
- Node 4: {7, 11, 12, 8}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {0, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {4, 9, 12}
- Node 12: {3, 4, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 6, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 6, 9, 13}

Next, we can identify which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0: 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: 3-stars = 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: 3-stars = inom{5}{3} + 1 = 11
- Node 9: 3-stars = inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 10: 3-stars = inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 12: 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 13: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 94

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [94].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, 5, 6, 13>, <0, 5, 6, 14>, <0, 5, 13, 14>, <0, 6, 13, 14>, <7, 4, 11, 12>, <7, 4, 8, 11>, <7, 4, 8, 12>, <7, 4, 11, 8>, <7, 8, 10, 12>, <1, 2, 8, 9>, <1, 2, 8, 10>, <1, 8, 9, 13>, <1, 8, 9, 10>, <9, 11, 12, 14>, <9, 10, 11, 12>, <9, 10, 11, 14>, <9, 10, 12, 14>, <10, 12, 2, 3>
