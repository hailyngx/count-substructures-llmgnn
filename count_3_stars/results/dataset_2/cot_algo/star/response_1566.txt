Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 6) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 7, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 6, 10}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 4, 11}

Next, we identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 10, Node 12, and Node 14

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of unique 3-stars they are part of:
\[ inom{6}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{6}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{6}{3} + inom{6}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} \]

Solving this sum, we get: 
\[ 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 117 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [117]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 8, 9>, 
<1, 7, 9>, 
<1, 9, 13>, 
<1, 9, 8>, 
<3, 7, 10>, 
<3, 10, 12>, 
<3, 10, 8>, 
<4, 10, 12>, 
<4, 10, 14>, 
<5, 0, 2>, 
<5, 0, 6>, 
<6, 7, 11>, 
<8, 0, 1>, 
<8, 0, 12>, 
<8, 1, 3>, 
<8, 1, 9>, 
<8, 3, 10>, 
<8, 10, 12>, 
<10, 3, 7>, 
<10, 4, 12>, 
<12, 3, 8>, 
<12, 4, 10>, 
<14, 0, 4>, 
<14, 0, 11>
