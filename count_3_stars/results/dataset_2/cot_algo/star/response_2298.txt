Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 20) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 25) (5, 12) (9, 17) (9, 24) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 27) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 27) (17, 21) (1, 26) (1, 19) (3, 28) (20, 11) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 22) (25, 11) (25, 16) (25, 20) (25, 23) (13, 11) (13, 4) (22, 20) (12, 5) (12, 21) (27, 14) (27, 17) (27, 10) (27, 19) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 15) (29, 17) (29, 4) (29, 18) (19, 1) (19, 27) (19, 26) (19, 4) (19, 6) (24, 9) (24, 26) (10, 27) (10, 7) (15, 26) (15, 0) (15, 18) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 23) (28, 3) (28, 18) (21, 17) (21, 12) (21, 8) (21, 23) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 6) (7, 18) (4, 13) (4, 29) (4, 19) (4, 23) (8, 20) (8, 21) (23, 25) (23, 0) (23, 21) (23, 4) (18, 29) (18, 15) (18, 28) (18, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {16, 15, 23}
- Node 1: {26, 19}
- Node 3: {28}
- Node 4: {13, 29, 19, 23}
- Node 5: {12}
- Node 6: {11, 14, 19, 7}
- Node 7: {9, 10, 6, 18}
- Node 8: {20, 21}
- Node 9: {17, 24, 7}
- Node 10: {27, 7}
- Node 11: {16, 13, 6, 20, 25}
- Node 12: {5, 21}
- Node 13: {11, 4}
- Node 14: {17, 6, 27}
- Node 15: {26, 0, 18}
- Node 16: {11, 0, 25}
- Node 17: {9, 14, 27, 29, 21}
- Node 18: {29, 15, 28, 7}
- Node 19: {1, 27, 26, 4, 6}
- Node 20: {11, 25, 8, 22}
- Node 21: {17, 12, 8, 23}
- Node 22: {20}
- Node 23: {25, 0, 21, 4}
- Node 24: {9, 26}
- Node 25: {11, 16, 20, 23}
- Node 26: {1, 19, 24, 15}
- Node 27: {14, 17, 10, 19}
- Node 28: {3, 18}
- Node 29: {17, 4, 18}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars and count them:
- Node 11: {16, 13, 6, 20, 25} --> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 17: {9, 14, 27, 29, 21} --> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 19: {1, 27, 26, 4, 6} --> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: {13, 29, 19, 23} --> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 18: {29, 15, 28, 7} --> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Adding them up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <11, 16, 13, 6>
- <11, 16, 13, 20>
- <11, 16, 13, 25>
- <11, 16, 6, 20>
- <11, 16, 6, 25>
- <11, 16, 20, 25>
- <17, 9, 14, 27>
- <17, 9, 14, 29>
- <17, 9, 14, 21>
- <17, 9, 27, 29>
- <17, 9, 27, 21>
- <17, 9, 29, 21>
- <17, 14, 27, 29>
- <17, 14, 27, 21>
- <17, 14, 29, 21>
- <17, 27, 29, 21>
- <19, 1, 27, 26>
- <19, 1, 27, 4>
- <19, 1, 27, 6>
- <19, 1, 26, 4>
- <19, 1, 26, 6>
- <19, 1, 4, 6>
- <4, 13, 29, 23>
- <18, 29, 15, 28>
- <18, 29, 15, 7>
- <18, 29, 28, 7>
- <18, 15, 28, 7>
