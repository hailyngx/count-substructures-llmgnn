Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 22) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 26) (3, 17) (3, 4) (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 12) (1, 21) (1, 10) (21, 1) (21, 23) (21, 22) (21, 29) (27, 17) (4, 3) (4, 13) (8, 28) (8, 10) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 18) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 29) (6, 22) (6, 26) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 26) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 29) (13, 4) (13, 5) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 24) (0, 17) (17, 3) (17, 27) (17, 5) (17, 0) (23, 11) (23, 21) (23, 19) (14, 28) (14, 29) (26, 16) (26, 5) (26, 6) (26, 7) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 9) (28, 8) (28, 14) (28, 18) (9, 10) (25, 15) (25, 19) (25, 24) (20, 7) (20, 22) (20, 24) (19, 23) (19, 25) (29, 11) (29, 21) (29, 6) (29, 12) (29, 14) (24, 0) (24, 25) (24, 20) (18, 5) (18, 28) (22, 11) (22, 15) (22, 21) (22, 6) (22, 20) 

Response:
The 3-star graph in this scenario can be found by first determining the neighbors for each node:

1. Node 0: {7, 10, 17, 24}
2. Node 1: {10, 21, 22, 23}
3. Node 3: {4, 16, 17}
4. Node 4: {3, 13}
5. Node 5: {6, 13, 17, 18, 26}
6. Node 6: {5, 22, 26, 29}
7. Node 7: {0, 12, 20, 26}
8. Node 8: {10, 12, 14, 28}
9. Node 9: {10}
10. Node 10: {0, 1, 8, 9}
11. Node 11: {16, 21, 22, 23, 29}
12. Node 12: {7, 8, 15, 29}
13. Node 13: {4, 5}
14. Node 14: {28, 29}
15. Node 15: {12, 22, 25}
16. Node 16: {3, 11, 26}
17. Node 17: {0, 3, 5, 27}
18. Node 18: {5, 28}
19. Node 19: {23, 25}
20. Node 20: {7, 22, 24}
21. Node 21: {1, 21, 23, 29}
22. Node 22: {5, 6, 11, 15, 20}
23. Node 23: {1, 11, 19, 21}
24. Node 24: {0, 20, 25}
25. Node 25: {15, 19, 24}
26. Node 26: {5, 6, 7, 16}
27. Node 27: {17}
28. Node 28: {8, 14, 18}
29. Node 29: {6, 11, 12, 14, 21}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0, Node 10, Node 12, Node 14, Node 21, Node 24, and Node 28 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they each form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars formed is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 48 \).

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, 7, 24>, <0, 10, 24>, <0, 17, 24>, <0, 24, 25>, <1, 10, 21>, <5, 6, 17>, <5, 13, 17>, <5, 17, 18>, <5, 17, 26>, <5, 18, 28>, <6, 22, 29>, <7, 12, 26>, <8, 10, 28>, <10, 21, 23>, <11, 16, 26>, <11, 21, 29>, <12, 15, 22>, <12, 15, 25>, <12, 29, 14>, <14, 28, 18>, <15, 22, 20>, <16, 26, 7>, <21, 23, 19>, <22, 11, 15>, <22, 11, 21>, <22, 20, 24>, <26, 16, 5>, <26, 16, 6>, <26, 5, 6>, <26, 7, 12>, <29, 6, 14>
