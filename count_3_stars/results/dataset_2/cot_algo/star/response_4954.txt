Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: (7, 1, 8, 5)
- Node 1: (6, 2, 0, 8)
- Node 2: (4, 6, 1, 3, 5)
- Node 3: (2, 5, 8)
- Node 4: (8, 9, 2)
- Node 5: (6, 3, 8, 0, 2)
- Node 6: (7, 5, 1, 2)
- Node 7: (0, 6, 9)
- Node 8: (4, 1, 3, 8, 0, 5, 9)
- Node 9: (4, 7, 8)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 5)>
<1, (6, 2, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 5)>
<5, (3, 8, 0)>
<6, (7, 5, 2)>
<8, (4, 1, 9)>
