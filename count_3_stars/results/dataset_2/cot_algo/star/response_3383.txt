Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 5) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 15) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 15) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (18, 6) (18, 15) (19, 15) (19, 0) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 19) (0, 6) (0, 17) (0, 19) (3, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 13) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 10) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 5) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 17, 19
- Node 1: 11, 7, 2, 13
- Node 2: 8, 1, 15
- Node 3: 10
- Node 4: 6, 7, 14
- Node 5: 11, 16, 8, 10
- Node 6: 9, 17, 18, 4, 0
- Node 7: 4, 12, 10, 1
- Node 8: 9, 2, 5
- Node 9: 6, 8, 10
- Node 10: 9, 7, 3, 5
- Node 11: 16, 1, 5
- Node 12: 7, 14
- Node 13: 14, 1
- Node 14: 4, 12, 13
- Node 15: 17, 2, 18, 19
- Node 16: 11, 5
- Node 17: 6, 0, 15
- Node 18: 6, 15
- Node 19: 15, 0

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 1: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 2: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 4: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 5: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 6: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 7: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 8: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 9: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 10: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 11: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 14: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 15: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 17: C(3, 3) = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 37

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [37]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 6, 17, 19>
- <1, 7, 2, 13>
- <4, 6, 7, 14>
- <5, 11, 16, 8>
- <6, 9, 17, 18>
- <7, 4, 12, 14>
- <8, 9, 2, 5>
- <9, 6, 8, 10>
- <10, 7, 3, 5>
- <11, 16, 5>
- <14, 4, 12, 13>
- <15, 17, 2, 18>
- <17, 6, 0>
