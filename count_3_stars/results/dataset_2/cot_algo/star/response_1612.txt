Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 2}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 7, 8}

Now, we'll check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 2: has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 6: has 6 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8: has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

So, the final answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
