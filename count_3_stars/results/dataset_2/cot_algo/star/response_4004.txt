Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 7
- Node 6: 1, 4
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 8

We can see that nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 8 each have 5 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars centered at these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 60 3-stars in the graph, which can be represented as [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
