Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 28) (17, 5) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 14) (20, 15) (20, 18) (20, 5) (29, 16) (29, 3) (7, 11) (12, 2) (12, 5) (24, 26) (24, 18) (26, 24) (4, 27) (4, 22) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 21) (27, 4) (27, 22) (27, 6) (1, 28) (1, 13) (3, 29) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 18) (8, 9) (8, 22) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 21) (9, 28) (9, 14) (21, 4) (21, 9) (5, 17) (5, 20) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 25) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 25) (19, 28) (22, 4) (22, 27) (22, 8) (22, 0) (2, 12) (2, 16) (6, 4) (6, 27) (6, 3) (14, 15) (14, 9) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 29) (16, 2) (18, 20) (18, 24) (18, 11) (18, 13) (23, 25) (28, 17) (28, 1) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 25) (0, 11) (0, 22) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 23) (25, 28) (13, 1) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 11, 22
- Node 1: 13, 28
- Node 2: 12, 16
- Node 3: 6, 9, 11, 29
- Node 4: 6, 11, 21, 22, 27
- Node 5: 12, 17, 19, 20, 25
- Node 6: 3, 4, 27
- Node 7: 11
- Node 8: 9, 22
- Node 9: 3, 8, 14, 21, 28
- Node 10: 16, 17
- Node 11: 0, 3, 4, 7, 18
- Node 12: 2, 5
- Node 13: 1, 18
- Node 14: 9, 15
- Node 15: 14, 19, 20
- Node 16: 2, 10, 29
- Node 17: 5, 10, 16, 28
- Node 18: 11, 13, 20, 24
- Node 19: 5, 15, 19, 25, 28
- Node 20: 5, 15, 18
- Node 21: 4, 9
- Node 22: 0, 4, 8, 27
- Node 23: 25
- Node 24: 18, 26
- Node 25: 5, 19, 23, 28
- Node 26: 24
- Node 27: 4, 6, 22
- Node 28: 1, 9, 17, 19, 25
- Node 29: 3, 16

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 70. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].

The unique 3-stars are:
