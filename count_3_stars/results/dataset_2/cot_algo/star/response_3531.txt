Response:
To find the number of 3-star graphs in the given network, we first need to identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors. Then we can calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of those nodes.

From the provided list of edges, we can see that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
9. Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
11. Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
12. Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
13. Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
14. Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
15. Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
16. Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
17. Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
18. Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
19. Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
20. Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
21. Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
22. Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives: \[10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 72\]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [72].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, 7, 10>, <4, 2, 7>, <4, 2, 24>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 7, 27>, <5, 10, 2>, <6, 7, 19>, <10, 2, 4>, <11, 7, 26>, <13, 27, 29>, <15, 29, 3>, <16, 24, 7>, <19, 6, 28>, <20, 15, 26>, <21, 26, 22>, <22, 18, 21>, <22, 21, 26>, <24, 3, 15>, <26, 1, 17>, <26, 18, 22>, <27, 4, 13>, <28, 10, 19>, <29, 3, 15>
