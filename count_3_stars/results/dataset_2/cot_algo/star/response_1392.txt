Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 13) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {2, 7, 10}
- Node 2: {1, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 4: {5, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 8, 10}
- Node 6: {3, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {1, 3}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 10, 11}
- Node 10: {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 11: {6, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {3, 4, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 4, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 8, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with {3, 5, 13} and {3, 9, 14}. (2 3-stars)
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with {5, 8, 11} and {5, 12, 13}. (2 3-stars)
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with {4, 8, 10}. (1 3-star)
- Node 8 forms 3-stars with {11, 13, 14}. (1 3-star)
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with {8, 9, 13}. (1 3-star)

The total number of 3-stars is 7, so the final answer is [7].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 5, 13)>, <0, (3, 9, 14)>, <3, (5, 8, 11)>, <3, (5, 12, 13)>, <5, (4, 8, 10)>, <8, (11, 13, 14)>, <11, (8, 9, 13)>
