Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 2) (1, 25) (1, 19) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 20) (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 15) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 8) (22, 26) (22, 7) (7, 22) (7, 0) (20, 21) (20, 25) (20, 23) (25, 1) (25, 20) (25, 23) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 9) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 6) (27, 14) (27, 9) (27, 16) (27, 23) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 29) (19, 1) (26, 18) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 6) (24, 26) (24, 0) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 2) (15, 17) (15, 5) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 23) (0, 7) (0, 24) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 27) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 12) (6, 26) (29, 4) (29, 16) (29, 8) (28, 17) (16, 27) (16, 29) (8, 18) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 29) (23, 20) (23, 25) (23, 27) (23, 13) (5, 15) (5, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:

Node 0: {3, 5, 7, 9, 24}
Node 1: {2, 12, 19, 21, 25}
Node 2: {1, 11, 12, 13}
Node 3: {0, 8, 11}
Node 4: {9, 18, 29}
Node 5: {0, 15}
Node 6: {12, 26}
Node 7: {0, 22}
Node 8: {3, 8, 10, 18, 29}
Node 9: {0, 4, 9, 10, 13, 14, 27}
Node 10: {8, 9, 17}
Node 11: {2, 3}
Node 12: {1, 2, 6}
Node 13: {2, 9, 13, 23, 27}
Node 14: {9, 13, 17, 27}
Node 15: {5, 17}
Node 16: {27, 29}
Node 17: {10, 14, 15, 17, 28}
Node 18: {4, 8, 26}
Node 19: {1}
Node 20: {21, 23, 25}
Node 21: {1, 20}
Node 22: {7, 26}
Node 23: {13, 20, 23, 25, 27}
Node 24: {0, 26}
Node 25: {1, 20, 23}
Node 26: {6, 18, 22, 24}
Node 27: {9, 13, 14, 16, 23, 27}
Node 28: {17}
Node 29: {4, 8, 16, 29}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 5 neighbors: Node 0, Node 9, and Node 27
Nodes with 4 neighbors: Node 23
Nodes with 3 neighbors: None

For nodes with 5 neighbors:
\( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10
\( \binom{7}{3} \) = 35
\( \binom{6}{3} \) = 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 35 + 20 = 65

Therefore, the final answer is [65]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 24)>
<0, (7, 9, 24)>
<9, (4, 10, 13)>
<9, (4, 13, 27)>
<9, (10, 13, 27)>
<27, (13, 16, 29)>
<27, (13, 23, 25)>
