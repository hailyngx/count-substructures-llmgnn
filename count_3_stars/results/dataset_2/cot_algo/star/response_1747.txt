Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 0) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {9, 8, 13, 7}
Node 1: {3, 11, 14}
Node 2: {5, 9, 11, 4, 10}
Node 3: {1, 11, 8}
Node 4: {9, 6, 14, 11, 2}
Node 5: {13, 2, 7}
Node 6: {14, 10, 4}
Node 7: {5, 12, 0, 10}
Node 8: {3, 13, 10, 0}
Node 9: {4, 2, 0, 12}
Node 10: {8, 13, 6, 7, 14, 2}
Node 11: {1, 3, 12, 4, 2}
Node 12: {9, 7, 11}
Node 13: {5, 8, 10, 0}
Node 14: {1, 6, 4, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes forming 3-stars: 2, 4, 10, 11

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they can form using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 50, which we write as [50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (5, 11, 10)>
<4, (9, 6, 14)>
<10, (8, 13, 14)>
<11, (1, 3, 12)>
