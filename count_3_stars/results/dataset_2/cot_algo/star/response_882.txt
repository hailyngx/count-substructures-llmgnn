Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 17) (6, 14) (9, 22) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 7) (25, 19) (25, 8) (25, 18) (8, 25) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 27) (22, 3) (22, 9) (22, 28) (23, 26) (23, 16) (23, 20) (27, 13) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 28) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 27) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 21) (12, 1) (24, 26) (24, 16) (24, 10) (24, 20) (26, 23) (26, 24) (26, 0) (11, 28) (11, 5) (11, 20) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 11) (28, 2) (18, 25) (18, 27) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 24) (16, 10) (21, 12) (1, 12) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 19) (29, 15) (29, 1) (14, 6) (14, 27) (20, 23) (20, 24) (20, 11) (20, 1) (2, 7) (2, 28) (2, 0) (19, 25) (19, 1) (17, 15) (17, 9) (0, 4) (0, 26) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 24) (10, 16) (5, 4) (5, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 26
- Node 1: 12, 19, 20, 29
- Node 2: 0, 7, 28
- Node 3: 15, 22
- Node 4: 0, 8, 10, 28, 5
- Node 5: 4, 11
- Node 6: 14
- Node 7: 2, 9, 12, 27
- Node 8: 4, 13, 16, 25
- Node 9: 7, 10, 17, 22
- Node 10: 4, 9, 16, 24
- Node 11: 5, 20, 28
- Node 12: 1, 7, 21
- Node 13: 8, 27
- Node 14: 6, 27
- Node 15: 3, 17, 29
- Node 16: 8, 10, 23, 24
- Node 17: 9, 15
- Node 18: 25, 27
- Node 19: 1, 25
- Node 20: 1, 11, 23, 24
- Node 21: 12
- Node 22: 3, 9, 28
- Node 23: 20, 26
- Node 24: 10, 16, 20, 26
- Node 25: 8, 18, 19
- Node 26: 0, 23, 24
- Node 27: 7, 13, 14, 18
- Node 28: 2, 4, 11, 22
- Node 29: 1, 15

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 4, 8, 10, 16, 27 have 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each of these nodes, totaling 20 3-stars.
- The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <4, (0, 8, 10)>
- <8, (4, 16, 25)>
- <10, (4, 16, 24)>
- <16, (8, 10, 24)>
- <27, (7, 13, 14)>
