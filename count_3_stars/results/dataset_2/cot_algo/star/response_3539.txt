Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 1) (8, 14) (8, 9) (8, 10) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 11) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 10) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {7, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 5: {7, 13}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {9, 10, 14}
- Node 9: {8, 10, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 12: {1, 9, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 5, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 7, 14}: <4, (6, 7, 14)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 5}: <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 9, 13}: <12, (1, 9, 13)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors {8, 9, 10}: <14, (8, 9, 10)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have 4 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
