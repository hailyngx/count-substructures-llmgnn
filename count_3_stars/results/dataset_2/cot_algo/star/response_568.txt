Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {9, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {5, 9, 8, 6, 2}
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 7, 1}
- Node 3: neighbors {9, 4, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors {5, 8, 2, 0, 3}
- Node 5: neighbors {9, 6, 8, 1, 4}
- Node 6: neighbors {5, 8, 1, 0}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 3, 2}
- Node 8: neighbors {5, 4, 6, 1}
- Node 9: neighbors {5, 3, 1, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 1: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 4: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 5: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 8: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 9: C(4, 3) = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 4, 6)>
<1, (5, 8, 6)>
<4, (5, 8, 2)>
<5, (9, 8, 4)>
<8, (5, 6, 1)>
<9, (5, 1, 0)>
