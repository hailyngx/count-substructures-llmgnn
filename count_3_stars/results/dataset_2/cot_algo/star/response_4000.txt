Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's find the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 6}
Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 8}
Node 2: {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 3: {1, 8}
Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}
Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 6: {0, 2, 9}
Node 7: {2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 7}
Node 9: {2, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

From the neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes.

For node 2, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 4, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 5, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 7, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 9, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32, which we represent as [32].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
