Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 14
- Node 1: 6, 10, 8, 14, 13
- Node 2: 11, 8, 12, 4, 7
- Node 3: 5, 4, 12
- Node 4: 6, 10, 2, 3, 12
- Node 5: 9, 11, 3, 7
- Node 6: 9, 1, 4
- Node 7: 5, 2, 8, 13
- Node 8: 9, 10, 2, 1, 7
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8, 13, 12
- Node 10: 11, 8, 1, 4
- Node 11: 5, 10, 13, 2
- Node 12: 9, 2, 14, 3, 4
- Node 13: 9, 11, 1, 7
- Node 14: 0, 1, 12

We can see that Node 0 and Node 14 only have one neighbor each, so they cannot form any 3-stars. Nodes 6, 3, and 10 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they each form 1 3-star.

For the other nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars we have calculated, we get a total of 73 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [73], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 3, 12)>
<10, (1, 4, 10)>
<1, (1, 8, 10)>
<2, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 12)>
<5, (5, 7, 11)>
<7, (7, 8, 13)>
<8, (9, 8, 10)>
<9, (9, 12, 13)>
<11, (11, 13, 2)>
<12, (12, 14, 3)>
<13, (13, 7, 1)>
