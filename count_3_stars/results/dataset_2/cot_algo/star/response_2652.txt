Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 14) (6, 15) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 2) (3, 17) (3, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 16) (7, 2) (16, 5) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 10) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 7) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 0) (17, 9) (17, 3) (11, 5) (11, 1) (19, 16) (19, 0) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 15) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in an adjacency list format for easier visualization:

1: {15, 11, 2}
2: {1, 13, 12, 7}
3: {17, 12}
4: {13, 12, 14}
5: {9, 8, 11, 15, 16}
6: {15}
7: {8, 15, 16, 2}
8: {5, 13, 14, 10, 7}
9: {5, 17, 14}
10: {8, 16, 0}
11: {5, 1}
12: {3, 4, 2}
13: {8, 4, 2}
14: {8, 9, 4, 15}
15: {5, 6, 1, 7, 14}
16: {5, 7, 19, 10}
17: {9, 3}
19: {16, 0}
0: {10, 19}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 5: 5 neighbors
Node 8: 5 neighbors
Node 15: 5 neighbors
Node 2: 4 neighbors
Node 4: 3 neighbors
Node 7: 4 neighbors
Node 10: 3 neighbors
Node 9: 3 neighbors
Node 16: 4 neighbors
Node 1: 3 neighbors
Node 14: 4 neighbors
Node 12: 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars formed:
- For nodes with 5 neighbors (5, 8, 15):
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
- For nodes with 4 neighbors (2, 7, 16, 14):
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (8, 15, 16)>
<8, (5, 14, 10)>
<15, (5, 7, 14)>
<2, (1, 13, 12)>
<7, (8, 15, 16)>
<16, (5, 7, 10)>
<14, (8, 9, 15)>
