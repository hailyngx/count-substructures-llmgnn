Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 9, 8, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {5, 4, 6, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 4, 7, 1}
- Node 3: {9, 8, 7, 0}
- Node 4: {1, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 1, 0}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 1}
- Node 7: {9, 0, 3, 2}
- Node 8: {9, 0, 6, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 3, 7, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 1: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 6: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of 20 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 9, 8)>
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<0, (5, 9, 3)>
<0, (5, 8, 7)>
<0, (5, 8, 3)>
<0, (9, 8, 7)>
<0, (9, 8, 3)>
<0, (8, 7, 3)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<5, (6, 1, 2)>
<9, (8, 6, 3)>
<9, (8, 7, 3)>
<9, (6, 6, 2)>
<9, (6, 1, 2)>
