Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 15) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 10) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 10) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 15) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 15) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 19) (10, 12) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 11) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {9, 17, 15}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 10, 8, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 8, 10}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 12}
- Node 4: {12, 11, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 1, 3, 11}
- Node 6: {5, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 1, 19, 11}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 19, 15}
- Node 9: {2, 0, 19}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 19, 12}
- Node 11: {14, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 12: {3, 4, 10, 15}
- Node 13: {14}
- Node 14: {17, 11, 13}
- Node 15: {8, 12, 0}
- Node 17: {14, 0}
- Node 19: {9, 8, 7, 10}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each of those nodes:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars associated with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 1: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 2: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 3: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 7: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 8: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 9: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 11: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 12: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 19: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 47

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [47].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (9, 17, 15)>
- <1, (3, 5, 10)>
- <2, (9, 4, 8)>
- <5, (6, 1, 3)>
- <7, (6, 1, 19)>
- <8, (1, 2, 19)>
- <10, (1, 2, 19)>
- <11, (14, 4, 5)>
- <12, (3, 4, 10)>
