Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {6, 4, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {6, 4, 8, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 4, 8, 1}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 8, 0}
- Node 4: {9, 6, 8, 0, 1, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 7, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 0}
- Node 8: {4, 2, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 3}

Next, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 4 + 4 = 28, which we put inside brackets as [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, (9, 6, 8)>
- <4, (9, 8, 2)>
- <4, (9, 8, 1)>
- <4, (6, 8, 1)>
- <4, (6, 8, 2)>
- <4, (6, 1, 2)>
- <8, (4, 9, 6)>
- <8, (4, 9, 2)>
- <8, (4, 2, 1)>
- <8, (4, 2, 9)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
- <9, (4, 6, 1)>
- <9, (4, 8, 2)>
- <9, (4, 8, 1)>
