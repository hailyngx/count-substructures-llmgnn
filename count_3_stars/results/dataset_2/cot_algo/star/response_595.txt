Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- For node 4: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- For node 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- For node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Adding all these together: 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>
