Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (14, 11) (14, 6) (17, 18) (10, 16) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 2) (13, 19) (13, 6) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (6, 9) (6, 18) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 15) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 19) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 15) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 15) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 15) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 5) (16, 10) (16, 19) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 16) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 7, 11, 15}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 11}
- Node 2: {8, 11, 18}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {3, 12, 15}
- Node 6: {3, 9, 13, 14, 18}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 9, 12, 15}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 7, 15}
- Node 10: {16}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 2, 14}
- Node 12: {5, 7, 19}
- Node 13: {6, 19}
- Node 14: {6, 11}
- Node 15: {0, 5, 7, 9, 18}
- Node 16: {10, 19}
- Node 17: {18}
- Node 18: {2, 6, 15, 17}
- Node 19:  {12, 13, 16}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors (1, 7, 11, 15) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 9) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (3, 9, 13, 14, 18) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (0, 4, 9, 12, 15) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (3, 6, 7, 15) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 14) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: 5 neighbors (0, 5, 7, 9, 18) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: 3 neighbors (12, 13, 16) => 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 47

Therefore, the final answer is [47].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 11>
- <0, 1, 15>
- <0, 7, 12>
- <0, 7, 15>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <6, 9, 15>
- <7, 9, 15>
- <6, 9, 13>
- <6, 9, 14>
- <6, 9, 18>
- <7, 9, 12>
- <7, 9, 15>
- <9, 15, 18>
- <11, 0, 1>
- <11, 0, 15>
- <11, 1, 14>
- <11, 2, 14>
- <15, 0, 5>
- <15, 0, 7>
- <15, 0, 18>
- <15, 5, 12>
- <15, 5, 18>
- <15, 7, 12>
- <15, 9, 18>
- <16, 10, 19>
