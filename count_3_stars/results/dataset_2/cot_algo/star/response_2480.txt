Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (16, 11) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 4) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 3) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 18) (2, 14) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 4) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 15) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 12) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 19) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 15) (9, 8) (9, 10) (10, 14) (10, 9) (19, 0) (19, 12) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 15) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 12) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 6) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph can be found as follows:

Node 1 has neighbors {11, 17, 3}.
Node 2 has neighbors {14, 18, 4}.
Node 3 has neighbors {11, 1, 18}.
Node 4 has neighbors {14, 2, 6}.
Node 5 has neighbors {6, 13, 7}.
Node 6 has neighbors {5, 7, 4}.
Node 7 has neighbors {14, 5, 6}.
Node 8 has neighbors {15, 0, 9}.
Node 9 has neighbors {8, 10}.
Node 10 has neighbors {14, 9}.
Node 11 has neighbors {16, 3, 1}.
Node 12 has neighbors {13, 15, 19}.
Node 13 has neighbors {2, 5, 12}.
Node 14 has neighbors {10, 17, 7, 2}.
Node 15 has neighbors {18, 8, 12}.
Node 16 has neighbors {11}.
Node 17 has neighbors {1, 4, 14, 0}.
Node 18 has neighbors {3, 2, 15}.
Node 19 has neighbors {0, 12}.

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 10 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 16 has only 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 19 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 26

Therefore, the final answer is [26]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 11, 17)>
<2, (4, 14, 18)>
<4, (2, 6, 14)>
<5, (6, 7, 14)>
<6, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (6, 14, 7)>
<8, (0, 9, 15)>
<11, (1, 3, 17)>
<12, (13, 15, 19)>
<13, (2, 5, 12)>
<14, (2, 7, 17)>
<15, (8, 12, 18)>
<17, (1, 4, 14)>
<18, (3, 15, 18)>
