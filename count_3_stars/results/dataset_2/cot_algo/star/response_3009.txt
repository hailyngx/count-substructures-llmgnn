Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 25) (7, 2) (21, 4) (10, 17) (10, 22) (10, 4) (10, 25) (17, 10) (17, 25) (17, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 29) (20, 6) (20, 0) (20, 18) (20, 16) (12, 27) (12, 16) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 23) (1, 14) (1, 26) (1, 11) (26, 1) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 5) (13, 26) (13, 2) (5, 26) (5, 15) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 23) (25, 7) (25, 10) (25, 17) (16, 20) (16, 12) (16, 28) (16, 19) (15, 5) (15, 18) (3, 6) (3, 27) (3, 22) (3, 29) (18, 20) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 11) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 24) (22, 10) (22, 3) (8, 17) (8, 27) (8, 24) (2, 7) (2, 13) (11, 1) (11, 18) (24, 19) (24, 8) (24, 29) (4, 9) (4, 21) (4, 10) (23, 14) (23, 28) (29, 0) (29, 3) (29, 24) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 9, 20, 14, 29}
- Node 1: {14, 26, 11}
- Node 2: {7, 13}
- Node 3: {6, 27, 22, 29}
- Node 4: {9, 21, 10}
- Node 5: {26, 15}
- Node 6: {0, 9, 3, 20}
- Node 7: {9, 25, 2}
- Node 8: {17, 27, 24}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 0, 7}
- Node 10: {17, 22, 4, 25}
- Node 11: {1, 18}
- Node 12: {27, 16}
- Node 13: {26, 2}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 23}
- Node 15: {5, 18}
- Node 16: {20, 12, 28, 19}
- Node 17: {10, 25, 8}
- Node 18: {20, 15, 19, 11}
- Node 19: {16, 18, 24}
- Node 20: {6, 0, 18, 16}
- Node 21: {4}
- Node 22: {10, 3}
- Node 23: {14, 28}
- Node 24: {19, 8, 29}
- Node 25: {7, 10, 17}
- Node 26: {14, 1, 13, 28, 5}
- Node 27: {12, 3, 8}
- Node 28: {26, 16, 23}
- Node 29: {0, 3, 24}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0, 6 neighbors
- Node 3, 4 neighbors
- Node 4, 4 neighbors
- Node 6, 4 neighbors
- Node 8, 3 neighbors
- Node 9, 4 neighbors
- Node 10, 4 neighbors
- Node 14, 3 neighbors
- Node 16, 4 neighbors
- Node 18, 4 neighbors
- Node 20, 4 neighbors
- Node 24, 3 neighbors
- Node 26, 5 neighbors
- Node 27, 3 neighbors
- Node 28, 3 neighbors
- Node 29, 3 neighbors

Now, let's apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of unique 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: No 3-star possible (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: No 3-star possible (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: No 3-star possible (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 27: No 3-star possible (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 28: No 3-star possible (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 29: No 3-star possible (less than 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 6, 9, 20>, <0, 6, 9, 14>, <0, 6, 9, 29>, <0, 6, 20, 14>, <0, 6, 20, 29>, <0, 9, 14, 29>, <6, 9, 20, 14>, <3, 6, 27, 29>, <4, 9, 10, 25>, <4, 9, 22, 25>, <4, 10, 17, 25>, <4, 10, 25, 17>, <4, 21, 10, 25>, <6, 9, 7, 25>, <6, 9, 25, 7>, <16, 20, 12, 28>, <16, 20, 19, 28>, <16, 20, 28, 12>, <16, 20, 28, 19>, <16, 28, 12, 19>.
