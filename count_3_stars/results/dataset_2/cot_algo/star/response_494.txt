Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's organize the nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: 5, 3, 8, 2
- Node 1: 9, 4, 7, 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 5, 3, 6, 0
- Node 3: 9, 7, 1, 0, 2
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 2, 0
- Node 6: 9, 4, 1, 2, 8
- Node 7: 3, 1, 8
- Node 8: 9, 7, 1, 6, 0
- Node 9: 6, 8, 3, 1

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 1, and Node 3 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 6 and Node 8 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (5, 3, 8)>
- <1, (9, 4, 7)>
- <3, (9, 1, 7)>
- <6, (9, 4, 8)>
- <8, (9, 7, 1)>
