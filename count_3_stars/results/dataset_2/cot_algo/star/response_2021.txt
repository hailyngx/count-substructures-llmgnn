Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 17) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 8) (3, 13) (15, 5) (15, 18) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 16) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 17) (12, 4) (18, 7) (18, 15) (18, 14) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 11) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 19) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 11) (0, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 13) (16, 10) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
1. Node 0: {13}
2. Node 1: {10, 2, 13}
3. Node 2: {5, 1}
4. Node 3: {13}
5. Node 4: {6, 7, 12, 17}
6. Node 5: {9, 2, 15, 14}
7. Node 6: {9, 7, 11, 4}
8. Node 7: {6, 4, 14, 18, 8}
9. Node 8: {7, 17}
10. Node 9: {5, 6, 11, 13}
11. Node 10: {17, 1, 19, 16}
12. Node 11: {9, 6, 19, 14}
13. Node 12: {4}
14. Node 13: {9, 3, 0, 1}
15. Node 14: {5, 7, 18, 11}
16. Node 15: {5, 18}
17. Node 16: {10}
18. Node 17: {4, 10, 19, 8}
19. Node 18: {7, 15, 14}
20. Node 19: {10, 17, 11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 1
- Node 9: 1
- Node 10: 1
- Node 11: 1
- Node 13: 1
- Node 14: 1
- Node 17: 1
- Node 18: 1
- Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 12

Therefore, the final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, 9, 15>
<6, 9, 11>
<7, 4, 8>
<10, 17, 19>
<11, 9, 14>
<13, 9, 0>
<14, 7, 18>
<1, 10, 16>
<5, 2, 15>
<17, 4, 8>
<18, 7, 15>
<19, 10, 11>
