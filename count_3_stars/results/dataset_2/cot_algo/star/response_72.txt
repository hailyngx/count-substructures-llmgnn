Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 0) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6, 8, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 12}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 8, 13}
- Node 11: {3, 6, 13}
- Node 12: {3, 5, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 13: {2, 10, 12, 11}
- Node 14: {5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 12 have at least 3 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 84

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [84].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (0, 8, 12)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>
- <12, (3, 5, 8)>
