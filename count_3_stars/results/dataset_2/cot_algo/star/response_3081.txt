Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (12, 5) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 2) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 2) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 10) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 13) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 10) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first find the neighborhood sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 8, 13}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {3, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {5, 8, 10}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 9: {0, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {2, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {5}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 2, 10, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 9}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 80 3-stars, so the final answer is [80].
Unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 13, 14)>
- <0, (3, 4, 13)>
- <0, (3, 9, 14)>
- <0, (4, 9, 14)>
- <1, (3, 8, 13)>
- <2, (4, 11, 13)>
- <2, (5, 11, 13)>
- <2, (5, 11, 2)>
- <2, (5, 13, 2)>
- <3, (0, 8, 13)>
- <3, (4, 8, 13)>
- <5, (8, 10, 7)>
- <5, (8, 11, 2)>
- <5, (8, 11, 13)>
- <5, (8, 2, 13)>
- <5, (8, 11, 5)>
- <8, (1, 10, 13)>
- <8, (3, 10, 6)>
- <8, (10, 6, 7)>
- <8, (10, 6, 6)>
- <8, (10, 7, 5)>
- <8, (6, 7, 10)>
- <9, (0, 10, 14)>
- <10, (6, 9, 13)>
- <10, (8, 9, 5)>
- <11, (9, 13, 10)>
- <13, (0, 11, 13)>
