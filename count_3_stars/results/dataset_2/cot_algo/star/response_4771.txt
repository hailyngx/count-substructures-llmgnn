Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 19) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 0) (3, 17) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 0) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 15) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (16, 4) (16, 1) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 10) (10, 6) (18, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 16) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 19) (15, 17) (19, 9) (19, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's analyze the neighbors for each node first: 

- Node 0: Neighbors = {8, 2, 11, 12, 19}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {5, 7, 16}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {4, 8, 11, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {17}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {7, 2, 13, 16}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {18, 12, 1, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {13, 12, 10}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {5, 4, 14, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {13, 2, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {17, 13, 19}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {6}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {2, 14, 0}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {5, 14, 0, 6}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8, 17, 6}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {7, 11, 12}
- Node 15: Neighbors = {17}
- Node 16: Neighbors = {4, 1}
- Node 17: Neighbors = {9, 13, 3, 15}
- Node 18: Neighbors = {5}
- Node 19: Neighbors = {9, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 5, with neighbors {18, 12, 1, 7}: Can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7, with neighbors {5, 4, 14, 1}: Can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13, with neighbors {9, 4, 8, 17, 6}: Can form 1 3-star.

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <5, (18, 12, 1)>
- <7, (4, 14, 1)>
- <13, (9, 8, 17)>
