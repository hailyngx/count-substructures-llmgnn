Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
Since the given graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first represent the graph in adjacency list format:

Node 0: 5, 6, 7
Node 1: 9, 4, 7
Node 2: 5, 6, 3, 8
Node 3: 2, 8, 4
Node 4: 5, 1, 3, 8
Node 5: 6, 2, 4, 0, 7
Node 6: 5, 9, 7, 2, 0
Node 7: 5, 9, 6, 1, 0
Node 8: 9, 3, 4, 2
Node 9: 6, 8, 1, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph by examining each node's neighborhood:

Node 0: [5, 6, 7] -> No 3-star can be formed.
Node 1: [9, 4, 7] -> No 3-star can be formed.
Node 2: [5, 6, 3, 8] -> 1 3-star can be formed <2, (5, 6, 8)>
Node 3: [2, 8, 4] -> No 3-star can be formed.
Node 4: [5, 1, 3, 8] -> No 3-star can be formed.
Node 5: [6, 2, 4, 0, 7] -> 1 3-star can be formed <5, (6, 7, 2)>
Node 6: [5, 9, 7, 2, 0] -> 2 3-stars can be formed <6, (5, 7, 2)>, <6, (5, 9, 7)>
Node 7: [5, 9, 6, 1, 0] -> 1 3-star can be formed <7, (5, 6, 9)>
Node 8: [9, 3, 4, 2] -> No 3-star can be formed.
Node 9: [6, 8, 1, 7] -> No 3-star can be formed.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5. Therefore, the final answer is [5].
