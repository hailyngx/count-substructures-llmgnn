Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0: forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, 7
- Node 3: forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 8, 1
- Node 8: forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, 9
- Node 9: forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, 8

Counting the unique 3-stars formed, we have a total of [7] 3-stars:
<0, 4, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 7, 8>, <2, 1, 8, 7>, <3, 4, 7, 8>, <7, 9, 8, 1>, <8, 1, 7, 9>, <9, 0, 7, 8>
