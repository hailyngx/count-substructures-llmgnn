Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 18) (14, 5) (14, 10) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 3) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (7, 5) (7, 16) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 16) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 10) (15, 13) (15, 11) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 19) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 1) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 9) (3, 18) (19, 10) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 2) (2, 19) (18, 14) (18, 3) (18, 11) (13, 15) (13, 0) (11, 5) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 18) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {12, 13, 19}
- Node 1: {6, 16}
- Node 2: {19}
- Node 3: {8, 9, 12, 18}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 9, 16}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 10}
- Node 7: {5, 16}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 10}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 11, 19}
- Node 10: {6, 8, 14, 15, 19}
- Node 11: {5, 9, 15, 18}
- Node 12: {0, 3}
- Node 13: {0, 15}
- Node 14: {5, 10, 18}
- Node 15: {10, 11, 13}
- Node 16: {4, 7, 1}
- Node 18: {3, 11, 14}
- Node 19: {0, 9, 10, 2}

Based on the information above, we can see that nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 14, and 19 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them.

For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 5: 1 3-star
   - <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 6: 1 3-star
   - <6, (1, 5, 10)>
- Node 7: 0 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 3-star
   - <8, (3, 4, 10)>
- Node 9: 1 3-star
   - <9, (3, 4, 11)>
- Node 11: 0 3-stars
- Node 14: 1 3-star
   - <14, (5, 10, 18)>
- Node 18: 1 3-star
   - <18, (3, 11, 14)>
- Node 19: 1 3-star
   - <19, (0, 9, 10)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the final answer is [7]
