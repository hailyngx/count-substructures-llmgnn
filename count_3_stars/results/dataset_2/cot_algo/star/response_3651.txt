Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 18) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 12) (3, 18) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 2) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 15) (0, 8) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 4) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 12) (16, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 19) (17, 11) (15, 5) (19, 3) (19, 2) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 4) (18, 13) (18, 3) (18, 14) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 14) (1, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:

- Node 0: {8, 10}
- Node 1: {12}
- Node 2: {5, 11, 19}
- Node 3: {11, 12, 18, 19}
- Node 4: {10, 14, 16}
- Node 5: {2, 13, 15}
- Node 6: {9, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {11, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 10, 13, 16}
- Node 9: {6, 10, 16}
- Node 10: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 6, 7, 17}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 13, 16}
- Node 13: {5, 8, 12, 18}
- Node 14: {4, 6, 7, 18}
- Node 15: {5}
- Node 16: {4, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 17: {11}
- Node 18: {3, 13, 14}
- Node 19: {2, 3}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors that can form a 3-star: 2, 3, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars formed: 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<2, (5, 11, 19)>, 
<3, (11, 12, 18)>, 
<6, (9, 11, 14)>, 
<11, (2, 3, 6)>, 
<12, (1, 3, 13)>, 
<13 (5, 8, 12)>, 
<14, (4, 7, 18)>, 
<16, (4, 8, 9)>.
