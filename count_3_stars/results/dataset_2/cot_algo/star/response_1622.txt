This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 24) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 29) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 17) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 2) (25, 19) (25, 23) (25, 10) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 2) (3, 26) (8, 20) (8, 11) (8, 6) (23, 25) (23, 15) (0, 20) (0, 5) (0, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 29) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (17, 21) (17, 1) (17, 29) (29, 22) (29, 5) (29, 17) (29, 18) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 11) (26, 22) (26, 7) (26, 3) (26, 15) (9, 22) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 27) (16, 28) (16, 15) (28, 16) (28, 18) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 19) (24, 13) (24, 7) (19, 25) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 14) (15, 23) (15, 26) (15, 16) (2, 20) (2, 1) (4, 13) (4, 19) (10, 25) (10, 6) (10, 9) (18, 5) (18, 29) (18, 12) (18, 28) (18, 27) (27, 9) (27, 18) (14, 13) (14, 19) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 8, 9, 20}
- Node 1: {2, 11, 17}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 20}
- Node 3: {15, 26}
- Node 4: {13, 19}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 18, 29}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 10}
- Node 7: {12, 21, 24, 26}
- Node 8: {6, 11, 20}
- Node 9: {0, 10, 22, 27}
- Node 10: {6, 9, 25}
- Node 11: {1, 8, 12, 19}
- Node 12: {7, 11, 18}
- Node 13: {4, 14, 22, 24}
- Node 14: {13, 19}
- Node 15: {3, 16, 23, 26}
- Node 16: {15, 28}
- Node 17: {1, 21, 29}
- Node 18: {5, 12, 27, 28, 29}
- Node 19: {4, 11, 14, 25}
- Node 20: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 21: {7, 17}
- Node 22: {9, 13, 26, 29}
- Node 23: {15, 25}
- Node 24: {7, 13}
- Node 25: {10, 19, 23}
- Node 26: {3, 7, 15, 22}
- Node 27: {9, 18}
- Node 28: {16, 18}
- Node 29: {5, 17, 18, 22}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 24 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 59, thus the answer is [59].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 20)>, <0, (2, 8, 20)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 20)>, <0, (5, 9, 20)>, <0, (8, 9, 20)>, <1, (2, 11, 17)>, <5, (6, 18, 29)>, <7, (12, 18, 29)>, <9, (10, 18, 29)>, <13, (14, 19, 24)>, <15, (16, 23, 26)>
