Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
1. Node 0: {5, 9, 3}
2. Node 1: {4, 7, 6, 2}
3. Node 2: {5, 4, 8, 6, 1}
4. Node 3: {7, 8, 6, 0}
5. Node 4: {8, 1, 2}
6. Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 0}
7. Node 6: {5, 8, 1, 3, 2}
8. Node 7: {9, 3, 1}
9. Node 8: {9, 4, 2, 6, 3}
10. Node 9: {5, 8, 7, 0}

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 37

Therefore, the final answer is [37], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (5, 9, 3)>, 
<1, (4, 7, 6)>, 
<1, (4, 6, 2)>, 
<1, (7, 1, 6)>, 
<1, (1, 6, 2)>, 
<2, (5, 8, 6)>, 
<2, (4, 8, 6)>, 
<2, (8, 6, 1)>, 
<2, (6, 1, 3)>, 
<3, (7, 8, 6)>, 
<3, (8, 6, 2)>, 
<3, (6, 2, 0)>, 
<5, (9, 6, 2)>, 
<5, (6, 2, 0)>, 
<6, (5, 8, 2)>, 
<6, (5, 2, 0)>, 
<6, (8, 2, 1)>, 
<6, (2, 1, 3)>, 
<9, (5, 8, 7)>, 
<9, (8, 7, 0)>.
