Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 8) (6, 12) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find all the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {3, 10, 13, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {11, 12, 0, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {5, 1, 11, 0, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {3, 11, 13, 12, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {9, 3, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {8, 12}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {5, 9, 8, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {13, 14, 7, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {5, 7, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {11, 0, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {3, 10, 12, 4, 2}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {9, 11, 4, 2, 6}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {10, 8, 4, 14, 7}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {1, 8, 13, 4, 2}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars for nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: <3, (5, 1, 11)>, <3, (1, 4, 14)>, <3, (11, 0, 10)>, <3, (0, 13, 2)>, <3, (10, 13, 4)>
- Node 4: <4, (3, 11, 13)>, <4, (11, 4, 12)>, <4, (4, 12, 2)>, <4, (12, 2, 14)>, <4, (2, 14, 13)>
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 11: <11, (3, 10, 0)>, <11, (10, 13, 4)>, <11, (13, 4, 14)>, <11, (4, 14, 2)>, <11, (14, 2, 12)>
- Node 12: <12, (9, 11, 4)>, <12, (11, 4, 2)>, <12, (4, 2, 14)>, <12, (2, 14, 13)>, <12, (14, 13, 7)>
- Node 13: <13, (10, 8, 4)>, <13, (8, 14, 2)>, <13, (14, 2, 4)>, <13, (2, 4, 13)>, <13, (4, 13, 7)>
- Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 47

Therefore, the final answer is [47].
