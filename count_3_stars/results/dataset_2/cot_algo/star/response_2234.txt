Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 2) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 13) (10, 0) (10, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {14, 10, 3, 11}
Node 1: {5, 11, 13}
Node 2: {6, 4, 7, 12, 13}
Node 3: {5, 4, 0, 11}
Node 4: {7, 12, 13, 3, 2}
Node 5: {8, 1, 3}
Node 6: {9, 2, 11, 8}
Node 7: {9, 4, 11, 2, 8}
Node 8: {5, 9, 6, 7, 10}
Node 9: {6, 8, 13, 7, 12}
Node 10: {0, 8}
Node 11: {6, 7, 0, 3, 1}
Node 12: {9, 4, 14, 2}
Node 13: {9, 4, 1, 2}
Node 14: {0, 12}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (5, 11, 13)>
Node 4, 7, and 13 have 5 neighbors each, so they each form 10 3-stars: 
Node 4: <4, (7, 12, 13)>, <4, (7, 12, 2)>, <4, (7, 13, 2)>, <4, (12, 13, 2)>, <4, (7, 13, 3)>, <4, (7, 3, 11)>, <4, (7, 3, 2)>, <4, (7, 11, 2)>, <4, (3, 11, 2)>, <4, (3, 11, 1)>
Node 7: <7, (9, 4, 13)>, <7, (9, 4, 2)>, <7, (9, 13, 2)>, <7, (4, 13, 2)>, <7, (9, 4, 12)>, <7, (9, 4, 3)>, <7, (9, 4, 11)>, <7, (4, 3, 11)>, <7, (4, 3, 2)>, <7, (4, 11, 2)>
Node 13: <13, (9, 4, 1)>, <13, (9, 4, 2)>, <13, (9, 1, 2)>, <13, (4, 1, 2)>, <13, (9, 1, 13)>, <13, (9, 1, 2)>, <13, (9, 2, 2)>, <13, (1, 2, 2)>, <13, (9, 4, 2)>, <13, (9, 4, 2)>
The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 31, so the final answer is [31].
