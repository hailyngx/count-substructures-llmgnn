Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 17) (0, 2) (27, 22) (27, 9) (27, 16) (20, 25) (20, 22) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 21) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 18) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 18) (23, 1) (28, 29) (28, 22) (28, 14) (28, 19) (29, 28) (29, 5) (29, 12) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 7) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 4) (26, 23) (26, 19) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (6, 21) (6, 7) (21, 25) (21, 6) (21, 12) (21, 15) (5, 8) (5, 29) (5, 24) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 10) (4, 19) (4, 13) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 18) (10, 1) (16, 27) (16, 24) (16, 2) (16, 15) (24, 5) (24, 16) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 9) (1, 23) (1, 10) (1, 13) (14, 20) (14, 28) (14, 22) (22, 27) (22, 20) (22, 28) (22, 14) (18, 8) (18, 23) (18, 17) (18, 10) (18, 13) (15, 21) (15, 16) (9, 27) (9, 2) (9, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 18) (12, 29) (12, 3) (12, 21) (12, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 2, 17
- Node 1: 10, 13, 23
- Node 2: 0, 9, 16
- Node 3: 11, 12
- Node 4: 13, 19
- Node 5: 8, 24, 29
- Node 6: 7, 21
- Node 7: 6, 10, 17
- Node 8: 5, 10, 18, 23
- Node 9: 2, 12, 27
- Node 10: 1, 7, 8, 18
- Node 11: 3
- Node 12: 3, 9, 21, 29
- Node 13: 1, 4, 18
- Node 14: 20, 22, 28
- Node 15: 16, 21
- Node 16: 2, 15, 24, 27
- Node 17: 0, 7, 18
- Node 18: 8, 10, 13, 17, 23
- Node 19: 4, 26, 28
- Node 20: 14, 22, 25
- Node 21: 6, 12, 15, 25
- Node 22: 14, 20, 28, 27
- Node 23: 1, 8, 18, 26
- Node 24: 5, 16
- Node 25: 20, 21
- Node 26: 19, 23
- Node 27: 9, 16, 22
- Node 28: 14, 19, 22
- Node 29: 5, 12

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 8: <8, (5, 10, 18)>
- Node 12: <12, (3, 9, 21)>, <12, (5, 12, 29)>

Finally, sum up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = 3 \]

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
