Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 24) (13, 27) (22, 14) (22, 29) (22, 25) (1, 21) (1, 5) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 2) (21, 15) (14, 22) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 25) (9, 14) (9, 5) (9, 24) (10, 23) (10, 28) (11, 27) (11, 12) (3, 14) (8, 17) (8, 23) (8, 19) (23, 10) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 15) (12, 11) (12, 24) (12, 0) (12, 26) (27, 13) (27, 11) (27, 19) (27, 6) (4, 28) (4, 25) (4, 6) (18, 0) (19, 8) (19, 27) (19, 26) (26, 23) (26, 12) (26, 19) (26, 15) (28, 10) (28, 4) (28, 24) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 2) (0, 15) (2, 21) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 25) (7, 20) (25, 22) (25, 5) (25, 4) (25, 7) (16, 21) (16, 29) (16, 6) (6, 17) (6, 27) (6, 4) (6, 16) (15, 21) (15, 23) (15, 26) (15, 0) (20, 7) (29, 22) (29, 16) (24, 13) (24, 9) (24, 12) (24, 28) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 12, 15, 18}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 15, 16, 21}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 21}
- Node 3: {9, 14}
- Node 4: {6, 25, 28}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 9, 21, 25}
- Node 6: {4, 16, 17, 27}
- Node 7: {20, 25}
- Node 8: {17, 19, 23}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 14, 24}
- Node 10: {23, 28}
- Node 11: {12, 27}
- Node 12: {0, 11, 24, 26}
- Node 13: {24, 27}
- Node 14: {3, 9, 17, 22}
- Node 15: {0, 1, 15, 21, 23, 26}
- Node 16: {1, 6, 16, 21, 29}
- Node 17: {6, 8, 14}
- Node 18: {0}
- Node 19: {8, 26, 27}
- Node 20: {7}
- Node 21: {1, 2, 5, 15, 16}
- Node 22: {14, 25, 29}
- Node 23: {8, 10, 15, 26}
- Node 24: {9, 12, 13, 28}
- Node 25: {4, 5, 7, 22}
- Node 26: {12, 15, 19, 23}
- Node 27: {6, 11, 13, 19}
- Node 28: {4, 10, 24}
- Node 29: {16, 22}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: <1, (2, 5, 21)>
- Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 21)>
- Node 9: <9, (3, 5, 14)>
- Node 12: <12, (0, 24, 26)>
- Node 14: <14, (3, 9, 17)>
- Node 15: <15, (0, 1, 21)>
- Node 16: <16, (1, 6, 21)>
- Node 21: <21, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 22: <22, (14, 25, 29)>
- Node 24: <24, (9, 12, 28)>
- Node 25: <25, (4, 5, 22)>
- Node 26: <26, (12, 15, 19)>

The total number of 3-stars formed is [11].
