Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 7) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 6, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 9, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8, 9, 10}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 10}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 14}
- Node 10: Neighbors {3, 6, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors {7, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 3, 11, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 7, 8, 9}

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors since only they can form 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star (only 1 possible 3-star since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 19

Therefore, the final answer is [19], and the unique 3-stars are: <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (8, 9, 10)>, <6, (0, 2, 10)>, <7, (1, 11, 13)>, <8, (2, 5, 11)>, <12, (0, 3, 11)>, <14, (1, 7, 8, 9)>.
