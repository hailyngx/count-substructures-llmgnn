Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Nodes with 5 neighbors: Node 1, Node 5, Node 9
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: Node 3, Node 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Now, sum up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 20 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
