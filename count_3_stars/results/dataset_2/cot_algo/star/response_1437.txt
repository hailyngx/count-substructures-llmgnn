Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 8) (11, 15) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 13) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 2) (1, 15) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 12) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 16) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 16) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 12) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 6) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (3, 18) (3, 6) (3, 8) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (9, 17) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 12) (6, 3) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = \( 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 36 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].
