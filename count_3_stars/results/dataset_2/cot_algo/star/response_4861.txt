Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 8) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 12) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 17) (12, 3) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 17) (0, 17) (0, 19) (14, 13) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 5) (1, 15) (1, 13) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 17) (9, 17) (19, 11) (19, 0) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 9) (3, 16) (3, 18) (3, 12) (3, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a table to represent the neighbors of each node:

| Node | Neighbors      |
|------|----------------|
| 0    | 17, 19         |
| 1    | 13, 15         |
| 2    | 7, 8, 12, 18   |
| 3    | 5, 12, 16, 18  |
| 4    | 5, 7, 13, 15   |
| 5    | 3, 4, 6        |
| 6    | 5, 11, 16      |
| 7    | 2, 4, 12       |
| 8    | 2, 8, 10, 17   |
| 9    | 17             |
|10    | 8, 10, 11, 18  |
|11    | 6, 10, 16, 19  |
|12    | 2, 3, 7, 12    |
|13    | 1, 4, 14       |
|14    | 13             |
|15    | 1, 4, 15, 17   |
|16    | 3, 6, 11       |
|17    | 0, 8, 9, 15    |
|18    | 2, 3, 10, 18   |
|19    | 11, 0          |

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed with them:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up all 3-stars, we get a total of 34 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [34].

List of unique 3-stars:
<2, 8, 10, 18>, <3, 4, 5, 6>, <3, 12, 16, 18>, <4, 7, 12, 15>, <4, 13, 14, 15>, <8, 10, 17, 18>, <8, 10, 18, 17>, <10, 11, 16, 19>, <12, 17, 15, 18>, <12, 17, 15, 18>
