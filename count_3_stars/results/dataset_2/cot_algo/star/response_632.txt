Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors can potentially form 3-stars. 

- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form 6 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 can form 4 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 20 + 6 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars inside brackets [] is [40].
