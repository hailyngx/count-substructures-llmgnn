Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 10) (9, 23) (26, 19) (26, 29) (26, 11) (26, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 19) (3, 22) (25, 8) (25, 21) (25, 22) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 27) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 2) (8, 26) (8, 25) (8, 24) (8, 21) (15, 1) (20, 17) (0, 14) (0, 21) (19, 26) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 28) (22, 3) (22, 25) (22, 6) (22, 28) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 18) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 29) (13, 28) (11, 26) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 23) (11, 2) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 24) (28, 19) (28, 22) (28, 13) (28, 18) (24, 8) (24, 23) (24, 18) (21, 25) (21, 8) (21, 0) (21, 12) (12, 21) (6, 7) (6, 22) (29, 26) (29, 13) (29, 16) (29, 18) (29, 10) (18, 5) (18, 28) (18, 24) (18, 29) (10, 9) (10, 29) (10, 27) (16, 13) (16, 29) (16, 27) (27, 14) (27, 10) (27, 16) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:
First, we'll determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {14, 21}
- Node 1: {11, 15, 19}
- Node 2: {4, 11, 13, 17}
- Node 3: {22}
- Node 4: {2, 11}
- Node 5: {7, 18, 19}
- Node 6: {7, 22}
- Node 7: {5, 6}
- Node 8: {21, 24, 25, 26}
- Node 9: {10, 23}
- Node 10: {9, 27, 29}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 4, 23, 26}
- Node 12: {21}
- Node 13: {2, 16, 28, 29}
- Node 14: {0, 17, 27}
- Node 15: {1}
- Node 16: {13, 27, 29}
- Node 17: {2, 14, 20}
- Node 18: {5, 16, 24, 28, 29}
- Node 19: {1, 5, 26, 28}
- Node 20: {17}
- Node 21: {0, 8, 12, 25}
- Node 22: {3, 6, 25, 28}
- Node 23: {9, 11, 24}
- Node 24: {8, 18, 23}
- Node 25: {8, 21, 22}
- Node 26: {8, 11, 19, 29}
- Node 27: {10, 14, 16}
- Node 28: {13, 18, 19, 22}
- Node 29: {10, 13, 16, 18, 26}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by them:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 does not have at least 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 does not have at least 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 does not have at least 3 neighbors.
- Node 10 does not have at least 3 neighbors.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 does not have at least 3 neighbors.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 does not have at least 3 neighbors.
- Node 22 does not have at least 3 neighbors.
- Node 23 does not have at least 3 neighbors.
- Node 24 does not have at least 3 neighbors.
- Node 25 does not have at least 3 neighbors.
- Node 26 does not have at least 3 neighbors.
- Node 27 does not have at least 3 neighbors.
- Node 28 does not have at least 3 neighbors.
- Node 29 does not have at least 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (11, 15, 19)>
<2, (4, 11, 13)>
<4, (2, 11, 17)>
<5, (7, 5, 19)>
<8, (21, 25, 26)>
<11, (1, 2, 4)>
<13, (13, 16, 28)>
<14, (0, 17, 27)>
<16, (13, 16, 27)>
<18, (5, 18, 29)>
<19, (1, 19, 28)>
