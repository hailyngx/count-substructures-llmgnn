Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {2, 3, 8, 9}
Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 5}
Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
Node 3: {0, 1, 4}
Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 6}
Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
Node 6: {2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 7: {5, 8}
Node 8: {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 6}

Now we can identify the 3-stars:

Node 2: 6 possible 3-stars
Node 4: 4 possible 3-stars
Node 5: 15 possible 3-stars
Node 6: 4 possible 3-stars
Node 8: 10 possible 3-stars
Node 9: 4 possible 3-stars

Summing these up: 6 + 4 + 15 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43].

And the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)>
