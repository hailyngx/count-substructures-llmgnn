Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 14) (1, 8) (1, 14) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {9, 2, 13, 3}
Node 1: {8, 14}
Node 2: {9, 10, 5, 3}
Node 3: {0, 7, 11, 14, 2}
Node 4: {9, 6, 13}
Node 5: {8, 12, 10, 2, 11}
Node 6: {4, 7, 11, 3, 14}
Node 7: {3, 13, 6}
Node 8: {1, 9, 5, 10}
Node 9: {0, 8, 4, 2}
Node 10: {12, 11, 8, 2, 5}
Node 11: {5, 10, 13, 6, 3}
Node 12: {10, 5, 14}
Node 13: {0, 7, 11, 5, 4}
Node 14: {1, 3, 6, 12}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: [0 choose 3] = 0
Node 1: [1 choose 3] = 0
Node 2: [5 choose 3] = 10
Node 3: [5 choose 3] = 10
Node 4: [3 choose 3] = 1
Node 5: [5 choose 3] = 10
Node 6: [5 choose 3] = 10
Node 7: [3 choose 3] = 1
Node 8: [4 choose 3] = 4
Node 9: [4 choose 3] = 4
Node 10: [5 choose 3] = 10
Node 11: [5 choose 3] = 10
Node 12: [3 choose 3] = 1
Node 13: [5 choose 3] = 10
Node 14: [4 choose 3] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [0 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4] = 75

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [75].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 5, 10)>
<2, (3, 5, 11)>
<2, (5, 10, 11)>
<2, (10, 11, 12)>
<3, (0, 7, 13)>
<3, (6, 7, 13)>
<5, (8, 10, 11)>
<5, (10, 11, 12)>
<6, (4, 7, 11)>
<6, (7, 11, 13)>
<8, (5, 10, 11)>
<8, (9, 10, 11)>
<10, (5, 11, 12)>
<13, (0, 7, 11)>
<13, (0, 11, 13)>
<13, (5, 11, 13)>
<14, (3, 6, 14)>
