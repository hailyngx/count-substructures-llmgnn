Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 1: {6, 9, 4, 11, 5, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 8}
- Node 3: {6, 9, 5, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 12, 1, 2, 14}
- Node 5: {13, 12, 1, 3, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 3}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 13, 2}
- Node 9: {6, 3, 1, 13, 0}
- Node 10: {11, 0, 14}
- Node 11: {10, 1, 0, 13, 12}
- Node 12: {4, 11, 5}
- Node 13: {9, 11, 8, 5}
- Node 14: {4, 10, 5, 1, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors

For these nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- For each of the seven nodes (1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 11, 14), there are \( \binom{n}{3} \) 3-stars.
  - For Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - For Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - For Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 74 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [74].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (6, 9, 4)>
- <1, (6, 9, 5)>
- <(6, 9, 4), 5>
- <(6, 9, 5), 14>
- <4, (7, 0, 12)>
- <4, (7, 1, 2)>
- <(7, 0, 12), 5>
- <(7, 1, 2), 8>
- <5, (13, 1, 3)>
- <5, (13, 3, 14)>
- <(13, 1, 3), 11>
- <(13, 3, 14), 1>
- <9, (6, 1, 3)>
- <9, (6, 3, 0)>
- <(6, 1, 3), 5>
- <(6, 3, 0), 11>
- <11, (10, 1, 13)>
- <11, (10, 0, 12)>
- <(10, 1, 13), 5>
- <(10, 0, 12), 11>
- <14, (10, 4, 5)>
- <14, (10, 5, 1)>
- <(10, 4, 5), 1>
- <(10, 5, 1), 3>
