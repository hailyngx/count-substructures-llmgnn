Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 23) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 2) (27, 20) (27, 19) (18, 12) (18, 28) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 21) (20, 27) (20, 7) (20, 28) (23, 0) (23, 22) (5, 4) (5, 17) (6, 0) (6, 22) (6, 15) (19, 27) (19, 26) (19, 17) (19, 24) (19, 3) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 13) (26, 10) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 28) (9, 11) (9, 16) (28, 18) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 7) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 15) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 3) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 11) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 19) (17, 13) (10, 0) (10, 26) (10, 21) (21, 22) (21, 10) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 14) (2, 27) (12, 18) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 24) (24, 19) (24, 8) (24, 11) (3, 19) (3, 13) (7, 20) (7, 28) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 15) (1, 12) (1, 14) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {27, 10, 17, 23, 6}
- Node 27: {0, 2, 20, 19}
- Node 18: {12, 28}
- Node 22: {23, 9, 6, 21}
- Node 20: {27, 7, 28}
- Node 23: {0, 22}
- Node 5: {4, 17}
- Node 6: {0, 22, 15}
- Node 19: {27, 26, 17, 24, 3}
- Node 26: {19, 28, 13, 10}
- Node 9: {22, 8, 28, 11, 16}
- Node 28: {18, 20, 26, 9, 7}
- Node 4: {5, 16, 15}
- Node 13: {26, 17, 3}
- Node 8: {9, 24, 16, 15, 11}
- Node 17: {0, 5, 19, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 26, 21}
- Node 21: {22, 10}
- Node 16: {9, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 2: {27}
- Node 12: {18, 1}
- Node 11: {9, 8, 24}
- Node 24: {19, 8, 11}
- Node 3: {19, 13}
- Node 7: {20, 28}
- Node 14: {16, 1, 15}
- Node 1: {12, 14}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = \(10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 61\)

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [61].
