Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 8) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 14) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (5, 18) (5, 14) (4, 18) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 8) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 0) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 2) (0, 13) (0, 12) (8, 11) (8, 18) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 2) (10, 6) (10, 7) (17, 11) (17, 9) (7, 13) (7, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {13, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 15, 6}
- Node 2: {12, 14, 19}
- Node 3: {1, 15, 16, 13}
- Node 4: {18}
- Node 5: {14, 18}
- Node 6: {1, 10, 12}
- Node 7: {13, 10}
- Node 8: {11, 18}
- Node 9: {13, 15, 17, 19}
- Node 10: {6, 7}
- Node 11: {8, 16, 17, 19, 15}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 9, 7}
- Node 14: {2, 5, 16, 18}
- Node 15: {1, 3, 9, 11}
- Node 16: {3, 14, 11}
- Node 17: {11, 9}
- Node 18: {4, 5, 8, 14}
- Node 19: {11, 9, 2}

Now let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with {8, 15, 16}
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with {17, 15, 19}
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with {1, 15, 16}
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with {1, 3, 9}

Total number of 3-stars = 4

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <11, (8, 15, 16)>
- <9, (17, 15, 19)>
- <3, (1, 15, 16)>
- <15, (1, 3, 9)>
