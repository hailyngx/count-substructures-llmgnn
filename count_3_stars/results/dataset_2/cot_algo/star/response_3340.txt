Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 neighbors or more: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: Only 3 neighbors, so not applicable
- Node 5: Only 2 neighbors, so not applicable
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 49

Therefore, the final answer is [49], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>
