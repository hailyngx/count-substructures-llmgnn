Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
Given the 10 nodes and 40 edges provided, let's first list out the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 9
Node 1: 0, 4, 7, 8
Node 2: 4, 6, 9
Node 3: 0, 6, 8
Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8
Node 5: 7, 8
Node 6: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 6
Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Node 9: 0, 2, 6, 8

Now, let's identify how many 3-stars can be formed:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5C3 = 10 3-stars
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5C3 = 10 3-stars
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars
Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6C3 = 20 3-stars
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 58

Therefore, the final answer is [58], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 7, 4>
<2, 4, 6>
<4, 7, 5>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 9>
