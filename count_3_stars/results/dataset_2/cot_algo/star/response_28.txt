Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 12) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 11) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 0) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: {7, 13, 11, 14}
Node 1: {7, 3, 5, 10, 12}
Node 2: {10, 6, 12, 14}
Node 3: {4, 1, 13, 9, 14}
Node 4: {7, 13, 3}
Node 5: {1, 8, 10, 11}
Node 6: {10, 2}
Node 7: {4, 0, 11, 9, 8, 1}
Node 8: {7, 13, 5}
Node 9: {7, 3, 12}
Node 10: {1, 6, 2, 5}
Node 11: {7, 13, 0, 5}
Node 12: {1, 13, 9, 2}
Node 13: {4, 3, 8, 12, 11, 0}
Node 14: {3, 2, 0}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars
Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it forms [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 84

Therefore, there are a total of [84] 3-stars in the graph.
