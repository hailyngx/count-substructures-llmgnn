Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 10) (22, 13) (22, 21) (15, 29) (15, 28) (27, 6) (9, 26) (9, 14) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 3) (26, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (21, 22) (21, 1) (21, 17) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 11) (29, 15) (29, 17) (29, 1) (29, 10) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 17) (4, 19) (4, 28) (4, 11) (8, 26) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 28) (20, 11) (17, 21) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 5) (3, 26) (3, 24) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 20) (0, 7) (0, 24) (0, 23) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 23) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 25) (5, 26) (5, 7) (5, 17) (5, 24) (18, 10) (18, 25) (28, 15) (28, 4) (28, 8) (28, 12) (6, 27) (6, 14) (6, 25) (6, 12) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 23) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 5) (10, 13) (10, 29) (10, 18) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 25) (25, 16) (25, 18) (25, 6) (25, 12) (23, 0) (23, 19) (23, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 7, 24, 23
Node 1: 21, 29, 17
Node 2: 8, 16, 11
Node 3: 26, 24
Node 4: 19, 28, 11
Node 5: 26, 7, 17, 24
Node 6: 27, 14, 25, 12
Node 7: 0, 5
Node 8: 26, 2, 19, 28
Node 9: 26, 14, 19
Node 10: 13, 29, 18
Node 11: 2, 4, 20
Node 12: 28, 6, 25
Node 13: 22, 10
Node 14: 9, 6, 23
Node 15: 29, 28
Node 16: 13, 2, 25
Node 17: 21, 1, 5
Node 18: 10, 25
Node 19: 9, 4, 8, 23
Node 20: 11
Node 21: 22, 1, 17
Node 22: 13, 21
Node 23: 0, 19, 14
Node 24: 3, 0, 5
Node 25: 16, 18, 6, 12
Node 26: 3, 5, 9, 8
Node 27: 6
Node 28: 15, 4, 8, 12
Node 29: 15, 17, 1, 10

Next, we'll identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 21, 17, 29
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 19, 8, 28
Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 26, 17, 24
Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 25, 14, 12
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 26, 19, 28
Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, 20
Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 22, 10, 29
Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 25, 18
Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, 23
Node 21 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 17, 29
Node 22 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 21, 1
Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 18, 6
Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 9, 8
Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 4, 12

Counting all unique 3-stars, we find that there are 14 in total. So, the final answer is [14].
