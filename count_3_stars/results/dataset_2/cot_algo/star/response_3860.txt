Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 16) (9, 19) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 17) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 16) (17, 7) (17, 14) (17, 10) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 8) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 16) (8, 10) (8, 11) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 13) (0, 5) (0, 13) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 1) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 13) (15, 18) (15, 1) (15, 16) (15, 12) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 12) (6, 10) (6, 3) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 19) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 12) (13, 18) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list format to better visualize the connections:

0: 5, 13  
1: 11, 15, 13  
2: 4, 19, 16  
3: 14, 6  
4: 18, 19, 2  
5: 0  
6: 10, 3  
7: 11, 19, 10, 17  
8: 10, 11  
9: 16, 19  
10: 7, 17, 6, 8  
11: 7, 8, 1  
12: 15, 16, 19  
13: 18, 0, 1  
14: 17, 3, 16  
15: 18, 1, 16, 12  
16: 9, 14, 2, 15, 12  
17: 7, 14, 10  
18: 4, 15, 13  
19: 9, 4, 7, 2, 12  

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 (12 nodes)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

\[
\text{{[Number of 3-stars]}} = \binom{n}{3}
\]

Calculating for each node:

2: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1  
4: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1  
7: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4  
10: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4  
11: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1  
12: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4  
13: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1  
15: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4  
16: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10  
17: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4  
18: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1  
19: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 45

Therefore, the final answer is [45]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (4, 19, 16)>
<4, (18, 15, 13)>
<7, (19, 10, 17)>
<10, (7, 17, 6)>
<11, (1, 8, 7)>
<12, (15, 16, 19)>
<13, (18, 0, 1)>
<15, (18, 16, 12)>
<16, (9, 14, 15)>
<17, (14, 10, 7)>
<18, (4, 15, 13)>
<19, (9, 7, 12)>
