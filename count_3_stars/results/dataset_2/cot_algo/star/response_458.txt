Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 19) (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 14) (18, 22) (18, 6) (18, 12) (20, 23) (20, 28) (25, 13) (25, 26) (25, 23) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 1) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 15) (8, 21) (8, 6) (8, 3) (26, 25) (26, 2) (7, 17) (15, 16) (15, 2) (15, 6) (15, 5) (9, 23) (29, 5) (29, 21) (3, 8) (3, 21) (3, 6) (21, 8) (21, 29) (21, 3) (21, 24) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 18) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 3) (6, 1) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 2) (19, 22) (19, 24) (19, 27) (10, 27) (27, 19) (27, 10) (27, 17) (14, 16) (14, 1) (4, 11) (4, 23) (17, 7) (17, 27) (17, 28) (17, 5) (28, 20) (28, 17) (28, 24) (28, 5) (24, 21) (24, 19) (24, 28) (23, 20) (23, 25) (23, 9) (23, 4) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 29) (5, 17) (5, 28) 

Response:
First, we will identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {16, 12, 1}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {12, 26, 15}
- Node 3: Neighbors {8, 21, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {11, 23}
- Node 5: Neighbors {11, 15, 29, 17, 28}
- Node 6: Neighbors {18, 8, 15, 3, 1}
- Node 7: Neighbors {17}
- Node 8: Neighbors {21, 6, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {23}
- Node 10: Neighbors {27}
- Node 11: Neighbors {16, 5, 4}
- Node 12: Neighbors {16, 18, 0, 2}
- Node 13: Neighbors {22, 25}
- Node 14: Neighbors {16, 1}
- Node 15: Neighbors {16, 2, 6, 5}
- Node 16: Neighbors {11, 15, 0, 12, 14}
- Node 17: Neighbors {7, 27, 28, 5}
- Node 18: Neighbors {22, 6, 12}
- Node 19: Neighbors {22, 24, 27}
- Node 20: Neighbors {23, 28}
- Node 21: Neighbors {8, 29, 3, 24}
- Node 22: Neighbors {13, 18, 19}
- Node 23: Neighbors {20, 25, 9, 4}
- Node 24: Neighbors {21, 19, 28}
- Node 25: Neighbors {13, 26, 23}
- Node 26: Neighbors {25, 2}
- Node 27: Neighbors {19, 10, 17}
- Node 28: Neighbors {20, 17, 24, 5}
- Node 29: Neighbors {5, 21}

Now, we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 15, 17, and 28
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 12, and 14

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <5, (15, 17, 28)> and <16, (0, 12, 14)>.
