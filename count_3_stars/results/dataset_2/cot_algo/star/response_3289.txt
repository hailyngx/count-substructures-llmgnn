Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 3) (13, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 11) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 4) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) 

Response:
First, let's construct the adjacency list for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {5, 11}
Node 1: {9, 3, 4, 12, 14}
Node 2: {10, 6, 4, 12}
Node 3: {5, 1, 11, 13, 8, 12}
Node 4: {1, 2, 11, 12}
Node 5: {9, 6, 0, 3}
Node 6: {5, 10, 2}
Node 7: {9, 10, 11}
Node 8: {3, 13, 14}
Node 9: {5, 10, 1, 7, 12}
Node 10: {9, 11, 6, 7, 2}
Node 11: {3, 10, 14, 7, 0, 4}
Node 12: {9, 1, 3, 2, 4}
Node 13: {3, 8}
Node 14: {1, 8, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 82

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [82].
