Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are as follows: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

The number of neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

For forming 3-stars:
- Node 3, 5, and 9 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 0, 1, 2, 6, and 7 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Nodes with less than 3 neighbors cannot form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 51 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (5, 9, 7)>, <5, (3, 9, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>
