Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 19) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 17) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 15) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 16) (0, 10) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 11) (16, 0) (16, 15) (19, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 4) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 2) (11, 15) (11, 18) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 18) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 5) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 14) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 3) (17, 7) (17, 2) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following nodes: 

\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 \]

Let's list the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 10, 12, 16}
- Node 1: {8, 9, 13, 5}
- Node 2: {3, 8, 11, 17}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 10}
- Node 4: {3, 10, 13}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 15}
- Node 6: {5, 19}
- Node 7: {0, 12, 17}
- Node 8: {1, 2}
- Node 9: {1, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 11: {2, 15, 18}
- Node 12: {0, 7, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {9, 15, 18}
- Node 15: {5, 11, 14, 16, 18}
- Node 16: {0, 15}
- Node 17: {2, 7}
- Node 18: {11, 14, 15}
- Node 19: {6}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 18.

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 109 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \([109]\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (7, 10, 12)>
- <1, (8, 9, 13)>
- <2, (3, 8, 11)>
- <3, (4, 10, 13)>
- <5, (6, 15, 19)>
- <7, (0, 12, 17)>
- <9, (13, 14, 1)>
- <10, (0, 3, 4)>
- <11, (2, 15, 18)>
- <12, (0, 13, 7)>
- <13, (1, 4, 9)>
- <14, (9, 15, 18)>
- <15, (5, 11, 18)>
- <18, (11, 14, 15)>
