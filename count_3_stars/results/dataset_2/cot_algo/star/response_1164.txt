Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges provided, we first need to find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 7, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {2, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 5, 13}
- Node 10: {7, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {4, 5, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {2, 4, 6, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 9, 10}
- Node 14: {4, 6, 10, 11}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 8, and 10.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 3-star (<0, 1, 13>)
- Node 1: 1 3-star (<1, 0, 6>)
- Node 3: 1 3-star (<3, 2, 9>)
- Node 8: 1 3-star (<8, 6, 7>)
- Node 10: 1 3-star (<10, 13, 14>)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
