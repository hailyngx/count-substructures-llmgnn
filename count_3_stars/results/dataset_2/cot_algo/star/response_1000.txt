Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 15 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 2 forms 15 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 7, 2)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].
