Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 17) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 13) (5, 16) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 14) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 1) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 19) (13, 9) (13, 5) (19, 12) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 0) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 18) (1, 10) (14, 5) (10, 3) (10, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 17) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 12, 17}
- Node 1: {10, 11, 16, 18}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 18}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 7, 10, 15}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {8, 9, 13, 14, 16}
- Node 6: {3, 9, 11, 17}
- Node 7: {3, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 13, 18}
- Node 10: {1, 3}
- Node 11: {1, 6, 7, 16}
- Node 12: {0, 7, 19}
- Node 13: {5, 9}
- Node 14: {5}
- Node 15: {3, 17}
- Node 16: {1, 5, 11}
- Node 17: {0, 6, 15}
- Node 18: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 19: {12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors

Now, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40 \)

So, the final answer is [40], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (10, 16, 18)>
- <3, (2, 7, 15)>
- <5, (8, 13, 14)>
- <6, (9, 11, 17)>
- <7, (8, 12, 11)>
- <9, (5, 13, 18)>
- <11, (1, 6, 16)>
