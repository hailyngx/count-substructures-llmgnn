Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 8}
Node 1: {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
Node 2: {6, 7}
Node 3: {1, 4, 6, 9}
Node 4: {0, 3, 7}
Node 5: {6, 8, 9}
Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 9}
Node 8: {0, 5, 6, 9}
Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed: 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 52

Thus, there are a total of 52 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [52], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, 
<1, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>,
<3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, 
<6, 7, 9>, <8, 9, 5>.
