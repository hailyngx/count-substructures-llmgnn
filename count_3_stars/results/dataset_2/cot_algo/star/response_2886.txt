Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (16, 17) (16, 2) (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 13) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 10) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 10) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 16) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 17) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (19, 5) (19, 1) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 17) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 13) (12, 18) (14, 9) (14, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {6}
- Node 1: {3, 8, 11, 13, 19}
- Node 2: {4, 15, 16, 18}
- Node 3: {1, 10, 14, 15}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 10}
- Node 5: {7, 19}
- Node 6: {0, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 8, 11}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {6, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 13, 15}
- Node 11: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 12: {18}
- Node 13: {1, 9, 10, 17}
- Node 14: {3, 9}
- Node 15: {2, 3, 10}
- Node 16: {2, 17}
- Node 17: {13, 16, 18}
- Node 18: {2, 12, 17}
- Node 19: {1, 5}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors: 
- Node 1, Node 3, Node 13, Node 18

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 19

Therefore, the final answer is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 3, 19>, <1, 8, 13>, <1, 8, 19>, <1, 13, 19>, <3, 10, 13>, <3, 10, 15>, <13, 16, 17>, <13, 17, 18>, <1, 11, 7>, <1, 11, 6>, <3, 14, 9>, <3, 14, 15>, <13, 9, 14>, <13, 9, 17>, <13, 10, 4>, <18, 2, 15>, <18, 2, 17>
