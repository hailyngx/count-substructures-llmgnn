- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. Unique 3-stars involving node 21: <(21, 15, 18)>

- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. Unique 3-stars involving node 28: <(28, 5, 19)>
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors, which is not sufficient to form a 3-star.

Summing up the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [57].
