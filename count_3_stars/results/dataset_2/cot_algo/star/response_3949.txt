Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node: 

- Node 0: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 8}

Now, for the nodes that have three or more neighbors, calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the final answer is [52], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>
