Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 4, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 3}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 6, 3, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 9, 6, 1, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 7, 8, 0, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 1, 4, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 4, 3, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9, 4, 0, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 7, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 2, 3, 0, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 2, as it has 4 neighbors: <2, (9, 6, 3)>, <2, (9, 6, 8)>, <2, (9, 3, 8)>, <2, (6, 3, 8)>
- Node 3, as it has 5 neighbors: <3, (5, 9, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 1)>, <3, (9, 1, 2)>, <3, (9, 2, 6)>
- Node 4, as it has 5 neighbors: <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>, <4, (7, 0, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 6)>
- Node 6, as it has 4 neighbors: <6, (9, 4, 3)>, <6, (9, 4, 6)>, <6, (4, 3, 2)>, <6, (9, 3, 2)>
- Node 7, as it has 4 neighbors: <7, (9, 4, 0)>, <7, (9, 4, 6)>, <7, (4, 0, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 2)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars formed, we get a total of [22].
