Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 0) (16, 21) (16, 8) (16, 4) (13, 22) (13, 24) (13, 14) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 12) (22, 21) (6, 13) (6, 25) (6, 0) (9, 2) (18, 22) (18, 17) (18, 1) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 24) (1, 18) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 29) (21, 16) (21, 22) (21, 12) (4, 16) (4, 27) (4, 5) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 17) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 8) (29, 1) (29, 12) (28, 27) (28, 23) (28, 15) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 15) (27, 4) (27, 28) (27, 3) (27, 7) (27, 5) (15, 10) (15, 28) (15, 14) (15, 26) (23, 28) (23, 26) (26, 15) (26, 23) (26, 3) (7, 27) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 27) (20, 3) (20, 24) (2, 9) (2, 19) (2, 3) (19, 2) (12, 22) (12, 21) (12, 29) (3, 10) (3, 27) (3, 26) (3, 20) (3, 2) (25, 6) (25, 24) (24, 13) (24, 10) (24, 20) (24, 25) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we need to identify the number of 3-stars in the graph.

First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 11, 6, 14
- Node 1: 18, 10, 17, 29
- Node 2: 9, 19, 3
- Node 3: 9, 27, 26, 20, 2
- Node 4: 16, 27, 5
- Node 5: 4, 8, 27
- Node 6: 13, 0, 25
- Node 7: 27
- Node 8: 16, 5, 17
- Node 9: 2, 3
- Node 10: 11, 1, 15, 3, 24
- Node 11: 10, 0
- Node 12: 22, 21, 29
- Node 13: 6, 22, 14, 24
- Node 14: 13, 0, 15
- Node 15: 10, 28, 14, 26
- Node 16: 4, 21, 8
- Node 17: 18, 1, 8
- Node 18: 22, 17, 1
- Node 19: 2
- Node 20: 24, 3
- Node 21: 16, 22, 12
- Node 22: 13, 18, 12, 21
- Node 23: 28, 26
- Node 24: 13, 10, 20, 25
- Node 25: 6, 24
- Node 26: 3, 23, 15
- Node 27: 4, 28, 3, 7, 5
- Node 28: 27, 23, 15
- Node 29: 12, 1

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 3: 3-stars = 1 (3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 3-stars = 1 (3 neighbors)
- Node 12: 3-stars = 1 (3 neighbors)
- Node 14: 3-stars = 1 (3 neighbors)
- Node 15: 3-stars = 1 (3 neighbors)
- Node 18: 3-stars = 1 (3 neighbors)
- Node 24: 3-stars = 1 (3 neighbors)
- Node 26: 3-stars = 1 (3 neighbors)
- Node 27: 3-stars = 1 (3 neighbors)
- Node 28: 3-stars = 1 (3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (9, 27, 26)>, <5, (4, 8, 27)>, <12, (22, 21, 29)>, <14, (13, 0, 15)>, <15, (10, 28, 26)>, <18, (22, 17, 1)>, <24, (13, 10, 20)>, <26, (3, 23, 15)>, <27, (4, 28, 3)>.
