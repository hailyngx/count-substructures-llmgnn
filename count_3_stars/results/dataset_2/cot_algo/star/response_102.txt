Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 14) (8, 19) (8, 16) (13, 12) (13, 19) (13, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 3) (2, 18) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 19) (11, 12) (11, 15) (1, 4) (1, 18) (1, 0) (17, 5) (17, 15) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 11) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 14) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 10) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 12) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 0) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 14) (10, 16) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 12, 15}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 18}
- Node 2: {16, 18}
- Node 3: {6, 9, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 11, 17, 19}
- Node 6: {3, 5}
- Node 7: {4, 14}
- Node 8: {16, 19}
- Node 9: {3, 9, 14, 15}
- Node 10: {16}
- Node 11: {5, 11, 15, 17, 19}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {12, 14, 19}
- Node 14: {7, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 15: {0, 9, 11, 15, 17}
- Node 16: {2, 8, 10}
- Node 17: {5, 11, 15}
- Node 18: {1, 2}
- Node 19: {5, 8, 11, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \(10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 44\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <5, (4, 11, 19)>
- <11, (5, 15, 19)>
- <12, (0, 11, 14)>
- <15, (0, 9, 17)>
