Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 3) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 8, 11}
- Node 1: {4, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 11, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {9, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 11, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 9, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 10: {5, 8, 11}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 12: {4, 6, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 5, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 14: {1, 6, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up gives a total of 74 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer is [74].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <4, (1, 5, 12)>
- <4, (1, 9, 6)>
- <4, (2, 9, 12)>
- <4, (5, 9, 12)>
- <6, (9, 12, 13)>
- <8, (9, 11, 4)>
- <8, (9, 11, 13)>
- <8, (9, 10, 5)>
- <8, (9, 13, 12)>
- <8, (11, 10, 5)>
- <11, (1, 3, 7)>
- <11, (1, 7, 13)>
- <11, (3, 7, 13)>
- <12, (4, 6, 9)>
- <12, (6, 13, 14)>
- <13, (3, 5, 12)>
