Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (6, 10) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 12) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 2) (13, 7) (13, 1) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 12) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors: 7, 3, 11, 2, 13
- Node 2 has neighbors: 4, 1, 3, 0, 5, 12
- Node 6 has neighbors: 10, 9, 14, 0
- Node 7 has neighbors: 10, 9, 13, 1, 8
- Node 10 has neighbors: 7, 11, 6, 12

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
For Node 1, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For Node 2, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
For Node 6, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For Node 7, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For Node 10, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up, we have a total of 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 48 3-stars.
Thus, the final answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (7, 3, 11)>
- <1, (7, 3, 2)>
- <1, (7, 3, 13)>
- <1, (7, 11, 2)>
- <1, (7, 11, 13)>
- <1, (3, 2, 13)>
- <1, (7, 2, 13)>
- <1, (3, 11, 13)>
- <2, (4, 3, 5)>
- <2, (4, 0, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 12)>
- <2, (1, 0, 5)>
- <2, (3, 0, 12)>
- <2, (1, 12, 5)>
- <6, (10, 9, 0)>
- <6, (10, 9, 14)>
- <6, (10, 14, 0)>
- <7, (10, 9, 8)>
- <7, (10, 9, 13)>
- <7, (10, 13, 8)>
- <7, (9, 13, 8)>
- <10, (7, 11, 12)>
