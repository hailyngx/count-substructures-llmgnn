Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 15) (1, 6) (1, 18) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 6) (7, 9) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 9) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 19) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 19) (5, 12) (5, 15) (5, 14) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 10) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 9) (4, 19) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 4) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 14) (15, 16) (15, 13) (15, 5) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 19) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are connected to each node. 

Node 0 is connected to: 10, 8, 19
Node 1 is connected to: 6, 18
Node 2 is connected to: 6, 14
Node 3 is connected to: 10, 13, 18
Node 4 is connected to: 17, 10, 9, 19
Node 5 is connected to: 12, 15, 14
Node 6 is connected to: 1, 2, 18, 12
Node 7 is connected to: 9
Node 8 is connected to: 12, 0, 10
Node 9 is connected to: 7, 13, 4
Node 10 is connected to: 0, 3, 8, 4, 19
Node 11 is connected to: 16, 17
Node 12 is connected to: 5, 6, 8
Node 13 is connected to: 3, 17, 15, 9
Node 14 is connected to: 2, 5, 19
Node 15 is connected to: 16, 13, 5
Node 16 is connected to: 11, 15
Node 17 is connected to: 11, 13, 4
Node 18 is connected to: 1, 3, 6
Node 19 is connected to: 0, 10, 4, 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<4, (10, 19, 8)>
<10, (0, 8, 19)>
<10, (0, 4, 19)>
<10, (3, 8, 4)>
<10, (3, 4, 19)>
<13, (9, 17, 15)>
<19, (0, 4, 14)>
