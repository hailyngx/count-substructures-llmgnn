Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we first need to find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {4, 6, 2}
Node 1: {9, 3, 6}
Node 2: {4, 3, 0}
Node 3: {5, 1, 6, 2, 8}
Node 4: {5, 9, 7, 2, 0}
Node 5: {9, 4, 3, 7}
Node 6: {9, 1, 3, 8, 0}
Node 7: {5, 9, 4}
Node 8: {9, 3, 6}
Node 9: {5, 9, 8, 4, 1, 6, 7}

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors for potential 3-star formations. 
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
Node 3: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 4: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 5: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 6: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 7: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
Node 9: 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 = 55
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [55].

The unique 3-star formations are:
<3, (5, 1, 6)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<5, (9, 4, 7)>
<6, (9, 1, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 7, 4)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 3)>
<9, (4, 7, 5)>
<9, (7, 5, 4)>
<9, (7, 5, 4)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
