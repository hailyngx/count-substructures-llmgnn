Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 5) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 1) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 14) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 9) (2, 1) (2, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 3) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {5, 7}
Node 1: {2, 5, 6, 7, 11, 14}
Node 2: {1, 10}
Node 3: {9, 10, 12}
Node 4: {6, 7, 9, 12}
Node 5: {0, 8, 12}
Node 6: {1, 4, 8, 14}
Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 9}
Node 8: {5, 6, 10, 14}
Node 9: {3, 4, 7, 12, 14}
Node 10: {2, 3, 8, 13}
Node 11: {1, 13}
Node 12: {3, 4, 5, 9, 13, 14}
Node 13: {10, 11, 12, 14}
Node 14: {1, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<1, (2, 5, 14)>
<1, (6, 8, 14)>
<1, (7, 9, 14)>
<5, (0, 8, 12)>
<5, (1, 6, 14)>
<5, (8, 14, 12)>
<12, (3, 9, 14)>
<12, (4, 6, 14)>
<12, (4, 9, 7)>
<12, (5, 8, 14)>
<12, (13, 14, 11)>
<13, (10, 14, 11)>

Counting them up, we have a total of 12 unique 3-stars, so the final answer is [12].
