Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 2) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 2: {5, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 10}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 10}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 10}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {6, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 11: {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 12: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 2, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 6, 8, 9, 13}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: None
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: None
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: 6, 14
- Nodes with 7 neighbors: None

Nodes 6 and 14 have 6 neighbors each, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of.

For Node 6:
\( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

For Node 14:
\( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 (from Node 6) + 20 (from Node 14) = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 9, 11)>
<6, (5, 9, 12)>
<6, (5, 9, 14)>
<6, (5, 11, 12)>
<6, (5, 11, 14)>
<6, (5, 12, 14)>
<6, (7, 9, 11)>
<6, (7, 9, 12)>
<6, (7, 9, 14)>
<6, (7, 11, 12)>
<6, (7, 11, 14)>
<6, (7, 12, 14)>
<6, (9, 11, 12)>
<6, (9, 11, 14)>
<6, (9, 12, 14)>
<6, (11, 12, 14)>
<14, (2, 6, 8)>
<14, (2, 6, 9)>
<14, (2, 6, 13)>
<14, (2, 8, 9)>
<14, (2, 8, 13)>
<14, (2, 9, 13)>
<14, (6, 8, 9)>
<14, (6, 8, 13)>
<14, (6, 9, 13)>
<14, (8, 9, 13) >
