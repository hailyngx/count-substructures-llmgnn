Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 5, 8, 9, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 6, 8}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars based on the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 35

Therefore, the final answer is [35], and the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>.
