Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Now, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 9.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of unique 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <7, 9, 5>, <7, 9, 8>, <9, 4, 6>, <9, 4, 7>, <9, 5, 7>, <9, 5, 8>.
