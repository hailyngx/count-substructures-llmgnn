Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 19) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 8) (17, 8) (17, 11) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 15) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 12) (16, 7) (16, 18) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 6) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 9) (19, 18) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (5, 8) (5, 10) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (11, 1) (11, 17) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 13) (12, 9) (12, 3) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 5) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 18) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 14, 3
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 14, 11, 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 10
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 13, 12
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 19, 1, 15, 2
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 10
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 18, 3, 13
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 16, 6, 2
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 17, 5, 15
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 10, 19, 12
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 5
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 1, 17
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 3
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 6
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 19
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 18
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 7, 18
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 8, 11
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 16, 19, 15, 6
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 4, 14, 9, 18

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 14, 15: <4, (1, 14, 15)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 16, 19: <18, (15, 16, 19)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, 17: <8, (1, 5, 17)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, 13: <3, (0, 6, 13)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars formed in this graph, so the total number of 3-stars is [4].
