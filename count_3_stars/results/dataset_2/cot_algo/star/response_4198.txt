Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (6, 7) (6, 14) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 2) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 1) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, namely nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

For node 4:
- Neighbors: 5, 9, 10, 14, 11
- Total number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (5, 9, 10)>, <4, (5, 9, 14)>, <4, (5, 10, 14)>, <4, (5, 10, 11)>, <4, (9, 10, 14)>, <4, (9, 10, 11)>, <4, (9, 14, 11)>, <4, (10, 14, 11)>

For node 7:
- Neighbors: 9, 6, 14, 13
- Total number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (9, 6, 14)>, <7, (9, 6, 13)>, <7, (9, 14, 13)>, <7, (6, 14, 13)>

For node 8:
- Neighbors: 9, 13, 11, 3, 1
- Total number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <8, (9, 13, 11)>, <8, (9, 13, 3)>, <8, (9, 13, 1)>, <8, (9, 11, 3)>, <8, (9, 11, 1)>, <8, (9, 3, 1)>, <8, (13, 11, 3)>, <8, (13, 11, 1)>, <8, (13, 3, 1)>, <8, (11, 3, 1)>

For node 9:
- Neighbors: 5, 8, 4, 7, 12
- Total number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>, <9, (5, 8, 12)>, <9, (5, 4, 7)>, <9, (5, 4, 12)>, <9, (5, 7, 12)>, <9, (8, 4, 7)>, <9, (8, 4, 12)>, <9, (8, 7, 12)>, <9, (4, 7, 12)>

The total number of 3-stars formed by the nodes is 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 34, therefore the final answer is [34].
