Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:

- Node 1, 5, 9: Each can form 3-stars since they have 4 neighbors.
- Node 0, 2, 4, 8: Each can form 3-stars since they have 3 neighbors.

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 1, 5, 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each, so a total of 12.
- For nodes 0, 2, 4, 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for each, so a total of 4.

Combining these, the total number of unique 3-stars is 16, which we will represent as [16].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>.
