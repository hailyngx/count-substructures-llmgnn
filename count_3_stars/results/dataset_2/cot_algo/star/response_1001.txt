Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 9) (11, 27) (16, 11) (16, 17) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 27) (17, 16) (17, 27) (1, 3) (1, 29) (1, 10) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 4) (20, 18) (20, 2) (20, 19) (25, 5) (25, 26) (25, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 29) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 18) (4, 3) (4, 25) (4, 8) (15, 19) (15, 7) (28, 11) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 5) (24, 26) (24, 9) (26, 25) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 0) (18, 14) (18, 20) (18, 13) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 22) (22, 6) (22, 27) (22, 0) (19, 3) (19, 20) (19, 15) (19, 28) (29, 1) (29, 8) (29, 21) (21, 29) (21, 0) (0, 26) (0, 22) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 5) (7, 15) (7, 27) (27, 11) (27, 14) (27, 17) (27, 22) (27, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 28) (9, 24) (9, 12) (2, 20) (5, 25) (5, 28) (5, 0) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 9) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {5, 12, 21, 22, 26}
- Node 1: {3, 9, 10, 29}
- Node 2: {20}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 19}
- Node 4: {3, 8, 25}
- Node 5: {0, 25, 28}
- Node 6: {10, 14, 22}
- Node 7: {15, 27}
- Node 8: {4, 8, 13, 29}
- Node 9: {1, 11, 12, 24, 28}
- Node 10: {1, 6}
- Node 11: {9, 16, 27, 28}
- Node 12: {0, 9, 29}
- Node 13: {8, 18, 26}
- Node 14: {6, 18, 27}
- Node 15: {7, 19}
- Node 16: {11, 17}
- Node 17: {16, 27}
- Node 18: {13, 14, 20}
- Node 19: {3, 15, 20, 28}
- Node 20: {2, 18, 19}
- Node 21: {0, 29}
- Node 22: {0, 6, 27}
- Node 24: {9, 26}
- Node 25: {4, 5, 26}
- Node 26: {0, 13, 24, 25}
- Node 27: {7, 11, 14, 17, 22}
- Node 28: {5, 9, 11, 19}
- Node 29: {1, 8, 12, 21}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the given information:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].
