Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 9, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 6, 10}
- Node 10: {5, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {2, 3}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 13: {0, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 8, 13}

Now, we can find the possible 3-stars:
- Node 5 and its neighbors {2, 7, 8, 10} form 1 3-star: <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 and its neighbors {3, 5, 7, 13, 14} form 1 3-star: <8, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 10 and its neighbors {5, 7, 9, 13} form 1 3-star: <10, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 13 and its neighbors {0, 8, 10, 14} form 1 3-star: <13, (0, 8, 10)>

Therefore, we have a total of 4 3-stars in this graph. Summing them up, we get [4].
