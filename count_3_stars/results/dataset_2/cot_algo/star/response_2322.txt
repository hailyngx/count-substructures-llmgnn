Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 22) (15, 12) (15, 28) (27, 2) (27, 3) (7, 21) (7, 14) (7, 26) (7, 8) (21, 7) (21, 9) (20, 25) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 0) (10, 17) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 26) (17, 11) (1, 26) (1, 22) (26, 7) (26, 17) (26, 1) (26, 16) (26, 0) (28, 15) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 12) (28, 5) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 22) (29, 18) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 22) (6, 12) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 22) (13, 25) (13, 5) (13, 24) (24, 6) (24, 13) (24, 18) (11, 20) (11, 17) (11, 18) (14, 7) (14, 12) (9, 21) (18, 29) (18, 24) (18, 11) (2, 27) (2, 19) (2, 0) (23, 10) (23, 19) (8, 7) (8, 20) (12, 15) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 14) (4, 16) (19, 29) (19, 2) (19, 23) (0, 25) (0, 17) (0, 26) (0, 2) (3, 27) (3, 20) (22, 15) (22, 1) (22, 29) (22, 6) (22, 5) (16, 26) (16, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 17, 25, 26
- Node 1: 22, 26
- Node 2: 0, 19, 27
- Node 3: 20, 27
- Node 4: 16
- Node 5: 13, 22, 28
- Node 6: 12, 22, 24, 28
- Node 7: 8, 14, 21, 26
- Node 8: 7, 20
- Node 9: 21
- Node 10: 17, 23
- Node 11: 18, 20, 17
- Node 12: 14, 15, 28, 6
- Node 13: 5, 24, 25
- Node 14: 7, 12
- Node 15: 12, 22, 28
- Node 16: 4, 26
- Node 17: 0, 10, 11, 26
- Node 18: 11, 24, 29
- Node 19: 2, 23, 29
- Node 20: 3, 8, 11, 25
- Node 21: 7, 9
- Node 22: 1, 5, 6, 15, 29
- Node 23: 10, 19
- Node 24: 6, 13, 18
- Node 25: 0, 13, 20
- Node 26: 0, 1, 7, 16, 17
- Node 27: 2, 3
- Node 28: 5, 6, 12, 15, 29
- Node 29: 18, 19, 22, 28

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 55

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [55], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (17, 25, 26)>, <6, (12, 24, 28)>, <12, (14, 15, 28)>, <13, (5, 24, 18)>, <17, (0, 11, 26)>, <18, (11, 24, 29)>, <19, (2, 23, 29)>, <22, (15, 6, 29)>, <25, (0, 13, 20)>, <26, (1, 7, 16)>, <28, (5, 15, 29)>
