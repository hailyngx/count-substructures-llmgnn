Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 1) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 13) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 17) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 2) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (5, 15) (5, 3) (19, 4) (15, 17) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 8) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 2) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (9, 0) (9, 15) (9, 3) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (10, 3) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 16) (13, 10) (2, 14) (2, 16) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 6) (11, 17) (11, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 9, 14
Node 1: 7, 12, 17, 16
Node 2: 14, 16 
Node 3: 5, 9, 10, 6
Node 4: 18, 19, 13
Node 5: 15, 3
Node 6: 3, 11, 8
Node 7: 1, 12, 8
Node 8: 7, 15, 6
Node 9: 0, 15, 3
Node 10: 3, 13
Node 11: 17, 6
Node 12: 7, 1
Node 13: 4, 16, 10
Node 14: 18, 0, 2
Node 15: 17, 5, 16, 9, 8
Node 16: 1, 17, 15, 13, 2
Node 17: 18, 1, 16, 15, 11
Node 18: 4, 14, 17

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 15, 16, 17, and 18 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<1, (7, 12, 17)>, <1, (7, 12, 16)>, <1, (7, 17, 16)>, <1, (12, 17, 16)>

Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<3, (5, 9, 10)>, <3, (5, 9, 6)>, <3, (5, 10, 6)>, <3, (9, 10, 6)>

Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<4, (18, 19, 13)>

Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<6, (11, 17, 6)>

Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<15, (17, 5, 16)>, <15, (17, 5, 9)>, <15, (17, 5, 8)>, <15, (17, 16, 9)>, <15, (17, 16, 8)>, <15, (17, 9, 8)>, <15, (5, 9, 8)>, <15, (16, 9, 8)>, <15, (5, 16, 9)>, <15, (5, 16, 8)>

Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<16, (1, 17, 15)>, <16, (1, 17, 13)>, <16, (1, 15, 13)>, <16, (17, 15, 13)>, <16, (17, 15, 2)>, <16, (17, 13, 2)>, <16, (15, 13, 2)>, <16, (1, 15, 2)>, <16, (1, 13, 2)>, <16, (15, 13, 2)>

Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<17, (1, 16, 15)>, <17, (1, 16, 13)>, <17, (1, 15, 13)>, <17, (16, 15, 13)>, <17, (16, 15, 2)>, <17, (16, 13, 2)>, <17, (15, 13, 2)>, <17, (1, 15, 2)>, <17, (1, 13, 2)>, <17, (15, 13, 2)>

Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<18, (4, 14, 17)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the final count of the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [41].
