Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {6, 8, 2, 1}
- Node 1: {6, 5, 0, 2}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 5, 0, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {9, 4, 2}
- Node 4: {6, 8, 5, 3, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 4, 2, 1}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 1, 7, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {6, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 0, 7}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 3}

Now, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 6 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing these up: 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <2, 4, 6>
