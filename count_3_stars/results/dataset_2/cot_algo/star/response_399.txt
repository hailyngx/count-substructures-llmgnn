- Node 0: 9, 21, 24, 27
- Node 1: 13, 14, 26
- Node 2: 4, 16, 26
- Node 3: 10, 12, 19
- Node 4: 2, 28
- Node 5: 8, 21
- Node 6: 7, 13, 15, 22
- Node 7: 6, 9, 20, 22, 25
- Node 8: 5, 11, 27
- Node 9: 0, 7, 23
- Node 10: 3, 24
- Node 11: 8, 21, 24
- Node 12: 3, 17

- Node 22: 6, 7, 16, 29
- Node 23: 9, 18
- Node 24: 0, 10, 11, 27
- Node 25: 7, 15, 17, 26
- Node 26: 1, 15, 25
- Node 27: 0, 8, 18, 24, 28
- Node 28: 4, 27
- Node 29: 13, 22

Nodes that form a 3-star are: 0, 27, 26, 25, 24, 21, 17, 15, 13, 11, 9, 8, 7, 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [14].

Unique 3-stars:
