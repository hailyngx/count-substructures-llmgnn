Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, we'll create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {6, 4, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {6, 4, 7, 5}
- Node 2: {9, 6, 4, 8, 7}
- Node 3: {9, 0}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 2, 0, 1}
- Node 5: {8, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 2, 0, 1}
- Node 8: {5, 4, 2}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 3, 7}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 1 + 10 = 12 \), thus [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <7, (5, 1, 2)>
- <2, (6, 4, 8)>
