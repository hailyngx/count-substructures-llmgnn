Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 15) (13, 0) (1, 17) (1, 18) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (15, 13) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 18) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 2) (7, 19) (7, 18) (0, 13) (0, 3) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 10) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 2) (9, 16) (9, 14) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 5) (5, 3) (5, 10) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {13, 3}
- Node 1: {17, 18}
- Node 2: {16, 17, 12, 4}
- Node 3: {17, 0, 5}
- Node 4: {11, 13, 2}
- Node 5: {3, 10}
- Node 6: {8, 14, 10}
- Node 7: {19, 18}
- Node 8: {14, 6, 12, 10}
- Node 9: {16, 14}
- Node 10: {8, 6, 5}
- Node 11: {16, 4}
- Node 12: {8, 13, 2}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 15, 12}
- Node 14: {8, 6, 9}
- Node 15: {13, 17, 19, 18}
- Node 16: {11, 17, 9, 2}
- Node 17: {16, 1, 3, 2, 15}
- Node 18: {1, 15, 7}
- Node 19: {15, 7}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 2, 8, 13, 15, and 17 have 4 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them:

  - Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <2, (16, 17, 12)>
    - <2, (16, 17, 4)>
    - <2, (17, 13, 12)>
    - <2, (17, 13, 4)>

  - Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <8, (14, 6, 10)>
    - <8, (14, 6, 12)>
    - <8, (14, 10, 12)>
    - <8, (6, 10, 12)>

  - Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <13, (0, 15, 12)>
    - <13, (0, 15, 4)>
    - <13, (0, 12, 2)>
    - <13, (15, 17, 12)>

  - Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <15, (13, 17, 19)>
    - <15, (13, 17, 18)>
    - <15, (13, 19, 18)>
    - <15, (17, 19, 18)>

  - Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - <17, (16, 2, 15)>
    - <17, (16, 2, 4)>
    - <17, (16, 15, 19)>
    - <17, (16, 15, 18)>
    - <17, (2, 13, 15)>
    - <17, (2, 13, 18)>
    - <17, (15, 19, 18)>
    - <17, (13, 19, 18)>
    - <17, (15, 19, 7)>
    - <17, (15, 18, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [26].
