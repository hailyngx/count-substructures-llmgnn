Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 15) (14, 23) (17, 14) (17, 4) (17, 21) (15, 14) (15, 21) (20, 7) (20, 1) (20, 22) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 5) (7, 20) (12, 29) (11, 28) (11, 24) (11, 26) (11, 29) (28, 11) (28, 26) (28, 8) (26, 11) (26, 28) (26, 2) (26, 8) (10, 2) (6, 24) (6, 4) (6, 23) (24, 11) (24, 6) (24, 22) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 25) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 27) (25, 0) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 29) (25, 22) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 4) (2, 26) (2, 10) (27, 9) (27, 29) (27, 3) (29, 12) (29, 11) (29, 25) (29, 27) (3, 27) (3, 16) (3, 22) (3, 18) (1, 20) (1, 8) (1, 25) (1, 19) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 13) (4, 17) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 19) (13, 19) (18, 3) (18, 16) (16, 9) (16, 3) (16, 18) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 25) (22, 3) (23, 14) (23, 6) (21, 17) (21, 15) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {14, 25, 5}
- Node 1: {20, 8, 25, 19}
- Node 2: {26, 10}
- Node 3: {27, 16, 22, 18}
- Node 4: {17, 6, 9, 5, 19}
- Node 5: {0, 8, 4}
- Node 6: {24, 4, 23}
- Node 7: {20}
- Node 8: {28, 26, 5, 1}
- Node 9: {25, 4, 16, 27}
- Node 10: {2}
- Node 11: {28, 24, 26, 29}
- Node 12: {29}
- Node 13: {19}
- Node 14: {17, 0, 15, 23}
- Node 15: {14, 21}
- Node 16: {9, 3, 18}
- Node 17: {14, 4, 21}
- Node 18: {3, 16}
- Node 19: {1, 4, 13}
- Node 20: {7, 1, 22}
- Node 21: {17, 15}
- Node 22: {20, 24, 25, 3}
- Node 23: {14, 6}
- Node 24: {11, 6, 22}
- Node 25: {0, 9, 1, 29, 22}
- Node 26: {11, 28, 2, 8}
- Node 27: {9, 29, 3}
- Node 28: {11, 26, 8}
- Node 29: {25, 11, 27, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Nodes 0, 4, 5, 8, 9, 14, 16, 17, 19, 22, 25, and 29 each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 1, 3, 6, 11, 26, and 28 each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- No other nodes have 3 or more neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 12 \times 4 + 6 \times 10 = 48 + 60 = 108 \]

Therefore, there are a total of 108 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (5, 25, 4)>, <4, (9, 19, 1)>, <5, (0, 8, 4)>, <8, (1, 28, 26)>, <9, (27, 25, 4)>, <14, (17, 0, 23)>, <16, (18, 9, 3)>, <17, (21, 14, 4)>, <19, (13, 4, 1)>, <22, (24, 25, 20)>, <25, (29, 22, 1)>, <29, (27, 11, 25)>
