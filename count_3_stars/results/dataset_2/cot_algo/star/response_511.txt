Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 13) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 10) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {9, 1, 3, 14}
Node 1: {9, 3, 2, 0, 8}
Node 2: {5, 1, 6, 12, 13}
Node 3: {9, 4, 1, 0, 8}
Node 4: {7, 14, 6, 3}
Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 8}
Node 6: {5, 4, 2, 13}
Node 7: {9, 4, 12}
Node 8: {5, 1, 3, 11, 10}
Node 9: {5, 14, 3, 1, 7, 0}
Node 10: {12, 14, 8}
Node 11: {13, 8}
Node 12: {7, 2, 10}
Node 13: {6, 2, 11}
Node 14: {9, 4, 0, 10}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 14

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 72

Therefore, the final answer is [72], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 1, 14>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 12>
<2, 5, 13>
<2, 6, 13>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 13>
<5, 6, 8>
<8, 10, 14>
