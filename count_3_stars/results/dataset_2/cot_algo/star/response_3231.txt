Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 18) (10, 14) (2, 16) (2, 18) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 1) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 12) (19, 5) (19, 4) (8, 17) (8, 1) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 7) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 1) (17, 18) (17, 8) (17, 15) (4, 11) (4, 19) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 8) (1, 14) (15, 18) (15, 17) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 5, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {8, 9, 14, 18}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 7, 16, 18}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 9, 16}
- Node 4: Neighbors {11, 19}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 9, 19}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 14, 18}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 17}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 10: Neighbor {14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 13, 16}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 13: Neighbors {7, 11, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 6, 10}
- Node 15: Neighbors {17, 18}
- Node 16: Neighbors {2, 3, 11}
- Node 17: Neighbors {8, 15, 18}
- Node 18: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 15, 17}
- Node 19: Neighbors {4, 5}

Now, let's find nodes with 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars. We have the following:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: <0, (2, 5, 12)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: <1, (8, 9, 14, 18)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: <2, (0, 7, 16, 18)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: <3, (7, 9, 16)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: <5, (0, 9, 19)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: <6, (9, 14, 18)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: <7, (2, 3, 13)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: <9, (1, 3, 5, 6)>
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: <11, (4, 13, 16)>
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: <13, (7, 11, 12)>
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: <14, (1, 6, 10)>
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: <16, (2, 3, 11)>
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: <17, (8, 15, 18)>
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors: <18, (1, 2, 6, 15, 17)>
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors.

In total, there are 12 unique 3-stars formed. So the final answer is [12].
