Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 2) (4, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 7) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 8, 3, 11, 12, 5
Node 1 neighbors: 12, 6, 10, 13
Node 2 neighbors: 8, 6, 3, 7, 4
Node 3 neighbors: 2, 8, 11, 0, 4
Node 4 neighbors: 2, 3
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 10, 14
Node 6 neighbors: 2, 11, 1, 14, 7
Node 7 neighbors: 8, 3, 6, 14, 13, 2
Node 8 neighbors: 2, 9, 11, 0, 7
Node 9 neighbors: 8, 10, 13
Node 10 neighbors: 9, 1, 5
Node 11 neighbors: 8, 3, 0, 6
Node 12 neighbors: 13, 0, 1
Node 13 neighbors: 9, 12, 1, 7
Node 14 neighbors: 6, 7, 5

Now, letâ€™s identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars for each such node:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 68

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [68].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 3, 11>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 13>, <0, 7, 14>, <1, 10, 13>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 11>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 11>, <6, 7, 13>
