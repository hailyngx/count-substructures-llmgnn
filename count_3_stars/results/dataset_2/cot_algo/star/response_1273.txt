Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 6) (8, 14) (8, 11) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 8) (14, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node: 

Node 0: {2, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13}
Node 1: {2, 5, 11, 13, 14}
Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 12}
Node 3: {2, 7, 12}
Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 12}
Node 5: {1, 4, 7, 11, 12}
Node 6: {0, 4, 11, 13}
Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 5, 12}
Node 8: {11, 14}
Node 9: {13}
Node 10: {0, 13}
Node 11: {1, 5, 6, 8}
Node 12: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
Node 13: {0, 1, 6, 10}
Node 14: {1, 8}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes: 
20 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 106

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [106].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 7, 12)>
<0, (6, 13, 12)>
<0, (6, 13, 2)>
<0, (10, 13, 12)>
<0, (10, 13, 2)>
<1, (2, 14, 13)>
<1, (5, 11, 13)>
<2, (0, 7, 12)>
<2, (1, 12, 13)>
<2, (1, 5, 13)>
<2, (1, 14, 13)>
<2, (4, 5, 12)>
<2, (7, 0, 12)>
<3, (2, 7, 12)>
<4, (2, 5, 12)>
<4, (6, 11, 12)>
<5, (1, 11, 13)>
<5, (4, 12, 7)>
<5, (4, 12, 11)>
<5, (7, 0, 12)>
<6, (0, 13, 12)>
<7, (0, 2, 12)>
<11, (1, 5, 6)>
<11, (1, 5, 8)>
<11, (6, 0, 13)>
<12, (0, 2, 7)>

These are the unique 3-stars in the given graph.
