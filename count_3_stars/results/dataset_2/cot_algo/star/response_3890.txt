Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 10: {3, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 3, 6, 10}
- Node 12: {3, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 10, 12}
- Node 14: {4, 7, 12}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3, 10, and 13 have 5 or more neighbors.

For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star (since it's already listed for node 0)

For nodes with 5 or more neighbors, the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 5) + 10 (from node 6) + 10 (from node 7) + 4 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 10) + 4 (from node 13) = 34

So, the final answer is [34], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, 5, 6, 11>
<4, 6, 10, 13>
<5, 7, 12, 14>
<6, 7, 8, 4>
<6, 7, 8, 5>
<6, 8, 5, 0>
<6, 8, 5, 2>
<7, 12, 3, 14>
<7, 12, 13, 4>
<7, 12, 13, 0>
<7, 12, 14, 4>
<7, 14, 4, 13>
<7, 14, 12, 4>
<8, 6, 10, 13>
<10, 6, 8, 5>
<10, 6, 8, 7>
