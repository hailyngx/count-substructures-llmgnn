Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 18) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 3) (18, 16) (18, 5) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (17, 11) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 14) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 19) (9, 12) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 19) (12, 4) (12, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 0) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (14, 1) (14, 10) (2, 19) (2, 3) (0, 15) (0, 6) (0, 19) (0, 5) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 3) (5, 0) 

Response:
The central idea is to find the nodes which have 3 or more neighbors and then count the number of 3-stars centered at those nodes.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 4, 7, 8, 18, 1, 10, 15, 9, 13, 12, 19, 3, 0, 5 

For node 11:
It has 4 neighbors - 16, 1, 19, 17
So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 11 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<11, (16, 1, 19)>, <11, (16, 1, 17)>, <11, (16, 19, 17)>, <11, (1, 19, 17)>

For node 16:
It has 3 neighbors - 11, 13, 18
So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 16 is 1
<16, (11, 13, 18)>

For node 4:
It has 3 neighbors - 7, 12, 13
So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 4 is 1
<4, (7, 12, 13)>

For node 7, 8, 18, 1, 10, 15, 9, 13, 12, 19, 3, 0, 5:
Each of these nodes has less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.

Total number of 3-stars = number of 3-stars centered at node 11 + node 16 + node 4 = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
