Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 6) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 2) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 4) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 14) 

Response:
The nodes are as follows: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}.

Let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 10, 14, 3, 2}
- Node 1: {13, 7, 12, 2}
- Node 2: {6, 0, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {10, 0, 12, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 10, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 12, 4}
- Node 6: {5, 10, 11, 2}
- Node 7: {9, 11, 12, 1}
- Node 8: {9, 13, 14, 0}
- Node 9: {8, 11, 7, 12}
- Node 10: {11, 0, 3, 6, 4, 14}
- Node 11: {9, 10, 7, 6}
- Node 12: {5, 9, 7, 3, 1}
- Node 13: {8, 1}
- Node 14: {8, 10, 0, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = [10] 3-stars
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so there are [inom{6}{3}] = [20] 3-stars
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = [10] 3-stars
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 68.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [68].
