Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in terms of its adjacency list:

Node 0: 5, 9, 6, 8, 3, 1
Node 1: 5, 7, 8, 0
Node 2: 7, 8, 3
Node 3: 9, 4, 7, 2, 8, 0
Node 4: 5, 7, 3
Node 5: 1, 4, 0
Node 6: 8, 0
Node 7: 9, 4, 3, 2, 1
Node 8: 6, 2, 3, 1, 0
Node 9: 3, 7, 0

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 6 neighbors, forming [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 6 neighbors, forming [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <4, 7, 3>.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <5, 4, 0>.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, forming [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, forming [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <9, 7, 0>.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 67

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [67].
