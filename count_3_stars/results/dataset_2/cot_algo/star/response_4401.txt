Response:
The graph contains the following nodes connected in the stated fashion:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 20, 7, 13
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 28, 10, 27
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 29, 24, 14
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 10, 6, 5
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 23, 20, 9, 21
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 18, 20, 6, 25
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 24, 17
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 29, 18, 7, 19, 21
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 24, 4
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 29, 1, 3
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 14, 17
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 23, 26
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 2, 11, 28
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 29, 18
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 6, 11, 25
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 22, 5, 16, 21, 8
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 26, 8, 27
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 0, 26, 4, 5
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 18, 8, 4, 27
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 18
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 4, 12
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 9
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 5, 26, 17
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 20, 12, 19, 25
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 1, 19, 21
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 1, 14
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 2, 16, 8, 10

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars involving node 18 are <18, (5, 16, 21)>, <18, (5, 8, 21)>, <18, (5, 8, 19)>, <18, (5, 8, 29)>, <18, (5, 16, 29)>, <18, (16, 8, 21)>, and permutations.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
