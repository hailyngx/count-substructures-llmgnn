Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 5) (16, 1) (16, 18) (1, 16) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 9) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 9) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 0) (7, 1) (7, 14) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 0) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 15) (19, 13) (19, 17) (19, 6) (19, 9) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 14) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 17) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 12) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 6) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 19) (9, 4) (17, 19) (17, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {3, 18, 12}
- Node 1: {16, 7, 12}
- Node 2: {18, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 13}
- Node 4: {12, 5, 9, 17}
- Node 5: {11, 2, 4, 15}
- Node 6: {19, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 14}
- Node 8: {11}
- Node 9: {10, 2, 19, 4}
- Node 10: {11, 15, 18, 9}
- Node 11: {10, 8, 5}
- Node 12: {1, 0, 4}
- Node 13: {3, 19}
- Node 14: {18, 7, 15, 6}
- Node 15: {10, 5, 14}
- Node 16: {1, 18}
- Node 17: {19, 4}
- Node 18: {16, 10, 2, 14, 0}
- Node 19: {13, 17, 6, 9}

Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 18, and 19 have three or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 18: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 19: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 12, 18)>, <1, (7, 12, 16)>, <2, (5, 9, 18)>, <4, (9, 12, 17)>, <5, (11, 15, 2)>, <9, (10, 19, 2)>, <10, (11, 15, 9)>, <12, (0, 1, 4)>, <14, (15, 6, 18)>, <18, (0, 14, 16, 2)>, <19, (9, 13, 6, 17)>
