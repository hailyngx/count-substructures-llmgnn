Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 19) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 10) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 15) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 18) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 7) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 19) (16, 17) (18, 5) (18, 11) (18, 15) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 17) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 18) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 19) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 10) (0, 12) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   <6, (9, 5, 10)>, <6, (9, 8, 10)>, <6, (9, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 10)>

2. Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
   <9, (6, 15, 19)>

3. Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
   <8, (6, 13, 1)>

4. Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   <13, (8, 4, 2)>, <13, (8, 10, 2)>, <13, (8, 10, 4)>, <13, (4, 10, 2)>

5. Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
   <5, (6, 18, 15)>

6. Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
   <3, (11, 7, 17)>

7. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   <11, (3, 14, 7)>, <11, (3, 18, 7)>, <11, (14, 18, 7)>, <11, (3, 18, 14)>

Adding up all these unique 3-stars, we get a total of 16. Therefore, the final number is [16].
