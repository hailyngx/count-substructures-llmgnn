Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 15) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 16) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 19) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 15) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 2) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 15) (4, 3) (4, 6) (1, 17) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 7) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 13) (16, 9) (16, 2) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 14) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 4) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (12, 10) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 6) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 1, 3, 5
- Node 1 neighbors: 0, 7, 13, 17
- Node 2 neighbors: 11, 13, 16, 18, 19
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 10, 17
- Node 4 neighbors: 3, 6
- Node 5 neighbors: 0, 15
- Node 6 neighbors: 4, 13, 14
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 8, 13, 19
- Node 8 neighbors: 7, 10, 12
- Node 9 neighbors: 11, 16
- Node 10 neighbors: 3, 8, 12, 19
- Node 11 neighbors: 2, 9, 14
- Node 12 neighbors: 8, 10
- Node 13 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 14 neighbors: 6, 11, 15
- Node 15 neighbors: 5, 14, 17
- Node 16 neighbors: 2, 9
- Node 17 neighbors: 1, 3, 15
- Node 18 neighbors: 2
- Node 19 neighbors: 2, 7, 10

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 8, 10, 13, 15, 17, 19
Number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 10)>
<7, (1, 13, 19)>
<8, (7, 10, 12)>
<10, (3, 8, 19)>
<13, (1, 2, 7)>
<15, (5, 14, 17)>
<17, (1, 3, 15)>
<19, (2, 7, 10)>
