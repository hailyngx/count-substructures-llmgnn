Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges based on the provided edge information, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node and then identify any 3-stars formed.

Let's start by listing the neighbor sets for each node:

1. Node 0: {16, 9}
2. Node 1: {10, 14}
3. Node 2: {7, 8, 13}
4. Node 3: {14}
5. Node 4: {15, 16}
6. Node 5: {15, 18, 28}
7. Node 6: {11, 22, 25}
8. Node 7: {2, 21, 25}
9. Node 8: {2, 14, 23}
10. Node 9: {0, 16, 20}
11. Node 10: {1, 17, 18, 19, 26}
12. Node 11: {6, 13, 29}
13. Node 12: {24}
14. Node 13: {2, 11, 26}
15. Node 14: {1, 3, 8, 20}
16. Node 15: {4, 5, 18, 21}
17. Node 16: {0, 4, 9, 28}
18. Node 17: {10, 19, 28}
19. Node 18: {5, 10, 15, 17}
20. Node 19: {10, 17, 18, 25}
21. Node 20: {9, 14, 22, 26}
22. Node 21: {7, 15}
23. Node 23: {8, 2}
24. Node 24: {12, 26, 29}
25. Node 25: {6, 7, 19}
26. Node 26: {10, 13, 20, 24}
27. Node 27: {22}
28. Node 28: {5, 16, 17}
29. Node 29: {11, 24}

Now, let's identify the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 10, 19, and 28 have exactly 3 neighbors each, so there is 1 3-star for each of these nodes.
- For the remaining nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each:

1. Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up:  
1 (from node 10) + 1 (from node 19) + 1 (from node 28) + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<10, (1, 17, 26)>, <19, (10, 17, 28)>, <28, (5, 16, 17)>, <15, (4, 5, 18)>, <16, (0, 4, 9)>, <18, (5, 10, 17)>
