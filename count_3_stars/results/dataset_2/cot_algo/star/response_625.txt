Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 18) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (12, 17) (12, 14) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 18) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 4) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 15) (4, 9) (4, 15) (4, 19) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (17, 16) (17, 12) (19, 4) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 15) (0, 2) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 1) 

Response:
First, we will identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 13, 15}
- Node 1: {8, 15, 18}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {9, 15, 19}
- Node 5: {8, 11, 18}
- Node 6: {0, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {3, 10}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 16}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 10: {7, 13, 15}
- Node 11: {5, 6, 16, 18}
- Node 12: {14, 17}
- Node 13: {0, 10}
- Node 14: {12}
- Node 15: {0, 1, 4, 10}
- Node 16: {8, 11, 17, 18}
- Node 17: {12, 16}
- Node 18: {1, 5, 11, 16}
- Node 19: {4}

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 30 \]

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (2, 13, 15)>, <0, (3, 15, 4)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (13, 10, 15)>, <1, (8, 15, 18)>, <2, (0, 9, 3)>, <3, (8, 9, 4)>, <4, (9, 15, 19)>, <5, (8, 11, 18)>, <6, (0, 9, 2)>, <8, (3, 16, 11)>, <9, (4, 6, 3)>, <10, (7, 15, 13)>, <11, (16, 18, 5)>, <16, (11, 17, 18)>, <18, (1, 5, 16)>
