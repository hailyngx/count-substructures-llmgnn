Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 10) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 10) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: {6, 7, 11, 12, 13}
Node 1: {4, 10, 11, 12}
Node 2: {3, 4, 9, 10}
Node 3: {2, 5, 6, 14}
Node 4: {1, 2, 7, 8, 14}
Node 5: {3, 8, 9}
Node 6: {0, 3, 9, 11}
Node 7: {0, 4, 9, 13}
Node 8: {4, 5, 8, 12, 13}
Node 9: {2, 5, 6, 7, 13}
Node 10: {1, 2, 14}
Node 11: {0, 1, 6, 12}
Node 12: {0, 1, 8, 11}
Node 13: {0, 7, 8, 9}
Node 14: {3, 4, 10}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: No 3-star (has only 4 neighbors)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: No 3-star (has only 3 neighbors)
Node 6: No 3-star (has only 4 neighbors)
Node 7: No 3-star (has only 4 neighbors)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 10: No 3-star (has only 3 neighbors)
Node 11: No 3-star (has only 4 neighbors)
Node 12: No 3-star (has only 4 neighbors)
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 14: No 3-star (has only 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42]. 

Unique 3-stars: <0, (6, 11, 12)>, <0, (7, 8, 13)>, <0, (7, 11, 13)>, <0, (7, 12, 13)>, <0, (8, 11, 12)>, <1, (4, 10, 12)>, <2, (3, 9, 10)>, <3, (4, 8, 14)>, <4, (7, 8, 13)>, <5, (8, 9, 13)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>.
