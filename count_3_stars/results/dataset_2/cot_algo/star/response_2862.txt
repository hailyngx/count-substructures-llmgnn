Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 4) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 10) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 11) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges and the edge list provided, let's determine the total number of 3-stars formed by the nodes.

First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 8, 13, 12, 14, 11}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 14, 2, 10}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 14, 6, 1, 10}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 10}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 9, 14, 6, 11}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 12, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {8, 14, 2, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 9, 3, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {10, 0, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 7, 0}
- Node 10: Neighbors {8, 3, 2, 1}
- Node 11: Neighbors {13, 12, 0, 4}
- Node 12: Neighbors {13, 11, 0, 5}
- Node 13: Neighbors {12, 11, 0}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 6, 1, 4, 2}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 14: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-star configurations found in the graph are as follows:
- <0, (9, 13, 12)>
- <0, (9, 13, 14)>
- <0, (9, 12, 14)>
- <0, (13, 12, 14)>
- <2, (5, 6, 14)>
- <2, (5, 10, 14)>
- <4, (5, 6, 14)>
- <4, (5, 11, 14)>
- <14, (1, 2, 6)>
- <14, (1, 2, 4)>
