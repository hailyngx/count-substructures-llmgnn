Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 22) (27, 11) (4, 8) (4, 20) (7, 3) (7, 5) (3, 7) (3, 25) (3, 22) (3, 18) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 16) (21, 16) (8, 4) (8, 23) (8, 28) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 18) (23, 2) (23, 1) (5, 7) (5, 25) (5, 29) (6, 24) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 0) (1, 23) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 11) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 26) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 19) (11, 27) (11, 26) (11, 2) (28, 8) (28, 24) (28, 10) (16, 25) (16, 21) (16, 17) (24, 6) (24, 28) (24, 13) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 18) (9, 25) (9, 20) (9, 19) (22, 27) (22, 3) (22, 14) (22, 29) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 17) (20, 4) (20, 9) (20, 12) (12, 14) (12, 20) (10, 28) (2, 23) (2, 11) (2, 17) (13, 15) (13, 24) (29, 5) (29, 22) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 8, 14, 15}
- Node 1: {23, 26}
- Node 2: {11, 17, 23}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 18, 22, 25}
- Node 4: {8, 20}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 9, 25, 29}
- Node 6: {0, 19, 24}
- Node 7: {3, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 23, 28}
- Node 9: {5, 19, 20, 25}
- Node 10: {28}
- Node 11: {2, 26, 27}
- Node 12: {14, 20}
- Node 13: {15, 24}
- Node 14: {0, 12, 19, 22, 26}
- Node 15: {0, 13, 27}
- Node 16: {17, 21, 25}
- Node 17: {2, 16, 18}
- Node 18: {3, 17, 23}
- Node 19: {6, 9, 14}
- Node 20: {4, 9, 12}
- Node 21: {16}
- Node 22: {3, 14, 27, 29}
- Node 23: {2, 8, 18, 1}
- Node 24: {6, 13, 28}
- Node 25: {3, 5, 9, 16}
- Node 26: {1, 11, 14}
- Node 27: {11, 15, 22}
- Node 28: {8, 10, 24}
- Node 29: {5, 22}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with them:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 3: [10]
- Node 5: [10]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 14: [6]
- Node 22: [6]
- Node 25: [1]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get \(1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 6 + 1 = 36\), so the final answer is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (5, 7, 25)>
- <5, (3, 7, 25)>
- <14, (0, 19, 22)>
- <22, (3, 14, 27)>
- <25, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (5, 9, 25)>
- <3, (7, 18, 22)>
- <3, (22, 25, 29)>
- <5, (7, 9, 25)>
- <22, (14, 27, 29)>
- <5, (9, 16, 25)>
- <9, (5, 16, 25)>
- <18, (3, 17, 23)>
- <14, (19, 22, 29)>
- <14, (0, 22, 29)>
- <22, (14, 0, 29)>
- <14, (0, 19, 29)>
- <14, (0, 19, 22)>
