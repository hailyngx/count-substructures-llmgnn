Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (12, 11) (12, 2) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows: 

Node 0: {9, 4, 10}
Node 1: {5, 9, 4, 10, 8, 14}
Node 2: {9, 7, 10, 8, 12}
Node 3: {9, 13, 6}
Node 4: {7, 0, 1}
Node 5: {9, 13, 1, 14}
Node 6: {11, 8, 3}
Node 7: {4, 11, 2, 13}
Node 8: {2, 14, 6, 1}
Node 9: {5, 2, 3, 1, 0}
Node 10: {11, 0, 1, 13, 2}
Node 11: {7, 10, 14, 6, 12}
Node 12: {11, 2}
Node 13: {3, 7, 10, 5}
Node 14: {5, 11, 8, 1}

Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14 have 3 or more neighbors, which means we can form 3-stars with these nodes. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed: 
\[ \text{Number of 3-star} = \sum_{v \in V} \binom{{\text{degree of }} v}{3} \]

\[ = \binom{3}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} \]

\[ = 1 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 \]

\[ = 66 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [66].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (9, 4, 10)>, 
<1, (5, 9, 4)>, 
<2, (9, 7, 10)>, 
<3, (9, 13, 6)>, 
<5, (9, 13, 1)>, 
<7, (4, 11, 2)>, 
<8, (2, 14, 6)>, 
<9, (5, 2, 3)>, 
<10, (11, 1, 13)>, 
<11, (7, 14, 6)>, 
<13, (3, 7, 10)>, 
<14, (11, 8, 5)>
