Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 19) (22, 17) (22, 12) (22, 25) (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 1) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 21) (26, 11) (26, 12) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 2) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 23) (2, 15) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (29, 9) (29, 2) (29, 8) (20, 25) (20, 24) (20, 28) (25, 22) (25, 20) (25, 5) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 3) (12, 22) (12, 26) (12, 7) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 13) (5, 25) (4, 27) (4, 6) (16, 28) (28, 20) (28, 16) (28, 14) (28, 23) (10, 2) (10, 21) (10, 18) (21, 26) (21, 10) (21, 24) (11, 26) (11, 7) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 17) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (14, 27) (14, 28) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 24) (23, 9) (23, 27) (23, 28) (23, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 18) (18, 10) (18, 1) (17, 22) (17, 19) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 23) (24, 20) (24, 21) (24, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

1: 9, 14, 18
2: 15, 29, 8, 6, 10
3: 7, 8, 14
4: 27, 6
5: 13, 25
6: 2, 8, 4, 23
7: 12, 11, 3
8: 2, 29, 6, 3
9: 26, 29, 1, 23
10: 2, 21, 18
11: 26, 7
12: 22, 26, 7
13: 5, 15, 19
14: 27, 28, 3, 1, 24
15: 13, 19, 2
16: 28
17: 22, 19
18: 10, 1
19: 13, 15, 17
20: 25, 24, 28
21: 26, 10, 24
22: 17, 12, 25
23: 9, 27, 28, 6
24: 20, 21, 14
25: 5, 22, 20
26: 9, 21, 11, 12
27: 4, 14, 23
28: 20, 16, 14, 23
29: 9, 2, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [43].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (6, 8, 29)>
<3, (7, 8, 14)>
<6, (2, 8, 29)>
<8, (2, 6, 29)>
<9, (1, 23, 29)>
<14, (1, 3, 27)>
<24, (14, 20, 21)>
<26, (11, 12, 21)>
<28, (14, 20, 23)>
