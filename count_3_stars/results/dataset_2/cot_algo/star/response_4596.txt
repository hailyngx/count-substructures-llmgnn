Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 6) (26, 4) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 0) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 18) (23, 29) (23, 6) (12, 27) (12, 24) (27, 9) (27, 12) (27, 14) (27, 3) (27, 16) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 11) (0, 19) (20, 0) (20, 19) (28, 9) (28, 21) (28, 13) (29, 23) (29, 25) (29, 24) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 17) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 8) (17, 21) (17, 1) (17, 2) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 13) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 11) (6, 26) (6, 23) (6, 24) (6, 4) (24, 12) (24, 29) (24, 6) (24, 8) (24, 5) (25, 29) (25, 11) (19, 22) (19, 0) (19, 20) (19, 7) (5, 23) (5, 24) (5, 18) (18, 23) (18, 5) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (16, 27) (8, 1) (8, 24) (8, 14) (14, 27) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 8) (11, 0) (11, 15) (11, 25) (13, 28) (13, 3) (2, 17) (2, 7) (4, 26) (4, 15) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 7, 11, 19, 20, 22}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 8, 14, 17}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 17}
- Node 3: Neighbors {13, 21, 27}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 15, 26}
- Node 5: Neighbors {18, 23, 24}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 23, 24, 26}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 14, 19}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 14, 24}
- Node 9: Neighbors {26, 27, 28}
- Node 10: Neighbors {15}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 15, 25}
- Node 12: Neighbors {24, 27}
- Node 13: Neighbors {3, 28}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 7, 8, 27}
- Node 15: Neighbors {4, 10, 11}
- Node 16: Neighbors {27}
- Node 17: Neighbors {1, 2, 21}
- Node 18: Neighbors {5, 23}
- Node 19: Neighbors {0, 7, 20, 22}
- Node 20: Neighbors {0, 19}
- Node 21: Neighbors {3, 17, 28}
- Node 22: Neighbors {19, 23}
- Node 23: Neighbors {5, 6, 18, 22, 29}
- Node 24: Neighbors {5, 6, 8, 12, 29}
- Node 25: Neighbors {11, 29}
- Node 26: Neighbors {4, 6, 9}
- Node 27: Neighbors {3, 9, 12, 14, 16}
- Node 28: Neighbors {13, 21, 27}
- Node 29: Neighbors {23, 24, 25}

Next, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 11, 14, 15, 19, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Number of 3-stars = \(\binom{13}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \times 2 + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} \times 2 + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 286\)

Therefore, the final answer is [286], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 7, 19>
- <0, 7, 19, 20>
- <0, 7, 19, 22>
- <6, 4, 15, 26>
- <6, 4, 26, 15>
- <7, 1, 14, 17>
- <7, 2, 1, 8>
- <7, 2, 17, 1>
- <7, 8, 1, 14>
- <11, 0, 15, 25>
- <14, 1, 7, 8>
- <14, 1, 8, 7>
- <14, 1, 17, 2>
- <14, 1, 2, 17>
- <14, 7, 1, 8>
- <14, 7, 8, 1>
- <15, 4, 10, 11>
- <15, 11, 10, 4>
- <19, 7, 0, 20>
- <19, 7, 20, 0>
- <23, 5, 18, 24>
- <23, 6, 5, 24>
- <23, 6, 24, 5>
- <23, 24, 6, 5>
- <24, 6, 5, 23>
- <24, 6, 23, 5>
- <26, 4, 6, 9>
- <27, 3, 13, 28>
- <27, 3, 21, 17>
- <27, 9, 26, 4>
- <27, 9, 6, 26>
- <27, 14, 7, 1>
- <27, 14, 1, 7>
- <28, 13, 3, 27>
- <28, 21, 3, 27>
- <29, 23, 5, 24>
- <29, 24, 5, 23>
