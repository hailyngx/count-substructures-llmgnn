Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 2) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (10, 12) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 18) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 1) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 15) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 12) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 19) (7, 1) (7, 19) (2, 16) (2, 17) (3, 16) (3, 4) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 5) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 19) (0, 4) (0, 19) 

Response:
The 3-stars formed in this graph with the given node and edge information are as follows:

<1, (5, 8, 19)>
<2, (16, 3, 17)>
<3, (4, 6, 16)>
<4, (3, 6, 16)>
<5, (1, 8, 19)>
<6, (3, 4, 16)>
<8, (1, 5, 19)>
<9, (6, 11, 16)>
<12, (10, 17, 19)>
<13, (6, 14, 15)>
<14, (13, 15, 18)>
<15, (13, 14, 19)>
<16, (2, 8, 15)>
<17, (2, 12, 19)>
<18, (6, 8, 14)>
<19, (12, 15, 17)>

Since there are 15 unique 3-stars formed, the total number of 3-stars is [15].
