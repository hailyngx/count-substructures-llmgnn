Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 21) (3, 19) (15, 10) (7, 21) (7, 16) (21, 3) (21, 7) (21, 14) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 28) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 1) (11, 4) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 6) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 6) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 16) (28, 10) (28, 12) (29, 26) (20, 17) (20, 12) (20, 18) (17, 23) (17, 20) (17, 26) (2, 13) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 25) (24, 11) (24, 27) (24, 9) (9, 24) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 19) (18, 20) (18, 9) (18, 27) (18, 12) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 27) (5, 22) (5, 23) (5, 8) (5, 12) (14, 21) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 13) (27, 24) (27, 18) (27, 1) (27, 26) (12, 28) (12, 20) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 14) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 1) (0, 9) (26, 29) (26, 17) (26, 27) (25, 10) (25, 16) (25, 6) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (6, 22) (6, 23) (6, 25) (6, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {9}
Node 1: {11, 19, 27}
Node 2: {13}
Node 3: {19, 21}
Node 4: {8, 11, 14}
Node 5: {8, 12, 22, 23}
Node 6: {13, 22, 23, 25}
Node 7: {16, 21}
Node 8: {4, 5, 16}
Node 9: {0, 18, 19, 24}
Node 10: {11, 15, 25, 28}
Node 11: {1, 4, 10, 24}
Node 12: {5, 14, 18, 20, 28}
Node 13: {2, 6, 14}
Node 14: {4, 12, 13, 21, 22}
Node 15: {10}
Node 16: {7, 8, 25}
Node 17: {20, 23, 26}
Node 18: {9, 12, 20, 27}
Node 19: {1, 3, 9}
Node 20: {12, 17, 18}
Node 21: {3, 7, 14}
Node 22: {5, 6, 14}
Node 23: {5, 6, 17}
Node 24: {9, 11, 27}
Node 25: {6, 10, 16}
Node 26: {17, 27, 29}
Node 27: {1, 18, 24, 26}
Node 28: {10, 12}
Node 29: {26}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star:

Nodes forming 3-star: 1, 11, 12, 14, 18, 19, 24

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Total = \( \binom{7}{3} \) = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (11, 19, 27)>
<11, (1, 10, 24)>
<12, (5, 14, 18)>
<14, (4, 12, 22)>
<18, (9, 12, 20)>
<19, (3, 9, 1)>
<24, (9, 11, 27)>
