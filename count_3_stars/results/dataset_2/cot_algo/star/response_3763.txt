Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 11) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 12) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 10) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we first need to find the neighbors of each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {6, 8, 9}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {7, 14}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6, 7, 10, 12}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {11}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {5, 8, 10}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7, 9, 14}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 13}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 12}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 10, 11}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 9, 12}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {3, 5, 9, 10, 12, 14}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {2, 5, 8, 10, 11}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {7}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {1, 6, 11}

Now, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

1. Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( {5 \choose 3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( {6 \choose 3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( {6 \choose 3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( {6 \choose 3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( {5 \choose 3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( {6 \choose 3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( {5 \choose 3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 110

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [110].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<2, (5, 7, 12)>, <2, (5, 10, 12)>, <2, (6, 7, 14)>, 
<5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 10, 12)>, <5, (6, 10, 11)>, 
<6, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (2, 6, 14)>, <10, (2, 5, 12)>, 
<11, (5, 9, 12)>
