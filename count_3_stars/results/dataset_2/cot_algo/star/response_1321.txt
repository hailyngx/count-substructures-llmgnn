Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

- Node 0 neighbors: {8, 7, 3, 4}
- Node 1 neighbors: {5, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 2 neighbors: {5, 1, 7}
- Node 3 neighbors: {5, 6, 0, 7, 9, 4}
- Node 4 neighbors: {0, 9, 3}
- Node 5 neighbors: {6, 2, 8, 1, 3}
- Node 6 neighbors: {5, 3, 8}
- Node 7 neighbors: {2, 0, 3, 9, 1}
- Node 8 neighbors: {5, 6, 0}
- Node 9 neighbors: {7, 4, 3, 1}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 forms [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 forms [6 choose 3] = 20 3-stars
- Node 5 forms [5 choose 3] = 10 3-stars
- Node 7 forms [5 choose 3] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9 forms [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars

Adding the total number of 3-stars formed by each node:

4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 7, 3)>
<1, (5, 2, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 0)>
<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<7, (2, 0, 3)>
<9, (7, 4, 3)>
