Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 13) (16, 8) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 16) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (18, 7) (18, 17) (18, 13) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 18) (7, 14) (7, 2) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 14) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (6, 8) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 18) (17, 6) (17, 12) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 14) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 12) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 12) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 9) (12, 5) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 19) (13, 16) (13, 18) (13, 10) (19, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated as follows:

1. First, we need to determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {11, 5, 2}
- Node 1: {15, 2, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 0, 7, 14}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 4: {8, 2}
- Node 5: {3, 0, 12}
- Node 6: {8, 17}
- Node 7: {18, 14, 2}
- Node 8: {16, 4, 10, 6}
- Node 9: {11, 15, 12}
- Node 10: {8, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 9, 17}
- Node 12: {10, 17, 9, 5}
- Node 13: {16, 18, 10}
- Node 14: {1, 7, 15, 2, 19}
- Node 15: {1, 9, 14}
- Node 16: {13, 8}
- Node 17: {11, 18, 6, 12}
- Node 18: {7, 17, 13}
- Node 19: {14}

2. Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [1 3-star]
- Node 1: [1 3-star]
- Node 2: [1 3-star]
- Node 5: [1 3-star]
- Node 8: [1 3-star]
- Node 12: [1 3-star]
- Node 14: [1 3-star]
- Node 17: [1 3-star]

Adding up these results, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 11, 2>
<1, 15, 14>
<2, 1, 14>
<5, 3, 12>
<8, 16, 4>
<12, 10, 17>
<14, 7, 15>
<17, 11, 18>
