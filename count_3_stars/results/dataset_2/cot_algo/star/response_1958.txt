Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 4) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 11) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 4) (10, 5) (10, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 13) 

Response:
The central idea is to first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {6, 13, 2}
- Node 1: {9, 3, 2, 13, 12, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 12, 0, 8, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 13, 4}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 3, 14, 11, 13}
- Node 5: {9, 4, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {11, 12, 8, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 3}
- Node 8: {6, 1, 2, 11}
- Node 9: {5, 10, 1, 7}
- Node 10: {5, 9}
- Node 11: {6, 8, 4}
- Node 12: {6, 1, 2, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 0, 2, 4}
- Node 14: {5, 12, 4}

Now, identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:  None
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors:  None

Therefore, no 3-stars can be formed in this graph. The final count of 3-stars is [0].
