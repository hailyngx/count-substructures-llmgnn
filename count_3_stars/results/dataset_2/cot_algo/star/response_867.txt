Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 10) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star clusters in the graph:

1. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: {9, 5, 7, 2, 12}. It forms \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
2. Node 9 has 5 neighbors: {6, 4, 14, 13, 7}. It forms \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
3. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {3, 10, 12}. It forms 1 3-star.
4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {1, 7, 13}. It forms 1 3-star.
5. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {9, 8, 12, 10, 11}. It forms \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
6. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {6, 13, 12}. It forms 1 3-star.
7. Node 2 has 5 neighbors: {6, 8, 10, 11, 0}. It forms \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
8. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {2, 11, 12}. It forms 1 3-star.
9. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {6, 9, 3, 14}. It forms \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
10. Node 12 has 6 neighbors: {6, 1, 4, 5, 0, 10}. It forms \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars.
11. Node 11 has 4 neighbors: {4, 2, 0, 14}. It forms \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
12. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {9, 7, 11, 10}. It forms \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
13. Node 10 has 5 neighbors: {1, 4, 2, 12, 14}. It forms \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 76

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [76]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

<6, (9, 5, 2)>
<6, (9, 5, 12)>
<6, (9, 7, 2)>
<6, (9, 7, 12)>
<6, (9, 2, 12)>
<6, (5, 7, 2)>
<6, (5, 7, 12)>
<6, (5, 2, 12)>
<6, (7, 2, 12)>
<9, (6, 4, 14)>
<9, (6, 4, 13)>
<9, (6, 4, 7)>
<9, (6, 14, 13)>
<9, (6, 14, 7)>
<9, (6, 13, 7)>
<9, (4, 14, 13)>
<9, (4, 14, 7)>
<9, (4, 13, 7)>
<9, (14, 13, 7)>
<...> (continue similarly for all combinations)
