Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: {3, 4, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[
\binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42
\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- <8, (0, 5, 7)>
