Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {9, 4, 7, 2}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 8, 3}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 3, 2}
- Node 8: {6, 3, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 6, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 9 have 6 neighbors.
- Node 1 and Node 7 have 4 neighbors.

Now, applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding all the combinations together: 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are 46 3-stars in the given graph. 

Putting the final number inside brackets: [46]

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (7, 9, 2)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 8, 0)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
