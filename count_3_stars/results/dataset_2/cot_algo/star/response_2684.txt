Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 15) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 15) (8, 0) (8, 15) (9, 14) (9, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (1, 18) (1, 6) (17, 3) (17, 12) (3, 19) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 14) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (13, 0) (13, 16) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 10) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges based on the nodes they connect:

Node 0: (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 13)
Node 1: (1, 6), (1, 18)
Node 2: (2, 6), (2, 10), (2, 15), (2, 16)
Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 12), (3, 17), (3, 19)
Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 11)
Node 5: (5, 7), (5, 11), (5, 12), (5, 16)
Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 2)
Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 5), (7, 15), (7, 18)
Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 15)
Node 9: (9, 14), (9, 19)
Node 10: (10, 2), (10, 12), (10, 14)
Node 11: (11, 4), (11, 5), (11, 12)
Node 12: (12, 3), (12, 5), (12, 10), (12, 11), (12, 17)
Node 13: (13, 0), (13, 16)
Node 14: (14, 9), (14, 10), (14, 15)
Node 15: (15, 2), (15, 7), (15, 8), (15, 14), (15, 18)
Node 16: (16, 2), (16, 5), (16, 13)
Node 17: (17, 3), (17, 12)
Node 18: (18, 1), (18, 7), (18, 15)
Node 19: (19, 3), (19, 9)

Now, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (7, 8, 13)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (6, 18)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (6, 10, 15, 16)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (4, 12, 17, 19)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (3, 11)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (7, 11, 12, 16)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (1, 2)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (0, 5, 15, 18)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (0, 15)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (14, 19)
- Node 10: 3 neighbors (2, 12, 14)
- Node 11: 3 neighbors (4, 5, 12)
- Node 12: 5 neighbors (3, 5, 10, 11, 17)
- Node 13: 2 neighbors (0, 16)
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (9, 10, 15)
- Node 15: 5 neighbors (2, 7, 8, 14, 18)
- Node 16: 3 neighbors (2, 5, 13)
- Node 17: 2 neighbors (3, 12)
- Node 18: 3 neighbors (1, 7, 15)
- Node 19: 2 neighbors (3, 9)

Now, we will look at nodes with 3 or more neighbors to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 5 neighbors
- Node 15: 5 neighbors

Now, for these nodes:
- Node 0: Inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: Inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: Inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: Inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: Inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 15: Inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 33. 
Therefore, the final answer is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 11>, <3, 4, 12>, <3, 4, 17>, <3, 12, 17>, <3, 12, 19>, <3, 17, 19>, 
<5, 7, 11>, <5, 7, 12>, <5, 7, 16>, <5, 11, 12>, <5, 12, 16>, <7, 15, 18>, <7, 18, 15>, 
<10, 12, 17>, <10, 12, 5>, <10, 12, 11>, <10, 12, 14>, <12, 17, 3>, <12, 5, 16>, <12, 10, 14>, 
<15, 14, 9>, <15, 14, 10>, <15, 14, 10>, <15, 14, 9>
