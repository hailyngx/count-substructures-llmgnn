Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 11) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 10) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 3, 5, 11, 12
Node 1: 3, 5, 9
Node 2: 3, 10, 11, 13
Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 13
Node 4: 5, 8, 10, 13
Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 9, 10, 12
Node 6: 8, 12, 14
Node 7: 8, 11, 14
Node 8: 4, 6, 7, 14
Node 9: 1, 5, 11
Node 10: 2, 4, 5, 13
Node 11: 0, 2, 7, 9, 14
Node 12: 0, 5, 6, 13
Node 13: 2, 4, 10, 12, 3
Node 14: 6, 7, 8, 11

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 11, 12, 13

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star

Nodes with 4 neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 3-stars
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 3-stars
- Node 11: 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 4 3-stars
- Node 13: 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (0, 1, 13)>
<6, (8, 12, 14)>
<7, (8, 11, 14)>
<9, (1, 5, 11)>
<10, (4, 5, 13)>
<14, (6, 7, 11)>
<(0, 1, 11), 4>
<(0, 1, 12), 4>
<(0, 1, 13), 4>
<(0, 3, 12), 4>
<(2, 10, 13), 4>
<(4, 10, 13), 4>
<(4, 13, 10), 4>
<(4, 8, 13), 4>
<(4, 13, 8), 4>
<(8, 11, 14), 4>
<(8, 14, 11), 4>
<(11, 14, 8), 4>
<(12, 13, 0), 4>
<(13, 0, 12), 4>
