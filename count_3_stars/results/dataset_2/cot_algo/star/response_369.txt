Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 28) (7, 21) (7, 20) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 25) (21, 15) (20, 7) (20, 25) (20, 27) (20, 9) (25, 21) (25, 20) (25, 19) (25, 0) (25, 12) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 18) (17, 28) (17, 5) (17, 27) (6, 28) (6, 22) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 23) (28, 4) (28, 17) (28, 6) (28, 12) (19, 25) (19, 13) (26, 5) (26, 27) (3, 21) (3, 10) (3, 11) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (16, 0) (16, 22) (0, 25) (0, 16) (0, 1) (5, 17) (5, 26) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 18) (12, 4) (12, 25) (12, 28) (12, 2) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 23) (2, 24) (23, 6) (23, 2) (9, 20) (9, 18) (9, 14) (18, 10) (18, 5) (18, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 14) (29, 14) (8, 10) (8, 5) (22, 6) (22, 16) (27, 20) (27, 17) (27, 26) (24, 2) (24, 15) (13, 19) (13, 11) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 29) (15, 21) (15, 6) (15, 24) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 20, 21, 25, 3, 6, 10, 11, 12, 5, 18, 2, 9, 16, 0, 1, 14, 8, 22, 27, 13, 29, 15, and 24.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 4 3-stars
- Node 20: 4 3-stars
- Node 21: 1 3-star
- Node 25: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 4 3-stars
- Node 18: 4 3-stars
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 4 3-stars
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 3-stars
- Node 22: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 29: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 24: 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 49, which can be written as [49].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<4, 12, 28>
<7, 20, 25>
<21, 7, 20>
<3, 10, 11>
<6, 11, 28>
<10, 18, 5>
<11, 5, 17>
<12, 4, 25>
<18, 9, 14>
<2, 12, 25>
<9, 20, 18>
<16, 0, 25>
<0, 1, 2>
<5, 8, 18>
<26, 5, 27>
<13, 11, 19>
<1, 14, 29>
<22, 6, 16>
<27, 17, 26>
<15, 6, 21>
