Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 3) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 2) 

Response:
The given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

```
Node 0: 4, 6, 5, 9
Node 1: 7, 12, 2
Node 2: 1, 6
Node 3: 10, 8, 9
Node 4: 7, 8, 9, 13, 0, 6
Node 5: 10, 8, 12, 0, 14, 13
Node 6: 4, 10, 8, 2
Node 7: 4, 11, 9, 1
Node 8: 4, 11, 5, 6, 3
Node 9: 4, 7, 0, 13, 3
Node 10: 3, 6, 5, 14
Node 11: 7, 14, 13, 8, 12
Node 12: 11, 5, 1
Node 13: 4, 11, 5, 9
Node 14: 10, 11, 5
```

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 4:
- Neighbors: 7, 8, 9, 13, 0, 6
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (7, 9, 13)>, <4, (7, 0, 6)>, <4, (8, 9, 13)>, <4, (8, 0, 6)>, <4, (9, 0, 6)>

For Node 5:
- Neighbors: 10, 8, 12, 0, 14, 13
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (10, 12, 14)>, <5, (10, 0, 13)>, <5, (8, 12, 13)>, <5, (8, 0, 14)>, <5, (12, 0, 14)>

For Node 11:
- Neighbors: 7, 14, 13, 8, 12
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <11, (7, 13, 8)>, <11, (7, 13, 12)>, <11, (14, 13, 8)>, <11, (14, 13, 12)>, <11, (7, 8, 12)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 20 + 10 = 50, therefore [50].
