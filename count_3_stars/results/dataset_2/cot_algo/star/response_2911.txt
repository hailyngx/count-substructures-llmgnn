Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (5, 4) (5, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 12}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4}
- Node 6: {3, 8, 11}
- Node 7: {2, 10, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {7, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {6, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 14: {9, 10, 11, 12}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 3, 8, and 9 have 5 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them.

For Node 1:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 1} = \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For Node 3:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 3} = \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For Node 8:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 8} = \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

For Node 9:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars for Node 9} = \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

Summing all the 3-stars:
\[ 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 8, 12)>
- <3, (1, 8, 13)>
- <8, (1, 3, 13)>
- <9, (1, 8, 10)>
