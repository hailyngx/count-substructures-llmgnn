Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 7, 8}

Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 have three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 38
Therefore, the final answer is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
And their count is 18.
