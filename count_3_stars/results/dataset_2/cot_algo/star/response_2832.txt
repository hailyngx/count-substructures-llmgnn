Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 27) (16, 6) (20, 24) (25, 1) (25, 18) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 21) (12, 14) (27, 16) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 19) (8, 16) (8, 24) (8, 0) (23, 1) (23, 3) (15, 26) (15, 5) (15, 21) (19, 27) (19, 26) (19, 22) (26, 15) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 6) (26, 4) (13, 12) (13, 26) (13, 4) (13, 10) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 22) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (3, 23) (3, 7) (3, 14) (2, 22) (2, 9) (22, 19) (22, 1) (22, 2) (22, 21) (24, 20) (24, 8) (24, 29) (5, 15) (28, 4) (28, 10) (6, 16) (6, 26) (6, 0) (6, 18) (14, 12) (14, 3) (9, 17) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (21, 12) (21, 27) (21, 15) (21, 22) (29, 24) (4, 26) (4, 13) (4, 28) (18, 25) (18, 6) (10, 13) (10, 28) (10, 9) 

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 16 has neighbors: {11, 8, 27, 6}, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
   <16, (11, 8, 27)>, <16, (11, 8, 6)>, <16, (11, 27, 6)>, <16, (8, 27, 6)>

2. Node 27 has neighbors: {16, 12, 19, 21}, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
   <27, (16, 12, 19)>, <27, (16, 12, 21)>, <27, (16, 19, 21)>, <27, (12, 19, 21)>

3. Node 1 has neighbors: {25, 23, 17, 7, 22}, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
   <1, (25, 23, 17)>, <1, (25, 23, 7)>, <1, (25, 23, 22)>, <1, (25, 17, 7)>, <1, (25, 17, 22)>, <1, (25, 7, 22)>, <1, (23, 17, 7)>, <1, (23, 17, 22)>, <1, (23, 7, 22)>, <1, (17, 7, 22)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 = 18, so the final answer is [18].
