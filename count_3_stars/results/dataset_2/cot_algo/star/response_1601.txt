Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 28) (1, 22) (1, 18) (21, 3) (21, 23) (2, 29) (29, 2) (29, 9) (29, 7) (29, 0) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 29) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 28) (10, 17) (10, 22) (11, 12) (20, 26) (20, 3) (20, 28) (25, 27) (25, 23) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 7) (6, 17) (6, 28) (6, 16) (28, 1) (28, 9) (28, 20) (28, 6) (22, 1) (22, 9) (22, 10) (22, 16) (22, 24) (0, 29) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 26) (7, 29) (7, 5) (7, 17) (15, 1) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 4) (18, 1) (18, 27) (18, 24) (26, 5) (26, 20) (26, 0) (3, 21) (3, 20) (3, 13) (16, 6) (16, 22) (16, 0) (27, 25) (27, 18) (8, 15) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 13) (14, 19) (14, 12) (14, 13) (24, 22) (24, 18) (23, 21) (23, 25) (23, 12) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 14) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 23) (4, 5) (4, 15) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {29, 16, 12, 26}
- Node 1: {15, 28, 22, 18}
- Node 2: {29, 9}
- Node 3: {21, 20, 13}
- Node 4: {5, 15}
- Node 5: {9, 26, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {17, 28, 16}
- Node 7: {29, 5, 17}
- Node 8: {15, 19}
- Node 9: {29, 5, 22, 28}
- Node 10: {17, 22}
- Node 11: {12}
- Node 12: {0, 14, 23, 11}
- Node 13: {3, 19, 14}
- Node 14: {19, 13, 12}
- Node 15: {1, 17, 8, 4}
- Node 16: {6, 22, 0}
- Node 17: {10, 7, 15, 6}
- Node 18: {27, 24, 1}
- Node 19: {8, 13, 14}
- Node 20: {26, 3, 28}
- Node 21: {23, 3}
- Node 22: {1, 9, 10, 16, 24}
- Node 23: {21, 25, 12}
- Node 24: {22, 18}
- Node 25: {27, 23}
- Node 26: {5, 20, 0}
- Node 27: {25, 18}
- Node 28: {1, 9, 20, 6}
- Node 29: {2, 9, 7, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (15, 28, 22)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (9, 26, 4)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (29, 5, 22)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (0, 14, 23)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (3, 19, 14)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (1, 17, 8)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star: <16, (6, 22, 0)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star: <17, (10, 7, 15)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star: <18, (27, 24, 1)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star: <19, (8, 13, 14)>
- Node 20 forms a 3-star: <20, (26, 3, 28)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star: <22, (1, 9, 10)>
- Node 28 forms a 3-star: <28, (20, 6, 1)>
- Node 29 forms a 3-star: <29, (9, 7, 0)>

Since each node with three or more neighbors forms a 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 13. So, the final answer is [13].
