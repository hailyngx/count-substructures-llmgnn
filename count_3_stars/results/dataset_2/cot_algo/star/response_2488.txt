Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 12) (6, 17) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 0) (8, 15) (8, 10) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 16) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (13, 14) (1, 18) (1, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 19) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 2) (7, 18) (16, 5) (16, 18) (19, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of its adjacency list:

Node 0: 3, 14, 11, 4
Node 1: 18, 12
Node 2: 3, 5, 12, 19
Node 3: 15, 0, 2, 4
Node 4: 3, 8, 18, 0
Node 5: 6, 2, 16
Node 6: 17, 9, 5
Node 7: 18
Node 8: 15, 10, 4
Node 9: 6, 10
Node 10: 9, 11, 8
Node 11: 14, 10, 0, 12
Node 12: 15, 17, 11, 1, 2
Node 13: 14
Node 14: 17, 0, 11, 13
Node 15: 3, 8, 12
Node 16: 5, 18
Node 17: 14, 6, 12
Node 18: 4, 16, 7, 1
Node 19: 2

Next, we'll go through each node to find its neighboring nodes:

Node 0 neighbors: 3, 14, 11, 4
Node 1 neighbors: 18, 12
Node 2 neighbors: 3, 5, 12, 19
Node 3 neighbors: 15, 0, 2, 4
Node 4 neighbors: 3, 8, 18, 0
Node 5 neighbors: 6, 2, 16
Node 6 neighbors: 17, 9, 5
Node 7 neighbors: 18
Node 8 neighbors: 15, 10, 4
Node 9 neighbors: 6, 10
Node 10 neighbors: 9, 11, 8
Node 11 neighbors: 14, 10, 0, 12
Node 12 neighbors: 15, 17, 11, 1, 2
Node 13 neighbors: 14
Node 14 neighbors: 17, 0, 11, 13
Node 15 neighbors: 3, 8, 12
Node 16 neighbors: 5, 18
Node 17 neighbors: 14, 6, 12
Node 18 neighbors: 4, 16, 7, 1
Node 19 neighbors: 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 15, 0, 2, 4
Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 3, 8, 12
Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 17, 0, 11, 13
Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 14, 6, 12
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 17, 9, 5
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 6, 10
Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 9, 11, 8
Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 14, 10, 0, 12
Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 15, 17, 11, 1, 2
Node 6, 11, and 12 each contribute \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1 3-star
So, total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Therefore, the final answer is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are <6, (17, 9, 5)>, <11, (14, 10, 0)>, and <12, (15, 17, 1)>.
