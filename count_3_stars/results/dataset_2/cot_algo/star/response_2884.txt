Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 2, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 3, 6, 2, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 9, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 1, 6, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 9, 1, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7, 1, 6, 0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 1, 3, 8, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7, 9, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 8, 2, 0}

Now, we will check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, hence can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, hence can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, hence can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, hence can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, hence can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, hence can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, hence can form 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
