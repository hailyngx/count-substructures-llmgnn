Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 13) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 13) (5, 7) (5, 10) (1, 11) (1, 4) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 3, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {11, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 8, 10, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 7, 2, 0, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 1, 14, 11, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7, 10}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 3, 2, 0, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9, 12, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7, 2, 11}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 4, 14, 10, 7}
- Node 10: Neighbors {9, 2, 13, 5}
- Node 11: Neighbors {12, 8, 1, 4}
- Node 12: Neighbors {7, 14, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors {6, 14, 10, 3, 4}
- Node 14: Neighbors {9, 12, 0, 4, 13}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 14: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 79

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [79].
