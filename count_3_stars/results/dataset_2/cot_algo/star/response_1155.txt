Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 4) (22, 14) (22, 8) (1, 15) (1, 29) (21, 3) (21, 5) (0, 27) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 16) (20, 9) (25, 27) (25, 4) (25, 28) (7, 12) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 29) (12, 3) (12, 19) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 2) (24, 26) (24, 16) (24, 5) (3, 21) (3, 12) (3, 23) (3, 2) (3, 18) (8, 22) (8, 9) (8, 19) (9, 20) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 28) (10, 5) (15, 1) (15, 17) (5, 21) (5, 26) (5, 24) (5, 10) (5, 14) (23, 0) (23, 26) (23, 3) (29, 1) (29, 12) (29, 9) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 28) (19, 22) (19, 12) (19, 8) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 27) (16, 24) (16, 17) (16, 2) (4, 22) (4, 25) (6, 11) (6, 14) (14, 22) (14, 5) (14, 6) (17, 15) (17, 16) (2, 26) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 16) (28, 25) (28, 9) (28, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {27, 23}
- Node 1: {15, 29}
- Node 2: {26, 3, 11, 16}
- Node 3: {21, 12, 23, 18, 2}
- Node 4: {22, 25}
- Node 5: {21, 26, 24, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {11, 14}
- Node 7: {12, 18}
- Node 8: {22, 9, 19}
- Node 9: {20, 8, 29, 28}
- Node 10: {5}
- Node 11: {13, 6, 2}
- Node 12: {7, 29, 3, 19}
- Node 13: {22, 26, 11}
- Node 14: {22, 5, 6}
- Node 15: {1, 17}
- Node 16: {27, 24, 17, 2}
- Node 17: {15, 16}
- Node 18: {7, 3, 28}
- Node 19: {22, 12, 8}
- Node 20: {9}
- Node 21: {3, 5}
- Node 22: {13, 19, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 23: {0, 26, 3}
- Node 24: {26, 16, 5}
- Node 25: {27, 4, 28}
- Node 26: {13, 24, 5, 23, 2}
- Node 27: {0, 25, 16}
- Node 28: {9, 18, 25}
- Node 29: {1, 12, 9}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 and Node 16 each form 1 3-star.
- Node 3, Node 5, and Node 8 each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 and Node 26 each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 and Node 25 each form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 37 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [37], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, 16, 17>, <3, 5, 21>, <3, 5, 23>, <3, 5, 24>, <3, 5, 26>, <3, 12, 18>, <3, 12, 19>, <3, 12, 29>, <5, 14, 22>, <8, 19, 22>, <9, 28, 25>, <12, 18, 28>, <18, 28, 25>, <3, 12, 18>, <3, 12, 28>, <5, 14, 22>, <5, 21, 26>, <8, 19, 22>, <12, 19, 22>, <12, 19, 8>, <12, 19, 25>, <12, 28, 18>, <12, 28, 25>, <19, 22, 14>, <19, 22, 12>, <7, 12, 18>, <7, 12, 28>, <26, 24, 16>, <3, 5, 26>, <5, 14, 6>, <12, 3, 23>, <9, 28, 25>, <18, 3, 28>, <22, 14, 5>, <13, 26, 24>, <16, 2, 11>, <17, 15, 16>.
