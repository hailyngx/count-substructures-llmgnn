Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: Inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: Inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 = 24

Therefore, the final answer is [24], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
