Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) 

Response:
Given that this is a graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, the first step is to determine the neighborhood sets for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 11, 3}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 0}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 1, 3, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 10, 11, 8}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 12, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 2, 8, 13, 1}
- Node 8: {7, 6, 5}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 1, 0}
- Node 10: {11, 5}
- Node 11: {10, 14, 0, 13, 5, 12}
- Node 12: {6, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {7, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {11, 2, 1, 13}

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars based on the neighbor sets:

Node 4 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 7 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 1 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 11 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 0 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 13 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding these up: 20 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 79

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [79].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<4, (7, 1, 2)>
<4, (7, 1, 3)>
<4, (7, 1, 5)>
<4, (7, 1, 13)>
<4, (7, 2, 3)>
<4, (7, 2, 5)>
<4, (7, 2, 13)>
<4, (7, 3, 5)>
<4, (7, 3, 13)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 13)>
<4, (1, 7, 13)>
<7, (4, 2, 3)>
<7, (4, 5, 1)>
<7, (4, 5, 13)>
<7, (4, 1, 13)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 13)>
<7, (2, 5, 13)>

<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 14)>
<1, (7, 6, 9)>
<1, (7, 6, 14)>
<1, (6, 9, 14)>
