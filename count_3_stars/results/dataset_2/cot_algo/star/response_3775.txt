Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 7) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (11, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 9) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 9, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 6, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 5, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 4, 13, 14}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 13: Neighbors {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 14: Neighbors {3, 9, 10}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 1 neighbor, so there are no 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 80

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [80].
