Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 24) (3, 16) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 13) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 1) (21, 16) (21, 14) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 0) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 29) (0, 7) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 12) (20, 0) (20, 2) (1, 7) (1, 22) (1, 16) (26, 22) (26, 8) (5, 17) (6, 28) (6, 11) (6, 19) (28, 6) (28, 27) (14, 21) (14, 0) (16, 3) (16, 21) (16, 1) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 25) (8, 3) (8, 26) (8, 19) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 2) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 25) (17, 5) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 27) (17, 11) (25, 10) (25, 19) (25, 17) (25, 4) (18, 7) (18, 9) (18, 29) (13, 15) (13, 27) (24, 3) (24, 12) (24, 29) (4, 10) (4, 9) (4, 25) (4, 2) (2, 20) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (12, 0) (12, 17) (12, 24) (27, 28) (27, 17) (27, 13) (29, 23) (29, 18) (29, 24) (29, 11) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 29) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {7, 22, 20, 14, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 22, 16}
- Node 2: Neighbors {20, 10, 9, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {24, 16, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {10, 9, 25, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {17}
- Node 6: Neighbors {28, 11, 19}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 18, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 26, 19}
- Node 9: Neighbors {18, 4, 2}
- Node 10: Neighbors {15, 4, 2, 25}
- Node 11: Neighbors {6, 17, 29}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 17, 24}
- Node 13: Neighbors {15, 27}
- Node 14: Neighbors {21, 0}
- Node 15: Neighbors {10, 13}
- Node 16: Neighbors {3, 21, 1}
- Node 17: Neighbors {5, 25, 12, 27, 11}
- Node 18: Neighbors {7, 9, 29}
- Node 19: Neighbors {6, 8, 25}
- Node 20: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 21: Neighbors {16, 14}
- Node 22: Neighbors {23, 26, 0, 1}
- Node 23: Neighbors {22, 29}
- Node 24: Neighbors {3, 12, 29}
- Node 25: Neighbors {10, 4, 17, 19}
- Node 26: Neighbors {22, 8}
- Node 27: Neighbors {28, 17, 13}
- Node 28: Neighbors {6, 27}
- Node 29: Neighbors {23, 18, 24, 11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors (forming 1 3-star each): 0, 1, 3, 21, 26
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors (forming \( \binom{n}{3} \) 3-stars each): 2, 4, 7, 10, 12, 17, 19, 22, 25, 27, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For each node with more than 3 neighbors:
    - Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars:
1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars is [38]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (4, 9, 10)>, <2, (4, 9, 2)>, <2, (4, 10, 25)>, <2, (9, 10, 25)>, <4, (2, 9, 10)>, <10, (2, 4, 25)>, <12, (0, 17, 24)>, <17, (5, 11, 17)>, <17, (5, 17, 25)>, <17, (5, 17, 27)>, <17, (11, 17, 29)>, <19, (6, 8, 19)>, <22, (0, 1, 22)>, <25, (4, 10, 25)>, <27, (13, 17, 27)>, <29, (11, 18, 29)>
