Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 4) (10, 17) (10, 9) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 12) (4, 13) (4, 15) (18, 9) (18, 3) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (5, 15) (5, 14) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 16) (19, 6) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 11) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 1) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 9) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 12) (9, 11) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 19) (14, 7) (14, 5) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 9) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows, where each node is followed by its neighbors:

1: 8, 16
2: 7, 12
3: 17, 18, 19
4: 13, 15
5: 14, 15
6: 8, 1, 11, 19
7: 0, 2, 14, 19
8: 1, 6, 13, 15
9: 10, 12, 18, 11
10: 9, 17
11: 6, 9, 15
12: 2, 9, 17
13: 8, 17, 4
14: 7, 5
15: 8, 4, 5, 11
16: 0, 1, 19
17: 13, 10, 3, 12
18: 9, 3
19: 7, 6, 16, 3

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 13. <8, (1, 6, 13)>
Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 4, and 17. <13, (8, 4, 17)>
Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 3, and 12. <17, (13, 3, 12)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 1, and 19. <6, (8, 1, 19)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, so the answer is [4].
