Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 7) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 12) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

1: 2, 3, 4, 8, 11
2: 0, 1, 8, 12
3: 1, 9, 13
4: 1, 6, 9, 14
5: 7, 14
6: 4, 8, 11, 12
7: 0, 5, 8, 10, 13, 14
8: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 13
9: 0, 3, 4, 11, 12
10: 7
11: 1, 6, 9, 0
12: 2, 6, 9, 14
13: 3, 7, 8
14: 4, 5, 7, 12

Now, let's identify the nodes that are part of at least one 3-star:

Nodes with 3 neighbors or more: 1, 8, 9, 12, 14

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 8, 13)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 8, 11)>
<1, (4, 8, 14)>
<1, (6, 8, 12)>
<1, (8, 11, 13)>
<1, (8, 13, 7)>
<1, (8, 13, 0)>
<1, (8, 13, 14)>
<1, (8, 7, 14)>
<1, (8, 7, 0)>
<1, (11, 9, 0)>
<1, (9, 12, 14)>
<1, (12, 6, 14)>
<8, (13, 7, 0)>
<8, (13, 7, 14)>
<8, (13, 7, 5)>
<8, (13, 7, 14)>
<8, (13, 7, 14)>
<9, (0, 4, 12)>
<9, (0, 4, 14)>
<9, (0, 6, 12)>
<9, (0, 6, 14)>
<9, (0, 12, 14)>
<12, (2, 6, 14)>
<12, (2, 9, 14)>
<12, (6, 9, 14)>
<14, (4, 5, 7)>
<14, (4, 7, 12)>
<14, (5, 7, 14)>
<14, (7, 12, 14)>
