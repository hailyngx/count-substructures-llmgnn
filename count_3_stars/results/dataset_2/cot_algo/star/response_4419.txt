Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (19, 12) (19, 9) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 12) (12, 19) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (18, 10) (0, 10) (0, 9) (0, 6) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 14) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 9) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 9) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 11) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 14) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's go through the list of edges and identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {10, 18, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {12, 11, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {13, 10, 17, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {15, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {12}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8, 11}
- Node 6: Neighbors {15, 12, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {17, 16, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {13, 5, 16, 11}
- Node 9: Neighbors {19, 0, 16, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors {15, 2, 0}
- Node 11: Neighbors {8, 5, 1, 9}
- Node 12: Neighbors {19, 4, 6, 1}
- Node 13: Neighbors {3, 8, 17, 2}
- Node 14: Neighbors {7, 1, 2}
- Node 15: Neighbors {3, 10, 6}
- Node 16: Neighbors {8, 7, 9}
- Node 17: Neighbors {13, 2, 7}
- Node 18: Neighbors {10}
- Node 19: Neighbors {12, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each such node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 15: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 19: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 25
