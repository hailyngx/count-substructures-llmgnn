Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 19) (1, 9) (21, 26) (21, 22) (21, 14) (15, 29) (15, 12) (27, 18) (27, 19) (27, 23) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 18) (5, 23) (5, 10) (5, 16) (6, 20) (6, 0) (17, 24) (17, 2) (17, 26) (29, 15) (29, 16) (29, 14) (11, 28) (11, 4) (28, 11) (28, 25) (28, 23) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 3) (26, 0) (0, 6) (0, 26) (0, 10) (0, 25) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 24) (9, 1) (9, 23) (9, 19) (18, 27) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 3) (23, 27) (23, 5) (23, 28) (23, 9) (4, 11) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 16) (19, 1) (19, 27) (19, 9) (7, 14) (24, 17) (24, 10) (24, 25) (22, 21) (22, 16) (22, 12) (22, 3) (16, 5) (16, 29) (16, 2) (16, 22) (20, 6) (25, 28) (25, 0) (25, 24) (25, 14) (14, 21) (14, 29) (14, 7) (14, 25) (14, 12) (12, 15) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 3) (3, 26) (3, 18) (3, 22) (3, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set of each node:

Node 0: {6, 10, 25, 26}
Node 1: {9, 19}
Node 2: {10, 16, 17}
Node 3: {12, 22, 26}
Node 4: {11}
Node 5: {10, 16, 23}
Node 6: {0, 20}
Node 7: {14}
Node 8: {13, 18}
Node 9: {1, 19, 23}
Node 10: {0, 2, 5, 24}
Node 11: {4, 28}
Node 12: {3, 14, 15, 22}
Node 13: {8, 18}
Node 14: {7, 12, 14, 21, 25, 29}
Node 15: {12, 29}
Node 16: {2, 5, 16, 22, 29}
Node 17: {2, 17, 24, 26}
Node 18: {3, 8, 13, 27}
Node 19: {1, 9, 19, 27}
Node 20: {6}
Node 21: {14, 16, 22, 26}
Node 22: {3, 12, 16, 21, 22}
Node 23: {5, 9, 14, 19, 27, 28}
Node 24: {10, 17, 25}
Node 25: {0, 14, 24, 28}
Node 26: {0, 3, 17, 21, 26}
Node 27: {9, 18, 19, 23}
Node 28: {11, 23, 25}
Node 29: {14, 15, 16, 29}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

- For nodes with 3 neighbors, we can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for each. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 14 \times 1 = 14 \), represented as [14].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (6, 10, 25)>
<3, (12, 22, 26)>
<5, (10, 16, 23)>
<12, (14, 15, 22)>
<14, (7, 25, 29)>
<16, (2, 22, 29)>
<17, (10, 24, 25)>
<18, (8, 13, 27)>
<19, (9, 18, 27)>
<22, (16, 21, 26)>
<23, (14, 19, 28)>
<25, (24, 28, 29)>
<26, (17, 21, 26)>
<27, (18, 19, 23)>
