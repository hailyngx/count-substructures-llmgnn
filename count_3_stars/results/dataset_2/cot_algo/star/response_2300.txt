Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 5) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 19) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 19) (5, 9) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 13) (18, 12) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 7) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 12) (16, 4) (7, 1) (7, 19) (0, 15) (0, 6) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {15, 6}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {9, 17, 7}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {15, 14, 13}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {15, 9, 4}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {3, 14, 16}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {9}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {9, 10, 0}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {1, 19}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {13, 16, 12}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {3, 6, 5, 1}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {15, 6, 11}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {10, 19}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {8, 13, 18, 16}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {8, 12, 2}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {17, 4, 2}
16. Node 16: Neighbors {17, 8, 12, 4}
17. Node 17: Neighbors {14, 1, 16, 6, 19}
18. Node 18: Neighbors {12}
19. Node 19: Neighbors {17, 11, 7}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes {9, 17, 7}
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes {15, 14, 13}
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes {15, 9, 4}
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes {9, 10, 0}
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes {3, 6, 5}
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes {8, 13, 18}
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes {17, 8, 4}
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 16, 19}

So, the total number of 3-stars is 8, which can be represented as [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 9, 17, 7>, <2, 15, 14, 13>, <3, 15, 9, 4>, <6, 9, 10, 0>, <9, 3, 6, 5>, <12, 8, 13, 18>, <16, 17, 8, 4>, <17, 1, 16, 19>
