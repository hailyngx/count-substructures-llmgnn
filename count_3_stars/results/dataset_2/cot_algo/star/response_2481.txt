Response:
First, let's create a visualization of the graph to better understand its structure:

```
1---26---15
|        |
10---25---14---24---5---27---16
|        |    |        |
3---11---20---9---21   6---4
|             |   |    |   |
18            25  22   20  2
|             |         |   
|             |         17  
|             19        |   
|             |         7   
|             12  23    |   
|             |   |     |   
|        29---21  29    8    
|        |         |        
|        13        11
|        |   
|        28

```

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1: 3 neighbors
Node 2: 3 neighbors
Node 3: 4 neighbors
Node 4: 4 neighbors
Node 5: 6 neighbors
Node 6: 5 neighbors
Node 7: 3 neighbors
Node 8: 3 neighbors
Node 9: 2 neighbors
Node 10: 4 neighbors
Node 11: 4 neighbors
Node 12: 3 neighbors
Node 13: 3 neighbors
Node 14: 2 neighbors
Node 15: 2 neighbors
Node 16: 4 neighbors
Node 17: 4 neighbors
Node 18: 2 neighbors
Node 19: 3 neighbors
Node 20: 6 neighbors
Node 21: 4 neighbors
Node 22: 3 neighbors
Node 23: 3 neighbors
Node 24: 3 neighbors
Node 25: 4 neighbors
Node 26: 2 neighbors
Node 27: 2 neighbors
Node 28: 3 neighbors
Node 29: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 196 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [196].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
