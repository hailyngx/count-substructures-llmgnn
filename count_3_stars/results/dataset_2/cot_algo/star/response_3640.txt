Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated as follows:

1.  **Node 0**: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}. Since this node has 5 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>.

2. **Node 1**: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9}. Since this node has 6 neighbors, it can form 20 3-stars. <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>.

3. **Node 2**: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}. Since this node has 5 neighbors, it can form 10 3-stars. <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>.

4. **Node 4**: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}. Since this node has 5 neighbors, it can form 10 3-stars. <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 50, which can be represented as [50].
