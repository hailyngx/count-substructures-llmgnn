Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 6) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 16) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 8) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 2) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 15) (18, 14) (18, 7) (0, 16) (14, 18) (14, 4) (13, 5) (13, 7) (15, 1) (15, 2) (15, 16) (16, 5) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 7) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 19) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 12) (7, 18) (7, 13) (7, 16) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 19) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {16}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 15}
- Node 2: {3, 15, 17}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 9, 13, 16}
- Node 6: {4, 9, 12, 16}
- Node 7: {13, 16, 18}
- Node 8: {11, 17, 19}
- Node 9: {5, 6}
- Node 10: {11, 12, 17}
- Node 11: {8, 10, 19}
- Node 12: {3, 6, 10, 19}
- Node 13: {5, 7}
- Node 14: {4, 18}
- Node 15: {1, 2, 16}
- Node 16: {0, 5, 6, 7, 15}
- Node 17: {2, 8, 10}
- Node 18: {7, 14}
- Node 19: {8, 11, 12}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 3, 4>
<3, 5, 12>
<3, 5, 12>
<3, 5, 16>
<3, 9, 12>
<3, 9, 16>
<5, 9, 16>
<5, 13, 16>
<6, 9, 16>
<7, 13, 18>
<16, 0, 15>
<16, 1, 15>
<16, 2, 15>
<16, 5, 15>
<16, 6, 15>
