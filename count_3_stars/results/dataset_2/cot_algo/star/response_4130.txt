Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 2, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 3, 6, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 6, 2, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8, 9, 5, 6, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 7, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 9, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 7, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 7, 1, 0}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 20 + 20 = 40, and the unique 3-stars found are:
1. <4, (7, 8, 9)>
2. <6, (1, 3, 5)>
