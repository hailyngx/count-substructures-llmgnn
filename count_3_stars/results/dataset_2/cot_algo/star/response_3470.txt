Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 5) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 14) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 9) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we can first list out the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 6, 11, 7, 12, 14
- Node 1: 6, 11, 2, 12
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 3: 9, 8
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 11, 13, 14
- Node 6: 9, 1, 10, 11, 8, 0
- Node 7: 9, 8, 13, 12, 0, 2
- Node 8: 6, 3, 10, 13, 7
- Node 9: 6, 4, 10, 3, 7
- Node 10: 6, 9, 11, 8
- Node 11: 6, 1, 10, 0, 5, 12
- Node 12: 1, 11, 7, 14, 0
- Node 13: 8, 5, 7
- Node 14: 12, 0, 5

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors that can form 3-stars are: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 110

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [110].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, (6, 7, 12)>
- <0, (6, 7, 14)>
- <0, (11, 12, 14)>
- <1, (6, 2, 12)>
- <6, (9, 10, 11)>
- <6, (1, 10, 11)>
- <6, (1, 11, 12)>
- <6, (8, 10, 11)>
- <6, (8, 11, 13)>
- <6, (0, 11, 12)>
- <7, (9, 13, 7)>
- <7, (8, 13, 7)>
- <7, (8, 7, 12)>
- <7, (0, 7, 12)>
- <8, (6, 10, 11)>
- <8, (6, 10, 13)>
- <9, (6, 7, 12)>
