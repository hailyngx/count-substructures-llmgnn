Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 7, 10, 6, 12}
- Node 1: {9, 4, 2, 6}
- Node 2: {8, 13, 10, 1}
- Node 3: {5, 4, 7, 13}
- Node 4: {10, 1, 6, 3}
- Node 5: {13, 3, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {4, 0, 1, 12}
- Node 7: {9, 0, 3}
- Node 8: {2, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {11, 1, 7, 0}
- Node 10: {5, 4, 8, 11, 0, 2}
- Node 11: {9, 13, 10, 14}
- Node 12: {8, 0, 6}
- Node 13: {5, 2, 11, 3, 14}
- Node 14: {5, 13, 11}

Now, let's identify the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors, forming inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 62

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [62], and the unique 3-stars are <0, 9, 10, 6>, <0, 9, 10, 12>, <0, 9, 7, 3>, <0, 6, 4, 1>, <1, 6, 4, 3>, <2, 1, 4, 10>, <2, 8, 10, 12>, <3, 5, 13, 14>, <4, 3, 7, 13>, <5, 10, 13, 14>.
