Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (14, 19) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 1) (18, 13) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 9) (1, 0) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 11) (13, 18) (13, 12) (19, 3) (19, 14) (19, 5) (10, 15) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 7) (8, 9) (8, 16) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 16) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 12) (12, 3) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 16) (7, 11) (7, 9) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 3, 16}
Node 1: {0, 2, 9, 18}
Node 2: {1, 6, 18}
Node 3: {0, 11, 12, 15, 19}
Node 4: {5, 9, 12, 17}
Node 5: {4, 11, 19}
Node 6: {2}
Node 7: {9, 11}
Node 8: {9, 16}
Node 9: {1, 4, 7, 8}
Node 10: {15, 16}
Node 11: {3, 5, 7, 17}
Node 12: {3, 4, 12, 13, 16, 18}
Node 13: {12, 18}
Node 14: {19}
Node 15: {3, 10}
Node 16: {0, 8, 10, 12}
Node 17: {4, 11}
Node 18: {1, 2, 12, 13}
Node 19: {3, 5, 14}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 3 (Node 3, Node 12, Node 16)
  
For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is [34], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 11, 12)>
<12, (3, 4, 13)>
<16, (0, 10, 12)>
