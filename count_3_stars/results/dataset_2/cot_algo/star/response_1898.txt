Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 0) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 1) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 9) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 3) (2, 5) (2, 12) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {13, 14, 7, 11}
- Node 1: Neighbors {13, 11, 4, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {13, 6, 7, 11, 10, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 12, 11, 1}
- Node 5: Neighbors {13, 6, 2, 12, 4, 10}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {8, 0, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {13, 11, 12, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {13, 14, 3, 1}
- Node 10: Neighbors {5, 12, 3}
- Node 11: Neighbors {8, 0, 3, 1, 4}
- Node 12: Neighbors {8, 5, 4, 2, 10}
- Node 13: Neighbors {8, 5, 3, 1, 0, 9}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 9}

Now, let's check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, 3-stars: 1
- Node 1, 3-stars: 1
- Node 3, 3-stars: 1
- Node 4, 3-stars: 1
- Node 5, 3-stars: 1
- Node 8, 3-stars: 1
- Node 9, 3-stars: 1
- Total 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 13, 9>
<1, 13, 11>
<3, 13, 9>
<4, 12, 11>
<5, 13, 9>
<8, 13, 9>
<9, 13, 14>
