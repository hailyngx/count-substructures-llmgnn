Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {5, 2, 8}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {7, 3, 2}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {9, 4, 1, 3, 0}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {9, 7, 6, 2}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {9, 6, 0, 7}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {5, 9, 4, 7}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {5, 9, 4, 6, 8, 1}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {7, 1, 0}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 4, 2, 7}

Now, we will check for each node that has 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

1. Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
2. Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
3. Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
4. Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
5. Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
6. Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
7. Node 7: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
8. Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 2, 8)>, <1, (7, 3, 2)>, <2, (9, 4, 1)>, <2, (9, 4, 3)>, <2, (9, 1, 3)>, <2, (4, 1, 3)>, <2, (9, 1, 0)>, <4, (9, 7, 6)>, <4, (7, 6, 2)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <6, (9, 4, 7)>, <7, (9, 4, 6)>, <7, (5, 9, 6)>, <7, (5, 4, 6)>, <7, (5, 9, 4)>, <7, (4, 6, 5)>, <7, (9, 6, 5)>, <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 4, 7)>.
