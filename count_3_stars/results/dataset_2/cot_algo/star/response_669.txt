Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 7) (22, 2) (22, 11) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 21) (1, 14) (21, 1) (21, 6) (21, 14) (26, 5) (26, 28) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 27) (28, 23) (6, 21) (6, 3) (6, 18) (7, 13) (7, 25) (7, 0) (25, 7) (25, 10) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 11) (24, 23) (24, 29) (24, 20) (10, 13) (10, 25) (10, 29) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 20) (29, 24) (29, 10) (29, 11) (27, 28) (27, 17) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 15) (17, 27) (17, 8) (8, 17) (8, 14) (14, 1) (14, 21) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 20) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 23) (23, 28) (23, 24) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 12) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 23) (4, 11) (19, 14) (19, 20) (15, 0) (15, 16) (20, 24) (20, 3) (20, 14) (20, 19) (11, 22) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 29) (11, 4) (12, 23) 

Response:
There are 34 nodes with 9 of them having exactly 3 neighbors, so we can potentially form some 3-stars in this graph. Let's list out the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: <(0, 7, 11)>
2. Node 3: <(3, 6, 20)>
3. Node 4: <(4, 11, 13)>
4. Node 5: <(5, 9, 26)>
5. Node 9: <(9, 2, 5)>
6. Node 10: <(10, 13, 25)>
7. Node 11: <(11, 0, 29)>
8. Node 14: <(14, 8, 21)>
9. Node 20: <(20, 14, 19)>

Therefore, there are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
The final count inside [] is [9].
