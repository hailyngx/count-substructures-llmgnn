Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6
- Node 1: 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5

Next, let's identify any nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: 6 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
