Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (9, 15) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 10) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 3) (3, 17) (3, 8) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 12) (15, 9) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 16) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (0, 6) (0, 19) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 8) (19, 4) (19, 11) (19, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 16) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 14) (8, 3) (8, 10) (16, 15) (16, 14) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star formations:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 10, and 12: <1, (2, 10, 12)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 12, and 19: <4, (7, 12, 19)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 12, and 14: <6, (0, 12, 14)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 9, and 15: <7, (4, 9, 15)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 13: <10, (1, 8, 13)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 19, and 13: <11, (12, 19, 13)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 11, and 1: <12, (4, 11, 1)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 10, and 11: <13, (2, 10, 11)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 16, and 18: <14, (6, 16, 18)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 16, and 18: <15, (7, 16, 18)>

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars formed in the given graph, so the final answer is [9].
