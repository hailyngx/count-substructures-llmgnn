Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 16) (10, 15) (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (2, 9) (2, 14) (18, 9) (18, 12) (0, 17) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 7) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 19) (1, 4) (1, 9) (13, 9) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 5) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 16) (6, 4) (6, 19) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 19) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {17, 14, 7, 11}
- Node 1: {4, 9}
- Node 2: {9, 14}
- Node 3: {8, 11}
- Node 4: {17, 8, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {8, 11, 16}
- Node 6: {4, 19}
- Node 7: {0, 14, 11, 16, 19}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 5, 12}
- Node 9: {2, 18, 1, 13}
- Node 10: {15, 17}
- Node 11: {3, 0, 7, 5, 12}
- Node 12: {8, 18, 11, 19}
- Node 13: {9}
- Node 14: {2, 0, 7}
- Node 15: {10, 16}
- Node 16: {15, 7, 5}
- Node 17: {10, 0, 4}
- Node 18: {9, 12}
- Node 19: {7, 6, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars based on the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 7, 14>
- <0, 7, 16>
- <0, 7, 11>
- <0, 7, 19>
- <4, 8, 5>
- <4, 8, 12>
- <4, 8, 3>
- <4, 8, 12>
- <7, 11, 12>
- <7, 11, 16>
- <9, 2, 14>
- <9, 2, 18>
- <9, 2, 13>
- <11, 5, 16>
- <12, 8, 18>
- <12, 8, 19>
