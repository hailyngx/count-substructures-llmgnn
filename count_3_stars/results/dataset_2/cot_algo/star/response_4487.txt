Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 24) (2, 25) (29, 25) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 6) (22, 4) (22, 25) (22, 3) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 17) (23, 13) (18, 2) (18, 16) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 24) (21, 9) (21, 19) (28, 11) (28, 26) (11, 28) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 12) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 19) (17, 23) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (26, 28) (26, 16) (10, 13) (15, 23) (15, 12) (15, 4) (20, 24) (4, 22) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 24) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 3) (9, 14) (9, 21) (9, 11) (9, 16) (16, 18) (16, 26) (16, 9) (3, 22) (3, 5) (24, 2) (24, 14) (24, 20) (24, 7) (25, 2) (25, 29) (25, 22) (25, 5) (25, 6) (6, 27) (6, 25) (6, 12) (6, 13) (19, 0) (19, 21) (19, 1) (19, 17) (13, 23) (13, 10) (13, 6) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can construct the neighbor sets for each node as follows: 

- Node 0 neighbors: {27, 14, 19}
- Node 1 neighbors: {17, 4, 19}
- Node 2 neighbors: {18, 24, 25}
- Node 3 neighbors: {22, 5}
- Node 4 neighbors: {22, 1, 15}
- Node 5 neighbors: {8, 17, 25, 3}
- Node 6 neighbors: {27, 25, 12, 13}
- Node 7 neighbors: {8, 11, 24}
- Node 8 neighbors: {23, 5, 12, 7}
- Node 9 neighbors: {14, 21, 11, 16}
- Node 10 neighbors: {13}
- Node 11 neighbors: {28, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 12 neighbors: {8, 11, 15, 6}
- Node 13 neighbors: {23, 10, 6}
- Node 14 neighbors: {0, 9, 24}
- Node 15 neighbors: {23, 12, 4}
- Node 16 neighbors: {18, 26, 9}
- Node 17 neighbors: {23, 1, 19, 5}
- Node 18 neighbors: {2, 16}
- Node 19 neighbors: {0, 21, 1, 17}
- Node 20 neighbors: {24}
- Node 21 neighbors: {9, 19}
- Node 22 neighbors: {3, 4, 25}
- Node 23 neighbors: {8, 15, 17, 13}
- Node 24 neighbors: {2, 14, 20, 7}
- Node 25 neighbors: {2, 29, 22, 5, 6}
- Node 26 neighbors: {28, 16}
- Node 27 neighbors: {0, 6}
- Node 28 neighbors: {11, 26}
- Node 29 neighbors: {25}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25.

Next, we can count the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph by summing the combinations for each applicable node: 
\[
\binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 145
\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [145]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 14, 19>, <0, 14, 24>, <0, 19, 21>, <0, 19, 27>, <1, 4, 17>, <2, 18, 24>, <2, 18, 25>, <2, 24, 25>, <3, 5, 22>, <5, 17, 23>, <5, 17, 25>, <5, 22, 25>, <6, 13, 23>, <6, 13, 27>, <6, 23, 27>, <6, 25, 27>, <7, 11, 24>, <8, 11, 12>, <8, 11, 24>, <8, 12, 15>, <8, 12, 23>, <8, 12, 6>, <8, 15, 23>, <8, 15, 4>, <8, 17, 23>, <8, 17, 5>, <8, 23, 5>, <9, 11, 14>, <9, 11, 21>, <9, 11, 16>, <9, 14, 24>, <9, 16, 18>, <9, 16, 26>, <11, 12, 15>, <11, 12, 6>, <11, 12, 8>, <11, 16, 26>, <12, 15, 4>, <14, 19, 21>, <17, 19, 21>, <17, 19, 23>, <17, 19, 5>, <22, 3, 5>, <22, 3, 25>, <22, 4, 15>, <23, 13, 6>, <23, 13, 27>, <23, 15, 12>, <23, 15, 4>, <25, 2, 18>, <25, 2, 29>, <25, 5, 22>, <25, 6, 27>, <25, 6, 29>
