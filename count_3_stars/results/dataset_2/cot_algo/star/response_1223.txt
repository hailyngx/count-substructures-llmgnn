Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 14) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 5) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 0) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
Given the provided information, we can start by identifying the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 11, 2, 13
- Node 1 neighbors: 6, 10, 14
- Node 2 neighbors: 10, 7, 5, 0
- Node 3 neighbors: 10, 8, 7, 13
- Node 4 neighbors: 6, 11, 13, 5
- Node 5 neighbors: 4, 12, 14, 7, 2
- Node 6 neighbors: 1, 7, 11, 4
- Node 7 neighbors: 6, 8, 14, 3, 2, 5
- Node 8 neighbors: 9, 12, 3, 7
- Node 9 neighbors: 8, 11, 13
- Node 10 neighbors: 3, 1, 2
- Node 11 neighbors: 6, 9, 14, 0, 4
- Node 12 neighbors: 8, 13, 5
- Node 13 neighbors: 9, 4, 12, 3, 0
- Node 14 neighbors: 11, 1, 7, 5

Nodes 6, 11, and 7 each have 4 neighbors, which means they can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars each. This gives a total of 12 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (1, 7, 11)>
<11, (6, 9, 14)>
<7, (6, 8, 14)>
