Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 4) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 2) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 1) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the set of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 6, 12, 3, 2}
- Node 1: {8, 6, 12, 14, 4}
- Node 2: {9, 10, 7, 0, 14}
- Node 3: {10, 13, 0}
- Node 4: {10, 11, 6, 12, 1}
- Node 5: {6, 11, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 10, 11, 1, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 2}
- Node 8: {9, 11, 0, 1}
- Node 9: {8, 2, 13}
- Node 10: {6, 3, 4, 2}
- Node 11: {5, 13, 8, 6, 4}
- Node 12: {4, 14, 0, 1}
- Node 13: {9, 11, 3}
- Node 14: {12, 1, 2}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) where n is the number of neighbors, we find the number of 3-stars from each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 73

Therefore, the final answer is [73], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 2, 12>
- <0, 2, 14>
- <0, 3, 12>
- <0, 3, 2>
- <0, 12, 2>
- <0, 12, 3>
- <0, 12, 1>
- <0, 12, 14>
- <0, 2, 14>
- <1, 4, 10>
- <1, 4, 11>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 12>
- <1, 4, 14>
- <2, 9, 13>
- <4, 10, 6>
- <4, 10, 11>
- <4, 10, 12>
- <4, 10, 1>
- <4, 11, 5>
- <4, 12, 0>
- <4, 12, 1>
- <6, 10, 11>
- <6, 10, 1>
- <6, 10, 4>
- <6, 11, 5>
- <6, 11, 8>
- <8, 11, 5>
- <11, 5, 7>
