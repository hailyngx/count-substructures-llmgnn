Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 13) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 10) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 10) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 14, 2, 11}
- Node 1: {6, 3, 2, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 0, 5, 10}
- Node 3: {6, 1, 13, 12, 8}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 8, 12, 11, 2}
- Node 5: {7, 2, 11}
- Node 6: {1, 10, 3}
- Node 7: {9, 1, 4, 14, 13, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 4}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 0}
- Node 10: {6, 2, 13, 12}
- Node 11: {4, 0, 5, 12}
- Node 12: {3, 4, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {3, 7, 14, 10}
- Node 14: {7, 0, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 4: <4, (9, 7, 8)>, <4, (9, 7, 12)>, <4, (9, 8, 12)>, <4, (7, 8, 12)>, <4, (12, 10, 11)>
- Node 7: <7, (9, 4, 13)>, <7, (9, 13, 14)>, <7, (4, 13, 14)>, <7, (13, 10, 14)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 0)>, <2, (1, 5, 10)>, <2, (4, 0, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 10)>, <2, (0, 5, 10)>
- Node 0: <0, (9, 14, 2)>, <0, (9, 14, 11)>, <0, (9, 2, 11)>, <0, (14, 2, 11)>
- Node 1: <1, (6, 3, 2)>, <1, (6, 2, 7)>, <1, (3, 2, 7)>
- Node 3: <3, (6, 1, 12)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 12)>, <3, (12, 10, 13)>
- Node 12: <12, (3, 4, 11)>, <12, (3, 10, 11)>, <12, (4, 10, 11)>, <12, (10, 11, 13)>
- Node 13: <13, (3, 7, 14)>, <13, (3, 10, 14)>, <13, (7, 10, 14)>

There are a total of 27 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final number is [27].
