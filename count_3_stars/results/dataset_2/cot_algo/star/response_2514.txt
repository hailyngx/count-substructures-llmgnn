Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 9) (7, 13) (14, 6) (14, 16) (17, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 16) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 6) (19, 12) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 9) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 5) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 9) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 5) (5, 16) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 19) (15, 7) (15, 18) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 12) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 15) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 16) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, the first step is to determine the neighbors of each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {9, 10, 18}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {8, 11}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {11, 12, 19}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {8, 11, 13}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {6, 10}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {10, 16}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {4, 7, 14, 19}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {6, 9, 13, 15}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 16}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {0, 7, 12, 17}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 18, 19}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {1, 2, 3}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {2, 9, 19}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {3, 7, 16}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {6, 16}
16. Node 15: Neighbors {7, 18}
17. Node 16: Neighbors {5, 8, 13, 14}
18. Node 17: Neighbor {9}
19. Node 19: Neighbors {2, 6, 10, 12}

Now, we check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (10, 18, 9)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (11, 12, 19)
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (7, 14, 19)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (6, 9, 13, 15)
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 16)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 7, 12, 17)
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors (0, 18, 4, 5, 19)
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors (5, 8, 13, 14)
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors (2, 6, 10, 12)

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 2, 8: 0 three stars
- Node 6, 7, 9, 16, 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) three stars each
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) three stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 22 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [22], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <6, (7, 14, 19)>
- <7, (6, 9, 15)>
- <9, (0, 12, 17)>
- <16, (5, 8, 13)>
- <19, (2, 10, 12)>
