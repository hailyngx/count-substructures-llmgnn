Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 9) (16, 8) (3, 15) (3, 13) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 12) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 13) (5, 8) (19, 10) (19, 4) (8, 16) (8, 18) (8, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 14) (13, 3) (13, 7) (17, 15) (17, 4) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 4) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 7
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 6, 11, 14
Node 2 neighbors: 10, 14, 18
Node 3 neighbors: 9, 13, 15
Node 4 neighbors: 6, 12, 14, 17, 19
Node 5 neighbors: 8
Node 6 neighbors: 1, 4, 7
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 6, 13
Node 8 neighbors: 5, 16, 18
Node 9 neighbors: 3, 11, 14
Node 10 neighbors: 2, 11, 12, 18, 19
Node 11 neighbors: 1, 9, 10
Node 12 neighbors: 4, 10, 15
Node 13 neighbors: 3, 7
Node 14 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 9
Node 15 neighbors: 3, 12, 17, 18
Node 16 neighbors: 8
Node 17 neighbors: 4, 15
Node 18 neighbors: 2, 8, 10, 15
Node 19 neighbors: 4, 10

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 4, 10, 14, 15, 18
Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{1}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3}  = 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 39\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 12, 17)>
<10, (2, 12, 19)>
<14, (1, 4, 9)>
<15, (3, 12, 17)>
<18, (2, 10, 15)>
