Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 7) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 5) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 7) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {14, 5, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 10, 11, 2, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {11, 13, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 3: Neighbors {8, 13, 2, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 12, 1, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 1, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {8, 13, 14, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {13, 4, 14, 3, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors {11, 12, 1, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {9, 10, 1, 2}
- Node 12: Neighbors {10, 13, 3, 5}
- Node 13: Neighbors {6, 8, 12, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 14: Neighbors {10, 8, 4, 0, 7}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (6, 10, 11)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (11, 13, 1)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (8, 13, 12)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 12, 1)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (8, 13, 14)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (13, 4, 14)>
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star: <10, (11, 12, 1)>
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star: <11, (9, 10, 1)>
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star: <13, (6, 8, 12)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star: <14, (10, 8, 4)>

In total, there are 9 unique 3-stars formed. Therefore, the final number to put inside brackets is [9].
