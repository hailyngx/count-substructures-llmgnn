Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (9, 16) (26, 24) (26, 15) (26, 11) (26, 0) (4, 6) (4, 21) (7, 3) (7, 18) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 0) (22, 28) (20, 13) (20, 27) (20, 14) (20, 16) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 28) (8, 25) (8, 19) (8, 29) (13, 20) (13, 14) (12, 27) (12, 3) (12, 1) (27, 20) (27, 12) (27, 17) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 21) (21, 4) (21, 2) (21, 23) (28, 22) (28, 25) (28, 17) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 3) (24, 0) (5, 19) (5, 1) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 10) (10, 19) (10, 15) (10, 14) (15, 26) (15, 10) (15, 29) (15, 16) (29, 9) (29, 8) (29, 15) (11, 26) (11, 24) (11, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 24) (23, 21) (23, 16) (17, 27) (17, 28) (0, 26) (0, 18) (0, 25) (0, 24) (0, 1) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 0) (14, 20) (14, 13) (14, 10) (16, 9) (16, 20) (16, 15) (16, 23) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node based on the given list of edges:

- Node 0: {1, 18, 24, 25, 26}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 12}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 18, 21}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 12, 24}
- Node 4: {6, 21}
- Node 5: {1, 19}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 11}
- Node 7: {3, 18}
- Node 8: {19, 25, 29}
- Node 9: {16, 29}
- Node 10: {14, 15, 19}
- Node 11: {6, 24, 26}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 27}
- Node 13: {14, 20}
- Node 14: {10, 13, 20}
- Node 15: {10, 16, 26, 29}
- Node 16: {9, 15, 20, 23}
- Node 17: {27, 28}
- Node 18: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 19: {5, 8, 10}
- Node 20: {13, 14, 16, 27}
- Node 21: {2, 4, 23}
- Node 22: {28}
- Node 23: {16, 21}
- Node 24: {0, 11, 26, 3}
- Node 25: {0, 8, 28}
- Node 26: {0, 11, 15, 24}
- Node 27: {12, 17, 20}
- Node 28: {17, 22, 25}
- Node 29: {8, 9, 15}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star structures:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star (Unique: <8, 25, 29>)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star (Unique: <10, 14, 20>)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
