Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 11) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 4) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 5) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 4) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 10) 

Response:
This graph represents the following connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 13.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 13, and 14.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 11.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 10, and 11.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 9, and 10.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, 12, and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 10, 13, and 14.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 10, and 14.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 12.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7 and 11.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 9, and 2.

After analyzing the neighbors of each node, we find that nodes 6, 8, and 14 have 4 or more neighbors, hence they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

- Node 6: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 8: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 14: 4 choose 3 = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 4 (from node 6) + 10 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 14) = 18

Therefore, the final answer is [18], and the unique 3-stars are <6, (7, 8, 10)>, <8, (6, 7, 14)>, <8, (6, 10, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 14)>, <8, (10, 13, 14)>, <8, (13, 1, 14)>, <14, (7, 8, 9)>, <14, (8, 9, 10)>, <14, (2, 9, 8)>, <14, (2, 9, 7)>.
