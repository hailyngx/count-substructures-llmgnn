Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 1, 6, 8, 9, 5
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 6: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 6
- Node 8: 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars by applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
