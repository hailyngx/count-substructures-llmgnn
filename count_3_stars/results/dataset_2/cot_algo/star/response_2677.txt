Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 3) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 6) (4, 15) (4, 17) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 13) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 14) (13, 5) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 16) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 10) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 16) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 17) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 15) (11, 7) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 9) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 9) (15, 4) (15, 7) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 17) 

Response:
Counting the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors (1, 5, 8, 10, 14, 18)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (0, 6)
- Node 2: 1 neighbor (3)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (2, 7, 9, 18)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (6, 15, 17, 18, 19)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (0, 12, 13)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (1, 4, 8, 10)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (3, 11, 15)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (0, 6, 17, 19)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (3, 10, 17)
- Node 10: 3 neighbors (0, 6, 9)
- Node 11: 1 neighbor (7)
- Node 12: 3 neighbors (5, 16, 18)
- Node 13: 2 neighbors (5, 14)
- Node 14: 2 neighbors (0, 13)
- Node 15: 2 neighbors (4, 7)
- Node 16: 3 neighbors (12, 17, 19)
- Node 17: 5 neighbors (4, 8, 9, 16, 19)
- Node 18: 4 neighbors (3, 4, 12, 18)
- Node 19: 4 neighbors (4, 8, 16, 17)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:  
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars is 60.  

Therefore, the final answer is [60].  

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 18)>, <0, (8, 14, 18)>, <0, (10, 14, 18)>, <0, (1, 14, 18)>, <0, (1, 8, 18)>, <3, (2, 7, 18)>, <4, (6, 17, 19)>, <4, (8, 17, 19)>, <4, (6, 8, 17)>, <4, (6, 8, 10)>, <5, (12, 13, 14)>, <6, (1, 4, 10)>, <8, (4, 19, 17)>, <9, (3, 10, 17)>, <12, (5, 12, 16)>, <17, (16, 19, 8)>, <17, (4, 8, 17)>, <17, (4, 9, 17)>, <17, (8, 9, 17)>, <18, (12, 18, 3)>, <18, (4, 12, 18)>, <18, (4, 18, 3)>, <18, (4, 18, 16)>, <19, (4, 16, 19)>, <19, (4, 8, 19)>, <19, (16, 17, 19)>.
