Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {9, 7, 5}
Node 1: Neighbors {9, 4, 7, 3, 2}
Node 2: Neighbors {9, 4, 1, 5}
Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5, 8}
Node 4: Neighbors {9, 7, 2, 1}
Node 5: Neighbors {7, 3, 8, 0, 2}
Node 6: Neighbors {7, 8}
Node 7: Neighbors {6, 4, 1, 0, 5}
Node 8: Neighbors {6, 9, 3, 5}
Node 9: Neighbors {8, 4, 2, 1, 0}

Now we will go through each node that has three or more neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: 3 neighbors -> Cannot form a 3-star
Node 1: 5 neighbors -> inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 2: 4 neighbors -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 4: 4 neighbors -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 5: 5 neighbors -> inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 7: 5 neighbors -> inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 9: 5 neighbors -> inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 48

So, there are a total of 48 3-stars in the given graph. 
Putting this final number inside brackets: [48].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
