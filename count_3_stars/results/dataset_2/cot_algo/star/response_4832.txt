Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 5) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 10) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 17) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 11) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 2) (10, 11) (10, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 18) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 13) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 0) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 19) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 18) (1, 0) (1, 19) (2, 17) (2, 19) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 19) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 6) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 3) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 15) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 12, 18}
- Node 1: {0, 19}
- Node 2: {17, 19}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 7, 18}
- Node 4: {12, 13}
- Node 5: {3, 10, 15, 16}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 19}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 16, 19}
- Node 8: {9, 15, 18}
- Node 9: {8, 17}
- Node 10: {5, 11}
- Node 11: {10, 17}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 14}
- Node 13: {4, 14, 15}
- Node 14: {12, 13, 17, 18}
- Node 15: {5, 8, 13}
- Node 16: {5, 7}
- Node 17: {2, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 18: {0, 3, 8, 14}
- Node 19: {1, 2, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: {1, 12, 18} - forms a 3-star
- Node 3: {5, 6, 7, 18} - forms 4 3-stars
- Node 14: {12, 13, 17, 18} - forms 4 3-stars
- Node 18: {0, 3, 8, 14} - forms 4 3-stars
- Node 19: {1, 2, 6, 7} - forms a 3-star

Total 3-stars formed: 1 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 14) + 4 (from node 18) + 1 (from node 19) = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 12, 18)>
<3, (5, 6, 7, 18)>
<14, (12, 13, 17, 18)>
<18, (0, 3, 8, 14)>
<19, (1, 2, 6, 7)>
