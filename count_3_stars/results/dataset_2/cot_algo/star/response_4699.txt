Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 2) (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 16) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 6) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (0, 5) (0, 12) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 19) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 7) (19, 3) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 6) (2, 15) (2, 17) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1) (7, 15) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 18) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 10) (14, 6) (1, 16) (1, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 12}
- Node 1: {12, 16}
- Node 2: {15, 17}
- Node 3: {10, 19}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {8, 14, 15, 19}
- Node 7: {11, 15, 17, 18}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 15}
- Node 9: {5, 9, 16, 17}
- Node 10: {3, 14, 17}
- Node 11: {7, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 11}
- Node 13: {4, 11, 18}
- Node 14: {6, 10}
- Node 15: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 16: {1, 9, 19}
- Node 17: {2, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 18: {7, 13, 19}
- Node 19: {3, 6, 16, 18}

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 17, 18, and 19 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

- Node 4: \( inom{3}{4} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is [29], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 0, 12>
<6, 8, 15>
<6, 14, 19>
<7, 15, 17>
<7, 17, 18>
<9, 16, 17>
<10, 14, 17>
<11, 12, 13>
<15, 2, 17>
<15, 6, 14>
<16, 9, 19>
<17, 7, 18>
<18, 13, 19>
<19, 3, 16>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 12, 16>
<2, 15, 17>
<3, 10, 19>
