Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 1) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can first list out the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {8, 10}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 3, 6, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 7, 13}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 4: neighbors {7, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 8, 11}
- Node 6: neighbors {1}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 2, 4, 9, 11}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 10: neighbors {0, 3, 8, 11}
- Node 11: neighbors {3, 5, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 12: neighbors {3, 8, 11}
- Node 13: neighbors {1, 2, 4, 14}
- Node 14: neighbors {1, 4, 9, 13}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors - forms 20 3-stars
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors - forms 20 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors - forms 4 3-stars
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors - forms 10 3-stars
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors - forms 20 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors - forms 4 3-stars
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors - forms 10 3-stars
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors - forms 4 3-stars
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors - forms 4 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \(20+20+4+10+20+4+10+4+4 = 96\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [96].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 13, 14)>
- <1, (3, 13, 14)>
- <1, (7, 9, 11)>
- <1, (9, 13, 14)>
- <3, (5, 9, 11)>
- <3, (5, 11, 12)>
- <4, (7, 13, 14)>
- <7, (9, 11, 13)>
- <8, (10, 12, 11)>
- <9, (13, 14, 1)>
