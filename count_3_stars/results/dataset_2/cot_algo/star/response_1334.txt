Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 14) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 6) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 6) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 14) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) 

Response:
In this graph, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 1: {2, 8, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 11}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 10}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 9, 10}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 9, 14}
- Node 9: {7, 8, 11}
- Node 10: {4, 7}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 3, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 12: {2, 5, 6, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {5, 6, 8, 11, 13}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 11: [1]
- Node 14: [1]

Adding these up, we have a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 11)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 14)>
<6, (0, 11, 12)>
<7, (0, 4, 10)>
<8, (1, 4, 14)>
<11, (0, 2, 14)>
<14, (5, 8, 13)>
