Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 10) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 14) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 13) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 7, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {10, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 10}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 11}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 11: {3, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {3, 4, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {4, 6, 12, 13}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 (Node 7)
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 11 (Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 3-star each => 1 * 1 = 1
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each => 11 * 4 = 44

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from nodes with 3 neighbors) + 44 (from nodes with 4 neighbors) = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>
- <0, (1, 10, 13)>
- <1, (0, 8, 13)>
- <2, (3, 10, 13)>
- <3, (1, 9, 13)>
- <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 10)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
- <10, (0, 2, 6)>
- <11, (3, 9, 13)>
- <12, (3, 4, 14)>
- <13, (0, 2, 6)>
- <14, (4, 6, 12)>
