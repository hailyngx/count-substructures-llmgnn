Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 11) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 10) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 7, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 7, 1, 14, 10}
- Node 3: Neighbors {11, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8, 12, 10, 11}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 11, 0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 1, 10, 2, 11, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 2, 1, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 4, 7, 14, 10}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 10: Neighbors {6, 4, 8, 2}
- Node 11: Neighbors {5, 6, 4, 3, 12, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {4, 13, 14, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors {9, 12, 11}
- Node 14: Neighbors {3, 8, 12, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: {0, 3, 5}

For the nodes with 3 neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Therefore, a total of 2 unique 3-stars are formed in this graph. 

The final answer is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 5, 11>
- <5, 9, 6>
