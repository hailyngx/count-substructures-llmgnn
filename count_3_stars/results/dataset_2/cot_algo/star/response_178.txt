Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 14) (5, 18) (5, 0) (9, 28) (9, 10) (9, 12) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 26) (15, 7) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 13) (7, 15) (7, 21) (7, 3) (7, 22) (21, 15) (21, 7) (21, 3) (22, 7) (22, 19) (22, 4) (22, 24) (23, 2) (23, 28) (28, 9) (28, 23) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 20) (29, 26) (2, 23) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 14) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 26) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 6) (20, 27) (20, 29) (4, 22) (4, 26) (13, 27) (13, 17) (13, 6) (3, 7) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 18) (25, 17) (25, 6) (25, 10) (19, 15) (19, 22) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 25) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 18) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 3) (26, 15) (26, 29) (26, 8) (26, 4) (14, 16) (14, 2) (24, 22) (10, 9) (10, 25) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 1) (12, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (3, 5, 11)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (16, 2, 18)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (1, 14, 17, 23, 8)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (18, 0, 7, 21)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (22, 26)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (0, 18)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (11, 13, 17, 25)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (15, 21, 22, 3)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (11, 2, 26)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (28, 10, 12)
- Node 10: 2 neighbors (9, 25)
- Node 11: 4 neighbors (0, 8, 6, 16)
- Node 12: 1 neighbor (9)
- Node 13: 3 neighbors (27, 17, 6)
- Node 14: 2 neighbors (2, 16)
- Node 15: 5 neighbors (27, 19, 21, 26, 7)
- Node 16: 3 neighbors (11, 1, 14)
- Node 17: 4 neighbors (25, 2, 13, 6)
- Node 18: 3 neighbors (5, 1, 3)
- Node 19: 2 neighbors (15, 22)
- Node 20: 2 neighbors (27, 29)
- Node 21: 3 neighbors (7, 3, 15)
- Node 22: 4 neighbors (4, 24, 19, 7)
- Node 23: 2 neighbors (2, 28)
- Node 24: 1 neighbor (22)
- Node 25: 3 neighbors (17, 10, 6)
- Node 26: 4 neighbors (15, 29, 8, 4)
- Node 27: 4 neighbors (15, 20, 13, 7)
- Node 28: 3 neighbors (9, 23, 29)
- Node 29: 3 neighbors (28, 26, 20)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 14, 17)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (11, 13, 17)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (15, 21, 27)>
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star: <15, (7, 21, 27)>
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star: <17, (2, 13, 25)>
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star: <21, (3, 7, 15)>
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star: <22, (4, 19, 24)>
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star: <26, (4, 15, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
