Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 25) (15, 4) (15, 2) (27, 1) (3, 26) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 21) (20, 25) (20, 4) (20, 19) (18, 22) (18, 9) (18, 6) (18, 24) (18, 0) (22, 18) (22, 9) (22, 5) (12, 5) (10, 17) (10, 16) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (9, 18) (9, 22) (24, 18) (24, 7) (24, 4) (24, 2) (26, 3) (26, 2) (26, 8) (26, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (28, 8) (28, 1) (23, 2) (23, 29) (1, 27) (1, 28) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 13) (6, 18) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 19) (8, 26) (8, 28) (7, 24) (7, 26) (7, 29) (7, 2) (29, 23) (29, 7) (29, 0) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 29) (14, 10) (14, 6) (2, 15) (2, 24) (2, 26) (2, 23) (2, 7) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 1) (21, 25) (21, 4) (21, 5) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 19) (5, 22) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 4) (4, 15) (4, 20) (4, 24) (4, 21) (4, 5) (19, 20) (19, 6) (19, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 11, 18, 29
- Node 1: 6, 13, 16, 27, 28
- Node 2: 7, 15, 23, 24, 26
- Node 3: 26
- Node 4: 15, 20, 21, 24, 5
- Node 5: 4, 12, 21, 22
- Node 6: 1, 14, 18, 19
- Node 7: 2, 26, 29, 24
- Node 8: 26, 28
- Node 9: 18, 22
- Node 10: 14, 16, 17
- Node 11: 0, 13
- Node 12: 5
- Node 13: 1, 11, 19
- Node 14: 6, 10
- Node 15: 2, 20, 21, 25
- Node 16: 1, 10, 17
- Node 17: 10, 16
- Node 18: 0, 6, 9, 22, 24
- Node 19: 6, 13, 18, 20
- Node 20: 4, 19, 21, 25
- Node 21: 4, 5, 15, 20
- Node 22: 5, 9, 18
- Node 23: 2, 29
- Node 24: 2, 4, 7, 18
- Node 25: 15, 20, 21
- Node 26: 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 27: 1
- Node 28: 1, 8
- Node 29: 0, 7, 23

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
