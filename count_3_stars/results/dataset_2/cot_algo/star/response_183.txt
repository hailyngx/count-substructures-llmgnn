Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3} = 10] 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3} = 10] 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3} = 10] 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3} = 10] 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 52.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>

So, the final answer is [52].
