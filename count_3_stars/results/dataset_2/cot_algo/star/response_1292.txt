Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 17) (27, 26) (27, 13) (27, 6) (14, 17) (14, 9) (17, 27) (17, 14) (17, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 3) (22, 21) (10, 20) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 20) (0, 20) (0, 28) (20, 22) (20, 10) (20, 11) (20, 0) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 26) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 29) (12, 8) (28, 0) (28, 9) (28, 1) (1, 28) (1, 5) (25, 7) (25, 8) (25, 24) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 2) (23, 29) (8, 12) (8, 25) (8, 3) (19, 18) (19, 21) (4, 13) (4, 26) (4, 2) (13, 27) (13, 17) (13, 4) (16, 21) (16, 9) (21, 22) (21, 19) (21, 16) (21, 9) (24, 22) (24, 11) (24, 25) (3, 22) (3, 8) (3, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 23) (2, 23) (2, 4) (2, 26) (2, 6) (26, 27) (26, 7) (26, 4) (26, 2) (6, 27) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 2) (29, 12) (29, 23) (9, 14) (9, 28) (9, 16) (9, 21) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {20, 28}
- Node 1: {5, 28}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 23, 26}
- Node 3: {6, 8, 22}
- Node 4: {2, 13, 26}
- Node 5: {1, 12, 23}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 27, 18}
- Node 7: {12, 25, 26}
- Node 8: {3, 12, 25}
- Node 9: {14, 16, 21, 28}
- Node 10: {20, 11}
- Node 11: {10, 20, 23, 24}
- Node 12: {5, 7, 8, 29}
- Node 13: {4, 17, 27}
- Node 14: {9, 17}
- Node 15: {27}
- Node 16: {9, 21}
- Node 17: {13, 14, 27}
- Node 18: {6, 19}
- Node 19: {18, 21}
- Node 20: {0, 10, 11, 22}
- Node 21: {9, 16, 19}
- Node 22: {3, 20, 24, 21}
- Node 23: {2, 5, 11, 29}
- Node 24: {11, 22, 25}
- Node 25: {7, 8, 24}
- Node 26: {2, 4, 6, 27}
- Node 27: {6, 13, 15, 26}
- Node 28: {0, 9, 14, 1}
- Node 29: {12, 23}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 31

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [31].

Unique 3-stars:

<4, (2, 13, 26)>
<6, (2, 3, 27)>
<9, (14, 16, 21)>
<12, (5, 7, 8)>
