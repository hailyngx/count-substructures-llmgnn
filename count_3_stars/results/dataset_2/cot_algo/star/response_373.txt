Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 8 (4 neighbors)
Node 1 neighbors: 2, 9 (2 neighbors)
Node 2 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 (5 neighbors)
Node 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 (5 neighbors)
Node 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 8 (3 neighbors)
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7, 9 (5 neighbors)
Node 6 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 (6 neighbors)
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 5, 6 (3 neighbors)
Node 8 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6 (4 neighbors)
Node 9 neighbors: 1, 5, 6 (3 neighbors)

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 58 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars is [58].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
