Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 9: 1, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 and Node 5 have 5 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.  
Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, and Node 9 also have 5 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>
