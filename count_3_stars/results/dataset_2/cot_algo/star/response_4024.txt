Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 14) 

Response:
Following the steps outlined earlier:

1. Explore the neighbor nodes for each node:
   - Node 0: {2, 5, 7}
   - Node 1: {3, 6, 10, 12}
   - Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12}
   - Node 3: {1, 5}
   - Node 4: {5, 8, 9, 13}
   - Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}
   - Node 6: {1, 2, 7, 10}
   - Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 6, 10}
   - Node 8: {2, 4, 14}
   - Node 9: {4, 9, 12, 13, 14}
   - Node 10: {1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11}
   - Node 11: {10, 13}
   - Node 12: {1, 2, 9, 14}
   - Node 13: {4, 9, 11}
   - Node 14: {8, 9, 12}

2. Apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with three or more neighbors:
   - Node 0: [C(3, 3) = 1] (Forms 1 unique 3-star)
   - Node 1: [C(4, 3) = 4] (Forms 4 unique 3-stars)
   - Node 2: [C(6, 3) = 20] (Forms 20 unique 3-stars)
   - Node 4: [C(4, 3) = 4] (Forms 4 unique 3-stars)
   - Node 5: [C(5, 3) = 10] (Forms 10 unique 3-stars)
   - Node 6: [C(4, 3) = 4] (Forms 4 unique 3-stars)
   - Node 7: [C(5, 3) = 10] (Forms 10 unique 3-stars)
   - Node 9: [C(5, 3) = 10] (Forms 10 unique 3-stars)
   - Node 10: [C(6, 3) = 20] (Forms 20 unique 3-stars)
   - Node 12: [C(4, 3) = 4] (Forms 4 unique 3-stars)

3. Sum up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 77

Therefore, the final answer is [77], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 10)>, <1, (6, 10, 12)>, <1, (10, 11, 13)>, <1, (10, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 8, 14)>, <2, (5, 7, 10)>, <2, (6, 7, 10)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 9, 14)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (2, 6, 10)>, <7, (5, 6, 10)>, <7, (5, 9, 14)>, <9, (4, 9, 13)>, <9, (9, 13, 14)>, <10, (6, 7, 8)>, <10, (7, 9, 10)>, <10, (8, 9, 14)>, <10, (9, 11, 13)>, <10, (9, 12, 14)>, <12, (1, 9, 14)>.
