Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 4) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 4) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 1) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given edge list, we can first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {10, 5, 6, 2, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {8, 7, 14, 4, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 14, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {13, 5, 2, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {13, 2, 14, 1}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 0, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {8, 10, 0, 9, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {13, 1, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {11, 7, 14, 3, 1}
- Node 10: Neighbors {11, 0, 12, 7}
- Node 11: Neighbors {13, 10, 9, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {13, 10, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors {8, 12, 4, 11, 3}
- Node 14: Neighbors {2, 1, 9}

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 52 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52].
