Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 2) (14, 8) (14, 12) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 12) 

Response:
The given graph has the following connections for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 13, 6, 12}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 11, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 13, 1}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 7, 11, 6, 12}
- Node 4: {7, 10, 11, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 1, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {4, 8, 10, 3, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 3}
- Node 8: {13, 14, 11, 6, 12}
- Node 9: {5, 3, 1, 7}
- Node 10: {4, 6}
- Node 11: {4, 8, 3, 1, 12}
- Node 12: {8, 11, 3, 14, 0}
- Node 13: {8, 2, 0}
- Node 14: {8, 12}

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 44 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [44].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (5, 6, 12)>, 
<3, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<8, (6, 11, 12)>.
