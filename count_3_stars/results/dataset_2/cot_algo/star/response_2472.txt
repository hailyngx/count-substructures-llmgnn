Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 8) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 10) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 11) (12, 1) (16, 12) (16, 9) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 13) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 1) (19, 17) (19, 6) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 2) (1, 12) (1, 18) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 1) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 9) (13, 1) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: 12, 18, 2, 13
2: 0, 7, 14, 1
3: 15
4: 10, 8
5: 10, 11, 18, 0
6: 12, 19
7: 17, 14, 2, 18
8: 10, 11, 17, 4
9: 0, 16, 13
10: 4, 5
11: 8, 5, 12
12: 1, 11, 6, 16
13: 15, 14, 9, 1
14: 15, 7, 2, 13
15: 3, 13, 14
16: 12, 9
17: 19, 8, 7
18: 5, 7, 1
19: 17, 6

Next, we identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

- Node 1, 3-stars: <1, (12, 18, 2)>, <1, (2, 7, 14)>, <1, (1, 13, 9)>
- Node 2, 3-stars: <2, (0, 7, 14)>, <2, (14, 7, 18)>, <2, (2, 1, 13)>
- Node 5, 3-stars: <5, (10, 11, 8)>
- Node 7, 3-stars: <7, (17, 8, 4)>, <7, (14, 2, 1)>, <7, (18, 2, 1)>
- Node 8, 3-stars: <8, (10, 4, 17)>, <8, (11, 5, 12)>
- Node 11, 3-stars: <11, (8, 4, 10)>, <11, (5, 12, 1)>
- Node 12, 3-stars: <12, (1, 11, 5)>, <12, (11, 5, 10)>
- Node 13, 3-stars: <13, (15, 14, 7)>, <13, (14, 7, 18)>, <13, (9, 1, 12)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [16].
