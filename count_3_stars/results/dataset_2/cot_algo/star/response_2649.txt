Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 4) (15, 2) (6, 18) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 18) (12, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 17) (5, 12) (5, 10) (19, 1) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 14) (1, 12) (1, 19) (1, 18) (18, 6) (18, 12) (18, 1) 

Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. 

For each node, we will identify its neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 7, 17} (Degree: 3)
- Node 1: Neighbors {12, 18, 19} (Degree: 3)
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 10, 14, 15} (Degree: 4)
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 7, 8, 9, 15} (Degree: 5)
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8, 11, 15} (Degree: 4)
- Node 5: Neighbors {10, 12} (Degree: 2)
- Node 6: Neighbors {13, 18} (Degree: 2)
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 4} (Degree: 3)
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 4, 14} (Degree: 3)
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 10} (Degree: 3)
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 5, 9} (Degree: 3)
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 16, 17} (Degree: 3)
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 5, 18} (Degree: 3)
- Node 13: Neighbors {6, 14, 17} (Degree: 3)
- Node 14: Neighbors {2, 8, 13} (Degree: 3)
- Node 15: Neighbors {2, 3, 4} (Degree: 3)
- Node 16: Neighbors {11, 17} (Degree: 2)
- Node 17: Neighbors {0, 11, 13, 16} (Degree: 4)
- Node 18: Neighbors {1, 6, 12} (Degree: 3)
- Node 19: Neighbors {1} (Degree: 1)

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, and 17 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars involving these nodes.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: <2, (9, 10, 14)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 15)>, <3, (0, 8, 15)>, <3, (7, 4, 15)>, <3, (8, 4, 15)>, <4, (7, 8, 15)>, <7, (0, 3, 17)>, <13, (6, 14, 17)>.
