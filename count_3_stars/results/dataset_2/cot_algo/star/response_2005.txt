Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 7
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so we can form 10 3-stars with this node.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so we can form 20 3-stars with this node.
- Node 7 also has 6 neighbors, so we can form 20 3-stars with this node.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 20 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
