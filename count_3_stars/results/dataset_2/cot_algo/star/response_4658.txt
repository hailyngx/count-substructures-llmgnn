Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 29) (13, 24) (22, 13) (22, 10) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 21) (9, 6) (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 28) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 29) (8, 27) (23, 26) (23, 15) (23, 14) (28, 6) (28, 4) (28, 3) (28, 14) (26, 13) (26, 23) (26, 14) (27, 4) (27, 8) (27, 3) (27, 20) (1, 7) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 19) (15, 23) (15, 1) (21, 6) (21, 19) (21, 18) (11, 17) (11, 2) (10, 22) (10, 5) (14, 23) (14, 28) (14, 26) (14, 12) (3, 28) (3, 27) (3, 19) (3, 5) (24, 13) (24, 1) (24, 5) (24, 25) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 20) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 5) (5, 10) (5, 3) (5, 24) (5, 2) (0, 17) (0, 12) (29, 13) (29, 8) (20, 27) (20, 16) (18, 21) (18, 16) (18, 12) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 17) (17, 11) (17, 0) (17, 12) (25, 24) (19, 1) (19, 21) (19, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges. 

- Node 0: {17, 12}
- Node 1: {7, 15, 24, 19}
- Node 2: {11, 16, 5}
- Node 3: {28, 27, 19, 5}
- Node 4: {7, 27, 28, 16}
- Node 5: {10, 3, 24, 2}
- Node 6: {9, 28, 21}
- Node 7: {4, 1}
- Node 8: {13, 29, 27}
- Node 9: {6}
- Node 10: {22, 5}
- Node 11: {17, 2}
- Node 12: {14, 0, 18, 17}
- Node 13: {22, 8, 26, 29, 24}
- Node 14: {23, 28, 26, 12}
- Node 15: {23, 1}
- Node 16: {4, 18, 2, 20}
- Node 17: {11, 0, 12}
- Node 18: {21, 16, 12}
- Node 19: {1, 21, 3}
- Node 20: {27, 16}
- Node 21: {6, 19, 18}
- Node 22: {13, 10}
- Node 23: {26, 15, 14}
- Node 24: {13, 1, 5, 25}
- Node 25: {24}
- Node 26: {13, 23, 14}
- Node 27: {4, 8, 3, 20}
- Node 28: {6, 4, 3, 14}
- Node 29: {13, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star and count them.

- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the final answer is [15], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <4, (7, 16, 27)>
- <8, (13, 24, 29)>
- <13, (22, 24, 29)>
- <13, (8, 24, 29)>
- <13, (8, 24, 26)>
- <13, (8, 26, 29)>
- <13, (24, 26, 29)>
- <5, (3, 24, 5)>
- <5, (3, 24, 2)>
- <5, (3, 5, 2)>
- <3, (19, 27, 28)>
- <3, (19, 27, 5)>
- <3, (19, 28, 5)>
- <3, (27, 28, 5)>
- <1, (7, 15, 24)>
