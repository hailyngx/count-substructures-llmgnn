Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 27) (22, 11) (22, 1) (1, 22) (1, 21) (1, 5) (21, 13) (21, 1) (21, 2) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 15) (3, 20) (25, 18) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 24) (10, 29) (11, 22) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 0) (15, 17) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 9) (2, 21) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 17) (8, 20) (8, 2) (8, 7) (19, 22) (19, 26) (19, 16) (19, 27) (26, 19) (26, 18) (26, 23) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (28, 16) (28, 18) (28, 23) (16, 19) (16, 28) (16, 27) (18, 25) (18, 26) (18, 28) (4, 10) (4, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (23, 26) (23, 28) (5, 1) (24, 10) (24, 0) (24, 9) (9, 11) (9, 20) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 24) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 24) (27, 22) (27, 19) (27, 16) (29, 10) 

Response:
Since this graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges, we know that each node must have degree 6. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {11, 12, 24}
- Node 1: {5, 21, 22}
- Node 2: {8, 12, 21}
- Node 3: {20}
- Node 4: {9, 10}
- Node 5: {1}
- Node 6: {12, 14}
- Node 7: {8, 9, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {2, 7, 17, 20}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 9, 10, 24}
- Node 10: {4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 24, 29}
- Node 11: {0, 10, 14, 22}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 13: {21, 22}
- Node 14: {6, 7, 11, 17}
- Node 15: {17}
- Node 16: {19, 27, 28}
- Node 17: {8, 14, 15, 17}
- Node 18: {25, 26, 28}
- Node 19: {16, 22, 26, 27}
- Node 20: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 21: {1, 2, 13}
- Node 22: {1, 11, 13, 19, 27}
- Node 23: {26, 28}
- Node 24: {0, 9, 10}
- Node 25: {18}
- Node 26: {18, 19, 23}
- Node 27: {22, 16, 19}
- Node 28: {16, 18, 23}
- Node 29: {10}

Nodes 15, 25, and 29 only have degree 1, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 1
- Node 2: 3
- Node 4: 1
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 5
- Node 10: 10
- Node 12: 3
- Node 14: 3
- Node 16: 1
- Node 17: 1
- Node 19: 4
- Node 20: 1
- Node 21: 1
- Node 22: 4
- Node 26: 3
- Node 27: 3
- Node 28: 3

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 50, so the final answer is [50].
