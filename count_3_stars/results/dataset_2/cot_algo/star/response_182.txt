Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 27) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 19) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 13) (27, 11) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 6) (6, 27) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (9, 6) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 3) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 24) (20, 27) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 10) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 2) (12, 21) (1, 6) (1, 29) (1, 4) (26, 18) (26, 14) (26, 0) (0, 26) (0, 10) (0, 17) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 26) (14, 4) (28, 3) (28, 23) (3, 9) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 17) (21, 12) (21, 2) (21, 22) (18, 5) (18, 26) (18, 24) (7, 25) (7, 3) (10, 20) (10, 0) (10, 8) (2, 25) (2, 21) (17, 0) (17, 3) (17, 24) (17, 4) (29, 1) (29, 13) (29, 23) (19, 16) (23, 15) (23, 28) (23, 29) (23, 13) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 17) (8, 20) (8, 10) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 29) (13, 23) (24, 9) (24, 5) (24, 18) (24, 17) (22, 21) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 10, 17, 26
- Node 1: 4, 6, 29
- Node 2: 21, 25
- Node 3: 7, 9, 17, 28
- Node 4: 1, 14, 17
- Node 5: 9, 18, 24
- Node 6: 1, 9, 11, 14, 27
- Node 7: 3, 25
- Node 8: 10, 20
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6, 24
- Node 10: 0, 8, 20
- Node 11: 6, 14, 16, 27
- Node 12: 21
- Node 13: 15, 16, 23, 29
- Node 14: 1, 4, 6, 11, 26
- Node 15: 13, 23, 27
- Node 16: 11, 13, 19
- Node 17: 0, 3, 4, 24
- Node 18: 5, 24, 26
- Node 19: 16
- Node 20: 8, 10, 25, 27
- Node 21: 2, 12, 22
- Node 22: 21
- Node 23: 13, 15, 28, 29
- Node 24: 5, 9, 17, 18
- Node 25: 2, 7, 20
- Node 26: 0, 14, 18
- Node 27: 6, 11, 15, 20
- Node 28: 3, 23
- Node 29: 1, 13, 23

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are: 19, 22, and 28.

For each of these nodes, we can form 1 3-star. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 3.

Thus, the final answer is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<19, 16, 13>
<22, 21, 12>
<28, 3, 23>
