Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 18) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 18) (8, 16) (13, 15) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 19) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 15) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 12) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 15) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 11) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 9) (19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 9) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 19) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 5) (16, 8) (16, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by first determining the neighbor set for each node and then checking if they have at least 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. 

Here is the neighbor set for each node based on the given edge list:

1: {3, 7, 10, 19}
2: {0, 4, 6}
3: {1, 12, 18}
4: {2, 7, 11, 17}
5: {6, 16, 18}
6: {2, 5, 17}
7: {1, 4, 17, 18}
8: {16}
9: {0, 11, 19}
10: {1, 14, 15}
11: {4, 9, 17, 19}
12: {0, 3, 15}
13: {15}
14: {10, 19}
15: {10, 12, 13}
16: {5, 8}
17: {4, 6, 7, 11}
18: {3, 5, 7}
19: {1, 9, 11, 14}

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars possible for each node:

1: [1]
2: [0]
3: [1]
4: [3]
5: [0]
6: [1]
7: [3]
8: [0]
9: [1]
10: [0]
11: [3]
12: [1]
13: [0]
14: [0]
15: [0]
16: [0]
17: [3]
18: [1]
19: [1]

Adding these up, we get a total of [17] 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars are as follows: 
<1, (3, 7, 19)>
<3, (1, 12, 15)>
<4, (2, 7, 17)>
<7, (1, 4, 17)>
<9, (11, 19, 9)>
<11, (4, 17, 11)>
<17, (4, 7, 11)>
