Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 18) (8, 7) (8, 18) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 18) (9, 2) (15, 17) (19, 4) (19, 6) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 3) (4, 17) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (16, 5) (16, 17) (18, 13) (18, 8) (18, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (14, 5) (14, 1) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 16) (17, 2) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 17) 

Response:
First, let's organize the nodes and their neighbors based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 11
- Node 1: 0, 7, 14
- Node 2: 0, 9, 11, 17
- Node 3: 4, 7, 13
- Node 4: 3, 5, 17, 19
- Node 5: 4, 13, 14, 16
- Node 6: 0, 11, 19
- Node 7: 1, 3, 8, 12
- Node 8: 7, 18
- Node 9: 2, 9, 10, 11, 18
- Node 10: 9, 13
- Node 11: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 12: 7
- Node 13: 3, 5, 9, 10, 18
- Node 14: 1, 5
- Node 15: 17
- Node 16: 5, 17
- Node 17: 2, 4, 16, 17
- Node 18: 8, 9, 13
- Node 19: 4, 6

Now let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 9, 11)>
- Node 4: <4, (3, 5, 17)>
- Node 5: <5, (3, 13, 14)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 9: <9, (2, 10, 13)>
- Node 11: <11, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 13: <13, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 17: <17, (4, 16, 17)>

There are 8 unique 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [8].
