Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 3) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 4) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 8, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 13}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 10: {4, 11}
- Node 11: {7, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {6, 7, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {5, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 4, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, no 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed (has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, no 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed (has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: 4 neighbors, no 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of unique 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 100

Therefore, the final answer is [100]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 14>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 14>, <0, 5, 8>, 
<0, 5, 14>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 14>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 14>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 14>, 
<1, 8, 14>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 12>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 3>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 7, 14>, 
<4, 9, 12>, <4, 9, 7>, <4, 9, 1>, <4, 9, 8>, <4, 9, 7>, <4, 9, 1>, <4, 9, 14>, <6, 7, 8>, 
<6, 7, 12>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 3>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 12>, <6, 8, 3>, <6, 9, 12>, <6, 9, 7>, 
<6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 12>, <7, 9, 12>, <8, 9, 12>.
