Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 15) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 19) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 12) (13, 10) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 2) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 18) (1, 2) (3, 19) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 18) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 18) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 10) (18, 15) (15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 18) 

Response:
The total number of nodes in the graph is 20, and the graph contains 60 edges. 

Based on the given edge list, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0 neighbors: {2, 5, 8, 12}
- Node 1 neighbors: {2}
- Node 2 neighbors: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 3 neighbors: {19}
- Node 4 neighbors: {7, 9, 10, 14, 15}
- Node 5 neighbors: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 6 neighbors: {5, 9, 14, 17}
- Node 7 neighbors: {4, 16}
- Node 8 neighbors: {0, 12, 19}
- Node 9 neighbors: {4, 6, 19}
- Node 10 neighbors: {4, 13, 14, 18}
- Node 11 neighbors: {17, 19}
- Node 12 neighbors: {0, 8, 13, 18}
- Node 13 neighbors: {10, 12}
- Node 14 neighbors: {4, 6, 10}
- Node 15 neighbors: {4, 16, 18}
- Node 16 neighbors: {7, 15}
- Node 17 neighbors: {6, 11, 18}
- Node 18 neighbors: {10, 12, 15, 17}
- Node 19 neighbors: {3, 8, 9, 11}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 4, Node 6, Node 10, Node 15, and Node 18 have 5 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 23 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [23].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (7, 9, 15)>, <4, (7, 9, 10)>, <4, (7, 9, 14)>, <4, (9, 10, 14)>, <4, (9, 10, 15)>, <4, (10, 14, 15)>,
<6, (5, 9, 14)>, <6, (9, 14, 17)>, <6, (5, 14, 17)>,
<10, (4, 14, 18)>, <10, (4, 10, 14)>, <10, (10, 14, 18)>, <10, (10, 14, 18)>,
<15, (4, 16, 18)>,
<18, (10, 12, 15)>, <18, (10, 12, 17)>, <18, (10, 15, 17)>, <18, (12, 15, 17)>.
