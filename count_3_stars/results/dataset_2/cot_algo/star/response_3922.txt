Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 9) (2, 3) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 13) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 0) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 8, 5, 11, 6
- Node 1: 14, 5, 13, 8
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 10, 9, 2
- Node 4: 7, 8, 0, 10
- Node 5: 1, 8, 13, 11, 0
- Node 6: 7, 14, 10, 0
- Node 7: 4, 12, 6, 9, 13
- Node 8: 4, 1, 9, 5, 0
- Node 9: 7, 3, 8, 12, 13
- Node 10: 4, 3, 12, 13, 6
- Node 11: 12, 5, 0
- Node 12: 7, 10, 11, 9
- Node 13: 7, 1, 5, 10, 9
- Node 14: 1, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, 5: <0, (4, 8, 5)>
- Node 5: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, 13: <5, (1, 8, 13)>
- Node 6: Forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 14, 10: <6, (7, 14, 10)>
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 12, 6: <7, (4, 12, 6)>
- Node 8: Forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 1, 9: <8, (4, 1, 9)>
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 3, 8: <9, (7, 3, 8)>
- Node 10: Forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 3, 12: <10, (4, 3, 12)>
- Node 13: Forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 1, 5: <13, (7, 1, 5)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
