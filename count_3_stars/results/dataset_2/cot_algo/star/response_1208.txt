Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 14) (14, 1) (14, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 5, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 7, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 6: {7, 9, 12}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5, 12}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 2, 9, 11}
- Node 11: {5, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {2, 6, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 9}
- Node 14: {1, 12}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 94 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [94].

Unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 14)>, <1, (4, 7, 13)>, <1, (4, 10, 9)>, <1, (7, 10, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 12)>, <10, (0, 2, 11)>.
