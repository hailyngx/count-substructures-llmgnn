Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 8) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 3) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 13) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 13) (1, 10) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 1) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {9, 11, 7, 4, 13}
- Node 1: {10, 6, 14, 4}
- Node 2: {8, 6, 14, 4}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 6, 13}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 10, 2, 0, 1}
- Node 5: {9, 8, 4, 3}
- Node 6: {11, 7, 2, 3, 1}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 14}
- Node 8: {5, 12, 2, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 13, 0}
- Node 10: {1, 4}
- Node 11: {0, 13, 6}
- Node 12: {13, 8}
- Node 13: {9, 11, 12, 3, 0, 14}
- Node 14: {7, 2, 1, 13}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves {9, 11, 13}. <0, (9, 11, 13)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves {5, 10, 2}. <4, (5, 10, 2)>
- Node 4 also forms a 3-star with leaves {5, 0, 1}. <4, (5, 0, 1)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves {1, 2, 3}. <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with leaves {9, 11, 14}. <13, (9, 11, 14)>
  
There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars formed in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [5].
