Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {3, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 10}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {5, 7, 11}
- Node 11: {10, 12}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 4, 9, 14}
- Node 14: {6, 9, 12, 13}

Nodes with exactly 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 3
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 7
- Node 8
- Node 9
- Node 10
- Node 12
- Node 13
- Node 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 65
Thus, the final answer is [65].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 13, 2)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (2, 13, 4)>
<5, (10, 9, 12)>
<6, (14, 9, 13)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<14, (6, 9, 13)>
