Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 4) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 8) (2, 14) (2, 9) (2, 4) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 3) (11, 8) (5, 4) (19, 4) (19, 1) (1, 19) (1, 6) (1, 18) (1, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 8) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (12, 17) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 13) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 18) (15, 0) (15, 9) (9, 2) (9, 15) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 19) (13, 10) (13, 16) (13, 18) (18, 0) (18, 1) (18, 7) (18, 13) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {15, 18, 8}
- Node 1: {19, 6, 18, 7}
- Node 2: {14, 9, 4}
- Node 3: {11, 7}
- Node 4: {17, 2, 5, 19}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {1, 10, 16, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 1, 10, 18}
- Node 8: {17, 0, 11, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 15}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 13}
- Node 11: {3, 8}
- Node 12: {17, 16}
- Node 13: {10, 16, 18}
- Node 14: {17, 2}
- Node 15: {0, 9}
- Node 16: {17, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 17: {14, 16, 12, 8, 4}
- Node 18: {0, 1, 7, 13}
- Node 19: {4, 1}

Now, calculating the number of 3-stars:

- Node 4, 16, and 17 have 5, 4, and 5 neighbors respectively, forming a total of \( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 4 + 10 = 24 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, forming a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6, 7, 8, 13, and 18 have 4 neighbors each, forming a total of \( 5 \times \binom{4}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- The total number of 3-stars is \( 24 + 4 + 20 = 48 \), so the final answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (7, 16, 17)>, <4, (12, 16, 17)>, <4, (8, 16, 17)>, <4, (16, 17, 18)>, <4, (4, 17, 19)>, <1, (6, 7, 18)>, <6, (1, 7, 18)>, <7, (1, 6, 10)>, <8, (0, 6, 8)>, <8, (6, 10, 13)>
