Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 7, 8, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 6, 1, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 4, 8, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 0, 3, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 0, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 8, 2, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 8, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 7, 6, 3, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 4, 1, 0}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- For Node 0: No 3-stars can be formed as it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors.
- For Node 1: No 3-stars can be formed as it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors.
- For Node 2: No 3-stars can be formed as it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors.
- For Node 3: No 3-stars can be formed as it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors.
- For Node 4: No 3-stars can be formed as it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors.
- For Node 5: No 3-stars can be formed as it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors.
- For Node 6: No 3-stars can be formed as it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors.
- For Node 7: No 3-stars can be formed as it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors.
- For Node 8: Three 3-stars can be formed: <8, (9, 7, 6)>, <8, (9, 4, 3)>, <8, (9, 1, 7)>
- For Node 9: No 3-stars can be formed as it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
