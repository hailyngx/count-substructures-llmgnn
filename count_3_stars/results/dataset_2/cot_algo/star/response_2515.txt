Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 0) (21, 0) (21, 20) (21, 12) (2, 1) (2, 29) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 15) (29, 22) (15, 29) (15, 7) (15, 18) (27, 7) (27, 5) (27, 8) (22, 29) (22, 23) (22, 16) (23, 22) (23, 14) (23, 28) (8, 27) (8, 14) (4, 18) (4, 19) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 28) (18, 15) (18, 4) (18, 16) (5, 27) (5, 13) (5, 24) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 11) (20, 21) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 6) (7, 15) (7, 27) (7, 25) (25, 2) (25, 7) (25, 6) (19, 4) (19, 24) (3, 0) (28, 23) (28, 17) (28, 9) (28, 24) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 3) (16, 22) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 14) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 6) (26, 12) (14, 23) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 16) (6, 20) (6, 25) (6, 26) (6, 10) (10, 6) (11, 13) (11, 26) (11, 9) (12, 21) (12, 26) (12, 24) (24, 5) (24, 19) (24, 28) (24, 12) (9, 28) (9, 16) (9, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 21, 3
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 1, 29, 25
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 18, 19
- Node 5: 27, 13, 24, 14
- Node 6: 20, 25, 26, 10
- Node 7: 15, 27, 25
- Node 8: 27, 14
- Node 9: 28, 16, 11
- Node 10: 6
- Node 11: 13, 26, 9
- Node 12: 21, 26, 24
- Node 13: 5, 11
- Node 14: 23, 8, 5, 16
- Node 15: 29, 7, 18
- Node 16: 22, 18, 9, 14
- Node 17: 29, 20, 28
- Node 18: 15, 4, 16
- Node 19: 4, 24
- Node 20: 21, 17, 26, 6
- Node 21: 1, 0, 20, 12
- Node 22: 29, 23, 16
- Node 23: 22, 14, 28
- Node 24: 5, 19, 28, 12
- Node 25: 2, 7, 6
- Node 26: 20, 11, 12, 6
- Node 27: 7, 5, 8
- Node 28: 23, 17, 9, 24
- Node 29: 2, 15, 17, 22

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 2 (Node 16, Node 28)
Total 3-stars: \( \binom{2}{3} = 1 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found in the graph is <16, (18, 9, 14)>.
