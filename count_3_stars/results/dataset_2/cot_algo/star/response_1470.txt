Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 16) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 16) (4, 2) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 19) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 16) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 11) (19, 18) (19, 5) (7, 11) (7, 1) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 16) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 7) (0, 15) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 5) (12, 10) (12, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 15)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (Nodes 4, 6, 7, 16)
- Node 2: 1 neighbor (Node 4)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (Nodes 5, 15)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (Nodes 1, 2, 9, 16)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (Nodes 3, 13, 14, 19)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (Nodes 1, 9, 10, 13)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (Nodes 1, 11)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (Nodes 9, 16)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (Nodes 4, 6, 8, 10)
- Node 10: 4 neighbors (Nodes 6, 12, 13, 14)
- Node 11: 3 neighbors (Nodes 7, 13, 17)
- Node 12: 2 neighbors (Nodes 10, 17)
- Node 13: 4 neighbors (Nodes 5, 6, 10, 11)
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (Nodes 5, 10, 15)
- Node 15: 6 neighbors (Nodes 0, 3, 14, 16, 18, 19)
- Node 16: 4 neighbors (Nodes 1, 4, 8, 15)
- Node 17: 3 neighbors (Nodes 11, 12, 18)
- Node 18: 4 neighbors (Nodes 15, 17, 19)
- Node 19: 3 neighbors (Nodes 5, 15, 18)

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 12, so [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 4, 16>
<5, 13, 19>
<6, 9, 10>
<15, 0, 18>
<14, 5, 10>
<18, 17, 19>
<16, 1, 4>
<13, 5, 11>
<15, 14, 10>
<18, 15, 0>
<14, 15, 5>
<9, 6, 10>
