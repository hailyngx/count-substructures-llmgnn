Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graph is as follows:

- Node 0 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: <1, (3, 6, 7)>.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: <2, (4, 6, 7)>.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 7, 0)>.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: <4, (3, 5, 8)>.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: <5, (4, 6, 8)>.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: <6, (1, 5, 8)>.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: <7, (1, 3, 6)>.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 9, 8)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: <9, (5, 7, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].
