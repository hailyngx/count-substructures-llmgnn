Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 13) (26, 9) (26, 21) (26, 4) (26, 17) (15, 2) (15, 11) (27, 3) (27, 17) (27, 1) (14, 6) (14, 25) (17, 26) (17, 27) (17, 12) (3, 27) (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 10) (3, 29) (25, 14) (25, 3) (25, 8) (22, 9) (22, 23) (22, 5) (23, 22) (23, 21) (23, 28) (23, 19) (20, 2) (20, 28) (21, 26) (21, 3) (21, 23) (21, 16) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 29) (0, 1) (16, 21) (16, 0) (1, 27) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (8, 25) (8, 6) (8, 11) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 7) (19, 23) (19, 4) (4, 26) (4, 0) (4, 19) (10, 3) (10, 18) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 24) (24, 7) (28, 23) (28, 20) (28, 13) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 29) (12, 11) (18, 10) (5, 22) (5, 1) (5, 11) (29, 3) (29, 0) (29, 12) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 5) (13, 9) (13, 28) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 16, 29
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 7, 27
- Node 2: 7, 15, 20
- Node 3: 10, 17, 21, 25, 27, 29
- Node 4: 0, 19, 26
- Node 5: 1, 11, 22
- Node 6: 1, 8, 12, 14
- Node 7: 1, 2, 24
- Node 8: 6, 11, 25
- Node 9: 13, 22, 26
- Node 10: 3, 18
- Node 11: 5, 8, 12, 15
- Node 12: 6, 11, 17, 29
- Node 13: 9, 28
- Node 14: 6, 25
- Node 15: 2, 11
- Node 16: 0, 21
- Node 17: 3, 12, 26, 27
- Node 18: 10
- Node 19: 4, 23
- Node 20: 2, 28
- Node 21: 3, 16, 23, 26
- Node 22: 5, 9, 23
- Node 23: 19, 21, 22, 28
- Node 24: 7
- Node 25: 3, 8, 14
- Node 26: 4, 9,17, 21
- Node 27: 1, 3, 17
- Node 28: 13, 20, 23
- Node 29: 0, 3, 12

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 13, 19, 24
- Total number of 3-stars = 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 16, 29)>
- <2, (7, 15, 20)>
- <5, (1, 11, 22)>
- <13, (9, 28)>
- <19, (4, 23, 26)>
- <24, (7)>
