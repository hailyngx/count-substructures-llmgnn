Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 18) (20, 22) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 6) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (17, 10) (17, 22) (2, 1) (2, 24) (2, 28) (2, 0) (18, 20) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 8) (19, 13) (26, 5) (26, 6) (26, 12) (26, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 23) (7, 0) (7, 29) (7, 24) (7, 28) (3, 16) (3, 8) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 27) (4, 26) (4, 24) (4, 14) (22, 20) (22, 17) (22, 6) (5, 25) (5, 11) (5, 26) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 13) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 25) (6, 26) (6, 22) (6, 1) (6, 12) (29, 7) (28, 2) (28, 0) (28, 7) (8, 15) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 27) (24, 2) (24, 7) (24, 4) (24, 8) (24, 27) (9, 10) (9, 23) (9, 12) (27, 16) (27, 8) (27, 24) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 16) (13, 14) (12, 26) (12, 6) (12, 9) (23, 0) (23, 9) 

Response:
The given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges forms a 3-star graph. 

Here are the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:
- Node 0: {2, 7, 23, 28}
- Node 1: {2, 6}
- Node 3: {8, 16}
- Node 4: {14, 24, 26}
- Node 5: {11, 25, 26}
- Node 6: {1, 12, 22, 25}
- Node 8: {3, 15, 24, 27}
- Node 9: {10, 12, 23}
- Node 10: {9, 11, 15, 17}
- Node 11: {5, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {6, 9, 26}
- Node 13: {11, 14, 16, 19}
- Node 14: {4, 11, 13}
- Node 15: {10, 20, 8}
- Node 16: {3, 13, 27}
- Node 17: {10, 22}
- Node 18: {20}
- Node 19: {13}
- Node 20: {15, 18, 22, 25}
- Node 22: {17, 20, 6}
- Node 23: {0, 9}
- Node 24: {2, 4, 7, 8, 27}
- Node 25: {20, 5, 6}
- Node 26: {4, 5, 6, 12}
- Node 27: {8, 24, 16}
- Node 28: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 29: {7}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 15: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 16: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 20: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 24: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 25: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 26: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 27: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Total number of 3-stars: 41
