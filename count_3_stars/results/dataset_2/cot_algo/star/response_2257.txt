Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 8) (15, 25) (15, 17) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 14) (21, 23) (28, 12) (28, 18) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 19) (22, 14) (22, 7) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 4) (9, 22) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 27) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 24) (4, 26) (4, 27) (27, 1) (27, 4) (27, 25) (8, 15) (8, 10) (25, 15) (25, 17) (25, 27) (25, 19) (25, 29) (19, 22) (19, 25) (19, 14) (19, 12) (10, 26) (10, 8) (12, 28) (12, 19) (12, 13) (12, 6) (16, 24) (16, 6) (24, 17) (24, 16) (24, 18) (24, 29) (2, 23) (14, 20) (14, 22) (14, 19) (14, 23) (7, 20) (7, 22) (7, 1) (0, 11) (0, 29) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 11) (18, 28) (18, 24) (18, 6) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 18) (23, 21) (23, 2) (23, 14) (23, 29) (11, 26) (11, 0) (11, 13) (3, 5) (3, 29) (29, 25) (29, 24) (29, 0) (29, 23) (29, 3) (5, 3) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 11, 29
- Node 1: 7, 13, 17, 27
- Node 2: 23
- Node 3: 5, 29
- Node 4: 26, 27
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 12, 16, 18
- Node 7: 1, 14, 20, 22
- Node 8: 10, 15
- Node 9: 22
- Node 10: 8, 26
- Node 11: 0, 13, 26
- Node 12: 6, 13, 19, 28
- Node 13: 1, 11, 12
- Node 14: 7, 19, 20, 23
- Node 15: 8, 17, 20, 25
- Node 16: 6, 24
- Node 17: 1, 15, 24, 25
- Node 18: 6, 24, 28
- Node 19: 12, 14, 22, 25
- Node 20: 7, 14, 15
- Node 21: 23
- Node 22: 7, 9, 14, 19, 26
- Node 23: 2, 14, 21, 29
- Node 24: 16, 17, 18, 29
- Node 25: 15, 17, 19, 27, 29
- Node 26: 4, 10, 11, 22
- Node 27: 1, 4, 25
- Node 28: 12, 18
- Node 29: 3, 5, 23, 24, 25

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 14, 15, 17, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29

Calculating the number of 3-star configurations for each eligible node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 64

Therefore, the final answer is [64] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 13, 27>
- <14, 19, 22>
- <14, 19, 25>
- <14, 22, 23>
- <15, 17, 25>
- <17, 24, 25>
- <19, 22, 25>
- <19, 24, 29>
- <22, 25, 29>
- <23, 24, 29>
