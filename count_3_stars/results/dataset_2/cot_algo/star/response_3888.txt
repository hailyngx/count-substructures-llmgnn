The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 21) (16, 4) (16, 20) (3, 10) (3, 2) (15, 10) (15, 29) (15, 17) (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 2) (6, 23) (9, 6) (9, 13) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 29) (4, 16) (4, 24) (8, 1) (28, 29) (28, 12) (28, 14) (28, 20) (29, 15) (29, 10) (29, 28) (29, 24) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 27) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 21) (21, 16) (21, 18) (24, 4) (24, 29) (24, 27) (26, 20) (26, 17) (23, 11) (23, 6) (23, 18) (23, 14) (23, 19) (12, 11) (12, 28) (12, 2) (12, 14) (20, 16) (20, 28) (20, 26) (19, 23) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 13) (22, 6) (22, 0) (22, 7) (27, 2) (27, 24) (27, 1) (7, 19) (7, 22) (7, 17) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 27) (5, 11) (5, 0) (0, 22) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 28) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 19) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 0) (17, 15) (17, 26) (17, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, and 29.

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) unique 3-star
<1, (8, 10, 27)>

Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) unique 3-stars
<2, (6, 12, 18)>, <2, (6, 12, 27)>, <2, (6, 18, 23)>, <2, (12, 18, 27)>, <2, (12, 18, 23)>, <2, (12, 27, 28)>, <2, (12, 27, 1)>, <2, (18, 23, 21)>, <2, (18, 21, 16)>, <2, (27, 28, 1)>

Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars
<6, (9, 23, 2)>, <6, (22, 23, 18)>, <6, (2, 23, 12)>, <6, (2, 23, 27)>

Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars
<10, (3, 15, 29)>, <10, (3, 29, 10)>, <10, (15, 29, 24)>, <10, (29, 24, 27)>

Node 11: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) unique 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars
<12, (28, 14, 2)>, <12, (28, 14, 19)>, <12, (14, 19, 23)>, <12, (14, 19, 28)>

Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) unique 3-star
<13, (9, 19, 0)>

Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars
<14, (28, 19, 12)>, <14, (28, 19, 23)>, <14, (19, 23, 7)>, <14, (19, 23, 28)>

Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) unique 3-star
<15, (10, 29, 17)>

Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) unique 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) unique 3-star
<17, (15, 26, 7)>

Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) unique 3-star
<18, (2, 21, 16)>

Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars
<19, (23, 7, 13)>, <19, (23, 7, 14)>, <19, (23, 13, 0)>, <19, (7, 14, 28)>

Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) unique 3-star
<20, (16, 28, 26)>

Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) unique 3-star
<22, (6, 7, 0)>

Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars
<23, (6, 18, 2)>, <23, (18, 21, 16)>, <23, (18, 21, 19)>, <23, (18, 21, 14)>

Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) unique 3-star
<24, (4, 29, 27)>

Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) unique 3-star
<27, (2, 1, 24)>

Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars
<28, (29, 14, 20)>, <28, (29, 14, 19)>, <28, (14, 19, 12)>, <28, (14, 19, 23)>

Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars
<29, (15, 24, 10)>, <29, (15, 24, 27)>, <29, (24, 27, 28)>, <29, (24, 27, 10)>

Summing up the total number of unique 3-stars gives us: 
1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 36 

Therefore, the final answer is [36].
