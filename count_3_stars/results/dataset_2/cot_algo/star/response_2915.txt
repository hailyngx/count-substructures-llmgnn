Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 24) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (15, 8) (15, 13) (5, 3) (5, 21) (6, 3) (6, 20) (6, 27) (8, 15) (8, 23) (8, 22) (23, 8) (23, 29) (23, 24) (12, 27) (12, 16) (12, 20) (12, 21) (27, 6) (27, 12) (27, 22) (27, 14) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 0) (26, 29) (26, 21) (4, 18) (4, 25) (4, 29) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 11) (18, 16) (21, 5) (21, 12) (21, 26) (21, 0) (28, 2) (17, 13) (17, 7) (20, 6) (20, 12) (20, 14) (7, 17) (25, 4) (25, 19) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 24) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 16) (0, 22) (0, 19) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 0) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 29) (14, 27) (14, 18) (14, 20) (14, 11) (19, 1) (19, 25) (19, 0) (19, 10) (2, 28) (29, 23) (29, 26) (29, 4) (29, 11) (22, 8) (22, 27) (22, 0) (24, 3) (24, 23) (24, 13) (24, 10) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 24) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 19, 21, 22}
- Node 1: {0, 10, 19}
- Node 2: {28}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 10, 24}
- Node 4: {18, 25, 29}
- Node 5: {3, 21}
- Node 6: {3, 20, 27}
- Node 7: {17}
- Node 8: {15, 22, 23}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 19, 24}
- Node 11: {13, 14, 18, 29}
- Node 12: {16, 20, 21, 27}
- Node 13: {11, 15, 17, 24}
- Node 14: {11, 18, 20, 27}
- Node 15: {8, 13}
- Node 16: {0, 12, 18}
- Node 17: {7, 13}
- Node 18: {4, 11, 14, 16}
- Node 19: {0, 1, 10, 25}
- Node 20: {6, 12, 14}
- Node 21: {0, 5, 12, 26}
- Node 22: {0, 8, 27}
- Node 23: {8, 24, 29}
- Node 24: {3, 10, 13, 23}
- Node 25: {4, 19}
- Node 26: {21, 29}
- Node 27: {6, 12, 14, 22}
- Node 28: {2}
- Node 29: {4, 11, 26, 23}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 0: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]
- Node 3: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]
- Node 10: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]
- Node 11: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]
- Node 12: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]
- Node 13: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]
- Node 14: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]
- Node 18: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]
- Node 19: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]
- Node 21: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]
- Node 22: [\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]]
- Node 24: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]
- Node 27: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]
- Node 29: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]

Total number of unique 3-stars: [52]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 1, 19, 21>, <3, 5, 6, 10>, <4, 11, 18, 29>, <8, 13, 15, 23>, <12, 14, 16, 20>, <0, 19, 21, 25>, <3, 10, 13, 24>, <18, 16, 0, 12>, <5, 12, 21, 26>, <8, 22, 23, 27>, <11, 14, 18, 27>, <0, 1, 10, 19>, <3, 10, 13, 24>, <5, 21, 21, 26>, <8, 13, 23, 2...
