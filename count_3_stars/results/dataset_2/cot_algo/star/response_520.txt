Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 20) (3, 27) (15, 14) (15, 24) (0, 27) (0, 16) (0, 29) (0, 19) (27, 3) (27, 0) (27, 8) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 7) (2, 18) (2, 22) (2, 13) (29, 0) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 18) (18, 2) (18, 29) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 17) (26, 28) (26, 20) (28, 26) (28, 19) (28, 24) (5, 10) (5, 16) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 17) (6, 10) (21, 8) (21, 14) (21, 4) (8, 27) (8, 21) (8, 9) (8, 7) (9, 18) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 4) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 23) (17, 4) (14, 15) (14, 21) (14, 11) (16, 0) (16, 29) (16, 5) (22, 2) (22, 12) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 20) (7, 1) (7, 29) (7, 8) (23, 17) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 10) (20, 3) (20, 26) (20, 11) (4, 21) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 25) (12, 1) (12, 22) (19, 0) (19, 28) (19, 25) (24, 15) (24, 28) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 13, and 7.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 18, 22, and 13.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 21, 9, and 17.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 27, 21, and 9.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 18, 8, and 25.
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 5, 6, and 25.
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 18, 20, and 4.
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 15, 21, and 11.
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 14, 24, and 15.
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 29, and 5.
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 18, 13, and 23.
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 2, 29, and 11.
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 28, and 25.
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 26, and 11.
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 8, 14, and 4.
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 2, 12, and 22.
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 15, 28, and 24.
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 9, 19, and 10.
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 0, and 8.
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 26, 19, and 24.
- Node 29 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 7, and 16.

There are a total of 21 unique 3-stars, so the final answer is [21].
