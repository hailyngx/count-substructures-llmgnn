Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. 

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}

Now, we apply the combinatorial calculation to each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 34 3-stars, which we represent as [34].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 9, 4>
- <0, 9, 7>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <4, 9, 7>
