Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 9) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: {2, 5, 8, 9, 11, 13}
Node 1: {6, 7, 8}
Node 2: {0, 5, 8, 12}
Node 3: {12, 14}
Node 4: {5, 6, 7}
Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 12, 13}
Node 6: {1, 4, 9, 10, 13}
Node 7: {1, 4, 10, 11, 14}
Node 8: {0, 1, 2}
Node 9: {0, 6, 14}
Node 10: {6, 7, 14}
Node 11: {0, 7}
Node 12: {2, 3, 5, 13}
Node 13: {0, 5, 6, 12, 14}
Node 14: {3, 7, 9, 10, 13}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 78

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [78], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 13)>, 
<2, (0, 5, 12)>, 
<5, (0, 2, 13)>, 
<6, (1, 10, 13)>, 
<7, (1, 4, 14)>, 
<12, (2, 5, 13)>, 
<13, (0, 5, 14)>, 
<14, (3, 7, 10)>
