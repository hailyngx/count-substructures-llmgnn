Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 2) (5, 19) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 19) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 18) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 16) (14, 13) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 16) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 17) (12, 7) (12, 9) (13, 14) (13, 11) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 11) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 11) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 14) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 2) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 8) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 19) (11, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 18}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 10}
- Node 2: {3, 8, 16}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 17}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 16}
- Node 5: {19}
- Node 6: {11, 14, 19}
- Node 7: {4, 10, 12, 17, 18}
- Node 8: {2, 9, 10, 17}
- Node 9: {4, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 11: {6, 9, 13, 19}
- Node 12: {7, 9}
- Node 13: {11, 14}
- Node 14: {6, 13, 16, 18}
- Node 16: {2, 4, 14}
- Node 17: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 18: {0, 7, 14}
- Node 19: {5, 6, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 4: In-degree = 2, so it can form 1 3-star
- Node 7: In-degree = 5, so it can form 10 3-stars
- Node 14: In-degree = 3, so it can form 1 3-star
- Node 16: In-degree = 3, so it can form 1 3-star
- Node 9: In-degree = 4, so it can form 4 3-stars
- Node 11: In-degree = 4, so it can form 4 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [21].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, 7, 17>
- <7, 4, 9>
- <7, 4, 16>
- <7, 17, 3>
- <7, 18, 0>
- <7, 17, 8>
- <7, 10, 1>
- <7, 12, 9>
- <7, 18, 14>
- <7, 18, 0>
- <7, 18, 14>
- <7, 18, 14>
- <14, 6, 11>
- <14, 6, 19>
- <14, 13, 11>
- <14, 16, 2>
- <16, 4, 14>
- <9, 4, 16>
- <9, 12, 7>
- <9, 8, 17>
- <9, 11, 6>
