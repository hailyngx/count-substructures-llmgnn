Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {4, 7, 8, 1, 2}
Node 1: {5, 6, 2, 0, 7}
Node 2: {4, 8, 1, 0, 6}
Node 3: {4, 8, 7, 5}
Node 4: {8, 0, 6, 3, 2}
Node 5: {6, 1, 3, 7, 0}
Node 6: {5, 4, 1, 7}
Node 7: {5, 6, 0, 3, 1}
Node 8: {4, 2, 0, 3}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 60 in total. So, the final answer is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 8, 2)>
<0, (4, 2, 1)>
<0, (4, 1, 7)>
<0, (7, 1, 5)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<1, (6, 7, 5)>
<2, (4, 8, 3)>
<2, (4, 6, 1)>
<4, (8, 6, 5)>
<4, (8, 6, 7)>
<4, (8, 3, 5)>
<4, (6, 1, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 5)>
<5, (6, 7, 1)>
<7, (5, 6, 3)>
