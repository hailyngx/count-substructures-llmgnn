Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 26) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 24) (15, 21) (0, 27) (0, 29) (0, 18) (0, 5) (27, 0) (27, 18) (9, 1) (9, 24) (9, 23) (1, 9) (1, 21) (1, 16) (1, 19) (21, 15) (21, 1) (21, 14) (28, 13) (28, 23) (29, 0) (29, 13) (29, 10) (24, 15) (24, 9) (24, 26) (24, 17) (26, 3) (26, 24) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 17) (5, 0) (5, 19) (19, 1) (19, 5) (11, 26) (23, 9) (23, 28) (23, 7) (4, 12) (4, 25) (4, 20) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 22) (22, 3) (22, 12) (10, 29) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 16) (2, 12) (14, 3) (14, 21) (14, 25) (8, 25) (8, 16) (7, 23) (7, 20) (20, 3) (20, 4) (20, 7) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 13) (18, 0) (18, 27) (18, 12) (18, 10) (18, 25) (13, 28) (13, 29) (13, 16) (17, 24) (17, 26) (17, 12) (25, 4) (25, 14) (25, 8) (25, 18) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {27, 29, 18, 5}
Node 1 neighbors: {9, 21, 16, 19}
Node 2 neighbors: {12}
Node 3 neighbors: {15, 14, 20, 26, 22}
Node 4 neighbors: {12, 25, 20}
Node 5 neighbors: {0, 19}
Node 7 neighbors: {23, 20}
Node 8 neighbors: {25, 16}
Node 9 neighbors: {1, 24, 23}
Node 10 neighbors: {29, 26, 18, 16}
Node 11 neighbors: {26}
Node 12 neighbors: {4, 2, 17, 18, 22}
Node 13 neighbors: {28, 29, 16}
Node 14 neighbors: {3, 21, 25}
Node 15 neighbors: {3, 24, 21}
Node 16 neighbors: {1, 10, 8, 13}
Node 17 neighbors: {24, 26, 12}
Node 18 neighbors: {0, 27, 12, 10, 25}
Node 19 neighbors: {1, 5}
Node 20 neighbors: {3, 4, 7}
Node 21 neighbors: {15, 1, 14}
Node 22 neighbors: {3, 12}
Node 23 neighbors: {9, 28, 7}
Node 24 neighbors: {15, 9, 26, 17}
Node 25 neighbors: {4, 14, 8, 18}
Node 26 neighbors: {3, 24, 10, 11, 17}
Node 27 neighbors: {0, 18}
Node 28 neighbors: {13, 23}
Node 29 neighbors: {0, 13, 10}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = [10] 3-stars.
Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = [10] 3-stars.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars.
Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = [10] 3-stars.
Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars.
Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = [10] 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [58]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (18, 25, 29)>
<1, (9, 13, 16)>
<3, (15, 24, 26)>
<12, (4, 17, 18)>
<15, (3, 21, 24)>
<16, (8, 10, 13)>
<18, (10, 25, 27)>
<21, (14, 15, 21)>
<24, (9, 17, 26)>
<26, (10, 11, 17)>
