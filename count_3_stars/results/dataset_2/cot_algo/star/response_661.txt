Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 0) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 19) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 7) (7, 17) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 15) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (18, 6) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 0) (15, 9) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 14) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 19) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 8) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (3, 10) (14, 4) (14, 15) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (5, 17) (5, 12) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 9, 13, 16}
- Node 1: {0, 11, 15}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 3: {10}
- Node 4: {2, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {12, 17}
- Node 6: {2, 9, 13, 18}
- Node 7: {8, 17}
- Node 8: {7, 17, 19}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 6, 15, 19}
- Node 10: {3, 16, 17, 19}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 12}
- Node 12: {5, 11, 15}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 14: {4, 15}
- Node 15: {1, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 16: {0, 10}
- Node 17: {5, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 18: {6}
- Node 19: {8, 9, 10}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: There are exactly 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: There are exactly 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 6: There are more than 3 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: There are exactly 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 12: There are exactly 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 15: There are more than 3 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: There are more than 3 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 15>
- <2, 4, 13>
- <6, 9, 15>
- <9, 15, 19>
- <10, 17, 19>
- <11, 1, 12>
- <12, 5, 17>
- <17, 7, 8>
- <19, 8, 9>
