Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 9) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 5) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 1) (4, 18) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (5, 10) (5, 11) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 13) (16, 17) (16, 7) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 15) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 19) (1, 18) (1, 0) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 13) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 19) (19, 14) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 3) (3, 9) (3, 19) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 18}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 10, 12, 18}
- Node 3: neighbors {9, 19}
- Node 4: neighbors {8, 18}
- Node 5: neighbors {10, 11}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 8, 12}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 13, 15, 16}
- Node 8: neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 17, 19}
- Node 10: neighbors {2, 5, 11}
- Node 11: neighbors {5, 10}
- Node 12: neighbors {2, 6, 15, 17}
- Node 13: neighbors {7, 14, 15, 19}
- Node 14: neighbors {13, 19}
- Node 15: neighbors {1, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 16: neighbors {7, 17}
- Node 17: neighbors {9, 12, 16}
- Node 18: neighbors {1, 2, 4, 15}
- Node 19: neighbors {3, 9, 13, 14}

Now, let's identify which nodes form 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors (3-stars): 0, 2, 7, 12, 13, 15, 19
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors (calculate number of 3-stars formed):
    - Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 7 (1 each for nodes with 3 neighbors, 4 for nodes with more than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [7].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <2, 10, 18>
- <7, 13, 15>
- <12, 2, 17>
- <13, 7, 19>
