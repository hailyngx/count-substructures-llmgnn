Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 5) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 19) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 18) (11, 8) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 5) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 7) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 17) (4, 10) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (18, 11) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 6) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 17) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 2) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 7) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 5) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 17) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 7) (13, 18) (13, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors [14, 17]
2. Node 1: Neighbors [3, 14, 19]
3. Node 2: Neighbors [9, 10, 17]
4. Node 3: Neighbors [1, 5]
5. Node 4: Neighbors [10, 12]
6. Node 5: Neighbors [3, 7, 14]
7. Node 6: Neighbors [7, 15, 19]
8. Node 7: Neighbors [5, 6, 8, 13, 15]
9. Node 8: Neighbors [7, 9, 11]
10. Node 9: Neighbors [2, 8, 15, 17]
11. Node 10: Neighbors [2, 4]
12. Node 11: Neighbors [8, 18]
13. Node 12: Neighbors [4, 16, 18]
14. Node 13: Neighbors [7, 18]
15. Node 15: Neighbors [6, 7, 9]
16. Node 16: Neighbors [12, 17, 19]
17. Node 17: Neighbors [0, 2, 9, 16]
18. Node 18: Neighbors [11, 12, 13, 19]
19. Node 19: Neighbors [1, 6, 16, 18]

Now, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: <1, (3, 5)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: <6, (7, 15, 19)>, <6, (7, 19, 15)>
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: <7, (5, 6, 13)>, <7, (6, 13, 15)>, <7, (5, 6, 15)>, <7, (6, 15, 19)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: <8, (7, 9, 15)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: <9, (2, 17, 9)>, <9, (2, 16, 9)>, <9, (17, 16, 9)>
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: <12, (4, 18, 16)>
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors: <13, (7, 18)>
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors: <14, (1, 5)>
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: <15, (6, 7, 19)>
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: <16, (12, 17, 19)>
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: <17, (0, 2, 16)>, <17, (2, 16, 9)>

Total 3-stars formed: 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
