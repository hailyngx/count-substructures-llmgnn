Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 26) (3, 18) (15, 10) (15, 22) (15, 28) (15, 2) (1, 21) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 9) (21, 29) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 26) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 16) (25, 27) (25, 6) (6, 25) (6, 9) (6, 14) (9, 21) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 24) (28, 15) (28, 11) (28, 13) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 24) (8, 22) (0, 17) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 23) (11, 28) (11, 14) (17, 20) (17, 0) (17, 13) (13, 28) (13, 17) (26, 3) (26, 7) (26, 20) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 4) (27, 25) (27, 10) (16, 7) (16, 20) (18, 3) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 23) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 12) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 23) (5, 0) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 23) (24, 29) (29, 21) (29, 24) (29, 22) (23, 14) (23, 19) (23, 12) (23, 24) (22, 15) (22, 8) (22, 29) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {17, 5}
- Node 1: {21, 12}
- Node 2: {15, 20, 9, 8}
- Node 3: {26, 18}
- Node 4: {10, 19, 12}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {25, 9, 14}
- Node 7: {21, 16, 26}
- Node 8: {2, 24, 22}
- Node 9: {21, 6, 2, 24}
- Node 10: {15, 18, 27, 4}
- Node 11: {28, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 18, 4, 23}
- Node 13: {28, 17}
- Node 14: {6, 11, 23}
- Node 15: {10, 22, 28, 2}
- Node 16: {7, 20}
- Node 17: {20, 0, 13}
- Node 18: {3, 10, 19, 12}
- Node 19: {18, 4, 23}
- Node 20: {17, 2, 26, 16}
- Node 21: {1, 7, 9, 29}
- Node 22: {15, 8, 29}
- Node 23: {14, 19, 12, 24}
- Node 24: {8, 9, 23, 29}
- Node 25: {6, 27}
- Node 26: {3, 7, 20, 26}
- Node 27: {25, 10}
- Node 28: {15, 11, 13, 28}
- Node 29: {21, 24, 22}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2, 9, 15, 21, and 24 each have 4 neighbors, so they each contribute \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 10 and 18 each have 4 neighbors, so they each contribute \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <2, (9, 15, 21)>
- <9, (2, 21, 24)>
- <15, (2, 22, 28)>
- <21, (2, 9, 29)>
- <24, (9, 23, 29)>
- <10, (18, 27, 4)>
- <18, (10, 19, 12)>
- <19, (4, 23, 12)>
