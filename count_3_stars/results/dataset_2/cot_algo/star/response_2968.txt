Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 21) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 0) (3, 25) (3, 6) (25, 3) (25, 13) (10, 17) (10, 15) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 23) (17, 22) (17, 2) (4, 24) (4, 26) (18, 26) (18, 7) (18, 1) (21, 5) (21, 11) (24, 4) (24, 19) (2, 17) (2, 27) (2, 6) (2, 28) (8, 20) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 22) (26, 4) (26, 18) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 29) (28, 2) (28, 26) (28, 14) (13, 5) (13, 25) (15, 10) (15, 23) (15, 7) (14, 26) (14, 28) (14, 20) (12, 1) (12, 23) (16, 20) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 27) (7, 18) (7, 15) (7, 27) (20, 5) (20, 8) (20, 14) (20, 16) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 29) (23, 17) (23, 15) (23, 12) (19, 24) (19, 29) (29, 26) (29, 0) (29, 19) (29, 22) (1, 18) (1, 12) (11, 21) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 22) (22, 17) (22, 8) (22, 29) (22, 11) (27, 2) (27, 6) (27, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 9, 8, 29, 11
Node 1: 18, 12
Node 2: 17, 27, 6, 28
Node 3: 25, 6
Node 4: 24, 26
Node 5: 9, 13, 21, 20
Node 6: 3, 17, 2, 27
Node 7: 18, 15, 27
Node 8: 20, 11, 0, 22
Node 9: 5, 0
Node 10: 17, 15
Node 11: 21, 8, 0, 22
Node 12: 1, 23
Node 13: 5, 25
Node 14: 26, 28, 20
Node 15: 10, 17, 7, 23
Node 16: 20
Node 17: 2, 10, 6, 23, 22
Node 18: 26, 7, 1
Node 19: 24, 29
Node 20: 5, 8, 14, 16
Node 21: 5, 11
Node 22: 17, 29, 11, 8
Node 23: 17, 15, 12
Node 24: 4, 19
Node 25: 3, 13
Node 26: 4, 18, 28, 14, 29
Node 27: 2, 6, 7
Node 28: 2, 26, 14
Node 29: 0, 19, 26, 22

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 5, 9, 13, 21, 24, 26
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 8, 17, 22, 29
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 20

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

For nodes with 3 neighbors: 6 * 1 = 6 3-stars
For nodes with 4 neighbors: 4 * 4 = 16 3-stars
For nodes with 5 neighbors: 1 * 10 = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 6 + 16 + 10 = 32

Therefore, the final answer is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, 9, 13>, <5, 9, 21>, <5, 9, 20>, <5, 13, 25>, <5, 9, 20>, <5, 20, 16>, <9, 0, 8>, <9, 0, 29>, <13, 25, 3>, <21, 11, 8>, <24, 4, 26>, <26, 18, 7>, <26, 28, 2>, <26, 14, 29>, <8, 11, 0>, <17, 6, 2>, <17, 23, 15>, <17, 22, 29>, <20, 14, 16>, <0, 29, 19>.
