Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: Neighbors {5, 20, 21} => Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1 => <0, (5, 20, 21)>
Node 2: Neighbors {3} => No 3-stars
Node 3: Neighbors {2, 6, 16} => Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1 => <3, (2, 6, 16)>
Node 4: Neighbors {5, 22, 23} => Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1 => <4, (5, 22, 23)>
Node 6: Neighbors {3, 8, 24} => Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1 => <6, (3, 8, 24)>
Node 7: Neighbors {1, 9, 29} => Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1 => <7, (1, 9, 29)>
Node 8: Neighbors {6, 18, 21, 28} => Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4 => <8, (6, 18, 21)>, <8, (6, 18, 28)>, <8, (21, 18, 28)>, <8, (21, 28, 18)>
Node 9: Neighbors {5, 7, 22} => Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1 => <9, (5, 7, 22)>
Node 10: Neighbors {1, 13, 23} => Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1 => <10, (1, 13, 23)>
Node 13: Neighbors {10, 14, 18, 21} => Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4 => <13, (10, 14, 18)>, <13, (10, 18, 21)>, <13, (10, 14, 21)>, <13, (14, 18, 21)>
Node 16: Neighbors {3, 12, 23} => Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1 => <16, (3, 12, 23)>
Node 17: Neighbors {20, 23, 24} => Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1 => <17, (20, 23, 24)>
Node 18: Neighbors {8, 13, 20} => Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1 => <18, (8, 13, 20)>
Node 20: Neighbors {0, 17, 24, 28} => Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4 => <20, (0, 17, 24)>, <20, (0, 17, 28)>, <20, (0, 24, 28)>, <20, (17, 24, 28)>
Node 21: Neighbors {0, 8, 13} => Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1 => <21, (0, 8, 13)>
Node 22: Neighbors {5, 9, 28} => Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1 => <22, (5, 9, 28)>
Node 23: Neighbors {4, 10, 16, 17} => Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4 => <23, (4, 10, 16)>, <23, (4, 10, 17)>, <23, (10, 16, 17)>, <23, (16, 17, 4)>
Node 24: Neighbors {6, 17, 20} => Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1 => <24, (6, 17, 20)>
Node 28: Neighbors {8, 20, 22} => Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1 => <28, (8, 20, 22)>
Node 29: Neighbors {7, 14} => No 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].
