Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 12) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 7) (2, 3) (18, 16) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 5) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 16) (5, 7) (5, 3) (19, 17) (19, 9) (10, 14) (10, 15) (10, 0) (15, 12) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 11) (15, 16) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 9) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 9) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (11, 15) (11, 13) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 16) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (13, 14) (13, 11) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can first construct the neighborhood sets for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 10, 15}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 9, 16}
- Node 5: {3, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 8, 17}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 17}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 14, 16, 19}
- Node 10: {0, 14, 15}
- Node 11: {13, 15}
- Node 12: {1, 14, 15}
- Node 13: {11, 14}
- Node 14: {9, 10, 13}
- Node 15: {0, 10, 11, 12, 16}
- Node 16: {4, 9, 15, 18}
- Node 17: {6, 7, 19}
- Node 18: {16}
- Node 19: {9, 17}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-star configurations:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{2}{2} = 1
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 10: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 15: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 16: inom{4}{3} = 4

When we sum these up, we get a total of 37 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [37].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 9, 10>, 
<1, 4, 8>, 
<1, 4, 12>, 
<1, 6, 8>, 
<1, 6, 12>, 
<3, 2, 5>, 
<6, 7, 17>, 
<9, 14, 19>, 
<11, 13, 15>, 
<15, 16, 18>.
