Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 18) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 15) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 1) (2, 0) (2, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 18) (17, 1) (17, 11) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 15) (16, 12) (16, 9) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 2) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 15) (4, 19) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 11) (15, 6) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 15, 1}
- Node 1: {5, 0, 17, 10, 18}
- Node 2: {0, 11}
- Node 3: {13, 5, 14, 10}
- Node 4: {19}
- Node 5: {19, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {7, 15}
- Node 7: {8, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {14, 7, 18}
- Node 9: {13, 16, 11}
- Node 10: {1, 3}
- Node 11: {2, 17, 19, 9}
- Node 12: {16, 18, 15}
- Node 13: {3, 9, 14}
- Node 14: {8, 13, 3, 15}
- Node 15: {6, 0, 12, 14}
- Node 16: {12, 9}
- Node 17: {1, 11}
- Node 18: {8, 1, 12}
- Node 19: {5, 11, 4}

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 5, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 19 have three or more neighbors.

For these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they can form using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

The total number of 3-stars is: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 32.

Therefore, the final answer is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 15, 2)>
<1, (0, 18, 8)>
<1, (0, 18, 12)>
<1, (0, 18, 15)>
<1, (0, 5, 17)>
<1, (10, 3, 13)>
<1, (10, 3, 14)>
<1, (10, 9, 11)>
<3, (10, 13, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 19)>
<5, (3, 13, 9)>
<5, (3, 14, 15)>
<5, (3, 14, 8)>
<7, (6, 15, 0)>
<8, (14, 15, 6)>
<9, (11, 19, 4)>
<11, (17, 1, 18)>
<12, (16, 18, 8)>
<13, (3, 14, 8)>
<14, (3, 15, 6)>
<15, (14, 3, 10)>
<19, (11, 4, 5)>
