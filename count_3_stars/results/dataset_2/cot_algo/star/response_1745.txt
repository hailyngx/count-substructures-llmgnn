Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 25) (15, 29) (15, 24) (27, 10) (27, 20) (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 10) (7, 21) (7, 16) (21, 7) (21, 0) (21, 19) (21, 29) (20, 27) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 19) (20, 28) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 0) (25, 2) (2, 25) (2, 1) (2, 13) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 17) (4, 13) (4, 23) (8, 20) (8, 11) (6, 5) (6, 24) (6, 23) (6, 0) (19, 21) (19, 20) (19, 26) (26, 18) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 11) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 26) (28, 20) (28, 17) (28, 12) (16, 7) (16, 17) (24, 15) (24, 6) (24, 12) (22, 14) (22, 1) (3, 23) (1, 2) (1, 22) (1, 29) (1, 10) (29, 15) (29, 21) (29, 1) (29, 12) (14, 18) (14, 22) (17, 18) (17, 28) (17, 16) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 6) (23, 3) (0, 21) (0, 25) (0, 6) (10, 27) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 12) (12, 28) (12, 24) (12, 29) (12, 10) (11, 8) (11, 26) 

Response:
There are total of 30 nodes and 90 edges in the graph. 

For each node, let's find its neighbor nodes:

- Node 0: {21, 25, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 10, 22, 29}
- Node 2: {1, 13, 25}
- Node 3: {23}
- Node 4: {13, 23}
- Node 5: {9, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 24, 0, 23}
- Node 7: {21, 16}
- Node 8: {20, 11}
- Node 9: {5, 10}
- Node 10: {27, 9, 1, 12}
- Node 11: {8, 26}
- Node 12: {28, 24, 29, 10}
- Node 13: {2, 4, 26}
- Node 14: {18, 22}
- Node 15: {25, 29}
- Node 16: {7, 17}
- Node 17: {18, 28, 16}
- Node 18: {26, 23, 14, 17}
- Node 19: {21, 20, 26}
- Node 20: {27, 25, 8, 19, 28}
- Node 21: {7, 0, 19, 29}
- Node 22: {14, 1}
- Node 23: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 24: {15, 6, 12}
- Node 25: {15, 20, 2, 0}
- Node 26: {18, 19, 13, 11}
- Node 27: {10, 20}
- Node 28: {20, 17, 12}
- Node 29: {15, 1, 21, 12}

Now, let's find the 3-stars formed in this graph:

- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 18: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 20: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 21: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 25: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 26: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 28: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 29: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding them up, we get a total of [44] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
