Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in a more readable format:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- 0: {8, 3}
- 1: {6, 8, 2, 7}
- 2: {9, 6, 8, 1}
- 3: {9, 4, 8, 7, 0}
- 4: {5, 9, 8, 3}
- 5: {9, 4}
- 6: {1, 7, 2}
- 7: {9, 6, 8, 1, 3}
- 8: {4, 2, 0, 3, 1, 7}
- 9: {5, 4, 2, 3, 7, 6}

Now, we will find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 3}
- Node 1: {6, 8, 2, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 6, 8, 1}
- Node 3: {9, 4, 8, 7, 0}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 8, 3}
- Node 5: {4, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 2}
- Node 7: {9, 6, 8, 1, 3}
- Node 8: {4, 2, 0, 3, 1, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 2, 3, 7, 6}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

In this graph, the nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( {6 \choose 3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( {5 \choose 3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( {5 \choose 3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( {6 \choose 3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( {6 \choose 3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 88

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [88].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
