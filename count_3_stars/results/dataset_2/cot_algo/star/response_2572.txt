Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 27) (17, 18) (17, 21) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 1) (20, 26) (20, 18) (25, 29) (25, 22) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 27) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 1) (29, 25) (29, 21) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 26) (18, 17) (18, 20) (18, 4) (18, 1) (18, 3) (5, 26) (5, 23) (5, 1) (7, 24) (7, 26) (7, 13) (12, 0) (12, 19) (0, 12) (16, 6) (16, 21) (16, 23) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 22) (15, 11) (15, 24) (8, 6) (8, 28) (8, 15) (8, 22) (19, 12) (19, 2) (27, 17) (27, 10) (26, 20) (26, 4) (26, 5) (26, 7) (3, 9) (3, 28) (3, 18) (3, 24) (21, 17) (21, 29) (21, 16) (23, 5) (23, 16) (24, 7) (24, 15) (24, 3) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 11) (1, 9) (1, 28) (1, 18) (1, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 11) (22, 25) (22, 15) (22, 8) (11, 9) (11, 15) (11, 2) (11, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {12}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 18, 28}
- Node 2: {6, 11, 19}
- Node 3: {9, 18, 24, 28}
- Node 4: {13, 18, 26}
- Node 5: {1, 13, 23, 26}
- Node 6: {2, 8, 16}
- Node 7: {13, 24, 26}
- Node 8: {6, 15, 22, 28}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 11}
- Node 10: {15, 17, 27}
- Node 11: {2, 9, 13, 15}
- Node 12: {0, 19}
- Node 13: {4, 7, 11, 18}
- Node 15: {8, 10, 11, 22, 24}
- Node 16: {6, 21, 23}
- Node 17: {10, 18, 21, 27}
- Node 18: {1, 3, 4, 13, 17, 26}
- Node 19: {2, 12}
- Node 20: {18, 26}
- Node 21: {16, 17, 27, 29}
- Node 22: {8, 15, 25}
- Node 23: {5, 16}
- Node 24: {3, 7, 15}
- Node 25: {22, 29}
- Node 26: {4, 5, 7, 18, 20}
- Node 27: {10, 17, 21}
- Node 28: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 29: {21, 25}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 64 \).

Thus, the final answer is [64], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 5, 9, (1, 5, 18), (1, 5, 28)>

<8, 6, 2, (6, 8, 16)>
<11, 9, 1, (9, 11, 13), (9, 11, 15), (1, 11, 28), (1, 13, 11)>
