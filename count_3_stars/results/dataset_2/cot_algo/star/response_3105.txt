Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 18) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 15) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 15) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 6) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 3) (9, 18) (9, 19) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 13) (1, 4) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 19) (19, 2) (19, 9) (19, 16) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 15) 

Response:
Given that this graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can start by examining the neighbors of each node to see if there are any 3-stars formed.

The degree of each node is as follows:
Node 0: degree 3 (neighbors: 2, 11, 13)
Node 1: degree 1 (neighbor: 4)
Node 2: degree 4 (neighbors: 5, 8, 19, 0)
Node 3: degree 2 (neighbors: 11, 16)
Node 4: degree 3 (neighbors: 18, 14, 1)
Node 5: degree 4 (neighbors: 6, 2, 18, 2)
Node 6: degree 4 (neighbors: 5, 14, 8, 13)
Node 7: degree 4 (neighbors: 12, 16, 11, 18)
Node 8: degree 2 (neighbors: 6, 2)
Node 9: degree 2 (neighbors: 18, 19)
Node 10: degree 2 (neighbors: 17, 12)
Node 11: degree 3 (neighbors: 7, 0, 3)
Node 12: degree 4 (neighbors: 7, 10, 13, 15)
Node 13: degree 4 (neighbors: 6, 12, 0, 15)
Node 14: degree 2 (neighbors: 4, 6)
Node 15: degree 3 (neighbors: 17, 12, 13)
Node 16: degree 4 (neighbors: 7, 17, 3, 19)
Node 17: degree 3 (neighbors: 10, 16, 15)
Node 18: degree 4 (neighbors: 4, 7, 5, 9)
Node 19: degree 3 (neighbors: 2, 9, 16)

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 2, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [30] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (5, 6, 18)>
<5, (2, 6, 18)>
<6, (2, 5, 18)>
<7, (12, 16, 18)>
<12, (7, 13, 15)>
<13, (6, 12, 15)>
<15, (12, 13, 17)>
<16, (7, 17, 19)>
<17, (10, 15, 16)>
<18, (4, 5, 7)>
<19, (2, 16, 9)>
