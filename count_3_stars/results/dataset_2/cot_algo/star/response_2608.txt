Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 8 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 20 + 10 = 30, so the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
