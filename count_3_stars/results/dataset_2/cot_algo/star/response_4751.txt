Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 27) (9, 21) (9, 24) (18, 20) (18, 29) (18, 13) (22, 2) (22, 12) (22, 3) (14, 17) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 8) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 25) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 1) (0, 15) (0, 5) (11, 1) (11, 21) (28, 8) (28, 5) (28, 23) (21, 9) (21, 11) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 23) (25, 4) (25, 15) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 16) (15, 0) (15, 25) (15, 10) (13, 18) (13, 29) (13, 19) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 3) (2, 22) (2, 23) (2, 27) (2, 24) (24, 9) (24, 2) (24, 27) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 11) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 19) (20, 5) (26, 8) (26, 20) (26, 29) (23, 28) (23, 7) (23, 2) (23, 3) (29, 18) (29, 13) (29, 26) (27, 6) (27, 2) (27, 24) (27, 19) (19, 14) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 20) (19, 27) (3, 22) (3, 16) (3, 23) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 28) (5, 10) (5, 20) (12, 22) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we need to identify the 3-stars formed. 

First, let's list all the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {15, 5}
- Node 1: {4, 8, 11}
- Node 2: {22, 23, 27, 24}
- Node 3: {22, 16, 23}
- Node 4: {8, 5, 1, 25}
- Node 5: {0, 28, 10, 4, 20}
- Node 6: {27}
- Node 7: {16, 19, 23}
- Node 8: {4, 17, 28, 26, 1}
- Node 9: {21, 24}
- Node 10: {15, 5, 16}
- Node 11: {1, 21}
- Node 12: {22}
- Node 13: {18, 29, 19}
- Node 14: {17, 19}
- Node 15: {0, 25, 10}
- Node 16: {7, 3, 10}
- Node 17: {14, 8}
- Node 18: {20, 29, 13}
- Node 19: {14, 7, 13, 20, 27}
- Node 20: {18, 26, 19, 5}
- Node 21: {9, 11}
- Node 22: {2, 12, 3}
- Node 23: {28, 7, 2, 3}
- Node 24: {9, 27, 2}
- Node 25: {15, 4}
- Node 26: {20, 29, 8}
- Node 27: {6, 2, 24, 19}
- Node 28: {8, 5, 23}
- Node 29: {18, 13, 26}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [51].

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (4, 8, 11)>, <4, (1, 8, 25)>, <5, (0, 10, 28)>, <8, (1, 4, 26)>, <13, (18, 19, 29)>, <19, (7, 13, 27)>, <20, (5, 18, 26)>, <23, (2, 3, 28)>, <26, (8, 20, 29)>, <29, (13, 26, 18)>
