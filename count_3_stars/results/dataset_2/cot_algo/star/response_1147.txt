Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 13) (29, 10) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 26) (25, 3) (25, 15) (25, 12) (1, 14) (1, 28) (1, 23) (1, 7) (15, 25) (15, 19) (20, 19) (20, 11) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 11) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 9) (0, 19) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 12) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 16) (26, 3) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 17) (9, 0) (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 24) (9, 27) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (13, 29) (13, 4) (24, 2) (24, 9) (10, 29) (10, 0) (23, 1) (23, 26) (23, 21) (11, 20) (11, 18) (11, 5) (19, 15) (19, 20) (19, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (16, 22) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 6) (17, 26) (17, 16) (17, 28) (8, 16) (28, 1) (28, 9) (28, 17) (28, 12) (28, 27) (21, 23) (21, 12) (27, 9) (27, 28) (12, 25) (12, 14) (12, 28) (12, 21) (6, 4) (6, 16) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {9, 10, 14, 19}
- Node 1: {7, 14, 23, 28}
- Node 2: {5, 24, 29}
- Node 3: {7, 25, 26}
- Node 4: {6, 13, 18}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 11}
- Node 6: {4, 16}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {16}
- Node 9: {0, 22, 24, 27, 28}
- Node 10: {0, 29}
- Node 11: {5, 18, 20}
- Node 12: {14, 21, 25, 28}
- Node 13: {4, 29}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 12, 18}
- Node 15: {19, 25}
- Node 16: {6, 8, 17, 22}
- Node 17: {16, 26, 28}
- Node 18: {4, 11, 14}
- Node 19: {0, 15, 20}
- Node 20: {11, 19}
- Node 21: {12, 23}
- Node 22: {9, 16, 26}
- Node 23: {1, 21, 26}
- Node 24: {2, 9}
- Node 25: {3, 12, 15}
- Node 26: {3, 17, 22, 23}
- Node 27: {9, 28}
- Node 28: {1, 9, 12, 17, 27}
- Node 29: {2, 10, 13}

Now we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 24, and 29: <2, (5, 24, 29)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 24, 27, and 28: <9, (24, 27, 28)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 21, 25, and 28: <12, (21, 25, 28)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [3].
