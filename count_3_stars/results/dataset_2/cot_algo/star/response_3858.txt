Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 4) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 9) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 19) (3, 11) (3, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 17) (5, 19) (5, 17) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 13) (1, 18) (1, 7) (1, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 15) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 16) (15, 6) (15, 13) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 15) (16, 18) (16, 9) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 17) (12, 18) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more easily understandable format:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 11, 8, 14, 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 18, 7, 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 18, 8, 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 11, 3, 17.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 19, 17.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 11, 8, 7, 15.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 17, 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 0, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 1, 16.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 13, 19.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 3, 0, 6, 4.
- Node 12 is connected to node 18.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 10, 19, 15.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 19.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 6, 13.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 18, 9.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 7, 5, 4.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 2, 16, 12, 1.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 10, 14, 5, 13.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
  - <0, (11, 8, 6)>

- Node 1: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 2: 1 3-star
  - <2, (18, 8, 9)>

- Node 3: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 4: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 5: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 6: 1 3-star
  - <6, (11, 8, 7)>

- Node 7: 1 3-star
  - <7, (0, 1, 17)>

- Node 8: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 9: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 10: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 11: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 12: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 13: 1 3-star
  - <13, (10, 19, 15)>

- Node 14: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 15: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 16: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 17: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 18: 1 3-star
  - <18, (2, 16, 12)>

- Node 19: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given 20-node graph, so the final answer is [4].
