Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 3) (9, 19) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 16) (3, 9) (3, 15) (3, 20) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 18) (2, 29) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 13) (29, 12) (29, 4) (14, 23) (14, 4) (14, 10) (17, 16) (8, 13) (8, 25) (8, 21) (8, 1) (13, 29) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 27) (22, 26) (22, 11) (23, 14) (23, 11) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 19) (20, 3) (20, 15) (20, 11) (20, 10) (21, 8) (21, 0) (21, 24) (24, 21) (24, 4) (24, 5) (4, 29) (4, 14) (4, 24) (4, 27) (27, 13) (27, 4) (27, 7) (27, 6) (11, 22) (11, 23) (11, 20) (11, 19) (1, 8) (1, 13) (6, 27) (28, 18) (28, 25) (7, 29) (7, 13) (7, 27) (7, 16) (16, 26) (16, 17) (16, 7) (10, 26) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 20) (10, 18) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 11) (5, 24) (5, 18) (18, 15) (18, 28) (18, 10) (18, 5) (25, 8) (25, 28) (12, 29) (12, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {21, 19, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {8, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {29, 10}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 15, 20}
- Node 4: Neighbors {29, 14, 24, 27}
- Node 5: Neighbors {24, 18}
- Node 6: Neighbors {27}
- Node 7: Neighbors {29, 13, 27, 16}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 13, 21, 25}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 19}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 26, 14, 20, 18}
- Node 11: Neighbors {22, 23, 20, 19}
- Node 12: Neighbors {29, 0}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 29, 8, 7, 27}
- Node 14: Neighbors {29, 4, 10, 23}
- Node 15: Neighbors {3, 20, 18}
- Node 16: Neighbors {26, 17, 7}
- Node 17: Neighbor {16}
- Node 18: Neighbors {5, 10, 28, 15}
- Node 19: Neighbors {9, 0, 11}
- Node 20: Neighbors {3, 15, 10, 11}
- Node 21: Neighbors {8, 0, 24}
- Node 22: Neighbors {26, 11}
- Node 23: Neighbors {14, 11}
- Node 24: Neighbors {21, 4, 5}
- Node 25: Neighbors {8, 28}
- Node 26: Neighbors {22, 10, 16}
- Node 27: Neighbors {13, 4, 7, 6}
- Node 28: Neighbors {18, 25}
- Node 29: Neighbors {2, 12, 7, 13, 4}

Let's then calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2, Node 4, Node 20, and Node 29 have 5 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 (from Node 2) + 10 (from Node 4) + 4 (from Node 20) + 10 (from Node 29) = 34

Therefore, the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars are: <2, (10, 14, 29)>, <4, (10, 14, 29)>, <20, (3, 15, 10)>, <29, (4, 13, 7)>.
