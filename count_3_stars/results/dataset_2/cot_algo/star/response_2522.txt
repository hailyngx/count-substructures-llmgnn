Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 25) (1, 16) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 13) (21, 19) (21, 8) (5, 9) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 17) (18, 20) (18, 13) (22, 6) (22, 25) (8, 21) (8, 15) (8, 27) (13, 21) (13, 18) (13, 24) (12, 27) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 11) (27, 8) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 20) (26, 28) (26, 25) (17, 9) (17, 12) (17, 28) (17, 24) (29, 20) (28, 26) (28, 17) (28, 19) (28, 2) (20, 18) (20, 27) (20, 29) (20, 16) (11, 12) (11, 23) (23, 11) (23, 3) (0, 16) (0, 3) (16, 1) (16, 21) (16, 20) (16, 0) (16, 10) (3, 23) (3, 0) (3, 6) (15, 5) (15, 8) (14, 19) (14, 2) (14, 10) (4, 9) (4, 24) (4, 6) (4, 2) (25, 1) (25, 22) (25, 26) (24, 13) (24, 27) (24, 17) (24, 4) (10, 16) (10, 14) (10, 2) (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 4) (19, 21) (19, 28) (19, 14) (2, 28) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {16, 3}
- Node 1: {21, 25, 16}
- Node 2: {28, 14, 4, 10}
- Node 3: {0, 23, 6}
- Node 4: {9, 24, 6, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 15}
- Node 6: {22, 12, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {21, 15, 27}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 17}
- Node 10: {16, 14, 2}
- Node 11: {12, 23}
- Node 12: {27, 17, 6, 11}
- Node 13: {21, 18, 24}
- Node 14: {19, 2, 10}
- Node 15: {8, 5}
- Node 16: {1, 21, 20, 0, 10}
- Node 17: {9, 12, 28, 24}
- Node 18: {20, 13}
- Node 19: {21, 28, 14}
- Node 20: {16, 27, 29, 18}
- Node 21: {1, 16, 13, 19, 8}
- Node 22: {6, 25}
- Node 23: {11, 3}
- Node 24: {13, 27, 17, 4}
- Node 25: {1, 22, 26}
- Node 26: {28, 25}
- Node 27: {8, 12, 24, 20}
- Node 28: {26, 17, 19, 2}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors where a 3-star can be formed:
- Node 1, 21 (with 5 neighbors)
- Node 16 (with 5 neighbors)
- Node 2 (with 4 neighbors)
- Node 4 (with 4 neighbors)
- Node 6, 12, 24, 17 (each with 4 neighbors)
- Node 19, 28 (each with 4 neighbors) 

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} +  \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 44, which we represent as [44].

- <1, 21, 8>
