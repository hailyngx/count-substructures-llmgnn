Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 8}

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 8 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 53

Therefore, the final answer is [53], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <1, (2, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 2, 4)>
- <7, (1, 2, 8)>
