Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 3) (20, 23) (20, 28) (25, 8) (25, 0) (10, 21) (10, 9) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 1) (17, 29) (17, 16) (17, 22) (17, 2) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 16) (28, 20) (28, 29) (28, 24) (29, 17) (29, 28) (29, 1) (29, 4) (12, 27) (12, 21) (12, 14) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 1) (27, 5) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 6) (3, 20) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 14) (3, 24) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 3) (23, 20) (23, 11) (23, 4) (5, 27) (5, 26) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 22) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 24) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 14) (16, 17) (16, 18) (24, 28) (24, 3) (24, 19) (24, 0) (1, 11) (1, 29) (1, 27) (1, 7) (8, 25) (8, 6) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 7) (6, 26) (6, 8) (0, 25) (0, 15) (0, 24) (0, 22) (0, 9) (9, 10) (9, 0) (22, 17) (22, 15) (22, 0) (13, 2) (4, 29) (4, 23) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 15, 22, 24, 25}
- Node 1: {7, 11, 27, 29}
- Node 2: {13, 16, 17, 18}
- Node 3: {14, 20, 21, 24, 27}
- Node 4: {23, 29}
- Node 5: {14, 19, 26, 27}
- Node 6: {8, 26}
- Node 7: {1, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {6, 25}
- Node 9: {0, 10}
- Node 10: {9, 21}
- Node 11: {1, 7, 23, 29}
- Node 12: {14, 21, 27}
- Node 13: {2}
- Node 14: {3, 7, 12, 19}
- Node 15: {0, 19, 22}
- Node 16: {2, 17, 18}
- Node 17: {2, 16, 22, 29}
- Node 18: {2, 16, 26}
- Node 19: {0, 14, 15, 24}
- Node 20: {3, 23, 24, 28}
- Node 21: {3, 10, 12}
- Node 22: {0, 15, 17}
- Node 23: {4, 11, 20}
- Node 24: {0, 19, 20, 28}
- Node 25: {0, 8}
- Node 26: {5, 6, 18}
- Node 27: {1, 3, 5, 12}
- Node 28: {20, 24, 29}
- Node 29: {1, 4, 17, 28}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 5 neighbors, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (not considered)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 11: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 14: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 17: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 19: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 22: 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 24: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 27: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 29: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars is \( 10+4+4+10+4+1+4+1+4+1+4+1+4+4+1+1+4+1+4 = 55 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [55] and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (15, 22, 24)>, <0, (15, 19, 24)>, <0, (15, 19, 14)>, <0, (15, 22, 17)>, <0, (19, 15, 24)>, <0, (19, 15, 14)>, <0, (19, 24, 14)>, <0, (22, 17, 15)>, <0, (22, 17, 29)>, <1, (7, 11, 29)>, <2, (13, 16, 17)>, <2, (13, 16, 18)>, <2, (13, 17, 18)>, <2, (16, 17, 18)>, <3, (14, 21, 27)>, <3, (14, 19, 24)>, <3, (14, 19, 15)>, <3, (21, 12, 27)>, <3, (21, 12, 14)>, <3, (21, 14, 19)>, <7, (1, 11, 29)>, <11, (1, 7, 29)>, <14, (3, 21, 27)>, <14, (3, 12, 27)>, <14, (3, 12, 21)>, <14, (7, 1, 11)>, <16, (2, 17, 18)>, <17, (2, 16, 22)>, <17, (2, 22, 15)>, <17, (2, 22, 0)>, <17, (16, 22, 15)>, <19, (0, 14, 24)>, <20, (3, 23, 24)>, <21, (3, 12, 27)>, <24, (0, 19, 15)>, <24, (0, 19, 14)>, <24, (19, 15, 14)>, <24, (19, 14, 15)>, <27, (1, 3, 5)>, <27, (5, 3, 12)>, <27, (5, 3, 14)>, <28, (20, 24, 29)>, <29, (1, 7, 11)>.
