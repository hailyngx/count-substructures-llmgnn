Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 7, 4, 6
Node 1: 5, 9, 6, 4
Node 2: 9, 6, 3, 7, 0
Node 3: 9, 2, 4
Node 4: 9, 0, 1, 6, 3
Node 5: 1, 7
Node 6: 2, 8, 0, 7, 1, 4
Node 7: 5, 2, 0, 6
Node 8: 9, 6
Node 9: 8, 4, 2, 3, 1, 0

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 0: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 1: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 2: \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 4: \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 6: \({{6}\choose{3}} = 20\) 3-stars
Node 9: \({{6}\choose{3}} = 20\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 68

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [68], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
