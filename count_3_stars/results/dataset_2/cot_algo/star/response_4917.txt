Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 17) (7, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (8, 2) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 18) (1, 2) (1, 17) (17, 4) (17, 12) (17, 1) (17, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 19) (10, 2) (10, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 9) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 4) (19, 16) (19, 15) (19, 11) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 19) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 3) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 14) (13, 16) (13, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node, we get a total of \( 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 46 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [46].

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (6, 1, 9)>, <3, (6, 0, 13)>, <4, (17, 5, 19)>, <5, (4, 6, 14)>, <6, (5, 2, 11)>, <9, (2, 3, 17)>, <11, (6, 0, 19)>, <12, (17, 14, 18)>, <14, (5, 12, 18)>, <16, (19, 13, 18)>, <17, (4, 1, 9)>, <18, (12, 14, 16)>, <19, (15, 4, 11)>.
