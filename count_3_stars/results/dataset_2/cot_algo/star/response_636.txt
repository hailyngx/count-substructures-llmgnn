Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 13) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 18) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 19) (7, 9) (15, 17) (15, 16) (13, 14) (13, 17) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 6) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 4) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 6) (6, 14) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 4) (18, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 12}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 11}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 16}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 11}
- Node 6: {0, 12, 14, 19}
- Node 7: {9, 19}
- Node 8: {2, 12, 16, 18}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 7, 11}
- Node 10: {0, 11}
- Node 11: {2, 5, 9, 10, 19}
- Node 12: {1, 6, 8, 16}
- Node 13: {14, 17}
- Node 14: {6, 13}
- Node 15: {16, 17}
- Node 16: {3, 8, 12, 15}
- Node 17: {13, 15}
- Node 18: {8}
- Node 19: {6, 7, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <0, (1, 4, 6)>
  - <0, (1, 4, 9)>
  - <0, (1, 4, 10)>
  - <0, (1, 6, 9)>
  - <0, (1, 9, 10)>
  - <0, (4, 6, 9)>
  - <0, (4, 9, 10)>
  - <0, (6, 9, 10)>
  - <0, (4, 5, 9)>
  - <0, (6, 9, 19)>

- Node 1: 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars formed

- Node 2: 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars formed

- Node 3: 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars formed

- Node 4: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (0, 5, 9)>
  - <4, (0, 9, 11)>
  - <4, (5, 9, 11)>
  - <4, (0, 5, 11)>

- Node 5: 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars formed

- Node 6: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <6, (0, 12, 19)>
  - <6, (12, 16, 19)>
  - <6, (0, 14, 19)>
  - <6, (14, 19, 13)>

- Node 8: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (12, 16, 18)>
  - <8, (2, 8, 16)>
  - <8, (8, 16, 15)>
  - <8, (8, 12, 16)>

- Node 9: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <9, (0, 4, 7)>
  - <9, (0, 4, 11)>
  - <9, (0, 7, 11)>
  - <9, (4, 7, 11)>

- Node 11: 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <11, (2, 5, 11)>
  - <11, (2, 9, 11)>
  - <11, (5, 9, 11)>
  - <11, (0, 9, 11)>
  - <11, (9, 10, 11)>
  - <11, (9, 11, 19)>
  - <11, (2, 11, 19)>
  - <11, (5, 11, 19)>
  - <11, (2, 10, 11)>
  - <11, (10, 11, 19)>

- Node 12: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <12, (1, 6, 12)>
  - <12, (6, 12, 16)>
  - <12, (6, 12, 19)>
  - <12, (12, 16, 18)>

- Node 16: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <16, (3, 12, 16)>
  - <16, (3, 8, 16)>
  - <16, (3, 12, 16)>
  - <16, (12, 15, 16)>

- Node 19: 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars formed

In total, we have 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 40 3-stars.

Therefore, the final number is [40].
