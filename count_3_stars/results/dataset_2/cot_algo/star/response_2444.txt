Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 19) (27, 12) (27, 10) (10, 27) (10, 2) (10, 14) (12, 11) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 26) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 6) (8, 16) (8, 4) (8, 20) (28, 6) (28, 20) (14, 0) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 2) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 23) (18, 6) (18, 24) (22, 26) (22, 19) (22, 3) (26, 12) (26, 22) (26, 21) (26, 3) (15, 0) (20, 8) (20, 28) (20, 9) (20, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 22) (3, 26) (3, 13) (6, 4) (6, 28) (6, 18) (6, 23) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 20) (2, 9) (7, 1) (7, 17) (19, 0) (19, 22) (19, 17) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 9) (21, 26) (17, 7) (17, 19) (17, 9) (23, 18) (23, 6) (23, 25) (23, 24) (9, 4) (9, 20) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 17) (1, 7) (1, 25) (25, 23) (25, 1) (24, 18) (24, 23) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 14, 15, 19}
- Node 1: {7, 25}
- Node 2: {9, 10, 14, 20}
- Node 3: {0, 11, 13, 22, 26}
- Node 4: {6, 8, 9, 14, 18}
- Node 6: {4, 18, 23, 28}
- Node 7: {1, 17, 19}
- Node 8: {4, 16, 20}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 13, 17, 20}
- Node 10: {2, 14, 27}
- Node 11: {3, 12, 16}
- Node 12: {11, 13, 26, 27}
- Node 13: {3, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 4, 10, 18}
- Node 15: {0}
- Node 16: {8, 11}
- Node 17: {7, 9, 19}
- Node 18: {4, 6, 14, 23, 24}
- Node 19: {0, 7, 17, 22}
- Node 20: {2, 8, 9, 28}
- Node 21: {26}
- Node 22: {3, 19, 26}
- Node 23: {6, 18, 24, 25}
- Node 24: {18, 23}
- Node 25: {1, 23}
- Node 26: {3, 12, 21, 22}
- Node 27: {10, 12}
- Node 28: {6, 20}

Next, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0, Node 4, Node 9, Node 14, Node 18, Node 20 each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3, Node 6, and Node 26 each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars formed in the graph: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 80

Therefore, the final answer is [80], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 14, 19)>, <4, (6, 18, 23)>, <9, (2, 17, 20)>, <14, (2, 4, 18)>, <18, (4, 6, 23)>, <20, (2, 8, 28)>, <26, (3, 12, 22)>
