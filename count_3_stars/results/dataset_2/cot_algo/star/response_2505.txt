Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 11) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 18) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 11) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 12) (5, 10) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 15) (6, 13) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 16) (13, 2) (13, 6) (13, 12) (15, 4) (15, 6) (16, 14) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 19) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {18, 11, 19}
- Node 1 neighbors: {4, 3, 10, 19}
- Node 2 neighbors: {10, 18, 13}
- Node 3 neighbors: {1, 14, 18}
- Node 4 neighbors: {7, 9, 1, 6, 15}
- Node 5 neighbors: {10, 8}
- Node 6 neighbors: {4, 15, 13}
- Node 7 neighbors: {4, 11}
- Node 8 neighbors: {5}
- Node 9 neighbors: {4, 10}
- Node 10 neighbors: {1, 17, 2, 9, 5}
- Node 11 neighbors: {7, 17, 0}
- Node 12 neighbors: {18, 13, 19}
- Node 13 neighbors: {2, 6, 12}
- Node 14 neighbors: {3, 19, 16}
- Node 15 neighbors: {4, 6}
- Node 16 neighbors: {14}
- Node 17 neighbors: {10, 19, 11}
- Node 18 neighbors: {3, 2, 0, 12}
- Node 19 neighbors: {1, 17, 0, 14, 12}

Now, let's identify the 3-star formations:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves {3, 10, 19} <1, (3, 10, 19)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves {7, 9, 6} <4, (7, 9, 6)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with leaves {17, 2, 5} <10, (17, 2, 5)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with leaves {3, 2, 12} <18, (3, 2, 12)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with leaves {17, 0, 14} <19, (17, 0, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
