Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
In this graph, each node has the following neighbors:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 8}

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 34 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 5)>
