Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (9, 0) (26, 12) (1, 21) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 6) (21, 25) (21, 14) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 28) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 16) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 19) (22, 23) (22, 27) (22, 0) (23, 22) (8, 15) (8, 28) (8, 20) (8, 25) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 13) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 20) (6, 21) (6, 15) (6, 28) (6, 13) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 6) (7, 18) (7, 25) (7, 5) (7, 17) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 7) (25, 12) (29, 9) (29, 24) (27, 22) (27, 18) (27, 2) (24, 11) (24, 29) (24, 12) (24, 5) (24, 2) (20, 8) (20, 19) (20, 14) (14, 21) (14, 20) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 22) (0, 4) (0, 13) (5, 7) (5, 24) (12, 26) (12, 25) (12, 24) (12, 13) (13, 18) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 12) (17, 4) (17, 19) (17, 7) (2, 27) (2, 24) (16, 15) 

Response:
First, we will construct the adjacency list based on the given edges:

Node 0: {9, 1, 4, 22, 13}
Node 1: {21, 0}
Node 2: {27, 24}
Node 3: {15, 11, 28}
Node 4: {18, 0, 17}
Node 5: {7, 24}
Node 6: {21, 15, 28, 13}
Node 7: {18, 25, 5, 17}
Node 8: {15, 28, 20, 25}
Node 9: {29, 0}
Node 10: {11}
Node 11: {3, 15, 10, 24, 19}
Node 12: {26, 25, 24, 13}
Node 13: {18, 6, 0, 12}
Node 14: {21, 20}
Node 15: {3, 6, 8, 16}
Node 16: {15}
Node 17: {4, 19, 7}
Node 18: {4, 27, 7, 13}
Node 19: {11, 17, 20}
Node 20: {8, 14, 19}
Node 21: {1, 6, 14, 25}
Node 22: {23, 27, 0}
Node 23: {22}
Node 24: {11, 22, 12, 5, 2}
Node 25: {21, 8, 7, 12}
Node 26: {12}
Node 27: {22, 18, 2}
Node 28: {3, 6, 8}
Node 29: {9, 24}


Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with it.
Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with it.
Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with it.
Node 24 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with it.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 28, which can be written as [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<21, (1, 6, 14)>
<21, (6, 15, 25)>
<21, (6, 15, 25)>
<21, (15, 25, 8)>
<15, (3, 6, 8)>
<15, (6, 8, 25)>
<15, (6, 8, 28)>
<15, (8, 25, 12)>
<11, (3, 15, 24)>
<11, (3, 15, 19)>
<11, (15, 24, 12)>
<11, (15, 24, 5)>
<11, (24, 12, 13)>
<24, (11, 5, 2)>
<24, (11, 22, 12)>
<24, (5, 2, 27)>
<24, (5, 27, 18)>

<8, (28, 6, 13)>
<20, (19, 14, 21)>
<19, (11, 17, 20)>
<19, (17, 7, 25)>
<6, (21, 15, 28)>
<6, (15, 8, 25)>
<6, (28, 8, 15)>
