Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 5) (16, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 5) (12, 5) (12, 3) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 14) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 13) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 10) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 13) (13, 17) (13, 9) (13, 14) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 9) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 19) (0, 6) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 0) (18, 11) (18, 3) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 18) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {6, 10, 19}
- Node 1: {6, 14, 17}
- Node 2: {8, 11, 14, 19}
- Node 3: {8, 12, 18}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 15}
- Node 5: {7, 10, 12, 16}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 16}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 15}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 8, 13, 15}
- Node 10: {0, 5}
- Node 11: {2, 17, 18, 19}
- Node 12: {3, 5}
- Node 13: {9, 14, 17}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 13}
- Node 15: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 16: {5, 6}
- Node 17: {1, 11, 13}
- Node 18: {3, 11}
- Node 19: {0, 2, 11}

Now, let's check which nodes can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 2
- Node 5
- Node 11
- Node 15
- Node 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <2, (8, 11, 19)>
- <5, (7, 10, 12)>
- <11, (17, 18, 19)>
- <15, (4, 7, 9)>
- <19, (0, 2, 11)>
