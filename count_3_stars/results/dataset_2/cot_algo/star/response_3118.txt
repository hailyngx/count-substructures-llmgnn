Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 9) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 1) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 10) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 12) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {11, 14, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {2, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {6, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 5, 10, 12}
- Node 7: {1, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 6, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 2, 3, 14}
- Node 12: {4, 6, 8, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 4, 8, 9, 11}

Now, we can see that the nodes forming 3-stars are:
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14: inom{6}{3} = 20

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 58 3-stars. 
Therefore, the final answer is [58].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 10)>, <2, (1, 5, 11)>, <2, (1, 11, 13)>, 
<5, (1, 6, 10)>, <5, (1, 2, 10)>, <5, (1, 2, 13)>, <5, (2, 6, 10)>, 
<6, (2, 10, 12)>, <6, (4, 5, 13)>, <6, (4, 13, 14)>, <6, (5, 10, 12)>, 
<10, (2, 5, 12)>, <10, (2, 6, 12)>, <10, (5, 6, 12)>, <10, (4, 6, 12)>, 
<12, (4, 6, 8)>, <12, (4, 8, 14)>, <12, (6, 8, 14)>, <12, (6, 10, 14)>, 
<14, (0, 3, 9)>, <14, (0, 3, 11)>, <14, (0, 9, 11)>, <14, (3, 9, 11)>, 
<14, (3, 11, 14)>, <14, (9, 11, 14)>
