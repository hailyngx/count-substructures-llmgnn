Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 7}

Now, we can identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 6 neighbors
- Node 1, 4 neighbors
- Node 3, 4 neighbors
- Node 4, 4 neighbors
- Node 5, 3 neighbors
- Node 6, 6 neighbors
- Node 7, 5 neighbors
- Node 8, 3 neighbors
- Node 9, 4 neighbors

Next, we count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars for this graph: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 66

Therefore, the final answer is [66], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 3, 6)>
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
