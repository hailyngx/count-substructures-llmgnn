Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 3) (9, 0) (26, 9) (26, 11) (26, 27) (2, 7) (18, 6) (18, 1) (18, 8) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 25) (12, 0) (29, 17) (29, 24) (29, 3) (21, 10) (21, 8) (21, 17) (17, 29) (17, 21) (17, 25) (17, 27) (3, 9) (3, 29) (3, 13) (3, 19) (11, 26) (11, 19) (4, 27) (4, 24) (4, 20) (4, 6) (27, 26) (27, 17) (27, 4) (27, 25) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 15) (10, 5) (15, 10) (15, 13) (15, 16) (25, 12) (25, 17) (25, 27) (1, 18) (1, 6) (1, 5) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 1) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 23) (16, 19) (24, 29) (24, 4) (24, 8) (5, 10) (5, 1) (5, 23) (5, 0) (23, 16) (23, 5) (23, 20) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 0) (8, 18) (8, 21) (8, 24) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 14) (20, 4) (20, 23) (20, 14) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 20) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {9, 12, 5, 19}
- Node 1: {18, 6, 5}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {9, 29, 13, 19}
- Node 4: {27, 24, 6, 20}
- Node 5: {10, 1, 23, 0}
- Node 6: {18, 4, 1}
- Node 7: {2, 10, 14}
- Node 8: {18, 21, 24}
- Node 9: {26, 3, 0}
- Node 10: {7, 21, 15, 5}
- Node 11: {26, 19}
- Node 12: {25, 0}
- Node 13: {3, 15, 16, 14}
- Node 14: {7, 13, 20}
- Node 15: {10, 13, 16}
- Node 16: {15, 13, 23, 19}
- Node 17: {29, 21, 25, 27}
- Node 18: {6, 1, 8}
- Node 19: {3, 11, 16, 0}
- Node 20: {4, 23, 14}
- Node 21: {10, 8, 17}
- Node 23: {5, 16, 20}
- Node 24: {29, 4, 8}
- Node 25: {12, 17, 27}
- Node 26: {9, 11, 27}
- Node 27: {26, 17, 4, 25}
- Node 29: {17, 24, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 5, 14, 16, 24
\[ inom{3}{3} = 1 \] 3-star each for the nodes with 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, 0, 19>
- <14, 7, 20>
- <16, 13, 19>
- <24, 29, 4>
