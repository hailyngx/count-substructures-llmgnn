Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 18) (0, 21) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 25) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 9) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 3) (18, 21) (18, 11) (18, 16) (26, 0) (26, 20) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 3) (28, 26) (28, 4) (4, 28) (4, 9) (4, 10) (27, 17) (27, 6) (25, 0) (25, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 5) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 11) (9, 20) (9, 4) (9, 11) (29, 1) (29, 26) (29, 3) (8, 25) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 23) (16, 18) (16, 22) (6, 12) (6, 27) (6, 15) (17, 27) (17, 8) (17, 5) (13, 21) (13, 12) (13, 24) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 22) (24, 8) (24, 13) (22, 0) (22, 16) (22, 5) (11, 18) (11, 15) (11, 9) (3, 2) (3, 26) (3, 29) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 23) (23, 1) (23, 19) (23, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 21, 20, 22, 25, 26
- Node 1: 21, 29, 23
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2, 26, 29
- Node 4: 28, 9, 10
- Node 5: 10, 15, 17, 22
- Node 6: 12, 27, 15
- Node 7: 12, 10, 14
- Node 8: 25, 19, 24, 17
- Node 9: 20, 4, 11
- Node 10: 7, 4, 5
- Node 11: 18, 15, 9
- Node 12: 7, 13, 6
- Node 13: 21, 12, 24
- Node 14: 7, 19, 23
- Node 15: 6, 5, 11
- Node 16: 18, 22
- Node 17: 27, 8, 5
- Node 18: 21, 11, 16
- Node 19: 8, 14, 23
- Node 20: 0, 26, 9
- Node 21: 1, 13, 18
- Node 22: 0, 5, 16
- Node 23: 1, 14, 19
- Node 24: 8, 13
- Node 25: 0, 8
- Node 26: 0, 20, 28, 29, 3
- Node 27: 17, 6
- Node 28: 26, 4
- Node 29: 1, 26, 3

Next, identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to consider for 3-star formation:

- Node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Now calculate the number of 3-stars per node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 25: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 35

Therefore, the final answer is [35], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (21, 20, 25)>, <1, (21, 29, 23)>, <3, (2, 26, 29)>, <4, (28, 9, 10)>, <5, (10, 15, 17)>, <6, (12, 27, 15)>, <7, (12, 10, 14)>, <8, (25, 19, 24)>, <9, (20, 4, 11)>, <10, (7, 4, 5)>, <11, (18, 15, 9)>, <12, (7, 13, 6)>, <13, (21, 12, 24)>, <14, (7, 19, 23)>, <15, (6, 5, 11)>, <17, (27, 8, 5)>, <18, (21, 11, 16)>, <19, (8, 14, 23)>, <20, (0, 26, 9)>, <21, (1, 13, 18)>, <21, (0, 20, 22)>, <23, (1, 14, 19)>, <26, (0, 20, 29)>, <27, (8, 6, 5)>, <29, (1, 26, 3)>
