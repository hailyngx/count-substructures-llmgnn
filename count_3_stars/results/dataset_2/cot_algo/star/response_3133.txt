Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 14) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 10) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

The neighbor sets for each node are:
Node 0: {2, 3, 10, 12}
Node 1: {2, 6, 8, 11, 14}
Node 2: {0, 1, 4}
Node 3: {0, 8, 11}
Node 4: {2, 8, 9, 10, 11}
Node 5: {6, 8}
Node 6: {1, 5, 12, 13}
Node 7: {8, 11, 12}
Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10}
Node 9: {4, 10, 12}
Node 10: {0, 4, 8, 9, 14}
Node 11: {1, 3, 4, 7, 12}
Node 12: {0, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13}
Node 13: {6, 12, 14}
Node 14: {1, 10, 13}

Node 4, Node 8, Node 10, and Node 12 have 5 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars.

Calculating the 3-stars:
For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (2, 8, 10)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 11)>
<8, (3, 4, 11)>
<10, (0, 4, 9)>
<12, (6, 7, 13)>
