Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0 neighbors: {6, 8, 7, 1}
Node 1 neighbors: {5, 6, 4, 8, 0}
Node 2 neighbors: {5, 6, 4, 8, 7}
Node 3 neighbors: {5, 4}
Node 4 neighbors: {6, 8, 1, 3, 2}
Node 5 neighbors: {9, 2, 1, 3}
Node 6 neighbors: {1, 2, 4, 0}
Node 7 neighbors: {9, 2, 0}
Node 8 neighbors: {9, 4, 2, 0, 1}
Node 9 neighbors: {5, 8, 7}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1 can form a 3-star with neighbors 0, 4, and 8: <1, (0, 4, 8)> 
Node 2 can form a 3-star with neighbors 5, 6, and 8: <2, (5, 6, 8)> 
Node 4 can form a 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, and 2: <4, (1, 3, 2)>
Node 8 can form a 3-star with neighbors 9, 4, and 2: <8, (9, 4, 2)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, so the final answer is [4].
