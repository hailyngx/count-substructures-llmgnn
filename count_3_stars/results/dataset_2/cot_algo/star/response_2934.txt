Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 2, 6, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 (degree 6)
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 3, 7 (degree 3)
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 4: Neighbors are 3, 7, 8, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 5: Neighbor is 1 (degree 1)
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 1, 7, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 6 (degree 4)
- Node 8: Neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 6, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 8 (degree 4)

Next, we will identify nodes with more than 3 neighbors to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, and Node 8 have 4 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 0: [4 choose 3] = 4
- For Node 1: [6 choose 3] = 20
- For Node 3: [5 choose 3] = 10
- For Node 4: [4 choose 3] = 4
- For Node 6: [4 choose 3] = 4
- For Node 8: [5 choose 3] = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the final answer is [52], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
