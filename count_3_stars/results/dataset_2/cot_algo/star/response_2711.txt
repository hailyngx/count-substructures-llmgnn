Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {2, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars.
- For Node 2, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars.
- For Node 4, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
- For Node 6, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
- For Node 8, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
- For Node 9, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the final answer is [36], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
