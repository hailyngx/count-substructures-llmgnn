Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 9) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated as follows:

1. For node 1: Node 1 has neighbors {13, 11, 4, 5, 12, 0}. Since it has more than 3 neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)

2. For node 2: Node 2 has neighbors {8, 6, 7}. Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star with node 2.

3. For node 3: Node 3 has neighbors {8, 13, 0}. Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star with node 3.

4. For node 4: Node 4 has neighbors {11, 9, 1}. Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star with node 4.

5. For node 5: Node 5 has neighbors {13, 6, 1}. Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star with node 5.

6. For node 6: Node 6 has neighbors {5, 2, 0}. Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star with node 6.

7. For node 7: Node 7 has neighbors {13, 2, 12, 0, 9}. Since it has more than 3 neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)

8. For node 8: Node 8 has neighbors {13, 2, 14, 10, 3}. Since it has more than 3 neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)

9. For node 9: Node 9 has neighbors {4, 7, 14}. Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star with node 9.

10. For node 10: Node 10 has neighbors {8, 11, 12, 14}. Since it has more than 3 neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)

11. For node 11: Node 11 has neighbors {10, 1, 4, 12}. Since it has more than 3 neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)

12. For node 12: Node 12 has neighbors {10, 11, 7, 0, 1}. Since it has more than 3 neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)

13. For node 13: Node 13 has neighbors {8, 5, 1, 7, 3}. Since it has more than 3 neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)

14. For node 14: Node 14 has neighbors {8, 10, 9}. Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star with node 14.

Adding up all the calculated 3-stars: \( 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 64 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [64].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 0, 12, 11>, <1, 0, 12, 7>, <1, 0, 4, 5>, <1, 0, 4, 11>, <1, 0, 5, 12>, <1, 0, 5, 13>, <1, 0, 7, 12>, <1, 0, 7, 13>, <1, 0, 9, 14>, <1, 4, 11, 9>, <2, 6, 0, 7>, <2, 6, 7, 13>, <2, 6, 8, 13>, <4, 9, 7, 14>, <8, 10, 14, 9>
