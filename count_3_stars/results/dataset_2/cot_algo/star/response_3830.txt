Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
Node 3: {6, 9}
Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 9}
Node 5: {2, 7, 8}
Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 4}
Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 8}
Node 8: {1, 5, 7}
Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4}

Now, let's identify nodes that have at least three neighbors:

Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, and Node 9 each have 6 neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of unique 3-stars:

Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is the sum of these numbers: 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 38, which we represent as [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
