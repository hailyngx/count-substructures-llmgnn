Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 0) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 8, 13, 14, 6}
- Node 2: {9, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {7, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 10}
- Node 6: {1}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 9, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 7, 13}
- Node 10: {5, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {2, 10, 13, 8}
- Node 12: {4, 8, 3}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 3, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 3, 8, 10}

Next, we find the nodes that have three or more neighbors: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 78

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [78].

The unique 3-stars found are:
