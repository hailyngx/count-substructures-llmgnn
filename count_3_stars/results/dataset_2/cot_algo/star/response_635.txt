Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 6) (15, 0) (15, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 2) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 2) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 7) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (17, 1) (17, 7) (5, 13) (5, 16) (19, 4) (19, 16) (16, 0) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 9) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 10) (18, 9) (18, 6) (7, 11) (7, 17) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 1) (12, 15) (12, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 18) (6, 12) 

Response:
There are a total of 3-stars formed in the graph, which can be represented as [15]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (6, 12, 15)>
<1, (2, 10, 17)>
<2, (1, 4, 14)>
<4, (2, 11, 13)>
<5, (9, 16, 19)>
<6, (0, 12, 18)>
<8, (10, 11, 13)>
<9, (10, 14, 16)>
<11, (4, 7, 8)>
<13, (2, 5, 8)>
<14, (0, 2, 9)>
<15, (0, 12, 16)>
<16, (5, 9, 19)>
<17, (1, 7, 17)>
<18, (6, 9, 18)>
