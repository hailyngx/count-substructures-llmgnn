Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 0) (22, 11) (22, 17) (22, 8) (15, 20) (15, 17) (15, 16) (20, 15) (20, 24) (20, 10) (28, 29) (28, 25) (29, 28) (29, 8) (29, 0) (29, 3) (24, 20) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 19) (26, 24) (26, 10) (26, 7) (4, 9) (27, 24) (27, 21) (27, 7) (5, 23) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 13) (0, 29) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 1) (10, 20) (10, 26) (10, 0) (10, 6) (6, 24) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 2) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 9) (18, 3) (3, 29) (3, 18) (3, 8) (17, 22) (17, 15) (17, 2) (23, 5) (23, 7) (21, 27) (21, 11) (25, 28) (25, 9) (14, 5) (14, 16) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 7) (19, 24) (19, 1) (7, 26) (7, 27) (7, 23) (7, 2) (1, 0) (1, 19) (1, 16) (16, 13) (16, 15) (16, 14) (16, 1) (11, 22) (11, 5) (11, 21) (8, 22) (8, 29) (8, 6) (8, 3) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: {1, 10, 13, 18, 29}
- Node 1: {0, 16, 19}
- Node 2: {7, 9, 17}
- Node 3: {8, 18, 29}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {11, 14, 18, 23}
- Node 6: {8, 10, 24}
- Node 7: {2, 7, 23, 26, 27}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 22, 29}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 18, 25}
- Node 10: {0, 6, 20, 26}
- Node 11: {5, 21, 22}
- Node 13: {0, 16}
- Node 14: {5, 16}
- Node 15: {16, 17, 20}
- Node 16: {1, 13, 14, 15}
- Node 17: {2, 15, 22}
- Node 18: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 19: {1, 24}
- Node 20: {10, 15, 24}
- Node 21: {11, 27}
- Node 22: {8, 11, 17}
- Node 23: {5, 7}
- Node 24: {6, 19, 20, 26, 27}
- Node 25: {9, 28}
- Node 26: {6, 7, 10, 24}
- Node 27: {7, 21, 24}
- Node 28: {25, 29}
- Node 29: {0, 3, 8, 28}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 8, 9, 10, 24, 26, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the final answer is [38] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 16>, <0, 1, 19>, <0, 8, 29>, <0, 9, 18>, <0, 10, 26>, <0, 18, 29>, 
<0, 24, 27>, <0, 24, 19>, <1, 16, 14>, <1, 16, 15>, <1, 16, 19>, <1, 16, 1>, 
<8, 3, 29>, <8, 6, 10>, <8, 6, 24>, <8, 6, 27>, <9, 2, 17>, <9, 2, 7>, 
<9, 2, 11>, <9, 2, 23>, <10, 20, 24>, <10, 20, 26>, <24, 6, 8>, 
<24, 6, 27>, <24, 6, 7>, <24, 19, 1>, <24, 19, 27>, <24, 19, 1>, 
<24, 20, 15>, <24, 20, 26>, <24, 20, 10>, <26, 6, 8>, <26, 6, 24>, 
<26, 6, 27>, <29, 3, 18>, <29, 3, 8>, <29, 8, 22>, <29, 8, 3>
