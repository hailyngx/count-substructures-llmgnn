Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 13) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 6) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 14) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, we will find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 7, 13
Node 1: 2, 3, 8
Node 2: 1, 6, 11
Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 13, 14
Node 4: 0, 3, 9, 11
Node 5: 8
Node 6: 2, 3, 6, 10, 14
Node 7: 0, 9, 10, 13, 14
Node 8: 1, 5, 8, 9, 14
Node 9: 7, 8, 11, 12
Node 10: 6, 7, 10, 11, 13
Node 11: 2, 4, 9, 10
Node 12: 9, 10, 13, 14
Node 13: 0, 3, 7, 10, 12
Node 14: 3, 6, 7, 8, 12

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: \({0 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 3: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 4: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 6: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 7: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 8: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 10: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 12: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 13: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 14: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 73

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [73]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 13>, <3, 9, 13>, <3, 9, 12>, <3, 10, 13>, <3, 10, 12>, <3, 10, 14>, <4, 9, 11>, <6, 10, 14>, <7, 9, 12>, <7, 9, 13>, <7, 9, 14>, <8, 9, 14>, <10, 12, 13>, <10, 13, 14>, <12, 13, 14>.
