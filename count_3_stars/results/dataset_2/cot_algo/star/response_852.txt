Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 14) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 8) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 18) (13, 17) (13, 8) (10, 15) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 16) (2, 0) (18, 8) (18, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (1, 15) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 6) (7, 16) (16, 2) (16, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 5) (19, 10) (19, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (12, 3) (12, 6) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the graph can be identified as follows:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 2, 5, and 11.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 15.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 4.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 12, and 4.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 2, and 6.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 2, 6, and 0.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 12, and 4.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 10, 18, 16, and 6.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 14, 17, 13, and 5.
Node 10 is connected to nodes 15, 14, 11, 7, and 19.
Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 19, and 0.
Node 12 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
Node 13 is connected to nodes 17 and 8.
Node 14 is connected to nodes 15, 17, 8, and 10.
Node 15 is connected to nodes 1, 10, and 14.
Node 16 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
Node 17 is connected to nodes 14, 8, and 13.
Node 18 is connected to nodes 8 and 7.
Node 19 is connected to nodes 10 and 11.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [1] 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms [1] 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms [1] 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms [1] 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [4] 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [4] 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [4] 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [4] 3-stars.
Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [10] 3-stars.
Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it forms [1] 3-star.
Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [4] 3-stars.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms [1] 3-star.
Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms [1] 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 11>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 5, 6>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 12>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 16>, <6, 7, 16>, <7, 10, 18>, <7, 10, 19>, <7, 16, 2>, <8, 14, 17>, <8, 14, 10>, <8, 14, 15>, <8, 14, 17>, <10, 14, 15>, <10, 14, 17>, <10, 14, 15>, <10, 14, 17>, <10, 14, 15>, <10, 14, 17>, <13, 17, 8>, <17, 14, 15>, <17, 14, 8>, <17, 14, 15>, <17, 14, 8>, <17, 14, 15>, <17, 14, 8>, <19, 10, 11>
