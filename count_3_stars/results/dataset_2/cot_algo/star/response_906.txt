Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 1) (0, 27) (0, 23) (0, 1) (27, 0) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 29) (3, 25) (3, 26) (3, 22) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 26) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 15) (6, 16) (9, 10) (9, 25) (9, 18) (22, 3) (23, 0) (23, 16) (23, 28) (23, 19) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 28) (21, 20) (21, 29) (28, 23) (28, 13) (28, 12) (28, 2) (15, 10) (15, 17) (15, 5) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 1) (26, 3) (26, 25) (26, 2) (2, 28) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 20) (24, 8) (24, 5) (24, 29) (29, 11) (29, 21) (29, 24) (12, 8) (12, 28) (12, 20) (12, 5) (12, 14) (20, 21) (20, 2) (20, 12) (20, 5) (19, 4) (19, 23) (19, 2) (5, 15) (5, 24) (5, 12) (5, 20) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 12) (16, 6) (16, 23) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 18) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 23, 27}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 7, 18}
- Node 2: {19, 20, 26, 28}
- Node 3: {22, 25, 26}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 17, 19}
- Node 5: {12, 15, 20, 24}
- Node 6: {16}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 14}
- Node 8: {12, 13, 24, 28}
- Node 9: {10, 18, 25}
- Node 10: {9, 11, 15, 17}
- Node 11: {10, 29}
- Node 12: {5, 8, 14, 20, 28}
- Node 13: {8, 28}
- Node 14: {7, 12, 18}
- Node 15: {5, 10, 17}
- Node 16: {6, 23}
- Node 17: {4, 10, 15}
- Node 18: {1, 9, 14}
- Node 19: {2, 4, 23}
- Node 20: {2, 5, 12, 21}
- Node 21: {20, 29}
- Node 22: {3}
- Node 23: {0, 16, 19, 28}
- Node 24: {5, 8, 29}
- Node 25: {3, 9, 26}
- Node 26: {2, 3, 25}
- Node 27: {0}
- Node 28: {2, 8, 12, 13, 23}
- Node 29: {11, 21, 24}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 4, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, and 18 each have 3 neighbors, so there are 8 3-stars.
- Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 4, 18)>, <4, (1, 7, 19)>, <7, (1, 4, 14)>, <10, (9, 15, 17)>, <12, (5, 8, 14)>, <15, (5, 10, 17)>, <17, (4, 10, 15)>, <18, (1, 9, 14)>.
