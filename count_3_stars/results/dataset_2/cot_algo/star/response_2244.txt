Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 1) (1, 16) (1, 7) (1, 10) (3, 11) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 15) (13, 19) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 18) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 9) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 15) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 9) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 19) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 5) (2, 14) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 9) (5, 16) (5, 3) (5, 14) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {4, 9, 19}
- Node 1: {7, 10, 16}
- Node 2: {14}
- Node 3: {5, 11}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 14, 16}
- Node 6: {4, 10, 14, 19}
- Node 7: {1, 12, 19}
- Node 8: {4, 14, 15}
- Node 9: {0, 15, 18}
- Node 10: {1, 6, 17, 19}
- Node 11: {3, 15, 16}
- Node 12: {7, 17, 18}
- Node 13: {19}
- Node 14: {2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 15: {8, 9, 11}
- Node 16: {1, 5, 11}
- Node 17: {10, 12, 18}
- Node 18: {9, 12, 17}
- Node 19: {0, 6, 7, 10, 13}

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [3]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 10: [1]
- Node 11: [1]
- Node 12: [1]
- Node 14: [1]
- Node 15: [1]
- Node 16: [1]
- Node 17: [1]
- Node 18: [1]
- Node 19: [1]

The total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 9, 19)>
<1, (7, 10, 16)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (4, 10, 14, 19)>
<7, (1, 12, 19)>
<8, (4, 14, 15)>
<10, (1, 6, 17, 19)>
<11, (3, 15, 16)>
<12, (7, 17, 18)>
<14, (2, 5, 6, 8)>
<15, (8, 9, 11)>
<16, (1, 5, 11)>
<17, (10, 12, 18)>
<18, (9, 12, 17)>
