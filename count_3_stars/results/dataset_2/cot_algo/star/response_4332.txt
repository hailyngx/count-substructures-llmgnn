Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 18) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 15) (8, 10) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 15) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (15, 4) (15, 14) (15, 2) (15, 5) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 9) (16, 7) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 19) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 18) (19, 4) (19, 6) (19, 17) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 11) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 7) (12, 0) (13, 1) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {14, 18, 12, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 11, 14, 13}
- Node 2: {15, 6, 11}
- Node 3: {1, 14, 10, 5, 18}
- Node 4: {19, 11, 15}
- Node 5: {3, 15, 18}
- Node 6: {17, 7, 2, 11, 19}
- Node 7: {16, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {10}
- Node 9: {0, 10, 7}
- Node 10: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 11: {1, 4, 6, 2}
- Node 12: {0}
- Node 13: {1}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 0, 15}
- Node 15: {4, 14, 2, 5}
- Node 16: {7}
- Node 17: {6, 19}
- Node 18: {3, 0, 5}
- Node 19: {4, 6, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, 14, 18>
- <0, 14, 15>
- <0, 14, 12>
- <1, 3, 13>
- <3, 5, 18>
- <6, 2, 11>
- <6, 4, 19>
- <6, 11, 2>
- <6, 11, 4>
- <6, 11, 2>
- <6, 17, 19>
- <7, 16, 6>
- <9, 7, 10>
- <10, 3, 5>
- <11, 2, 15>
- <14, 1, 13>
- <15, 4, 19>
