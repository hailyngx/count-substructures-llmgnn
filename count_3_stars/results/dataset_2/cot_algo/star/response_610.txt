Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 13) (14, 3) (14, 13) (17, 12) (17, 5) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 5) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 18) (12, 6) (0, 3) (0, 10) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 9) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 18) (8, 15) (8, 18) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 2) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 13) (18, 8) (18, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 2) (1, 18) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 10}
- Node 1: {18}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 14, 15}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 11}
- Node 5: {2, 10, 12, 17, 19}
- Node 6: {2, 11, 12}
- Node 7: {3, 4}
- Node 8: {15, 18}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 19}
- Node 10: {0, 5, 18}
- Node 11: {4, 6, 16, 19}
- Node 12: {5, 6, 17, 18}
- Node 13: {8, 14, 18, 15}
- Node 14: {3, 13}
- Node 15: {3, 8, 13, 16}
- Node 16: {11, 15}
- Node 17: {5, 12}
- Node 18: {1, 8, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 19: {5, 9, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- 3-star at node 3: <3, (0, 7, 14)>, <3, (0, 15, 7)>, <3, (15, 7, 14)>
- 3-star at node 5: <5, (2, 10, 12)>, <5, (2, 19, 11)>
- 3-star at node 11: <11, (4, 6, 16)>, <11, (4, 19, 5)>
- 3-star at node 18: <18, (1, 8, 14)>, <18, (1, 8, 13)>, <18, (1, 8, 15)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [12].
