Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (2, 4) (2, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 7) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 7) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 10) (14, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are neighbors to each node:
- Node 0: 5, 4
- Node 1: 3, 10
- Node 2: 4, 12
- Node 3: 5, 6, 1, 7
- Node 4: 8, 12, 0, 10, 2
- Node 5: 9, 13, 11, 0, 3, 7
- Node 6: 7, 3, 12, 13
- Node 7: 5, 6, 3, 11, 13, 14
- Node 8: 9, 4, 11, 12
- Node 9: 5, 8, 11, 14
- Node 10: 1, 4, 13, 14
- Node 11: 5, 9, 8, 14, 7
- Node 12: 6, 4, 8, 2
- Node 13: 5, 6, 10, 7
- Node 14: 9, 11, 10, 7

Now let's determine the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 13, and 11: <5, 9, 13, 11>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 11: <9, 5, 8, 11>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 13, and 14: <10, 1, 13, 14>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 8: <11, 5, 9, 8>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 10: <13, 5, 6, 10>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 11, and 10: <14, 9, 11, 10>

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us: [6].
