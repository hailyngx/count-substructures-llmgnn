Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 4) (13, 29) (22, 18) (22, 10) (15, 5) (15, 21) (27, 14) (4, 13) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 29) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (9, 1) (26, 24) (26, 14) (26, 6) (6, 26) (6, 18) (6, 19) (18, 22) (18, 6) (18, 11) (18, 28) (18, 25) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 8) (20, 23) (28, 18) (28, 29) (28, 17) (28, 5) (29, 13) (29, 4) (29, 28) (29, 23) (19, 6) (19, 23) (24, 26) (24, 16) (24, 0) (24, 10) (17, 28) (17, 5) (8, 12) (8, 14) (23, 20) (23, 29) (23, 19) (23, 3) (14, 27) (14, 26) (14, 8) (14, 16) (2, 21) (2, 25) (0, 24) (0, 16) (0, 25) (0, 5) (16, 12) (16, 24) (16, 14) (16, 0) (21, 13) (21, 15) (21, 2) (21, 11) (25, 18) (25, 2) (25, 0) (25, 1) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 10) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 25) (10, 22) (10, 24) (10, 3) (5, 15) (5, 28) (5, 17) (5, 0) (11, 18) (11, 21) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 1 neighbor
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 2 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 2 neighbors
- Node 16: 4 neighbors
- Node 17: 2 neighbors
- Node 18: 5 neighbors
- Node 19: 2 neighbors
- Node 20: 1 neighbor
- Node 21: 4 neighbors
- Node 22: 2 neighbors
- Node 23: 4 neighbors
- Node 24: 4 neighbors
- Node 25: 4 neighbors
- Node 26: 3 neighbors
- Node 27: 1 neighbor
- Node 28: 4 neighbors
- Node 29: 4 neighbors

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <18, (5, 25, 28)>, <18, (6, 22, 28)>, <18, (18, 25, 28)>
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <24, (0, 10, 26)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <6, (18, 19, 26)>
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <28, (5, 17, 28)>, <28, (18, 25, 29)>
- Node 29 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <29, (4, 23, 28)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [11] 3-stars in the graph.
