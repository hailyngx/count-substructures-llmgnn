Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 28) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 25) (4, 27) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (10, 1) (10, 16) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 9) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 19) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 26) (1, 22) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 5) (17, 29) (17, 0) (17, 24) (17, 21) (29, 17) (29, 13) (29, 25) (29, 22) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 14) (28, 15) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 20) (22, 1) (22, 26) (22, 29) (22, 21) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 28) (21, 22) (21, 16) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 20) (0, 11) (0, 17) (0, 8) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 9) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 13) (25, 24) (16, 10) (16, 21) (5, 12) (5, 26) (5, 18) (5, 8) (5, 20) (2, 7) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 5) (14, 6) (14, 23) (3, 19) (19, 12) (19, 3) (9, 11) (9, 23) (9, 24) (13, 29) (13, 25) (20, 28) (20, 18) (20, 5) (24, 17) (24, 25) (24, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 11, 17, 8
- Node 1: 10, 15, 22, 26
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 19
- Node 4: 7, 12, 27
- Node 5: 8, 12, 18, 20, 26
- Node 6: 14, 21, 28
- Node 7: 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 0, 5, 7
- Node 9: 11, 23, 24
- Node 10: 1, 16
- Node 11: 0, 9, 23
- Node 12: 4, 5, 19, 27
- Node 13: 25, 29
- Node 14: 6, 23
- Node 15: 1, 28
- Node 16: 10, 21
- Node 17: 0, 21, 24, 29
- Node 18: 5, 20, 26
- Node 19: 3, 12
- Node 20: 5, 18, 28
- Node 21: 6, 16, 17, 22, 28
- Node 22: 1, 21, 26, 29
- Node 23: 11, 14, 9
- Node 24: 9, 17, 25
- Node 25: 13, 24, 27, 29
- Node 26: 1, 5, 18, 22
- Node 27: 4, 12, 25
- Node 28: 6, 15, 20, 21
- Node 29: 13, 17, 22, 25

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (8, 12, 19)>
<5, (8, 18, 20)>
<5, (12, 18, 26)>
<5, (18, 20, 26)>
<21, (16, 28, 20)>
<21, (17, 22, 29)>
<21, (22, 26, 17)>
<21, (22, 26, 28)>
<22, (1, 21, 26)>
<24, (9, 17, 25)>
