Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (9, 15) (9, 12) (4, 18) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 15) (1, 15) (1, 12) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 1) (19, 18) (19, 7) (19, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 16) (6, 19) (6, 17) (3, 8) (3, 7) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 13) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 17) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) 

Response:
The central idea is to first determine the neighbor set for each node. Then, for each node that has three or more neighbors, we calculate the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.
Let's start by listing the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: [2, 10]
Node 1 neighbors: [15, 12]
Node 2 neighbors: [13, 10, 15, 0]
Node 3 neighbors: [8, 7]
Node 4 neighbors: [18, 13]
Node 5 neighbors: [8]
Node 6 neighbors: [19, 17]
Node 7 neighbors: [8, 19, 14, 3, 13]
Node 8 neighbors: [5, 11, 7, 3]
Node 9 neighbors: [15, 12]
Node 10 neighbors: [2, 18, 0, 16]
Node 11 neighbors: [8, 14, 12]
Node 12 neighbors: [9, 1, 11, 14]
Node 13 neighbors: [2, 7, 4]
Node 14 neighbors: [11, 7, 16, 12]
Node 15 neighbors: [9, 2, 18, 1]
Node 16 neighbors: [10, 14, 17]
Node 17 neighbors: [6, 16]
Node 18 neighbors: [4, 19, 10, 15]
Node 19 neighbors: [18, 7, 6]

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of unique 3-stars for each:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors -> 1
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors -> 1

Adding up the total number of unique 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
- <2, (13, 10, 15)>
- <7, (19, 14, 3)>
- <8, (5, 11, 7)>
- <12, (9, 11, 14)>
- <14, (11, 16, 7)>
- <15, (9, 18, 1)>
- <16, (10, 17, 14)>
- <18, (4, 19, 10)>
- <19, (18, 7, 6)>
