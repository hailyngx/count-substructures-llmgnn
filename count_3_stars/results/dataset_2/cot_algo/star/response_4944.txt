Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 12) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 13) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 8) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 9) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 6, 10}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 2, 10, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 2, 11, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {13}

Now, we identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1:  \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2:  \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3:  \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4:  \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7:  \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8:  \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9:  \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10:  \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11:  \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12:  \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes that have three or more neighbors, we get a total of \( 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 81 \) 3-stars in this graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [81].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
