Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 3) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 19) (22, 25) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (21, 13) (21, 2) (8, 23) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 25) (23, 28) (23, 27) (0, 8) (0, 20) (0, 17) (20, 0) (20, 18) (2, 4) (2, 21) (2, 15) (18, 20) (18, 25) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 3) (15, 2) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 29) (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 27) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 28) (17, 0) (17, 16) (17, 11) (5, 13) (5, 15) (19, 22) (19, 14) (19, 24) (29, 15) (29, 9) (29, 24) (29, 10) (10, 12) (10, 29) (10, 26) (10, 28) (10, 14) (26, 10) (26, 6) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (6, 26) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 27) (16, 17) (16, 24) (16, 14) (24, 19) (24, 29) (24, 16) (24, 14) (27, 23) (27, 9) (27, 11) (28, 23) (28, 1) (28, 10) (25, 22) (25, 23) (25, 18) (14, 19) (14, 10) (14, 16) (14, 24) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 20, 17}
- Node 1: Neighbors {15, 11}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 21, 15}
- Node 3: Neighbors {13, 7, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {13, 15}
- Node 6: Neighbors {26}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {23, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {22, 29, 27}
- Node 10: Neighbors {12, 29, 26, 28, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 17, 27}
- Node 12: Neighbors {15, 10, 3}
- Node 13: Neighbors {22, 5, 21, 3}
- Node 14: Neighbors {19, 10, 16, 24}
- Node 15: Neighbors {2, 12, 1, 5, 29}
- Node 16: Neighbors {17, 24, 14}
- Node 17: Neighbors {0, 16, 11}
- Node 18: Neighbors {20, 25}
- Node 19: Neighbors {22, 14, 24}
- Node 20: Neighbors {0, 18}
- Node 21: Neighbors {13, 2}
- Node 22: Neighbors {13, 9, 19, 25}
- Node 23: Neighbors {8, 25, 28, 27}
- Node 24: Neighbors {19, 29, 16, 14}
- Node 25: Neighbors {22, 23, 18}
- Node 26: Neighbors {10, 6}
- Node 27: Neighbors {23, 9, 11}
- Node 28: Neighbors {23, 1, 10}
- Node 29: Neighbors {15, 9, 24, 10}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 32 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

Unique 3-stars found:
<13, (21, 3, 5)>, <13, (22, 21, 3)>, <13, (22, 3, 5)>, <13, (22, 21, 5)>,
<22, (25, 19, 14)>, <22, (25, 19, 24)>, <22, (25, 14, 24)>, <22, (19, 14, 24)>,
<15, (1, 29, 5)>, <15, (1, 29, 10)>, <15, (1, 5, 29)>, <15, (1, 10, 29)>,
<15, (5, 29, 10)>, <10, (26, 14, 24)>, <10, (26, 14, 29)>, <10, (26, 24, 29)>,
<10, (14, 24, 29)>
