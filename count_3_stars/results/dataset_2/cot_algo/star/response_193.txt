Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9 (degree 6)
- Node 1: 0, 3 (degree 2)
- Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 8, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6 (degree 3)
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 8: 2, 5, 7 (degree 3)
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6 (degree 5)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with (2, 6, 9)
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with (0, 6, 9)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with (0, 2, 9)
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with (5, 8, 9)

Total number of 3-stars: 4

Thus, the final number to be represented inside brackets is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>
