Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 11) (8, 2) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 4) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges for each node:

- Node 0: (0, 7), (0, 4), (0, 6)
- Node 1: (1, 11), (1, 7), (1, 2), (1, 4)
- Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 1), (2, 3)
- Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 12), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 4)
- Node 4: (4, 10), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 14), (4, 3)
- Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 3), (5, 7)
- Node 6: (6, 12), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
- Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 0), (7, 1)
- Node 8: (8, 11), (8, 2)
- Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 2), (9, 11), (9, 13), (9, 12)
- Node 10: (10, 11), (10, 4), (10, 13)
- Node 11: (11, 9), (11, 10), (11, 1), (11, 13), (11, 8)
- Node 12: (12, 9), (12, 14), (12, 6), (12, 3)
- Node 13: (13, 5), (13, 9), (13, 10), (13, 11), (13, 14)
- Node 14: (14, 12), (14, 13), (14, 4)

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star. (1, 7, 2), (1, 7, 4), (1, 2, 4)
- Node 2: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 3: Forms 1 3-star. (3, 2, 6), (3, 2, 4)
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star. (4, 1, 6), (4, 1, 3)
- Node 5: Forms 2 3-stars. (5, 9, 13), (5, 9, 7)
- Node 6: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 7: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 8: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 9: Forms 2 3-stars. (9, 11, 13), (9, 11, 12)
- Node 10: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 11: Forms 3 3-stars. (11, 10, 13), (11, 10, 4), (11, 1, 13)
- Node 12: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 13: Forms 3 3-stars. (13, 10, 11), (13, 10, 14), (13, 11, 14)
- Node 14: Does not form any 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3] = [13].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 7, 2>
- <1, 7, 4>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <3, 2, 6>
- <3, 2, 4>
- <4, 1, 6>
- <4, 1, 3>
- <5, 9, 13>
- <5, 9, 7>
- <9, 11, 13>
- <9, 11, 12>
- <11, 10, 13>
- <11, 10, 4>
- <11, 1, 13>
- <13, 10, 11>
- <13, 10, 14>
- <13, 11, 14>
