Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 17) (7, 12) (7, 16) (14, 6) (14, 5) (17, 4) (17, 13) (17, 19) (8, 4) (8, 19) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 6) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 10) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 6) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 6) (9, 3) (9, 18) (9, 16) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 15) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 16) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 2) (18, 9) (18, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 10, 18}
- Node 1: {12, 5, 15}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 16}
- Node 3: {2, 9, 11}
- Node 4: {0, 8, 17}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 13, 14, 19}
- Node 6: {11, 14, 15, 16, 19}
- Node 7: {12, 16}
- Node 8: {4, 19}
- Node 9: {3, 16, 18}
- Node 10: {0, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {3, 6}
- Node 12: {1, 7, 10, 16}
- Node 13: {5, 10, 17}
- Node 14: {5, 6}
- Node 15: {1, 6}
- Node 16: {2, 6, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 17: {4, 13, 19}
- Node 18: {0, 9}
- Node 19: {5, 6, 8, 17}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 16, 17, and 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 6 3-stars in total (1 for each of the 6 nodes).
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 85 \)
  
Hence, the total number of 3-stars formed in the given graph is [91].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 4, 17>
- <0, 10, 12>
- <0, 10, 18>
- <0, 10, 13>
- <0, 18, 9>
- <1, 5, 12>
- <1, 5, 15>
- <1, 6, 12>
- <1, 6, 15>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 3, 16>
- <2, 5, 13>
- <2, 5, 14>
- <2, 5, 19>
- <3, 9, 11>
- <3, 9, 16>
- <4, 8, 19>
- <4, 17, 13>
- <4, 17, 19>
- <5, 13, 17>
- <5, 13, 19>
- <5, 14, 6>
