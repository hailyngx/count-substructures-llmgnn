Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {14, 4, 12, 13, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {8, 13, 6, 3, 14}
- Node 3: {10, 2, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 12, 1}
- Node 5: {8, 13, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {11, 2, 0, 12, 7}
- Node 7: {10, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 3}
- Node 9: {0, 12, 1}
- Node 10: {11, 3, 12, 7, 13}
- Node 11: {10, 6}
- Node 12: {10, 0, 14, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 13: {10, 2, 0, 5}
- Node 14: {2, 0, 12}

Calculating the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 90 \)

Thus, there are a total of 90 3-stars in this graph. 
<0, (4, 12, 13)>, <2, (8, 13, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 12)>, <5, (8, 1, 4)>, <6, (2, 0, 12)>, <10, (3, 7, 12)>.
So, the final answer is [90].
