Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 16) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 5) (1, 4) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 7) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 4) (2, 16) (18, 7) (18, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (16, 3) (16, 10) (16, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (14, 19) (14, 13) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 9) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 14) (5, 15) (5, 11) (5, 12) (9, 10) (9, 7) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 5) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 11) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {19, 13}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {16}
- Node 3: {7, 6, 16}
- Node 4: {1, 17, 8, 6}
- Node 5: {15, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {3, 10, 4, 11}
- Node 7: {3, 17, 18, 9}
- Node 8: {15, 17, 4}
- Node 9: {10, 7}
- Node 10: {17, 6, 9, 16}
- Node 11: {5, 6, 12}
- Node 12: {17, 18, 11, 5}
- Node 13: {15, 0, 14}
- Node 14: {19, 13}
- Node 15: {19, 8, 13, 5}
- Node 16: {3, 10, 2}
- Node 17: {10, 4, 8, 7, 12}
- Node 18: {7, 12}
- Node 19: {15, 0, 14}

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 3: 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5: 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7: 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8: 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 10: 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 12: 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 13: 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 15: 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 17: 5 neighbors, can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 19: 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (1, 17, 8, 6)>
<6, (3, 10, 4, 11)>
<7, (3, 17, 18, 9)>
<10, (17, 4, 8, 12)>
<12, (17, 18, 11, 5)>
<17, (10, 4, 8, 7)>
