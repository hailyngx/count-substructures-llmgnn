Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 10) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 12) (13, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 17) (0, 12) (0, 2) (16, 7) (16, 18) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 9) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 15) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 14) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 17) (17, 3) (17, 11) (17, 2) (19, 11) (19, 10) (15, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 6) (10, 12) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 10) (14, 18) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: {3, 8}
2: {0, 5, 6, 17}
3: {1, 10, 11, 17}
4: {6, 10}
5: {2, 8, 12, 13, 18}
6: {2, 4, 10, 11}
7: {8, 9, 11, 16}
8: {1, 5, 7}
9: {7, 15, 18}
10: {3, 4, 6, 12, 19}
11: {3, 6, 7, 17, 19}
12: {0, 5, 10}
13: {5}
14: {18}
15: {9}
16: {7, 18}
17: {2, 3, 11}
18: {5, 9, 14, 16}
19: {10, 11}

Now, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 18

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 41

Therefore, the final answer is [41]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (0, 6, 17)>, <3, (1, 17, 11)>, <5, (2, 12, 10)>, 
<6, (2, 4, 10)>, <7, (8, 16, 11)>, <8, (1, 7, 5)>, 
<10, (3, 6, 12)>, <11, (3, 17, 19)>, <18, (5, 9, 16)>.
