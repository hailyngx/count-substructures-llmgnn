Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges provided, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {5, 4, 7, 2, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 3, 0}
- Node 3: {9, 6, 2, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 0, 1}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 4, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 3}
- Node 7: {9, 6, 4, 0, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 2, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 3, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 3-stars: 1
- Node 8, 3-stars: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
