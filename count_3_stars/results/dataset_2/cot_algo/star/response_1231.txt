Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 1) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4, 7

Now, let's see which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3, 4, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Next, calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing these up: 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 6, 4>
- <0, 7, 5>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <4, 1, 5>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <7, 5, 8>
