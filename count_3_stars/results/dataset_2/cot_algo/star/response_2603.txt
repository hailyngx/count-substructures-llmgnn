Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 12) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {13}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6, 8, 14}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {8, 9, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 12}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {4, 5, 12}
- Node 12: {1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 8, 10}
- Node 14: {2, 7, 9}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (4, 8, 12)>
- Node 2 forms 4 3-stars: <2, (3, 6, 14)>, <2, (3, 7, 14)>, <2, (6, 8, 14)>, <2, (7, 8, 14)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 6, 13)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 7, 12)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (8, 9, 12)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 13, 10)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (5, 12, 14)>
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star: <12, (1, 4, 11)>

Adding all these 3-stars together, we have a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
