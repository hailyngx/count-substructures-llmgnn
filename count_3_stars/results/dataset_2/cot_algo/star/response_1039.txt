Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 25) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 4) (25, 23) (25, 3) (25, 2) (8, 23) (8, 29) (8, 15) (8, 21) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 19) (26, 14) (26, 16) (26, 27) (26, 4) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 26) (4, 21) (27, 26) (27, 14) (27, 10) (27, 13) (20, 14) (20, 5) (20, 10) (29, 8) (29, 16) (29, 12) (29, 11) (11, 29) (14, 1) (14, 26) (14, 27) (14, 20) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 9) (10, 27) (10, 20) (19, 22) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 28) (17, 28) (17, 7) (28, 19) (28, 17) (28, 12) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 15) (6, 16) (24, 13) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 13) (2, 25) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 21) (9, 0) (9, 15) (21, 22) (21, 8) (21, 4) (21, 2) (5, 20) (5, 0) (16, 26) (16, 29) (16, 6) (16, 2) (12, 29) (12, 28) (13, 27) (13, 0) (13, 24) (13, 15) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {5, 9, 13}
Node 1: {4, 14, 19}
Node 2: {19, 21, 25, 16}
Node 3: {4, 7, 25}
Node 4: {1, 21, 26, 3}
Node 5: {0, 20}
Node 6: {16}
Node 7: {3, 15, 17}
Node 8: {21, 23, 15, 29}
Node 9: {0, 15}
Node 10: {20, 27}
Node 11: {29}
Node 12: {28, 29}
Node 13: {0, 15, 24, 27}
Node 14: {1, 20, 26, 27}
Node 15: {7, 8, 9, 13}
Node 16: {2, 6, 26, 29}
Node 17: {7, 28}
Node 18: {22}
Node 19: {1, 2, 22, 28}
Node 20: {5, 10, 14}
Node 21: {2, 4, 8}
Node 22: {18, 19, 21, 23}
Node 23: {22, 25, 8}
Node 24: {13}
Node 25: {2, 3, 23}
Node 26: {4, 14, 16, 27}
Node 27: {10, 13, 26, 14}
Node 28: {19, 12, 17}
Node 29: {8, 11, 12, 16}

Next, we determine the 3-star formations:
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].

Unique 3-stars:
<15, (7, 8, 13)>
<16, (2, 26, 29)>
<19, (1, 2, 28)>
<26, (4, 14, 27)>
<27, (14, 26, 10)>
<28, (17, 12, 19)>
<29, (8, 11, 12)>
