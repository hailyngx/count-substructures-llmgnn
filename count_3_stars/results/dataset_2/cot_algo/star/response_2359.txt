Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 14) (2, 8) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 1) (18, 3) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 14) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 19) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 17) (3, 18) (1, 18) (1, 10) (19, 0) (19, 17) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 19) (4, 10) (4, 15) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (14, 9) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 12) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {8, 7, 19}
Node 1: {18, 10}
Node 2: {8}
Node 3: {18}
Node 4: {10, 15}
Node 5: {13, 17, 7}
Node 6: {16, 9, 10, 15}
Node 7: {5, 0, 17}
Node 8: {16, 9, 2, 0}
Node 9: {6, 8, 15, 14}
Node 10: {4, 18, 6, 1}
Node 11: {17}
Node 12: {13, 14}
Node 13: {5, 12, 15, 14}
Node 14: {9, 18, 13, 12}
Node 15: {6, 9, 13, 4}
Node 16: {17, 8, 6}
Node 17: {11, 16, 5, 7, 19}
Node 18: {14, 10, 1, 3}
Node 19: {0, 17}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: [1]
Node 1: [1]
Node 4: [1]
Node 5: [1]
Node 6: [1]
Node 7: [1]
Node 8: [1]
Node 9: [1]
Node 10: [1]
Node 13: [1]
Node 14: [1]
Node 15: [1]
Node 16: [1]
Node 17: [1]
Node 18: [1]
Node 19: [1]

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (8, 7, 19)>
<1, (18, 10, 6)>
<4, (10, 15, 6)>
<5, (13, 17, 7)>
<6, (16, 9, 15)>
<7, (5, 0, 17)>
<8, (16, 9, 15)>
<9, (6, 8, 15)>
<10, (4, 18, 6)>
<13, (5, 15, 17)>
<14, (9, 13, 18)>
<15, (6, 9, 13)>
<16, (8, 6, 17)>
<17, (6, 16, 19)>
<18, (1, 10, 14)>
