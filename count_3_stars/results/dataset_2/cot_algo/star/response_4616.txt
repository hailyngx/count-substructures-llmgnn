Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 0) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 11) 

Response:
We first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 9, 8, 13, 10, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 2, 14, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 1, 11}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 1, 7, 13}
- Node 4: {10, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 3, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 10, 11}
- Node 8: {9, 10, 13, 0, 12}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 2, 0}
- Node 10: {11, 0, 8, 4, 7}
- Node 11: {10, 7, 2}
- Node 12: {8, 13, 4, 14}
- Node 13: {6, 3, 8, 12, 0}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 0, 12}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 13: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 64

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 8, 13>
<0, 9, 14>
<0, 8, 10>
<0, 13, 14>
<1, 2, 14>
<1, 3, 7>
<3, 6, 13>
<3, 7, 10>
<8, 10, 13>
