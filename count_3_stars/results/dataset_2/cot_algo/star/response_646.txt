Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 15) (14, 0) (14, 10) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 13) (1, 6) (1, 8) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 19) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 19) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 18) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 15) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (9, 4) (9, 17) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 10) (18, 6) (18, 15) (18, 8) (18, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 4) (17, 7) (17, 8) (17, 9) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {14, 3, 15}
- Node 1: {8, 6}
- Node 2: {7, 12, 19}
- Node 3: {0, 11, 6, 5}
- Node 4: {9, 13, 10}
- Node 5: {3, 18, 10}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 18, 19}
- Node 7: {12, 10, 2, 13, 17}
- Node 8: {12, 1, 17, 18}
- Node 9: {4, 17}
- Node 10: {7, 14, 4, 5}
- Node 11: {3, 13}
- Node 12: {7, 2, 8}
- Node 13: {7, 11, 4}
- Node 14: {0, 10}
- Node 15: {0, 19, 18}
- Node 17: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 18: {6, 15, 8, 5}
- Node 19: {2, 6, 15}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 18. Therefore, the answer is [18].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, 3, 15>
<3, 6, 18>
<7, 10, 14>
<7, 12, 2>
<8, 12, 17>
<10, 4, 5>
<12, 2, 8>
<15, 0, 19>
<18, 5, 8>
<19, 6, 15>
