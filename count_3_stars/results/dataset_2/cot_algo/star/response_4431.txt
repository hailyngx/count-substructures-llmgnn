Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 9) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighboring nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {2, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 10}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 12}
- Node 8: {2, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {4, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {6, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {8, 9, 10}
- Node 12: {1, 5, 7, 13}
- Node 13: {4, 5, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {3, 5, 8, 9, 10}

Now, we'll determine the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 68

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [68].
