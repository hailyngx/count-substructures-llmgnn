Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (9, 28) (9, 11) (26, 19) (26, 27) (0, 24) (0, 11) (0, 19) (27, 26) (27, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 22) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 20) (3, 4) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 18) (23, 18) (23, 17) (15, 8) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 14) (20, 3) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 10) (19, 26) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 25) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (21, 11) (21, 22) (7, 6) (7, 17) (25, 19) (25, 24) (29, 9) (29, 22) (14, 15) (14, 18) (28, 9) (28, 3) (28, 13) (28, 18) (17, 23) (17, 7) (17, 4) (2, 27) (2, 22) (2, 24) (22, 1) (22, 21) (22, 29) (22, 2) (5, 1) (16, 13) (16, 4) (24, 0) (24, 25) (24, 2) (18, 8) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 28) (18, 12) (12, 20) (12, 18) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 16) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 21) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 16) (4, 10) (10, 20) (10, 4) 

Response:
First, let's organize the given edges by each node:

Node 0: {24, 11, 19}
Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 13, 22}
Node 2: {27, 22, 24}
Node 3: {28, 20, 4, 1}
Node 4: {3, 17, 16, 10}
Node 5: {1}
Node 6: {1, 8, 7}
Node 7: {6, 17}
Node 8: {11, 6, 15, 18}
Node 9: {29, 28, 11}
Node 10: {20, 4}
Node 11: {9, 0, 21, 8}
Node 12: {20, 18}
Node 13: {1, 28, 16}
Node 14: {15, 18}
Node 15: {8, 20, 19, 14}
Node 16: {13, 4}
Node 17: {23, 7, 4}
Node 18: {23, 28, 14, 12, 8}
Node 19: {26, 0, 15, 25}
Node 20: {3, 15, 10, 12}
Node 21: {11, 22}
Node 22: {1, 21, 29, 2}
Node 23: {18, 17}
Node 24: {0, 25, 2}
Node 25: {19, 24}
Node 26: {19, 27}
Node 27: {26, 2}
Node 28: {9, 3, 13, 18}
Node 29: {9, 22}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node.

Number of 3-stars formed by each node:
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 25: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 26: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 27: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 13, 22)>
<1, (3, 5, 13)>
<1, (3, 6, 22)>
<1, (5, 6, 22)>
<1, (5, 6, 13)>
<3, (4, 16, 28)>
<3, (4, 17, 28)>
<3, (16, 13, 28)>
<3, (16, 4, 28)>
<6, (7, 17, 18)>
<8, (11, 21, 22)>
<8, (11, 21, 9)>
<8, (11, 21, 28)>
<8, (11, 21, 18)>
<11, (0, 9, 29)>
<15, (14, 18, 28)>
<18, (12, 20, 28)>
<18, (14, 15, 28)>
<18, (14, 15, 18)>
<18, (14, 15, 12)>
<18, (14, 18, 12)>

<22, (2, 24, 25)>
<22, (2, 24, 0)>
<22, (21, 29, 2)>
<22, (21, 29, 9)>
<22, (21, 29, 22)>
<22, (21, 29, 2)>
