Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (14, 4) (14, 1) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {10, 11, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {10, 4, 5, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {6, 13, 7, 3}
- Node 3: {9, 13, 0, 12, 2}
- Node 4: {6, 9, 12, 14, 1}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 12, 1}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 2, 4, 13}
- Node 7: {11, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {9, 10, 13, 5}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 4, 3}
- Node 10: {0, 12, 8, 1}
- Node 11: {7, 0}
- Node 12: {10, 4, 5, 3, 1}
- Node 13: {6, 8, 2, 3}
- Node 14: {4, 1}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 12, and Node 13.

For these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 70

So, the total number of 3-stars is [70].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, 10, 12>
<0, 10, 1>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 12>

<1, 5, 14>
<3, 9, 13>
<3, 12, 10>
<3, 12, 1>
<4, 6, 13>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 9, 8>
<4, 9, 3>
<4, 12, 5>

<4, 14, 1>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 8, 13>
<6, 9, 8>
<9, 8, 13>
<10, 8, 13>
