Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 14) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 1) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 13) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 13) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 5, 12, 13  
Node 1: 0, 8, 11, 13  
Node 2: 4, 7, 10, 12  
Node 3: 4, 6, 10, 12  
Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 14  
Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 8, 11  
Node 6: 3, 5, 9, 12  
Node 7: 2, 14  
Node 8: 1, 5, 9, 11  
Node 9: 6, 8, 10, 11, 14  
Node 10: 2, 3, 9  
Node 11: 1, 5, 8, 9  
Node 12: 0, 2, 3, 6, 13  
Node 13: 0, 1, 12, 14  
Node 14: 4, 7, 9, 13  

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and calculate how many 3-stars each of these nodes participate in:

Node 0: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars  
Node 1: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars  
Node 2: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars  
Node 3: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars  
Node 4: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars  
Node 5: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars  
Node 6: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars  
Node 8: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars  
Node 9: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars  
Node 11: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars  
Node 12: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars  
Node 13: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars  
Node 14: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars  

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 72  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [72], and the unique 3-stars found are:
