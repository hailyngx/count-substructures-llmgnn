Response:
Given the provided information, let's find the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
   - Node 0: {3, 18, 20, 27}
   - Node 1: {4, 13, 15, 20, 23}
   - Node 2: {10, 26}
   - Node 3: {0, 13, 27}
   - Node 4: {1, 7}
   - Node 5: {6, 22, 23}
   - Node 6: {5, 13, 22, 25, 29}
   - Node 7: {4, 12, 28}
   - Node 8: {12, 20}
   - Node 9: {14, 17, 28}
   - Node 10: {2, 11, 26, 28}
   - Node 11: {10, 16}
   - Node 12: {7, 8, 23, 29}
   - Node 13: {1, 3, 6, 16}
   - Node 14: {9, 15, 19}
   - Node 15: {1, 14, 21}
   - Node 16: {11, 13}
   - Node 17: {14, 17, 19, 21, 26}
   - Node 18: {0}
   - Node 19: {14, 17, 20}
   - Node 20: {0, 1, 8, 19, 27}
   - Node 21: {15, 17, 24}
   - Node 22: {5, 6, 23, 25}
   - Node 23: {1, 5, 12, 22}
   - Node 24: {21}
   - Node 25: {6, 22}
   - Node 26: {2, 10, 17}
   - Node 27: {0, 20, 3}
   - Node 28: {7, 9, 10}
   - Node 29: {6, 12}

2. Next, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
   - Node 1: \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars
   - Node 3: \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star
   - Node 6: \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars
   - Node 7: \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star
   - Node 10: \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars
   - Node 12: \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars
   - Node 13: \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars
   - Node 14: \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star
   - Node 17: \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars
   - Node 19: \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star
   - Node 20: \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars
   - Node 21: \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star
   - Node 22: \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars
   - Node 26: \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star
   - Node 27: \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star
   - Node 28: \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star

3. Total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 57\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [57]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (4, 13, 20)>, 
<3, (0, 13, 27)>, 
<6, (5, 22, 23)>, 
<7, (4, 12, 28)>, 
<10, (2, 26, 28)>, 
<12, (8, 23, 29)>, 
<13, (1, 3, 16)>, 
<14, (9, 17, 19)>, 
<17, (14, 19, 21)>, 
<19, (17, 20, 14)>, 
<20, (1, 8, 27)>, 
<21, (15, 17, 24)>, 
<22, (6, 23, 5)>, 
<26, (2, 10, 17)>, 
<27, (3, 0, 20)>, 
<28, (7, 9, 10)>.
