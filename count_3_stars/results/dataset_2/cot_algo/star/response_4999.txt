Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first find the neighbor sets for each node:

1. Node 0: {4, 7, 5}
2. Node 1: {3, 2, 7}
3. Node 2: {6, 9, 1, 3, 4}
4. Node 3: {6, 9, 1, 7, 2, 5}
5. Node 4: {8, 0, 5, 2}
6. Node 5: {6, 3, 4, 7, 8, 0}
7. Node 6: {5, 3, 2}
8. Node 7: {1, 3, 0, 5}
9. Node 8: {9, 4, 5}
10. Node 9: {8, 2, 3}

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors and find the number of 3-stars formed:
Nodes 3, 5, and 8 have three or more neighbors.

For Node 3:
- \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars are formed.

For Node 5:
- \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars are formed.

For Node 8:
- \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star is formed.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the final answer is [41] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (9, 4, 5)>
