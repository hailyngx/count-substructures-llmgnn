Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges with the connections you provided. Let's now find all the 3-stars in this graph.

First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {14, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {26, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {23, 17}
- Node 3: Neighbors {17}
- Node 4: Neighbors {14, 21, 17}
- Node 5: Neighbors {26, 10, 20}
- Node 6: Neighbors {27, 0, 18, 25}
- Node 7: Neighbors {15, 23, 24}
- Node 8: Neighbors {26, 29}
- Node 9: Neighbors {25, 15, 28, 16}
- Node 10: Neighbors {11, 22, 5}
- Node 11: Neighbors {10, 27, 19}
- Node 12: Neighbors {27, 20, 29}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 28}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 22, 4, 29}
- Node 15: Neighbors {9, 7, 17}
- Node 16: Neighbors {9, 22, 20}
- Node 17: Neighbors {3, 15, 2, 4}
- Node 18: Neighbors {26, 21, 23, 6}
- Node 19: Neighbors {11, 24, 29}
- Node 20: Neighbors {12, 5, 16, 24}
- Node 21: Neighbors {4, 18}
- Node 22: Neighbors {10, 14, 16}
- Node 23: Neighbors {18, 2, 7}
- Node 24: Neighbors {20, 19, 7}
- Node 25: Neighbors {9, 27, 6}
- Node 26: Neighbors {1, 18, 5, 8}
- Node 27: Neighbors {11, 12, 25, 6}
- Node 28: Neighbors {9, 13}
- Node 29: Neighbors {12, 14, 19, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars based on the number of neighbors each node has:

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<9, (25, 15, 28)>
<15, (9, 7, 17)>
<16, (9, 22, 20)>
<17, (3, 15, 2)>
<17, (15, 2, 4)>
<18, (26, 21, 23)>
<20, (12, 5, 24)>
<24, (20, 19, 7)>
<27, (11, 25, 6)>
<29, (12, 14, 19)>
