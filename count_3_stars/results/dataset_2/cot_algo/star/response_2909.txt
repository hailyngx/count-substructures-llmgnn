Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 20) (26, 24) (1, 24) (1, 13) (21, 8) (21, 11) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 19) (27, 11) (27, 8) (27, 16) (8, 21) (8, 27) (8, 13) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 19) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 17) (5, 18) (5, 25) (5, 15) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 4) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 23) (20, 9) (20, 17) (20, 4) (20, 16) (28, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 29) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 21) (11, 27) (11, 3) (11, 7) (17, 18) (17, 20) (24, 26) (24, 1) (24, 10) (10, 0) (10, 24) (10, 16) (4, 6) (4, 20) (4, 22) (4, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 14) (7, 15) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 29) (29, 22) (29, 7) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 4) (23, 15) (23, 25) (23, 16) (25, 13) (25, 5) (25, 6) (25, 23) (16, 27) (16, 20) (16, 10) (16, 23) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 3, 10, 14, 19
- Node 1 neighbors: 13, 24
- Node 2 neighbors: 12, 13, 19
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 7, 11
- Node 4 neighbors: 6, 19, 20, 22
- Node 5 neighbors: 6, 15, 18, 25
- Node 6 neighbors: 4, 5, 25, 28
- Node 7 neighbors: 3, 11, 15, 29
- Node 8 neighbors: 13, 21, 27
- Node 9 neighbors: 15, 20, 22
- Node 10 neighbors: 0, 16, 24
- Node 11 neighbors: 3, 7, 21, 27
- Node 12 neighbors: 2, 14, 18
- Node 13 neighbors: 1, 2, 8, 25
- Node 14 neighbors: 0, 12
- Node 15 neighbors: 5, 7, 9, 23
- Node 16 neighbors: 10, 16, 20, 23
- Node 17 neighbors: 18, 20
- Node 18 neighbors: 5, 12, 17
- Node 19 neighbors: 0, 2, 4
- Node 20 neighbors: 4, 16, 17, 20
- Node 21 neighbors: 8, 11
- Node 22 neighbors: 4, 9, 29
- Node 23 neighbors: 15, 16, 25
- Node 24 neighbors: 1, 10, 24
- Node 25 neighbors: 5, 6, 13, 23
- Node 26 neighbors: 24
- Node 27 neighbors: 8, 11, 16
- Node 28 neighbors: 6
- Node 29 neighbors: 7, 22

Nodes 0, 4, 5, 7, 13, 15, 16, 20, 25, and 27 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with these nodes.

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars:
- Nodes 0, 4, 5, 7, 13, 15, 16, 20, 25, and 27 each contribute \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 3, 19>, <4, 6, 25>, <5, 18, 12>, <7, 3, 11>, <13, 8, 25>, <15, 5, 7>, <16, 10, 23>, <20, 17, 18>, <25, 6, 23>, <27, 8, 11>.
