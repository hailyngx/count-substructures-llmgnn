Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 8) (13, 12) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 12) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {5, 4, 3, 11, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 2, 10, 12, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 1, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 3: {7, 1, 0, 6}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 0, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 0, 10}
- Node 6: {3, 11, 14, 8}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 12, 3}
- Node 8: {1, 12, 0, 6, 14}
- Node 9: {14, 10, 7}
- Node 10: {5, 9, 1, 2}
- Node 11: {0, 6, 2}
- Node 12: {7, 1, 2, 13, 8}
- Node 13: {12}
- Node 14: {9, 4, 6, 8}

Now, we will look for nodes with 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 14 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the 3-stars for these nodes:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star formed.
- For the other nodes, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) where n is the number of neighbors.

Calculations:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10
- Node 3: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 5: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10
- Node 10: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10
- Node 14: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (5, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 2, 8)>
<2, (5, 1, 10)>
<3, (7, 0, 1)>
<4, (5, 7, 0)>
<6, (3, 11, 8)>
<7, (9, 4, 12)>
<8, (1, 12, 14)>
<12, (7, 1, 13)>
