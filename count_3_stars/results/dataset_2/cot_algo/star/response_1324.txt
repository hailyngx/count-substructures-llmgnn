Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 8) (9, 1) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 13}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 5, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 5, 8, 12}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 8}
- Node 10: {0, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 13: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 14: {2, 6, 10, 11}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: Ineligible, as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: Ineligible, as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: Ineligible, as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: Eligible.
- Node 4: Eligible.
- Node 5: Eligible.
- Node 6: Eligible.
- Node 7: Eligible.
- Node 8: Eligible.
- Node 9: Ineligible, as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 10: Ineligible, as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 11: Ineligible, as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 12: Eligible.
- Node 13: Ineligible, as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 14: Ineligible, as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- From nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 12, we have 7 nodes.
- We apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these 7 nodes:
  - For each of these nodes, \( \binom{deg}{3} = \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Total 3-stars = 7 * 10 = 70

Therefore, the final answer is [70], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 13)>
- <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- <12, (1, 6, 7)>
