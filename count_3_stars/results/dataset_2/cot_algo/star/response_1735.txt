Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 19) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 15) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (18, 19) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 17) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 14) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 16) (14, 13) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 15) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 17) (15, 9) (15, 11) (15, 6) (17, 19) (17, 7) (17, 4) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 7) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 4) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 16) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {12, 3}
- Node 1: {8, 2}
- Node 2: {1, 12, 13, 14, 16}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6, 14}
- Node 4: {10, 3, 16, 17}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 15}
- Node 7: {6, 13, 17}
- Node 8: {9, 10, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 15, 19}
- Node 10: {8, 4, 13}
- Node 11: {15}
- Node 12: {0, 2}
- Node 13: {10, 2, 7, 0, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 13, 16}
- Node 15: {9, 11, 6}
- Node 16: {2, 4, 14}
- Node 17: {19, 7, 4}
- Node 18: {19}
- Node 19: {9, 18, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 5 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 40

Therefore, the final result is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 12, 14)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (3, 10, 16)>, <7, (6, 13, 17)>, <8, (1, 9, 10)>, <9, (5, 8, 15)>, <13, (0, 7, 14)>, <14, (2, 3, 16)>
