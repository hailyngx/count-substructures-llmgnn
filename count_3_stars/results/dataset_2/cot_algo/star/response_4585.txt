Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 1) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 4) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 1) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 9) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 2) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 9) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 5) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 14) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 12) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 14) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 7) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 12) (2, 1) (2, 16) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 16, 5}
- Node 1: {15, 4, 2}
- Node 2: {1, 16}
- Node 3: {12, 8}
- Node 4: {13, 1, 0}
- Node 5: {10, 8, 0, 12}
- Node 6: {11, 17, 7}
- Node 7: {8, 6, 14}
- Node 8: {3, 13, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {18, 17, 14}
- Node 10: {11, 18, 5}
- Node 11: {10, 18, 6}
- Node 12: {3, 19, 5}
- Node 13: {8, 17, 4}
- Node 14: {16, 9, 7}
- Node 15: {1}
- Node 16: {0, 2, 19, 14}
- Node 17: {13, 6, 9}
- Node 18: {10, 11, 19, 9}
- Node 19: {18, 16, 12}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each node:
- Node 5, Node 8, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 14, and Node 16 each have 4 or more neighbors
- By applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we find that each of these nodes can form 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 7 \times 4 = 28 \), which we should put inside brackets as [28].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (10, 8, 12)>, 
<8, (3, 13, 5)>,
<10, (11, 18, 5)>,
<11, (10, 18, 6)>,
<12, (3, 19, 5)>,
<14, (16, 9, 7)>,
<16, (0, 2, 19)>.
