Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 7) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 0) (15, 10) (15, 16) (15, 9) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 19) (16, 10) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 4) (6, 18) (14, 19) (14, 4) (12, 16) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 15) (9, 19) (18, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 14) (19, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 13, 17}
- Node 2: {1, 3}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 10}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 14, 16}
- Node 5: {0, 8}
- Node 6: {18}
- Node 7: {0, 10, 17}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {11, 15, 17, 19}
- Node 10: {3, 7, 11, 15, 16}
- Node 11: {9, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {16}
- Node 13: {1, 11, 17, 19}
- Node 14: {4, 19}
- Node 15: {9, 10, 16}
- Node 16: {4, 10, 12, 15}
- Node 17: {1, 7, 9, 13, 19}
- Node 18: {6}
- Node 19: {9, 13, 14, 17}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 10 and Node 17 both have 5 neighbors, so each can form \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Summing up, there are \( 10 + 10 = 20 \) 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the final answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <10, (3, 7, 15)>
- <17, (1, 9, 13)>
