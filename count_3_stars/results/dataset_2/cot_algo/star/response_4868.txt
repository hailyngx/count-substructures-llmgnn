Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 12) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 1) (10, 9) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 13}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 3: {11, 14}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 8, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 7, 10}
- Node 10: {2, 9}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 12: {4, 7, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 6, 12}
- Node 14: {2, 8, 11}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars formed by the graph: 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 74

Therefore, the final answer is [74].
