Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 21) (15, 11) (15, 16) (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 25) (21, 15) (21, 1) (21, 14) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 20) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (2, 6) (2, 28) (12, 7) (12, 27) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 6) (28, 3) (28, 2) (28, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 3) (14, 21) (14, 0) (14, 26) (14, 23) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 18) (26, 20) (18, 3) (18, 26) (25, 1) (25, 9) (25, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 9) (17, 3) (17, 13) (17, 22) (8, 0) (8, 9) (19, 22) (19, 6) (22, 17) (22, 19) (9, 25) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 23) (10, 15) (10, 28) (10, 6) (11, 15) (24, 27) (24, 5) (5, 25) (5, 24) (5, 23) (23, 14) (23, 9) (23, 5) (23, 16) (20, 4) (20, 26) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 13) (16, 23) (6, 2) (6, 27) (6, 19) (6, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

1: {21, 26, 25}
2: {6, 28}
3: {15, 28, 17, 14, 18}
4: {13, 16, 20}
5: {25, 24, 23}
6: {2, 27, 19, 10}
7: {12, 0, 13}
8: {0, 9}
9: {25, 13, 8, 23}
10: {15, 28, 6}
11: {15}
12: {7, 27}
13: {4, 7, 17, 9, 16}
14: {3, 21, 0, 26, 23}
15: {3, 10, 21, 11, 16}
16: {4, 13, 23, 15}
17: {3, 13, 22}
18: {3, 26}
19: {6, 22}
20: {4, 26}
21: {15, 1, 14}
22: {17, 19}
23: {24, 14, 9, 5, 16}
24: {27, 5, 23}
25: {1, 26, 9, 5}
26: {1, 14, 18, 20, 25}
27: {12, 24, 6}
28: {3, 2, 10}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 23 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 \). 

Therefore, the final answer is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (15, 17, 28)>
<3, (15, 14, 21)>
<13, (4, 9, 16)>
<13, (7, 9, 23)>
<15, (3, 16, 21)>
<15, (10, 11, 28)>
<23, (5, 14, 24)>
<23, (9, 16, 5)>
<26, (1, 14, 25)>
<26, (18, 20, 25)>
