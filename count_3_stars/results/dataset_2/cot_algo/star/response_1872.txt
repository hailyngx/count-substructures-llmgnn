Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 16) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 11) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 3) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 10) (19, 15) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 11) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 10) (5, 14) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (12, 15) (13, 1) (13, 6) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 3) (11, 18) (11, 15) (11, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 11) 

Response:
Calculating the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 8, 16}
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {0, 9, 13}
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: {9, 16}
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {0, 4, 10, 16}
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {3, 6, 8, 17}
Node 5 has 1 neighbor: {14}
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {4, 11, 13}
Node 7 has 2 neighbors: {8, 9}
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {0, 4, 7, 10}
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {1, 2, 7, 14}
Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {3, 8, 14, 16}
Node 11 has 3 neighbors: {6, 15, 18}
Node 12 has 1 neighbor: {15}
Node 13 has 2 neighbors: {1, 6}
Node 14 has 5 neighbors: {5, 9, 10, 17, 18}
Node 15 has 3 neighbors: {11, 12, 19}
Node 16 has 4 neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 10}
Node 17 has 3 neighbors: {4, 14, 18}
Node 18 has 4 neighbors: {11, 14, 17, 18}
Node 19 has 1 neighbor: {15}

By applying the formula, the number of 3-stars is  \([inom{20}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3}]\) = \([1140 + 1 + 4 + 4]\) = \([1149]\)

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 8, 16>, 
<1, 9, 13>, 
<3, 4, 16>, 
<4, 14, 17>
