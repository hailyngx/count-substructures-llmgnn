Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 7) (26, 22) (26, 2) (26, 29) (26, 11) (3, 14) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 6) (1, 12) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 26) (11, 7) (11, 21) (12, 1) (12, 29) (27, 23) (27, 6) (28, 19) (28, 2) (29, 26) (29, 12) (29, 6) (0, 15) (0, 25) (14, 3) (14, 24) (14, 4) (14, 20) (22, 9) (22, 26) (22, 19) (22, 5) (22, 17) (8, 21) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 24) (7, 13) (25, 0) (25, 17) (25, 16) (19, 15) (19, 28) (19, 22) (19, 23) (17, 22) (17, 25) (17, 18) (17, 4) (2, 26) (2, 28) (2, 13) (5, 10) (5, 22) (5, 23) (23, 27) (23, 19) (23, 5) (6, 15) (6, 27) (6, 29) (6, 16) (20, 14) (20, 4) (20, 16) (21, 11) (21, 8) (21, 24) (24, 14) (24, 7) (24, 21) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 20) (4, 13) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 18) (16, 10) (16, 25) (16, 6) (16, 20) (16, 18) (18, 17) (18, 13) (18, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {15, 25}
- Node 1: {12}
- Node 2: {13, 26, 28}
- Node 3: {14}
- Node 4: {13, 14, 17, 20}
- Node 5: {10, 22, 23}
- Node 6: {15, 16, 27, 29}
- Node 7: {9, 11, 13, 24}
- Node 8: {21}
- Node 9: {7, 22}
- Node 10: {5, 16}
- Node 11: {7, 21, 26}
- Node 12: {1, 29}
- Node 13: {4, 7, 18, 2}
- Node 14: {3, 4, 20, 24}
- Node 15: {0, 6, 19}
- Node 16: {6, 10, 18, 20, 25}
- Node 17: {4, 22, 25, 18}
- Node 18: {13, 16, 17}
- Node 19: {15, 22, 23, 28}
- Node 20: {4, 16, 14}
- Node 21: {11, 24, 8}
- Node 22: {5, 9, 19, 26, 17}
- Node 23: {19, 5, 27}
- Node 24: {7, 14, 21}
- Node 25: {0, 16, 17}
- Node 26: {2, 11, 22, 29}
- Node 27: {6, 23}
- Node 28: {19, 2}
- Node 29: {12, 6, 26}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with them:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1
Total number of 3-stars = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].
