First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors based on the given edges:

- Node 0 is connected to node 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 14, and 26.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 12, 15, 18, and 29.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 13, and 26.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 8, 16, 24, and 26.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 10, and 23.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 10, and 24.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 12, 16, 21.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 14, and 24.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 10, 18, and 25.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 9, and 11.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 27, and 29.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 16.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 14, and 21.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 13, and 8.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 2 and 20.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 12, and 23.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 20 and 25.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 2, 9, and 24.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 20 and 22.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 15, 17, 19, and 29.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 7, 13, and 25.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 19 and 27.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 5, 16, and 14.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, 18, and 27.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 9, 17, and 21.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 11, 22, and 24.
- Node 28 is connected to node 21.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 2, 11, and 20.

Now, we check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of. Since all have at least 3 neighbors, we can count all of them as follows:
- Node 2: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 10: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 13: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 14: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 16: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 21: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 24: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 25: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 27: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 29: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars we calculated above, we get a total of 41 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [41].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (1, 15, 29)>
- <2, (1, 18, 29)>
- <2, (1, 29, 15)>
- <2, (1, 29, 18)>
- <2, (15, 18, 29)>
- <4, (3, 16, 24)>
- <4, (6, 10, 24)>
- <4, (6, 23, 24)>
- <4, (8, 14, 24)>
- <7, (0, 12, 16)>
- <10, (5, 6, 23)>
- <11, (10, 27, 29)>
- <16, (4, 7, 12)>
- <18, (9, 10, 25)>
- <21, (7, 13, 25)>
- <24, (4, 6, 8)>
- <24, (4, 6, 27)>
- <24, (4, 8, 27)>
- <24, (6, 8, 27)>
- <25, (9, 17, 21)>
- <27, (11, 22, 24)>
- <29, (20, 11, 2)>
