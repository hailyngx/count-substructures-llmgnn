Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 12) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 4) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 7) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 13) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 11}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 10, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 13}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 8, 12}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 4, 5, 11}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 10}
- Node 12: {1, 5, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {6, 12}
- Node 14: {4, 8, 12}

Nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12 have 4 or more neighbors, so we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 84

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [84].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 10)>
<3, (4, 8, 10)>
<5, (0, 6, 10)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<10, (1, 4, 5)>
<12, (1, 9, 13)>
