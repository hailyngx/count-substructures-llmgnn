Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 29) (7, 6) (7, 19) (21, 7) (21, 5) (21, 15) (20, 13) (20, 4) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 16) (25, 12) (3, 25) (3, 22) (3, 18) (12, 25) (12, 27) (12, 24) (12, 14) (27, 12) (27, 9) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 10) (8, 15) (13, 20) (13, 8) (13, 0) (13, 18) (1, 26) (1, 5) (1, 0) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 11) (22, 3) (22, 26) (22, 29) (11, 26) (4, 20) (4, 19) (6, 7) (6, 24) (6, 0) (24, 12) (24, 8) (24, 6) (24, 17) (24, 10) (15, 21) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 16) (19, 7) (19, 4) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 0) (5, 21) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 23) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 10) (29, 7) (29, 22) (29, 0) (9, 25) (9, 27) (16, 25) (16, 15) (16, 17) (17, 24) (17, 2) (17, 23) (17, 16) (18, 3) (18, 13) (10, 8) (10, 24) (10, 23) (14, 12) (14, 15) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 29) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 13, 29}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 26}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 5, 17}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 18, 22, 25}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 13, 19, 20}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 21, 23}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 7, 24}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 19, 21, 29}
- Node 8: Neighbors {10, 13, 15, 24}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 25, 27}
- Node 10: Neighbors {8, 23, 24}
- Node 11: Neighbors {26}
- Node 12: Neighbors {14, 24, 25, 27}
- Node 13: Neighbors {4, 8, 18, 20}
- Node 14: Neighbors {12, 15}
- Node 15: Neighbors {8, 14, 16, 21}
- Node 16: Neighbors {15, 17, 25}
- Node 17: Neighbors {2, 16, 23, 24}
- Node 18: Neighbors {3, 13}
- Node 19: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 20: Neighbors {4, 13}
- Node 21: Neighbors {5, 7, 15}
- Node 22: Neighbors {3, 26, 29}
- Node 23: Neighbors {5, 10, 17}
- Node 24: Neighbors {6, 8, 10, 12, 17}
- Node 25: Neighbors {3, 12, 16}
- Node 26: Neighbors {1, 11, 22}
- Node 27: Neighbors {9, 12}
- Node 29: Neighbors {0, 7, 22}

Next, let's identify the nodes that act as the center of a 3-star:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 24, 25, 26, 29

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{14}{3} + \binom{13}{3} + \binom{14}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} \]
\[ = 364 + 286 + 364 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 1062 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1062].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 29)>
- <2, (0, 5, 17)>
- <5, (1, 2, 23)>
- <7, (6, 19, 21)>
- <8, (10, 17, 24)>
- <10, (8, 23, 24)>
- <12, (14, 24, 27)>
- <13, (4, 18, 20)>
- <15, (8, 14, 16)>
- <17, (2, 16, 23)>
- <24, (6, 8, 10)>
