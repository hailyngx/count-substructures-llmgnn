Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (12, 5) (12, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 10, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 13}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 13}
- Node 5: {4, 9, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 11}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6, 11}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 11}
- Node 11: {0, 8, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {5, 6}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 2, 4, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 5, 13}

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: Not applicable as it has fewer than 3 neighbors
- Node 2: Not applicable as it has fewer than 3 neighbors
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: Not applicable as it has fewer than 3 neighbors
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: Not applicable as it has fewer than 3 neighbors
- Node 8: Not applicable as it has fewer than 3 neighbors
- Node 9: Not applicable as it has fewer than 3 neighbors
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: Not applicable as it has fewer than 3 neighbors
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: Not applicable as it has fewer than 3 neighbors

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 84

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [84]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (8, 13, 14)>
<0, (10, 11, 13)>
<1, (3, 13, 2)>
<3, (10, 9, 5)>
<5, (10, 14, 2)>
<6, (2, 12, 10)>
<10, (0, 11, 13)>
<13, (0, 14, 2)>
