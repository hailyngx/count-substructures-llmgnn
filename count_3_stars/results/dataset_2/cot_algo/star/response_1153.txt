Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9, 6, 8, 2
- Node 1: 5, 9, 6
- Node 2: 5, 6, 4, 0
- Node 3: 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 8, 2
- Node 5: 9, 2, 1, 0, 3
- Node 6: 9, 1, 7, 2, 0
- Node 7: 6, 3, 8
- Node 8: 9, 4, 7, 0, 3
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8, 1, 0

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each node:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 57, so the answer is [57].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (5, 9, 6)>
- <0, (5, 9, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 8, 2)>
- <0, (9, 6, 8)>
- <0, (9, 8, 5)>
- <0, (6, 8, 5)>
- <0, (8, 5, 2)>
- <0, (5, 2, 9)>
- <0, (2, 9, 8)>
- <1, (5, 9, 6)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (6, 8, 5)>
- <2, (8, 5, 0)>
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (9, 6, 1)>
- <5, (2, 9, 8)>
- <6, (9, 1, 7)>
- <6, (1, 7, 3)>
- <6, (7, 3, 8)>
- <8, (9, 4, 8)>
- <8, (4, 8, 7)>
- <8, (8, 7, 6)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
- <9, (6, 8, 0)>
- <9, (8, 0, 2)>
