Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 14) (9, 3) (9, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) (13, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated as follows:

For node 1: Neighbors \(\{6, 2, 10, 4, 8\}\) - This node has 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the central node.

For node 3: Neighbors \(\{11, 9, 12\}\) - This node has 3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star with node 3 as the central node.

For node 10: Neighbors \(\{1, 11, 7, 5\}\) - This node has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 10 as the central node.

For node 4: Neighbors \(\{1, 11, 13, 5, 2\}\) - This node has 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the central node.

For node 8: Neighbors \(\{1, 14, 12, 7\}\) - This node has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the central node.

For node 5: Neighbors \(\{10, 4, 6, 0, 7, 14\}\) - This node has 6 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the central node.

For node 6: Neighbors \(\{1, 5, 14, 7, 2\}\) - This node has 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the central node.

For node 0: Neighbors \(\{5, 14, 2\}\) - This node has 3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star with node 0 as the central node.

For node 14: Neighbors \(\{8, 5, 6, 0, 7, 12\}\) - This node has 6 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 14 as the central node.

For node 2: Neighbors \(\{1, 4, 6, 0, 9\}\) - This node has 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the central node.

For node 7: Neighbors \(\{10, 8, 5, 6, 14\}\) - This node has 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the central node.

For node 9: Neighbors \(\{3, 2\}\) - This node has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed with node 9 as the central node.

For node 12: Neighbors \(\{3, 8, 14\}\) - This node has 3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star with node 12 as the central node.

For node 13: Neighbor \(\{4\}\) - This node has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars can be formed with node 13 as the central node.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed with each central node, we get a total of 100 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [100].
