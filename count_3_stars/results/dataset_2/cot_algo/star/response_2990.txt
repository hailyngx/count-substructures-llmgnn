Response:
First, let's create an adjacency list based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {27, 16, 3, 18, 5}
- Node 1: {27, 18, 19, 20}
- Node 2: {8, 28}
- Node 3: {0, 26, 12}
- Node 4: {23, 5, 25}
- Node 5: {0, 10, 4, 29}
- Node 6: {9, 17, 13}
- Node 7: {10, 12, 28}
- Node 8: {2, 18, 21}
- Node 9: {6, 21, 13, 23}
- Node 10: {11, 7, 5, 20}
- Node 11: {22, 10, 21, 29, 25}
- Node 12: {7, 29, 3}
- Node 13: {6, 9, 14}
- Node 14: {28, 13}
- Node 15: {22, 17}
- Node 16: {0}
- Node 17: {15, 6, 26}
- Node 18: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 19: {24, 1}
- Node 20: {10, 26, 1}
- Node 21: {9, 11, 8}
- Node 22: {15, 11}
- Node 23: {9, 4, 25}
- Node 24: {19}
- Node 25: {23, 11, 4}
- Node 26: {27, 20, 3, 17}
- Node 27: {0, 26, 1}
- Node 28: {2, 7, 14}
- Node 29: {11, 12, 5}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed in this graph. We'll iterate through each node that has three or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 0: has 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: has 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: has 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: has 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star
- Node 13: has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star
- Node 17: has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star
- Node 18: has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star
- Node 20: has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star
- Node 21: has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star
- Node 23: has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star
- Node 26: has 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star
- Node 28: has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star
- Node 29: has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star

Total 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 16, 3>
- <0, 16, 18>
- <0, 16, 5>
- <0, 3, 18>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 18, 5>
- <1, 19, 20>
- <3, 12, 26>
- <4, 23, 25>
- <10, 11, 21>
- <15, 17, 26>
- <6, 9, 13>
- <21, 8, 9>
- <11, 22, 25>
- <5, 10, 29>
- <7, 12, 28>
- <13, 6, 14>
