Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 6) (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 18) (4, 3) (4, 18) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 16) (2, 12) (2, 7) (8, 11) (8, 6) (0, 15) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (16, 18) (16, 0) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 6) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 12) (13, 14) (6, 15) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 19) (11, 5) (11, 18) (11, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

1. Node 0: {15, 9, 7, 16}
2. Node 2: {12, 7}
3. Node 3: {15, 17, 7, 19, 4}
4. Node 4: {3, 18}
5. Node 5: {9, 11}
6. Node 6: {15, 10, 8, 19}
7. Node 7: {3, 9, 2, 0}
8. Node 8: {11, 6}
9. Node 9: {5, 7, 0}
10. Node 10: {15, 17, 6}
11. Node 11: {5, 18, 8}
12. Node 12: {2, 13, 14}
13. Node 13: {12, 14}
14. Node 14: {12, 13}
15. Node 15: {3, 10, 19, 6, 0}
16. Node 16: {18, 0}
17. Node 17: {3, 10, 18}
18. Node 18: {17, 4, 19, 11, 16}
19. Node 19: {3, 15, 18, 6}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors or more: 0, 3, 6, 15, 18, 19

Number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 7, 16)>
<3, (17, 19, 4)>
<6, (10, 15, 19)>
<15, (10, 19, 6)>
<18, (4, 19, 11)>
<19, (15, 18, 6)>
