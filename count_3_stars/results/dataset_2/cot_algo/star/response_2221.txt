Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 14) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 10) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 10, 12, 13
- Node 3: 0, 5, 11
- Node 4: 0, 1, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 11, 12, 13
- Node 6: 1, 11, 14
- Node 7: 0, 4, 11, 12
- Node 8: 11, 13
- Node 9: 1, 10, 11
- Node 10: 2, 9, 14
- Node 11: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 12: 0, 2, 5, 7, 13, 14
- Node 13: 2, 5, 8, 12
- Node 14: 6, 10, 12

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 4, 7) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 6, 9) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (0, 10, 12, 13) => Not enough neighbors for 3-star
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (0, 5, 11) => Not enough neighbors for 3-star
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (0, 1, 7) => <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (1, 3, 11, 12, 13) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (1, 11, 14) => <6, (1, 11, 14)>
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (0, 4, 11, 12) => <7, (0, 4, 11)>
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (11, 13) => Not enough neighbors for 3-star
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (1, 10, 11) => <9, (1, 10, 11)>
- Node 10: 3 neighbors (2, 9, 14) => Not enough neighbors for 3-star
- Node 11: 6 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) => \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: 6 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 7, 13, 14) => \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: 4 neighbors (2, 5, 8, 12) => <13, (2, 5, 12)>
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (6, 10, 12) => <14, (6, 10, 12)>

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 + 20 + 20 = 75

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [75].

Unique 3-stars found: <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (1, 11, 14)>, <7, (0, 4, 11)>, <9, (1, 10, 11)>, <13, (2, 5, 12)>, <14, (6, 10, 12)>
