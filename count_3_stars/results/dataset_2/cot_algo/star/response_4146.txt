Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 12) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 12) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 14) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {4, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {7, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 11}
- Node 8: {6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 4, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {4, 5, 7, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 5, 6, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with center 0
- Node 1, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with center 1
- Node 2, 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with center 2
- Node 3, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with center 3
- Node 4, 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with center 4
- Node 5, 3 neighbors: 1 3-star with center 5
- Node 6, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with center 6
- Node 9, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with center 9
- Node 10, 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with center 10
- Node 11, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with center 11
- Node 12, 3 neighbors: 1 3-star with center 12
- Node 13, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with center 13
- Node 14, 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with center 14

Total 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 76

Therefore, the final answer is [76].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 12, 13)>
- <1, (9, 10, 13)>
- <2, (0, 4, 10)>
- <3, (0, 2, 14)>
- <4, (1, 10, 13)>
- <5, (7, 11, 14)>
- <6, (3, 7, 14)>
- <9, (1, 10, 13)>
- <10, (2, 4, 14)>
- <11, (4, 7, 12)>
- <12, (0, 4, 11)>
- <13, (0, 1, 9)>
- <14, (2, 6, 10)>
