Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 8) (4, 23) (4, 28) (4, 21) (7, 24) (21, 4) (21, 25) (21, 2) (1, 13) (1, 19) (3, 13) (3, 18) (18, 22) (18, 3) (18, 5) (18, 24) (8, 22) (8, 23) (8, 9) (23, 4) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 6) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 11) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 28) (20, 11) (12, 10) (27, 20) (27, 11) (6, 23) (6, 29) (6, 25) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 20) (28, 16) (19, 1) (19, 26) (19, 29) (26, 0) (26, 19) (26, 17) (16, 28) (10, 12) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 25) (15, 23) (15, 10) (15, 2) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 24) (9, 2) (11, 0) (11, 20) (11, 27) (11, 14) (14, 13) (14, 11) (17, 26) (17, 24) (29, 6) (29, 19) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 10) (24, 7) (24, 18) (24, 0) (24, 9) (24, 17) (5, 18) (2, 21) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {20, 11, 24, 26}
- Node 1: {13, 19}
- Node 2: {9, 10, 15, 21}
- Node 3: {13, 18}
- Node 4: {21, 23, 28}
- Node 5: {18}
- Node 6: {23, 25, 29}
- Node 7: {24}
- Node 8: {9, 22, 23}
- Node 9: {2, 8, 13, 24}
- Node 10: {2, 15, 25}
- Node 11: {0, 20, 27, 14}
- Node 12: {10}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 9, 14, 22}
- Node 14: {11, 13}
- Node 15: {10, 2, 23}
- Node 16: {28}
- Node 17: {24, 26}
- Node 18: {3, 5, 22, 24}
- Node 19: {1, 26, 29}
- Node 20: {0, 11, 27, 28}
- Node 21: {2, 4, 25}
- Node 22: {8, 13, 18, 28}
- Node 23: {4, 6, 8, 15}
- Node 24: {0, 7, 9, 17, 18}
- Node 25: {2, 6, 10, 21}
- Node 26: {0, 17, 19}
- Node 27: {11, 20}
- Node 28: {4, 16, 20, 22}
- Node 29: {6, 19}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 13 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 9, and 14: <13, (1, 9, 14)>
Node 22 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 8, 18, and 28: <22, (8, 18, 28)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 21, 23, and 28: <4, (21, 23, 28)>
Node 24 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 9, and 17: <24, (0, 9, 17)>
Node 0 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 11, 20, and 27: <0, (11, 20, 27)>
Node 10 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 2, 15, and 25: <10, (2, 15, 25)>
Node 26 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 17, and 19: <26, (0, 17, 19)>

The total number of 3-stars is 7, so the answer is [7].
