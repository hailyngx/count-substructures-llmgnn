Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Since there are 10 nodes in the graph, let's first find the degree of each node by counting the number of edges incident to it. 

Node 0: degree = 4
Node 1: degree = 6
Node 2: degree = 5
Node 3: degree = 4
Node 4: degree = 2
Node 5: degree = 4
Node 6: degree = 5
Node 7: degree = 5
Node 8: degree = 3
Node 9: degree = 3

Now, we need to find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {9, 3, 8, 2}
Node 1: {7, 6, 9, 3, 8, 5}
Node 2: {6, 9, 3, 5, 0}
Node 3: {7, 1, 0, 2}
Node 4: {7, 5}
Node 5: {4, 6, 1, 2}
Node 6: {7, 5, 1, 2, 8}
Node 7: {4, 3, 6, 1, 5}
Node 8: {6, 1, 0}
Node 9: {2, 1, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star graphs:

Node 1, Node 6, and Node 7 have 5 neighbors, so they can form
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star graphs each.

In total, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is \(3 \times 10 = 30\), which we represent as [30].

The unique 3-star graphs in this case are:
<1, (7, 6, 3)>
<6, (7, 1, 5)>
<7, (1, 6, 5)>
