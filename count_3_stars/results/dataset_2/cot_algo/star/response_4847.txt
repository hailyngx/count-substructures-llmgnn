Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 6) (12, 7) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 2) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 6) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first construct the adjacency list representation of the graph:

1: [3, 9, 0, 13]
2: [3, 14, 13, 9, 6]
3: [1, 0, 6, 2, 12]
4: [8, 9, 0, 5]
5: [4, 7, 14]
6: [3, 11, 8, 13, 2]
7: [12, 10, 9, 5]
8: [4, 11, 6]
9: [4, 7, 1, 13, 2]
10: [7, 11, 0, 13]
11: [10, 8, 6]
12: [7, 3]
13: [1, 10, 2, 9, 6]
14: [0, 2, 5]

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <1, (3, 9, 13)>, <1, (0, 9, 13)>
Node 2 forms no 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 3 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (12, 2, 6)>
Node 4 forms one 3-star: <4, (0, 5, 9)>
Node 5 forms no 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 6 forms one 3-star: <6, (2, 11, 13)>
Node 7 forms no 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 8 forms no 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 9 forms no 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 10 forms no 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 11 forms no 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 12 forms no 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 13 forms no 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 14 forms no 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 9, 13)>, <1, (0, 9, 13)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (12, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 11, 13)>.
