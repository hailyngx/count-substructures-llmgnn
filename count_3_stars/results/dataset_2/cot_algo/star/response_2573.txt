Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 5) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 9) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 12) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 12) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 3) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we first need to find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 10, 5, 9, 12
Node 1: 6, 12
Node 2: 4, 13, 3
Node 3: 8, 5, 6, 9, 2
Node 4: 7, 0, 14, 2
Node 5: 7, 11, 6, 0, 3
Node 6: 10, 5, 1, 3
Node 7: 4, 14, 5
Node 8: 10, 13, 9, 14, 3
Node 9: 10, 8, 13, 3, 0
Node 10: 11, 0, 6, 8, 9
Node 11: 10, 5
Node 12: 13, 1, 0, 14
Node 13: 8, 12, 2, 9
Node 14: 4, 7, 8, 12

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

Node 0, Node 3, Node 5, Node 8, Node 9, and Node 10 each have 5 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them using \( \binom{n}{3} \).

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60 \)

Therefore, there are 60 unique 3-stars in this graph, and the final answer is [60].

The unique 3-stars are:
