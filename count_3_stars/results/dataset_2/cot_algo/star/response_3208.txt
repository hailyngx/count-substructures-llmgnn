Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 19) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 18) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 15) (14, 13) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 18) (15, 14) (15, 16) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 18) (17, 6) (17, 18) (16, 7) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 5) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 19) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 9) (6, 17) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 16) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 12) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 12) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 13) (18, 17) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {7, 9, 10}
Node 1: {11, 13}
Node 2: {11, 12, 19}
Node 3: {9, 14, 19}
Node 4: {5, 8, 10, 19}
Node 5: {4, 10, 16}
Node 6: {17}
Node 7: {0, 16, 18}
Node 8: {4, 18}
Node 9: {0, 3, 12, 16}
Node 10: {0, 4, 5}
Node 11: {1, 2}
Node 12: {2, 9, 19}
Node 13: {1, 14, 18}
Node 14: {3, 13, 15, 19}
Node 15: {14, 16}
Node 16: {5, 7, 9, 15}
Node 17: {6, 18}
Node 18: {7, 8, 13, 17}
Node 19: {2, 4, 12, 14}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 3: Neighbor set size = 3, so it forms a 3-star with neighbors <3, 9, 19>.
Node 4: Neighbor set size = 4, so it forms a 3-star with neighbors <4, 10, 19>.
Node 9: Neighbor set size = 4, so it forms a 3-star with neighbors <9, 12, 16>.
Node 10: Neighbor set size = 3, so it forms a 3-star with neighbors <10, 0, 4>.
Node 11: Neighbor set size = 2, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 12: Neighbor set size = 3, so it forms a 3-star with neighbors <12, 2, 19>.
Node 13: Neighbor set size = 3, so it forms a 3-star with neighbors <13, 14, 18>.
Node 14: Neighbor set size = 4, so it forms a 3-star with neighbors <14, 3, 19>.
Node 16: Neighbor set size = 4, so it forms a 3-star with neighbors <16, 5, 7>.
Node 18: Neighbor set size = 4, so it forms a 3-star with neighbors <18, 13, 17>.
Node 19: Neighbor set size = 4, so it forms a 3-star with neighbors <19, 2, 12>.

Total number of 3-stars: 7

Therefore, the final answer is [7]. The unique 3-stars found are:

<3, 9, 19>
<4, 10, 19>
<9, 12, 16>
<10, 0, 4>
<12, 2, 19>
<13, 14, 18>
<16, 5, 7>
