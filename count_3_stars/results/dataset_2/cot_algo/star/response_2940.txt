Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are as follows: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 1, 8}
- Node 1: {9, 7, 3, 6, 0, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 3, 8, 6}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 1, 6, 2}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 6, 2}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 7: {5, 4, 3, 6, 1}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {4, 1}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Adding these up: 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 3)>, <1, (6, 3, 4)>, <1, (7, 3, 4)>, <3, (6, 7, 4)>, <4, (7, 6, 2)>, <4, (7, 6, 3)>, <4, (7, 1, 6)>
