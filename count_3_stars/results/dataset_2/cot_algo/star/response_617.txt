Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 22) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 15) (15, 16) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 10) (27, 13) (20, 25) (20, 2) (20, 24) (20, 5) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 2) (22, 11) (22, 23) (23, 22) (23, 13) (28, 26) (28, 7) (28, 14) (29, 11) (29, 24) (19, 15) (19, 25) (19, 26) (19, 4) (19, 13) (26, 28) (26, 19) (1, 10) (17, 11) (17, 9) (3, 2) (21, 9) (21, 24) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 0) (9, 17) (9, 21) (18, 24) (18, 0) (7, 28) (6, 14) (6, 8) (14, 15) (14, 28) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 5) (5, 20) (5, 25) (5, 12) (5, 4) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 8) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 8) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 20) (2, 25) (2, 3) (13, 27) (13, 23) (13, 19) (13, 14) (24, 20) (24, 29) (24, 21) (24, 18) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {12, 18, 8}
- Node 1: {10}
- Node 2: {3, 11, 16, 20, 25}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {5, 14, 19}
- Node 5: {4, 12, 20, 25}
- Node 6: {8, 14}
- Node 7: {28}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 10}
- Node 9: {17, 21}
- Node 10: {1, 8, 27}
- Node 11: {2, 16, 17, 22, 29}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 16}
- Node 13: {14, 19, 27, 23}
- Node 14: {4, 6, 13, 15, 28}
- Node 15: {14, 19, 27}
- Node 16: {2, 11, 12, 15}
- Node 17: {9, 11}
- Node 18: {0, 24}
- Node 19: {4, 13, 15, 25, 26}
- Node 20: {2, 5, 24, 25}
- Node 21: {9, 24}
- Node 22: {11, 23}
- Node 23: {13, 22}
- Node 24: {18, 20, 21, 29}
- Node 25: {2, 5, 19, 20}
- Node 26: {19, 28}
- Node 27: {10, 13, 15}
- Node 28: {7, 14, 26}
- Node 29: {11, 24}

Now, we can identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 64\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].
