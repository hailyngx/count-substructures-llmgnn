Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 17) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 19) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 12) (12, 11) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 0) (10, 14) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (17, 4) (17, 3) (17, 15) (2, 19) (2, 13) (19, 3) (19, 2) (19, 6) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 15) (1, 18) (1, 14) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 1) (13, 0) (13, 2) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 16) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 15) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {5, 10, 13}
Node 1: {18, 14}
Node 2: {19, 13}
Node 3: {11, 7, 17, 16, 19}
Node 4: {17}
Node 5: {9, 0, 16}
Node 6: {8, 19, 15}
Node 7: {9, 3, 11, 14}
Node 8: {9, 16, 6, 12}
Node 9: {5, 8, 7}
Node 10: {0, 14}
Node 11: {3, 7, 12}
Node 12: {11, 8}
Node 13: {0, 2}
Node 14: {10, 7, 1}
Node 15: {18, 17, 6, 16}
Node 16: {5, 18, 3, 8, 15}
Node 17: {4, 3, 15}
Node 18: {15, 16, 1}
Node 19: {3, 2, 6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the final result is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (11, 7, 16)>, <7, (9, 3, 11)>, <8, (9, 16, 15)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>, <16, (5, 18, 15)>
