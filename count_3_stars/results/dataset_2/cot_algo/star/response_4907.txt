Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 5, 4, 8, 7
Node 1: 9, 6, 8, 7
Node 2: 9, 3, 7
Node 3: 5, 6, 8, 2
Node 4: 9, 0
Node 5: 9, 6, 0, 3
Node 6: 5, 9, 1, 3, 8
Node 7: 1, 8, 0, 2
Node 8: 6, 1, 3, 0, 7
Node 9: 5, 6, 4, 2, 1

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars each node can form:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 8, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>
<8, (6, 1, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
