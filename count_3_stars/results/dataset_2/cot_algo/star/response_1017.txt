Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 4) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 3) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 10) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 10) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 10) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 13) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first calculate the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 5, 3}
- Node 1: {8, 5, 13}
- Node 2: {8, 12, 11}
- Node 3: {8, 0, 10}
- Node 4: {9, 5, 13, 11, 10}
- Node 5: {12, 1, 0, 4}
- Node 6: {14, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {6, 10}
- Node 8: {2, 14, 10, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {4, 11, 10, 0}
- Node 10: {9, 8, 7, 3, 14, 4}
- Node 11: {9, 2, 4}
- Node 12: {6, 2, 5, 14, 3}
- Node 13: {6, 4, 1, 14}
- Node 14: {6, 8, 13, 12, 10}

Checking which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 4, 10, and 14 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form 3-stars. 
- Node 6, 8, and 12 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form 3-stars as well.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: \(10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60\)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].

List of unique 3-stars: 
- <4, 13, 1>
- <4, 13, 5>
- <4, 13, 14>
- <4, 11, 9>
- <4, 11, 10>
- <10, 14, 13>
- <10, 14, 12>
- <10, 14, 8>
- <10, 8, 1>
- <10, 8, 3>
- <10, 8, 4>
- <10, 8, 14>
- <6, 7, 10>
- <6, 7, 12>
- <6, 7, 13>
- <6, 12, 2>
- <6, 12, 5>
- <6, 12, 14>
- <6, 12, 3>
- <6, 12, 6>
- <8, 14, 10>
- <8, 14, 13>
- <8, 14, 12>
- <8, 14, 6>
- <8, 14, 7>

This completes the analysis.
