Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8, 17}, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 6, 16}, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: Neighbors = {3}, no 3-star formed
- Node 3: Neighbors = {2, 13, 16}, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: Neighbors = {6, 11, 16}, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: Neighbors = {16, 19, 14, 0}, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 9, 10, 4, 0}, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: Neighbors = {15, 17, 11}, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: Neighbors = {15, 0}, no 3-star formed
- Node 9: Neighbors = {6, 10, 12, 19}, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: Neighbors = {6, 9, 12}, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: Neighbors = {7, 4}, no 3-star formed
- Node 12: Neighbors = {9, 10}, no 3-star formed
- Node 13: Neighbors = {14, 18, 3}, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: Neighbors = {5, 18, 13}, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: Neighbors = {7, 17, 8}, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: Neighbors = {5, 1, 3, 4}, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: Neighbors = {7, 15, 18, 0}, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: Neighbors = {14, 17, 13}, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: Neighbors = {9, 5}, no 3-star formed

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 31 \)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 5, 17)>, <1, (0, 6, 16)>, <3, (2, 13, 16)>, <4, (6, 11, 16)>, <5, (0, 14, 19)>, <6, (0, 9, 10)>, <13, (3, 14, 18)>, <14, (5, 13, 18)>, <15, (7, 17, 18)>, <16, (1, 4, 5)>, <17, (0, 7, 15)>.
