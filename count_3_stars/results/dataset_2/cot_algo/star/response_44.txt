Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 2) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 10) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 0) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 14) 

Response:
To solve this problem, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {9, 3, 8, 11, 2}
- Node 1: {7, 3, 6, 12}
- Node 2: {6, 0, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 1, 11, 6, 0}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 4, 3, 10}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 13, 2}
- Node 7: {4, 10, 1}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 10, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 0, 12}
- Node 10: {5, 4, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 11: {3, 13, 0, 14}
- Node 12: {9, 1, 13}
- Node 13: {5, 12, 11, 6}
- Node 14: {11, 2, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [56].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 3, 11>
- <0, 3, 2>
- <0, 4, 10>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <3, 1, 6>
- <3, 1, 13>
- <3, 5, 10>
- <3, 5, 11>
- <4, 5, 10>
- <5, 9, 13>
- <6, 1, 12>
- <6, 2, 14>
- <10, 7, 4>
- <11, 0, 14>
