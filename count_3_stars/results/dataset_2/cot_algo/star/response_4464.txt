Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 6) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 7) (10, 7) (10, 4) (17, 6) (17, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 17) (6, 5) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 18) (12, 0) (9, 18) (9, 14) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (4, 15) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (13, 15) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated as follows:

For each node, we need to identify its neighbors and then check if it forms a 3-star.

Node 0: Neighbors (11, 2, 4, 8, 12) - forms 1 3-star
Node 1: Neighbors (3, 5, 7, 14) - forms 1 3-star
Node 3: Neighbors (1, 15, 16, 18) - forms 1 3-star
Node 4: Neighbors (0, 10, 2, 15) - forms 1 3-star
Node 5: Neighbors (1, 6, 7, 8, 14) - forms 1 3-star
Node 6: Neighbors (11, 16, 17, 5) - forms 1 3-star
Node 7: Neighbors (1, 5, 8, 10) - forms 1 3-star
Node 8: Neighbors (0, 5, 7, 17) - forms 1 3-star
Node 15: Neighbors (3, 4, 13) - forms 1 3-star
Node 16: Neighbors (11, 3, 6) - forms 1 3-star
Node 18: Neighbors (3, 9, 19) - forms 1 3-star

Since all nodes have exactly 1 3-star, the total number of 3-stars is 20. Hence, the final answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 14)>
<3, (15, 16, 18)>
<4, (0, 10, 2)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (11, 16, 17)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<15, (3, 4, 13)>
<16, (11, 3, 6)>
<18, (3, 9, 19)>
