Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 15) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 18) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 14) (2, 7) (2, 14) (18, 13) (18, 1) (0, 19) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 5) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 8) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 5) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 1) (1, 16) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 1) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 12) (17, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {19}
- Node 1: {16, 18, 12, 9}
- Node 2: {7, 14}
- Node 3: {11, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {11, 7, 9, 3}
- Node 5: {14, 19, 15}
- Node 6: {10, 12}
- Node 7: {4, 2}
- Node 8: {13, 19, 14, 17, 3}
- Node 9: {4, 1}
- Node 10: {11, 6, 19, 14}
- Node 11: {16, 10, 3, 4}
- Node 12: {6, 15, 1}
- Node 13: {8, 19, 18}
- Node 14: {8, 10, 2, 5}
- Node 15: {16, 5, 12}
- Node 16: {11, 1, 15}
- Node 17: {8}
- Node 18: {13, 1}
- Node 19: {8, 13, 10, 0, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and evaluate how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes with three or more neighbors, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 41 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [41], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <1, 9, 12>
- <1, 9, 16>
- <1, 12, 16>
- <1, 12, 18>
- <4, 3, 7>
- <4, 3, 11>
- <4, 7, 11>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <5, 14, 19>
- <8, 13, 19>
- <8, 13, 18>
- <8, 14, 19>
- <8, 14, 17>
- <10, 11, 16>
- <10, 11, 3>
- <10, 11, 4>
- <10, 14, 19>
- <11, 3, 4>
- <13, 19, 8>
- <14, 8, 19>
- <14, 8, 17>
- <14, 10, 19>
- <15, 12, 16>
- <15, 12, 5>
- <19, 5, 15>
- <19, 5, 16>
- <19, 10, 14>
- <19, 13, 18>
