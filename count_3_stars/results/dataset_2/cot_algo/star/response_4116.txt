Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (6, 10) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 3) (5, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 12) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 8, 9, 11
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7, 11, 13
- Node 2: 1, 8, 9, 12, 14
- Node 3: 1, 5, 9
- Node 4: 8, 9
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 5, 8, 9, 10, 13
- Node 7: 0, 1, 11
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 6, 12
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 10: 6, 11, 14
- Node 11: 0, 1, 7, 10, 13
- Node 12: 2, 8, 13, 14
- Node 13: 1, 6, 11, 12
- Node 14: 2, 10, 12

Now, we see that nodes 0, 1, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12 have 5 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up these results, we get a total of 64 3-stars.
Thus, the final result is [64], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 11>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 7, 11>, <0, 8, 12>, <0, 9, 11>, <0, 9, 12>, <1, 11, 13>, <1, 6, 13>, <1, 6, 11>, <1, 6, 10>, <6, 10, 14>, <6, 8, 12>, <6, 8, 4>, <6, 9, 4>, <6, 9, 12>, <6, 9, 13>, <8, 12, 14>, <8, 2, 14>, <8, 2, 12>, <8, 2, 9>, <8, 0, 9>, <8, 0, 12>, <8, 0, 7>, <9, 4, 8>, <9, 4, 6>, <11, 7, 0>, <11, 7, 1>, <11, 7, 13>, <11, 13, 6>, <12, 2, 14>, <12, 2, 8>, <12, 2, 13>, <12, 14, 10>, <14, 10, 6>, <14, 10, 2>
