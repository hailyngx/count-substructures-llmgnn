Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: neighbors {9, 1, 8, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {5, 0, 8, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 4, 8, 5}
- Node 3: neighbors {6, 9, 2, 5}
- Node 4: neighbors {6, 9, 8, 2}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 3, 2}
- Node 6: neighbors {9, 3, 8, 4}
- Node 7: neighbors {9, 1, 0}
- Node 8: neighbors {6, 1, 4, 2, 0}
- Node 9: neighbors {6, 4, 3, 7, 0}

Now, letâ€™s check if any node forms a 3-star with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 1, 8} <0, (9, 1, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 0, 8} <1, (5, 0, 8)>
- Node 2 does not have exactly 3 neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 3 does not have exactly 3 neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 9, 8} <4, (6, 9, 8)>
- Node 5 does not have exactly 3 neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 6 does not have exactly 3 neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 7 does not have exactly 3 neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 8 does not have exactly 3 neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 9 does not have exactly 3 neighbors for a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (9, 1, 8)> and <4, (6, 9, 8)>.
