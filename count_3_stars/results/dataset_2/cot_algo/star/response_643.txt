Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: Can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <0, (11, 13, 21)>, <0, (11, 6, 21)>, <0, (13, 6, 21)>, <0, (13, 11, 21)>
- Node 3: Can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <3, (17, 22, 28)>, <3, (17, 22, 16)>, <3, (17, 28, 16)>, <3, (22, 28, 16)>
- Node 4: Can form [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <4, (12, 25, 14)>
- Node 5: Can form [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <5, (13, 15, 28)>
- Node 6: Can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <6, (7, 29, 0)>, <6, (7, 29, 2)>, <6, (7, 0, 2)>, <6, (29, 0, 2)>
- Node 9: Can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <9, (22, 24, 21)>, <9, (22, 24, 27)>, <9, (22, 21, 27)>, <9, (24, 21, 27)>
- Node 10: Can form [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <10, (7, 11, 25)>
- Node 12: Can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <12, (4, 29, 26)>, <12, (4, 29, 15)>, <12, (4, 26, 15)>, <12, (29, 26, 15)>
- Node 14: Can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <14, (11, 1, 18)>, <14, (11, 18, 4)>, <14, (11, 18, 19)>, <14, (1, 18, 19)>
- Node 16: Can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <16, (17, 25, 3)>, <16, (17, 25, 13)>, <16, (17, 25, 16)>, <16, (17, 13, 3)>
- Node 18: Can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <18, (20, 19, 14)>, <18, (20, 19, 18)>, <18, (20, 14, 19)>, <18, (19, 14, 18)>
- Node 19: Can form [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <19, (29, 8, 18)>
- Node 21: Can form [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <21, (27, 0, 9)>
- Node 24: Can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <24, (9, 7, 22)>, <24, (9, 7, 15)>, <24, (9, 22, 15)>, <24, (7, 22, 15)>
- Node 25: Can form [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <25, (10, 16, 4)>
- Node 27: Can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <27, (23, 1, 14)>, <27, (23, 1, 21)>, <27, (23, 14, 21)>, <27, (1, 14, 21)>

Total 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [30].
