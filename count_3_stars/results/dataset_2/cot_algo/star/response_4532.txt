Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 22) (11, 8) (16, 21) (3, 15) (3, 17) (15, 3) (15, 23) (15, 9) (15, 29) (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 8) (9, 15) (9, 6) (9, 29) (7, 21) (7, 20) (7, 1) (21, 16) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 24) (14, 20) (17, 3) (17, 20) (17, 19) (17, 2) (27, 4) (27, 28) (27, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 23) (8, 25) (23, 15) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 1) (1, 7) (1, 23) (1, 26) (1, 2) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 13) (26, 12) (20, 7) (20, 14) (20, 17) (20, 13) (28, 21) (28, 27) (28, 18) (22, 11) (22, 6) (22, 26) (22, 29) (2, 17) (2, 23) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 27) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 25) (18, 26) (18, 28) (18, 24) (29, 15) (29, 9) (29, 22) (29, 25) (5, 27) (19, 17) (19, 24) (12, 21) (12, 26) (12, 4) (13, 26) (13, 20) (13, 24) (25, 8) (25, 4) (25, 29) (24, 21) (24, 18) (24, 19) (24, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 1: {7, 23, 2}
- Node 2: {17, 23, 1, 4}
- Node 3: {15, 17}
- Node 4: {27, 2, 12, 25}
- Node 5: {27}
- Node 6: {9, 22, 8}
- Node 7: {21, 20, 1}
- Node 8: {11, 6, 23, 25}
- Node 9: {15, 6, 29}
- Node 12: {21, 26, 4}
- Node 13: {26, 20, 24}
- Node 14: {20}
- Node 15: {3, 9, 23, 29}
- Node 16: {21}
- Node 17: {3, 20, 19, 2}
- Node 18: {26, 28, 24}
- Node 19: {17, 24}
- Node 20: {7, 14, 17, 13}
- Node 21: {16, 7, 28, 12, 24}
- Node 22: {11, 6, 26, 29}
- Node 23: {15, 8, 2, 1}
- Node 24: {21, 18, 19, 13}
- Node 25: {8, 4, 29}
- Node 26: {1, 22, 18, 13, 12}
- Node 27: {4, 28, 5}
- Node 28: {21, 27, 18}
- Node 29: {9, 15, 22, 25}

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
\[ 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 64 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].
