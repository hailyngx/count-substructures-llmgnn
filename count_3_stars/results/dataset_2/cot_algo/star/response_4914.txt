Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 5) (1, 8) (1, 5) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {5, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 13}
- Node 4: {2, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 8, 11}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {7, 8, 11}
- Node 10: {2, 14}
- Node 11: {2, 6, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {5, 10, 11, 13}

Now let's find the number of 3-stars:
1. Node 0 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 35 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 99. Therefore, the final answer is [99].
