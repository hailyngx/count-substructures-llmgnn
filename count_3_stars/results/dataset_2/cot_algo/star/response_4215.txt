Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 12) (16, 3) (16, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 5) (17, 7) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 5) (6, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 18) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (15, 4) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 9) (2, 16) (2, 13) (2, 19) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 8) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 18) (9, 0) (18, 13) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 7) (3, 16) (3, 12) (8, 12) (8, 10) (8, 7) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 8) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 4) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 15) (4, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 9, 18}
Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 9}
Node 2: Neighbors {13, 16, 19}
Node 3: Neighbors {12, 16}
Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 13, 15}
Node 5: Neighbors {6, 13, 17}
Node 6: Neighbors {5, 12}
Node 7: Neighbors {8, 14, 17, 18}
Node 8: Neighbors {7, 10, 12}
Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 18, 19}
Node 10: Neighbors {8, 14, 19}
Node 11: Neighbors {12, 19}
Node 12: Neighbors {3, 6, 8, 11}
Node 13: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 18}
Node 14: Neighbors {7, 10}
Node 15: Neighbors {4}
Node 16: Neighbors {2, 3}
Node 17: Neighbors {5, 7}
Node 18: Neighbors {0, 7, 9, 13}
Node 19: Neighbors {2, 9, 10, 11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (4 choose 3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (4 choose 3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (4 choose 3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (4 choose 3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors (4 choose 3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors (4 choose 3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 15 has 1 neighbor, so 0 3-stars
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors (4 choose 3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors (4 choose 3) = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 18>
<0, 4, 13>
<4, 13, 15>
<7, 8, 10>
<7, 8, 12>
<7, 8, 18>
<7, 10, 14>
<9, 18, 19>
<12, 11, 19>
<12, 11, 3>
<12, 6, 5>
<12, 6, 8>
<13, 18, 2>
