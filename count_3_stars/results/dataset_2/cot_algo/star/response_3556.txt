Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 19) (17, 6) (17, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 5) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 15) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 18) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 16) (4, 12) (4, 14) (12, 13) (12, 4) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 16) (16, 3) (16, 15) (16, 7) (14, 4) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 18) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 8) (8, 18) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 10, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 18}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 11, 16, 19}
- Node 4: {12, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 11, 13, 15}
- Node 6: {2, 9, 17}
- Node 7: {3, 9, 15, 16, 17}
- Node 8: {18}
- Node 9: {6, 7}
- Node 10: {0, 15, 19}
- Node 11: {3, 5, 19}
- Node 12: {4, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 5, 12, 18}
- Node 14: {4}
- Node 15: {5, 7, 10, 16}
- Node 16: {3, 7, 15}
- Node 17: {6, 7}
- Node 18: {1, 8, 13}
- Node 19: {3, 10, 11}

Next, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 3, Node 5, Node 7, Node 13, Node 15, and Node 18 have three or more neighbors.

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 37

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [37], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 1, 18>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 13>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 10, 15>, <0, 13, 5>, <0, 13, 12>, <3, 5, 11>, <3, 5, 13>, <3, 5, 15>, <3, 5, 16>, <3, 7, 15>, <3, 7, 16>, <3, 11, 19>, <3, 15, 16>, <3, 16, 7>, <5, 13, 0>, <7, 9, 17>, <7, 15, 10>, <7, 15, 16>, <7, 16, 3>, <9, 6, 17>, <13, 0, 5>, <13, 0, 12>, <13, 5, 11>, <13, 5, 15>, <15, 5, 3>, <18, 1, 0>, <18, 1, 8>
