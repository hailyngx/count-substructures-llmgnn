Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify the neighbors of each node.

Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 6, 7}
Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 6, 7}
Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 5}
Node 4: {0, 3, 6, 7}
Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 9}
Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 8}
Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 9}
Node 8: {0, 6}
Node 9: {0, 5, 7}

Now, for each node with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by that node.

Node 0 forms 10 choose 3 = 120 3-stars
Node 1 forms 10 choose 3 = 120 3-stars
Node 2 forms 10 choose 3 = 120 3-stars
Node 4 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 6 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 7 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 3 does not have 3 or more neighbors
Node 5 does not have 3 or more neighbors
Node 8 does not have 3 or more neighbors
Node 9 does not have 3 or more neighbors

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 120 + 120 + 120 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 372

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [372].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
