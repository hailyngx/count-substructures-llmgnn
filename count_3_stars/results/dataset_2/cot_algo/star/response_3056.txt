Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 15) (5, 1) (9, 8) (9, 15) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 19) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 19) (10, 11) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 15) (12, 16) (0, 17) (0, 14) (0, 19) (0, 13) (14, 16) (14, 0) (14, 18) (18, 4) (18, 14) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 19) (13, 17) (13, 0) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 0) (19, 8) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 15) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

1: 3, 5, 7, 8, 11   
2: 10, 17  
3: 1, 4, 6, 19  
4: 3, 6, 18  
5: 1  
6: 3, 4, 7, 19  
7: 6, 8, 11  
8: 1, 7, 9, 19  
9: 8, 15  
10: 2, 11  
11: 1, 7, 10  
12: 16  
13: 0, 17  
14: 0, 16, 18  
15: 2, 9, 15, 17  
16: 12, 14, 15  
17: 2, 13, 15  
18: 4, 14, 19  
19: 3, 6, 8, 18  

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 also has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can also form 1 3-star.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes: \( 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 41 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 18>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 19>
<3, 8, 19>
<4, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 8>
<8, 9, 15>
<15, 16, 17>
<16, 17, 2>
<16, 17, 15>
<18, 19, 0>
