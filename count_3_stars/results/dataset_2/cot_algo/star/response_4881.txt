Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (12, 9) (12, 7) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {4, 6, 8, 11}
Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 6}
Node 2: {1, 5, 6}
Node 3: {1, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14}
Node 4: {0, 7, 13, 14}
Node 5: {1, 2, 9}
Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 7}
Node 7: {4, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14}
Node 8: {0, 3, 7, 9, 10, 13}
Node 9: {3, 5, 8, 10, 12}
Node 10: {3, 8, 9}
Node 11: {0, 7, 13}
Node 12: {7, 9}
Node 13: {4, 8, 11, 3}
Node 14: {4, 7, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 3: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
Node 7: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
Node 8: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 64

Therefore, the final answer is [64].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (1, 8, 13)>
<3, (1, 9, 10)>
<3, (1, 13, 14)>
<3, (8, 9, 10)>
<3, (8, 9, 12)>
<3, (8, 9, 13)>
<3, (9, 5, 12)>
<7, (4, 8, 13)>
<7, (4, 8, 11)>
<7, (4, 11, 13)>
<7, (8, 11, 13)>
<8, (0, 6, 11)>
<8, (0, 6, 14)>
<8, (0, 11, 14)>
<8, (6, 7, 14)>
<9, (3, 8, 10)>
