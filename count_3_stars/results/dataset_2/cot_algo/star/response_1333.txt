Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 7) (16, 20) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 22) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 24) (0, 21) (27, 26) (27, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 10) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 3) (22, 5) (22, 23) (22, 10) (22, 20) (22, 3) (23, 22) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 28) (18, 17) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 26) (1, 14) (26, 27) (26, 1) (21, 0) (28, 18) (28, 8) (28, 25) (28, 20) (17, 18) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 6) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 3) (13, 5) (24, 9) (24, 10) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 19) (20, 16) (20, 22) (20, 28) (20, 3) (10, 4) (10, 22) (10, 24) (10, 15) (10, 3) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 1) (25, 28) (25, 17) (8, 11) (8, 27) (8, 28) (19, 4) (19, 29) (19, 15) (19, 6) (6, 16) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 19) (3, 7) (3, 22) (3, 29) (3, 20) (3, 10) 

Response:
The nodes which have 3 or more neighbors are: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 27 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 68 \).

Therefore, we have found 68 unique 3-stars in this graph. Putting this number inside brackets gives us the final answer: [68].
