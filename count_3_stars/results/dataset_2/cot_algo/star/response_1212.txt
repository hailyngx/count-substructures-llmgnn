Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 18) (15, 2) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 16) (1, 29) (1, 23) (1, 18) (21, 24) (21, 0) (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 5) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 26) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 17) (12, 17) (12, 9) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 16) (18, 15) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 4) (19, 26) (19, 14) (26, 4) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 23) (26, 25) (24, 21) (24, 3) (24, 28) (24, 20) (24, 25) (13, 0) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 16) (3, 11) (3, 24) (3, 2) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 20) (28, 24) (22, 27) (22, 20) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 29) (23, 1) (23, 26) (23, 6) (29, 1) (29, 14) (29, 25) (16, 27) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 20) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 3) (6, 7) (6, 23) (6, 25) (20, 24) (20, 5) (20, 22) (20, 16) (8, 0) (9, 12) (25, 26) (25, 24) (25, 29) (25, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:

1. Find the number of neighbors for each node:
   - Node 0: 4 neighbors
   - Node 1: 3 neighbors
   - Node 2: 3 neighbors
   - Node 3: 3 neighbors
   - Node 4: 3 neighbors
   - Node 5: 3 neighbors
   - Node 6: 3 neighbors
   - Node 7: 4 neighbors
   - Node 8: 1 neighbor
   - Node 9: 1 neighbor
   - Node 10: 2 neighbors
   - Node 11: 6 neighbors
   - Node 12: 2 neighbors
   - Node 13: 4 neighbors
   - Node 14: 3 neighbors
   - Node 15: 2 neighbors
   - Node 16: 4 neighbors
   - Node 17: 3 neighbors
   - Node 18: 4 neighbors
   - Node 19: 2 neighbors
   - Node 20: 4 neighbors
   - Node 21: 2 neighbors
   - Node 22: 2 neighbors
   - Node 23: 3 neighbors
   - Node 24: 5 neighbors
   - Node 25: 4 neighbors
   - Node 26: 4 neighbors
   - Node 27: 3 neighbors
   - Node 28: 1 neighbor
   - Node 29: 3 neighbors

2. Calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
   - Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 1: 1 3-star
   - Node 2: 1 3-star
   - Node 3: 1 3-star
   - Node 4: 1 3-star
   - Node 5: 1 3-star
   - Node 6: 1 3-star
   - Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   - Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 27: 1 3-star
   - Node 29: 1 3-star

3. Total number of 3-stars: 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (8, 13, 21)>
<0, (8, 13, 26)>
<0, (8, 13, 27)>
<0, (21, 24, 27)>
<1, (18, 23, 29)>
<2, (3, 7, 11)>
<4, (11, 18, 26)>
<5, (13, 16, 20)>
<7, (4, 17, 26)>
<24, (20, 25, 28)>
<25, (6, 24, 29)>
<25, (6, 25, 29)>
