Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8
- Node 2: 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 7, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 7) ==> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (0, 4, 8, 9) ==> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 9) ==> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (0, 4, 6, 7) ==> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 8, 9) ==> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 7, 9) ==> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (3, 4, 7, 8) ==> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 40

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [40].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
