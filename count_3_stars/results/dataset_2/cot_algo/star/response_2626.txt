Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 9) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 10, 14}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 12}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 9, 10}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 11}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5, 6, 10}
- Node 8: {2, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {3, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 11: {4, 8, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 2, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {5, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 6, 8, 9, 12} 

Nodes 0, 8, and 11 have 3 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars. 
- Node 0: <0, (6, 10, 14)>
- Node 8: <8, (2, 11, 14)>
- Node 11: <11, (4, 8, 14)>

Since there is 1 unique 3-star possible for each of the nodes with 3 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
