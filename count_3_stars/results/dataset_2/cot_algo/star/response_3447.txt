Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (0, 7) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 4) (8, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {7, 5}
- Node 1: {7, 6, 5, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {7, 12, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 11, 14, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 10, 8, 4}
- Node 6: {7, 1, 10, 2, 11}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 6, 14, 1}
- Node 8: {12, 10, 11, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 10: {6, 8, 13, 5}
- Node 11: {6, 14, 8, 4}
- Node 12: {13, 3, 8}
- Node 13: {12, 2, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {7, 2, 11, 4, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1:  \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4:  \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5:  \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6:  \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7:  \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14:  \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [60], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 10, 11)>, <7, (14, 6, 1)>, <14, (7, 11, 4)>
