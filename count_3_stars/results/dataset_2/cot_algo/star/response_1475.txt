Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 19) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 5) (17, 2) (17, 15) (18, 4) (18, 9) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 0) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 19) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 6) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 12) (9, 8) (9, 18) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 19) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 1) (12, 10) (12, 19) (12, 3) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {2, 6, 7}
Node 1: {6}
Node 2: {0, 8, 15, 17}
Node 3: {8, 12, 14}
Node 4: {8, 13, 14, 18}
Node 5: {10, 11, 19}
Node 6: {0, 1, 11}
Node 7: {0, 10}
Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 9, 13, 14}
Node 9: {8, 18}
Node 10: {5, 7, 12}
Node 11: {5, 6, 15, 16}
Node 12: {3, 10, 19}
Node 13: {4, 8, 19}
Node 14: {3, 4, 8, 14, 19}
Node 15: {2, 11, 17, 19}
Node 16: {11}
Node 17: {2, 15}
Node 18: {4, 9}
Node 19: {5, 12, 13, 14, 15}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 60   

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60], and the unique 3-stars are:
