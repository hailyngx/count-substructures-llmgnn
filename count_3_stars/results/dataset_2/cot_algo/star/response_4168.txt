Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 12) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 9, 10}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 10}
- Node 6: {2, 3}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {12}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 3, 5, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {3, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 9, 14}
- Node 14: {3, 7, 10, 11, 13}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph by examining nodes with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 4: No 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 6: No 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 9: No 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 10: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 11: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 12: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 13: No 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 14: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 84

Therefore, the final answer is [84], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 12, 13)>
<0, (2, 12, 13)>
<0, (7, 12, 13)>
<0, (10, 12, 13)>
<1, (3, 10, 14)>
<2, (5, 10, 14)>
<3, (7, 11, 14)>
<7, (11, 12, 14)>
<10, (12, 14, 11)>
