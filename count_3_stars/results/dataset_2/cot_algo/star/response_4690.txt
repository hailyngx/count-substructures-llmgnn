Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (10, 17) (10, 18) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 11) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 18) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 0) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 2) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 15) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 7) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 1) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 12) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 19) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 19) (11, 17) (11, 1) (11, 15) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 1) (14, 6) (2, 4) (2, 13) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 11) (12, 6) (12, 18) 

Response:
This graph forms multiple 3-stars. Let's find and count them:

For Node 6:
- Neighbors: 9, 14, 12
- 3-stars: <6, (9, 14, 12)>

For Node 9:
- Neighbors: 6, 8
- 3-stars: [1]

For Node 10:
- Neighbors: 17, 18
- 3-stars: [1]

For Node 17:
- Neighbors: 10, 3, 5, 11
- 3-stars: <17, (10, 5, 11)>

For Node 4:
- Neighbors: 8, 1, 3, 2
- 3-stars: <4, (8, 3, 2)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>

For Node 8:
- Neighbors: 9, 4, 3, 18
- 3-stars: <8, (9, 4, 3)>

For Node 5:
- Neighbors: 17, 13, 15, 0
- 3-stars: <5, (17, 13, 15)>

For Node 13:
- Neighbors: 5, 16, 2
- 3-stars: [1]

For Node 0:
- Neighbors: 5, 16, 15
- 3-stars: [1]

For Node 16:
- Neighbors: 13, 0, 7
- 3-stars: [1]

For Node 7:
- Neighbors: 16, 19, 1
- 3-stars: [1]

For Node 18:
- Neighbors: 10, 8, 12
- 3-stars: [1]

For Node 3:
- Neighbors: 17, 4, 8, 19
- 3-stars: <3, (17, 4, 19)>

For Node 1:
- Neighbors: 4, 7, 11, 19
- 3-stars: <1, (4, 7, 11)>

For Node 11:
- Neighbors: 17, 1, 15
- 3-stars: [1]

For Node 19:
- Neighbors: 7, 3, 1
- 3-stars: [1]

For Node 14:
- Neighbors: 6
- No 3-stars

For Node 2:
- Neighbors: 4, 13
- No 3-stars

For Node 15:
- Neighbors: 5, 0, 11
- No 3-stars

For Node 12:
