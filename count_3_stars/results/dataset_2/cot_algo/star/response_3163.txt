Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 16) (17, 8) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 15) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 1) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 15) (12, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 15) (3, 10) (3, 9) (16, 17) (16, 15) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 4) (15, 11) (15, 16) (19, 14) (19, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

1. Node 0: neighbors {1, 7, 10, 13}
2. Node 1: neighbors {0, 6, 9}
3. Node 2: neighbors {5, 11, 18}
4. Node 3: neighbors {9, 10}
5. Node 4: neighbors {5, 15, 19}
6. Node 5: neighbors {2, 4, 6, 10}
7. Node 6: neighbors {1, 5}
8. Node 7: neighbors {0, 11, 13, 14, 15}
9. Node 8: neighbors {10, 11, 17}
10. Node 9: neighbors {1, 3, 14}
11. Node 10: neighbors {0, 3, 5, 8}
12. Node 11: neighbors {2, 7, 8, 15}
13. Node 12: neighbors {7, 13}
14. Node 13: neighbors {0, 7, 12, 14}
15. Node 15: neighbors {4, 7, 11, 16}
16. Node 16: neighbors {15, 17}
17. Node 17: neighbors {8, 16}
18. Node 18: neighbors {2, 15}
19. Node 19: neighbors {4, 14}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

1. For Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
2. For Node 5, 7, 10, 11, and 15: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars each
3. For Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
4. For Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20

Therefore, the final answer is [20].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 13)>
<0, (1, 7, 10)>
<0, (1, 10, 13)>
<0, (7, 13, 14)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 10)>
<5, (2, 6, 10)>
<5, (4, 6, 10)>
<7, (0, 11, 13)>
<7, (0, 11, 15)>
<7, (0, 13, 14)>
<7, (11, 13, 15)>
<10, (0, 3, 5)>
<10, (0, 3, 8)>
<10, (0, 5, 8)>
<10, (3, 5, 8)>
<11, (2, 7, 8)>
<11, (2, 7, 15)>
<11, (2, 8, 15)>
<11, (7, 8, 15)>
<15, (4, 7, 11)>
<15, (4, 7, 16)>
<15, (4, 11, 16)>
<15, (7, 11, 16)>
