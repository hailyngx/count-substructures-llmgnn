Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 26) (27, 0) (27, 14) (27, 1) (27, 6) (27, 8) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 15) (17, 7) (29, 19) (29, 5) (29, 14) (29, 24) (11, 21) (11, 20) (28, 16) (28, 5) (1, 27) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 22) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 23) (8, 27) (8, 24) (8, 25) (8, 12) (9, 20) (9, 12) (16, 28) (16, 22) (16, 18) (16, 23) (22, 1) (22, 16) (22, 10) (18, 16) (18, 7) (19, 29) (19, 20) (5, 29) (5, 28) (5, 26) (5, 21) (5, 3) (26, 0) (26, 5) (21, 11) (21, 5) (10, 0) (10, 22) (10, 13) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 3) (6, 27) (6, 17) (24, 29) (24, 8) (24, 13) (23, 15) (23, 16) (23, 25) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 24) (13, 12) (14, 27) (14, 29) (14, 20) (14, 25) (4, 1) (25, 8) (25, 23) (25, 14) (20, 11) (20, 9) (20, 19) (20, 14) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:

Node 0: 27, 10, 26
Node 1: 27, 15, 4, 22
Node 2: No neighbors
Node 3: 5, 7, 13
Node 4: 1
Node 5: 29, 28, 26, 21, 3
Node 6: 27, 17
Node 7: 17, 18, 3
Node 8: 27, 24, 25, 12
Node 9: 20, 12
Node 10: 0, 22, 13
Node 11: 21, 20
Node 12: 17, 8, 9, 13
Node 13: 10, 3, 24, 12
Node 14: 27, 29, 20, 25
Node 15: 17, 1, 23
Node 16: 28, 22, 18, 23
Node 17: 6, 12, 15, 7
Node 18: 16, 7
Node 19: 29, 20
Node 20: 11, 9, 19, 14
Node 21: 11, 5
Node 22: 1, 16, 10
Node 23: 15, 16, 25
Node 24: 29, 8, 13
Node 25: 8, 23, 14
Node 26: 0, 5
Node 27: 0, 14, 1, 6, 8
Node 28: 16, 5
Node 29: 19, 5, 14, 24

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed:
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars is [48], and they are:
