Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 18) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 15) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 8) (13, 19) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 7) (3, 14) (3, 16) (11, 12) (11, 1) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 5) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 10) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 16) (16, 3) (16, 10) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (5, 17) (5, 1) (5, 2) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 13) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by listing the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 12}
- Node 1: {14, 11, 15, 5}
- Node 2: {7, 10, 5, 12}
- Node 3: {14, 16}
- Node 4: {8, 18, 12}
- Node 5: {17, 1, 2}
- Node 6: {9, 17, 0}
- Node 7: {2, 12, 18}
- Node 8: {13, 4}
- Node 9: {6, 18}
- Node 10: {15, 2, 16}
- Node 11: {12, 1}
- Node 12: {4, 7, 2, 0, 11}
- Node 13: {8, 19}
- Node 14: {17, 3, 1, 19}
- Node 15: {17, 1, 10}
- Node 16: {3, 10}
- Node 17: {6, 14, 5, 15, 19}
- Node 18: {9, 4, 7}
- Node 19: {14, 17, 13}

Now, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 12, Node 14, Node 15, Node 17, and Node 19.

For each of these nodes, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 0 3-stars
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 0 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: 0 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives: 
1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 36. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (14, 11, 15)>
- <2, (7, 10, 5)>
- <5, (17, 1, 2)>
- <6, (9, 0, 17)>
- <15, (17, 1, 10)>
- <17, (19, 14, 15)>
- <17, (14, 5, 15)>
- <17, (14, 15, 19)>
- <19, (17, 14, 13)>
- <19, (14, 17, 13)>
- <19, (17, 15, 13)>
- <19, (14, 15, 13)>
- <19, (17, 14, 15)>
- <19, (17, 14, 5)>
- <19, (17, 5, 15)>
- <19, (14, 17, 15)>
- <19, (17, 14, 3)>
- <19, (14, 17, 3)>
- <19, (17, 15, 1)>
- <19, (14, 17, 1)>
