Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 16) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 3) (4, 15) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 17) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 12) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 3) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 18) (5, 19) (5, 8) (19, 6) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 0) (15, 4) (15, 2) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 8) (13, 17) (13, 16) (0, 19) (0, 16) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (14, 11) (14, 19) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 16) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 19) (2, 15) (2, 1) (18, 6) (18, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {19, 16, 1}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 3, 19, 15, 1}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 11, 12, 2, 18}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 15}
- Node 5: Neighbors {19, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {18, 19, 16}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9, 12, 17, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7, 5, 16}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 10: Neighbors {11, 17}
- Node 11: Neighbors {10, 14, 3}
- Node 12: Neighbors {7, 17, 3}
- Node 13: Neighbors {17, 16}
- Node 14: Neighbors {11, 19}
- Node 15: Neighbors {4, 2}
- Node 16: Neighbors {6, 0, 13, 8}
- Node 17: Neighbors {7, 10, 13, 12}
- Node 18: Neighbors {6, 3}
- Node 19: Neighbors {6, 5, 2, 14, 0}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes {18, 19, 16}
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes {12, 17, 8}

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <6, (18, 19, 16)>
- <7, (12, 17, 8)>
