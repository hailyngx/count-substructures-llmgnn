Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 10) (22, 5) (22, 10) (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 23) (25, 2) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 6) (8, 24) (28, 29) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 14) (28, 15) (29, 28) (29, 26) (29, 23) (29, 18) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 26) (14, 28) (14, 19) (14, 16) (21, 28) (21, 27) (21, 19) (21, 15) (26, 29) (26, 0) (5, 22) (5, 25) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 14) (19, 21) (19, 5) (19, 12) (2, 25) (2, 1) (2, 11) (7, 20) (7, 28) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 23) (16, 9) (3, 17) (3, 27) (17, 0) (17, 3) (17, 24) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 23) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 23) (24, 8) (24, 17) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 11) (27, 21) (27, 3) (18, 29) (18, 5) (18, 12) (12, 19) (12, 18) (11, 20) (11, 2) (11, 9) (10, 13) (10, 22) (15, 28) (15, 21) (23, 25) (23, 29) (23, 16) (23, 1) (23, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 17, 26}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 9, 23}
- Node 2: {1, 11, 25}
- Node 3: {17, 27}
- Node 4: {6, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {18, 19, 22, 25}
- Node 6: {4, 23}
- Node 7: {20, 28}
- Node 8: {24}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 11, 16}
- Node 10: {13, 22}
- Node 11: {2, 9, 20}
- Node 12: {18, 19}
- Node 13: {4, 10, 16}
- Node 14: {16, 19, 28}
- Node 15: {21, 28}
- Node 16: {13, 14, 23}
- Node 17: {0, 3, 24}
- Node 18: {5, 12, 29}
- Node 19: {5, 12, 14, 21}
- Node 20: {7, 11, 25}
- Node 21: {15, 19, 27, 28}
- Node 22: {5, 10}
- Node 23: {1, 6, 16, 25, 29}
- Node 24: {8, 17}
- Node 25: {2, 5, 20, 23}
- Node 26: {0, 29}
- Node 27: {3, 21}
- Node 28: {7, 14, 15, 21, 29}
- Node 29: {18, 23, 26, 28}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star
- Node 21: 1 3-star
- Node 23: 1 3-star
- Node 25: 1 3-star
- Node 28: 1 3-star
- Node 29: 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 10, so the final answer is [10].

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, 0, 9>
<9, 1, 4>
<13, 4, 16>
<16, 13, 23>
<19, 14, 21>
<21, 15, 19>
<23, 1, 29>
<25, 2, 20>
<28, 14, 29>
<29, 23, 18>
