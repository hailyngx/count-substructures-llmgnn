Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 18) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 0) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 16) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 2) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 3) (16, 18) (16, 13) (16, 12) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 19) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 0) (7, 10) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 17) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 14) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 12) (17, 2) 

Response:
Given that this is a graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can start by listing the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {4, 18, 3}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 19}
- Node 2: {15, 9, 17}
- Node 3: {5, 12, 0}
- Node 4: {8, 12, 0, 6}
- Node 5: {13, 1, 15, 3}
- Node 6: {4, 1, 19}
- Node 7: {10}
- Node 8: {4, 18}
- Node 9: {11, 2, 14}
- Node 10: {11, 15, 7}
- Node 11: {10, 9}
- Node 12: {4, 15, 16, 17, 3}
- Node 13: {5, 16}
- Node 14: {18, 9, 19}
- Node 15: {10, 5, 12, 2}
- Node 16: {18, 13, 12}
- Node 17: {12, 2}
- Node 18: {8, 16, 14, 0}
- Node 19: {1, 6, 14}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4, 18, 3
- Node 1: 5, 6, 19
- Node 2: 15, 9, 17
- Node 3: 5, 12, 0
- Node 4: 8, 12, 0, 6
- Node 5: 13, 1, 15, 3
- Node 6: 4, 1, 19
- Node 9: 11, 2, 14
- Node 10: 11, 15, 7
- Node 12: 4, 15, 16, 17, 3
- Node 14: 18, 9, 19
- Node 15: 10, 5, 12, 2
- Node 16: 18, 13, 12
- Node 18: 8, 16, 14, 0
- Node 19: 1, 6, 14

Next, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [34]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 4, 18>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 18, 3>, <1, 5, 19>, <2, 9, 17>, <3, 12, 0>, <4, 6, 1>, <5, 15, 2>, <9, 11, 2>, <12, 16, 17>, <14, 18, 9>, <15, 12, 16>, <18, 16, 13>, <19, 1, 6>
