Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 12) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 1) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 12) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {4, 9, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {8, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 8, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 9, 11}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 10}
- Node 7: {3, 10}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {1, 5, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 9, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 10, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 4, 11}

To calculate the number of 3-stars, we need to consider the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, 4, 13>
<0, 4, 14>
<0, 9, 12>
<0, 9, 13>
<0, 12, 13>
<1, 8, 12>
<1, 8, 14>
<2, 6, 13>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 8, 14>
<6, 10, 13>
<10, 12, 13>
<11, 5, 14>
<12, 1, 14>
