Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 3) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 10) (15, 27) (15, 12) (15, 24) (15, 16) (27, 15) (27, 8) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 29) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 23) (17, 11) (7, 21) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 9) (21, 18) (0, 20) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (20, 0) (20, 23) (20, 28) (1, 17) (1, 26) (1, 5) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 8) (26, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 27) (8, 14) (8, 26) (29, 14) (29, 17) (29, 28) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 24) (28, 20) (28, 29) (3, 13) (3, 7) (11, 22) (11, 17) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 25) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 20) (23, 26) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 26) (12, 16) (12, 6) (9, 21) (18, 13) (18, 21) (18, 25) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 1) (24, 15) (24, 19) (24, 10) (10, 22) (10, 19) (10, 24) (4, 0) (4, 6) (25, 16) (25, 18) (6, 12) (6, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 20}
- Node 1: {5, 17, 26}
- Node 2: {0, 14}
- Node 3: {7, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 22}
- Node 6: {4, 12}
- Node 7: {3, 19, 21, 23}
- Node 8: {14, 26, 27}
- Node 9: {21}
- Node 10: {19, 22, 24}
- Node 11: {17, 22}
- Node 12: {6, 14, 15, 16, 26}
- Node 13: {3, 18, 22}
- Node 14: {2, 8, 12, 29}
- Node 15: {12, 16, 24, 27}
- Node 16: {12, 15, 25}
- Node 17: {1, 11, 17, 23, 29}
- Node 18: {13, 21, 25}
- Node 19: {7, 10, 24}
- Node 20: {0, 23, 28}
- Node 21: {7, 9, 18}
- Node 22: {5, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 23: {7, 17, 20, 26}
- Node 24: {10, 15, 19}
- Node 25: {16, 18}
- Node 26: {1, 8, 12, 23}
- Node 27: {8, 15}
- Node 28: {20, 29}
- Node 29: {14, 17, 28}

Now, let's count the 3-stars:
Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {2, 8, 12, 29} => [\[ \binom {4}{3} = 4 \]]
Node 17 has 5 neighbors: {1, 11, 17, 23, 29} => [\[ \binom {5}{3} = 10 \]]
Node 22 has 4 neighbors: {5, 10, 11, 13} => [\[ \binom {4}{3} = 4 \]]
Node 26 has 4 neighbors: {1, 8, 12, 23} => [\[ \binom {4}{3} = 4 \]]
Node 29 has 3 neighbors: {14, 17, 28} => 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 23

Therefore, the final answer is [23].

Unique 3-stars:
<14, (2, 8, 12)>
<17, (1, 11, 23)>
<22, (5, 10, 11)>
<26, (1, 8, 12)>
<29, (17, 14, 28)>
