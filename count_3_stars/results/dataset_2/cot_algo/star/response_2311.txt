Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 8) (1, 16) (1, 18) (12, 10) (12, 17) (2, 15) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 11) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 14) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 10) (9, 17) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 15) (14, 13) (14, 16) (14, 11) (18, 1) (18, 0) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 0) (0, 18) (0, 17) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {17, 18}
- Node 1: {16, 18}
- Node 2: {15, 8}
- Node 3: {15, 5}
- Node 4: {7, 11, 16, 19}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 11}
- Node 6: {10, 11}
- Node 7: {4, 8, 10, 16}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 9: {17}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 12, 19}
- Node 11: {4, 5, 6, 14}
- Node 12: {10, 17}
- Node 13: {14, 15, 19}
- Node 14: {11, 13, 15, 16}
- Node 15: {2, 3, 13, 14, 17}
- Node 16: {1, 4, 7, 14}
- Node 17: {0, 9, 12, 15}
- Node 18: {0, 1}
- Node 19: {4, 10, 13}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 37 \). 

Thus, the final answer is [37].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (7, 11, 16)>
- <5, (3, 8, 11)>
- <7, (4, 8, 16)>
- <8, (2, 5, 8)>
- <10, (6, 12, 19)>
- <11, (4, 5, 14)>
- <14, (11, 13, 16)>
- <15, (2, 13, 17)>
- <17, (0, 12, 15)>
- <19, (10, 13, 4)>
