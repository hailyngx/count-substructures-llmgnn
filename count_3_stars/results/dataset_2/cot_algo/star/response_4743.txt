Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 6, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 8, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 4, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 8, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 9, 8, 6, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 6, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 4, 7, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {8, 6, 0, 2, 3, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 4, 3, 1, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8, 4, 2, 3, 0}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 10 + 20 = 30
Therefore, the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 6)>, <4, (5, 9, 6)>, <4, (8, 9, 6)>, <4, (8, 9, 2)>, <4, (8, 6, 2)>, <4, (9, 6, 2)>, <4, (9, 6, 5)>, <4, (8, 6, 5)>, <4, (5, 9, 2)>, <7, (8, 3, 1)>, <7, (8, 3, 0)>, <7, (8, 3, 9)>, <7, (8, 3, 2)>, <7, (8, 3, 4)>, <7, (8, 1, 0)>, <7, (8, 1, 9)>, <7, (8, 1, 2)>, <7, (8, 1, 4)>, <7, (8, 0, 9)>, <7, (8, 0, 2)>, <7, (8, 0, 4)>, <7, (8, 9, 2)>, <7, (8, 9, 4)>, <7, (8, 2, 4)>, <7, (8, 2, 0)>, <7, (8, 4, 0)>, <7, (8, 4, 2)>, <7, (3, 1, 0)>, <7, (3, 1, 9)>, <7, (3, 1, 2)>
