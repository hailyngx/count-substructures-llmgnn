Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>
