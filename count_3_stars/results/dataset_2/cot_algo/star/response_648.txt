Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 19) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 16) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 15) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 2) (3, 0) (3, 16) (15, 17) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 19) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 4) (4, 8) (4, 13) (1, 17) (1, 12) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 16) (18, 6) (18, 19) (0, 5) (0, 17) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 12) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 0) (16, 6) (16, 3) (16, 19) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 19) (7, 6) (7, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 17, 10, 3, 12
- Node 1: 17, 12
- Node 2: 14, 11, 19
- Node 3: 0, 16
- Node 4: 8, 13
- Node 5: 13, 0
- Node 6: 9, 7, 18, 16
- Node 7: 6, 10
- Node 8: 11, 4, 19
- Node 9: 6, 19
- Node 10: 11, 0, 7
- Node 11: 14, 10, 8, 2
- Node 12: 17, 13, 1, 0
- Node 13: 5, 12, 4
- Node 14: 17, 11, 2
- Node 15: 17
- Node 16: 6, 3, 19
- Node 17: 14, 1, 0, 12, 15
- Node 18: 6, 19
- Node 19: 9, 8, 18, 2, 16

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 6, Node 8, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 16, and Node 19 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them using \( \binom{n}{3} \).

- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars from the nodes above: 
\( 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 46 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

And the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 17, 10>, <0, 17, 3>, <0, 17, 12>, <0, 10, 3>, <0, 10, 12>, <6, 9, 19>, <6, 9, 18>, <6, 9, 16>, <6, 7, 18>, <6, 7, 16>, <6, 18, 16>, <8, 11, 4>, <8, 11, 13>, <8, 11, 19>, <11, 14, 2>, <11, 14, 8>, <11, 14, 10>, <11, 2, 19>, <12, 17, 1>, <12, 17, 15>, <12, 1, 17>, <12, 1, 0>, <12, 0, 17>, <17, 14, 2>, <17, 14, 11>, <17, 14, 8>, <17, 14, 10>, <17, 2, 11>, <17, 2, 19>, <19, 9, 8>, <19, 9, 18>, <19, 9, 16>, <19, 8, 18>, <19, 8, 16>, <19, 18, 16>
