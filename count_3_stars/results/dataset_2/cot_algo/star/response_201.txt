Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {8, 3, 12, 2}
Node 1 neighbors: {6, 12, 2, 14, 5}
Node 2 neighbors: {6, 3, 0, 1}
Node 3 neighbors: {9, 11, 0, 10, 13, 2}
Node 4 neighbors: {7, 8, 12, 13, 5}
Node 5 neighbors: {4, 8, 1, 10}
Node 6 neighbors: {9, 1, 2}
Node 7 neighbors: {4, 10, 14}
Node 8 neighbors: {4, 5, 14, 0}
Node 9 neighbors: {6, 14, 3, 13}
Node 10 neighbors: {7, 3, 5}
Node 11 neighbors: {3, 14}
Node 12 neighbors: {4, 0, 13, 1}
Node 13 neighbors: {4, 3, 12, 9}
Node 14 neighbors: {9, 7, 8, 11, 1}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 11 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 70.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 8, 14>, <0, 12, 4>, <0, 12, 13>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 6, 3>, <1, 12, 4>, <1, 12, 13>, <1, 14, 9>, <3, 9, 13>, <4, 12, 13>, <4, 7, 10>, <4, 7, 14>, <5, 8, 14>.
