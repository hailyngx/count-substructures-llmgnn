Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 6) (8, 18) (13, 2) (13, 0) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 14) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 17) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 1) (15, 10) (15, 14) (7, 16) (7, 1) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 2) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 12) (6, 4) (17, 19) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 9) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 19) (11, 1) (11, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 2) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 3) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 3) (14, 5) (14, 15) (14, 1) (18, 8) (18, 6) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {13, 9}
Node 1: {10, 7, 11, 14}
Node 2: {13, 16, 4}
Node 3: {16, 9, 12}
Node 4: {5, 6, 11, 2}
Node 5: {19, 4, 14}
Node 6: {8, 17, 18, 12, 4}
Node 7: {1, 16}
Node 8: {6, 18}
Node 9: {17, 0, 3}
Node 10: {15, 12, 1}
Node 11: {19, 1, 4}
Node 12: {10, 6, 3}
Node 13: {2, 0}
Node 14: {5, 15, 1}
Node 15: {10, 14}
Node 16: {7, 17, 3, 2}
Node 17: {19, 16, 6, 9}
Node 18: {8, 6}
Node 19: {5, 11, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Nodes forming 3-stars: 6, 17, 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, 4, 12>, <6, 4, 17>, <6, 4, 18>, <6, 12, 17>, <6, 12, 4>,
<17, 6, 18>, <17, 6, 4>, <17, 6, 9>,
<1, 10, 15>, <1, 10, 14>, <1, 15, 14>, <1, 7, 16>
