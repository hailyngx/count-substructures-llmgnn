Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 9) (8, 11) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 10}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {4, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {6, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {4, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {5, 10, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 5, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 5: [inom{6}{3}] = [20]
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 66

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 2, 8, 13>, <1, 2, 5, 14>, <1, 2, 6, 14>, <1, 3, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 5, 10>, <1, 3, 5, 14>, <1, 4, 9, 12>, <5, 8, 9, 14>, <5, 8, 11, 14>, <5, 8, 9, 11>, <6, 10, 11, 13> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [66].
