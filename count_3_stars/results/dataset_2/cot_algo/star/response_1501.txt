Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 1) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (1, 12) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 6) (2, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 10) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 3) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 10}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8, 9, 11}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 6, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 7, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 14: Neighbors {2, 5, 11, 12}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 7: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 11: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4

The total number of 3-stars is \(1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 89\).
Therefore, the final answer is [89].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 3, 5>, <3, 7, 10>, <5, 6, 13>, <5, 7, 14>, <6, 7, 11>, <11, 14, 12>
