Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 9) (16, 2) (16, 4) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 14) (13, 15) (13, 7) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 6) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 15) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (4, 16) (4, 12) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 6) (18, 0) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 17) (19, 1) (19, 18) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 18) (14, 5) (2, 16) (2, 9) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 0) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 0) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 9) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {17, 18, 9, 6}
- Node 1: {10, 19}
- Node 2: {16, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 8}
- Node 4: {16, 12, 18}
- Node 5: {3, 17, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {10, 18, 0}
- Node 7: {13, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 14}
- Node 9: {11, 2, 0}
- Node 10: {1, 17, 15, 6}
- Node 11: {14, 9}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 14}
- Node 13: {15, 7}
- Node 14: {11, 8, 12, 18, 5}
- Node 15: {13, 10, 17}
- Node 16: {2, 4}
- Node 17: {10, 15, 0, 5}
- Node 18: {4, 19, 14, 6, 0}
- Node 19: {1, 18}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 14: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 18: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 39

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 17, 18)>
<4, (12, 14, 18)>
<5, (7, 14, 17)>
<5, (3, 12, 14)>
