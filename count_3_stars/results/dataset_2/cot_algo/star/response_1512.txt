Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 17) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 13) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 19) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 17) (0, 16) (0, 2) (8, 19) (8, 18) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 14) (16, 0) (16, 1) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 18) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 15) (17, 5) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 12) (14, 19) (14, 15) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 16) (1, 2) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 2) (15, 14) (10, 2) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 12) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the adjacency list for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: [16, 2, 1]
Node 1: [4, 7, 16, 2]
Node 2: [0, 1, 10, 15]
Node 3: [11, 13, 19]
Node 4: [7, 1, 11, 15]
Node 5: [6, 17]
Node 6: [5, 15, 18, 13]
Node 7: [9, 4, 1]
Node 8: [19, 18]
Node 9: [7, 13]
Node 10: [2]
Node 11: [4, 3, 12, 17]
Node 12: [11, 17, 18]
Node 13: [9, 6, 3]
Node 14: [19, 15]
Node 15: [4, 6, 2, 14]
Node 16: [0, 1]
Node 17: [5, 11, 19, 12]
Node 18: [6, 8, 12]
Node 19: [3, 8, 17, 14]

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 5, 6, 4, 1, 7, 15, 11, 17, 12, 19

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

For node 5: Only 1 3-star can be formed with <5, 6, 17>
For node 6: Only 1 3-star can be formed with <6, 5, 15>
For node 4: Only 1 3-star can be formed with <4, 7, 1>
For node 1: Only 1 3-star can be formed with <1, 4, 16>
For node 7: Only 1 3-star can be formed with <7, 4, 1>
For node 15: Only 1 3-star can be formed with <15, 4, 6>
For node 11: Only 1 3-star can be formed with <11, 3, 12>
For node 17: Only 1 3-star can be formed with <17, 5, 11>
For node 12: Only 1 3-star can be formed with <12, 11, 18>
For node 19: Only 1 3-star can be formed with <19, 3, 17>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10

Thus, the final count of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
