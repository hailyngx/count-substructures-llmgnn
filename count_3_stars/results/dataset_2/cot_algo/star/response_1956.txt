Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {6, 2, 7, 1}
Node 1: {9, 8, 0, 7}
Node 2: {0, 3, 7}
Node 3: {5, 9, 4, 8, 2, 7}
Node 4: {9, 8, 3}
Node 5: {9, 8, 3}
Node 6: {9, 0}
Node 7: {8, 2, 0, 3, 1}
Node 8: {5, 4, 3, 1, 7}
Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 3, 1}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes 3, 8, and 9.

For node 3:
- Inom{5}{3} = 10
- <3, (5, 9, 4)>, <3, (5, 8, 7)>, <3, (9, 4, 8)>, <3, (9, 4, 1)>, <3, (9, 8, 7)> (5 unique 3-stars)

For node 8:
- Inom{5}{3} = 10
- <8, (5, 4, 7)>, <8, (5, 4, 1)>, <8, (5, 3, 1)>, <8, (5, 7, 1)>, <8, (4, 3, 7)> (5 unique 3-stars)

For node 9:
- Inom{5}{3} = 10
- <9, (5, 4, 8)>, <9, (5, 4, 1)>, <9, (5, 3, 1)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>, <9, (4, 3, 8)> (5 unique 3-stars)

Total number of 3-stars = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
