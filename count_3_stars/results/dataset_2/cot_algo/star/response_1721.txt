Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 13) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 16) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 12) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 2) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 14) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 3) (7, 18) (7, 14) (16, 6) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 15) (3, 12) (11, 19) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 15) (14, 19) (14, 7) (1, 18) (1, 16) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 15) 

Response:
First, let's create an adjacency list based on the given edges:

1: (18, 16)
2: (6, 10, 15)
3: (12)
4: (6, 10, 18, 12)
5: (17, 0)
6: (2, 4, 0, 16)
7: (18, 14)
8: (13, 19, 14)
9: (13)
10: (6, 4, 17, 15)
11: (19)
12: (4, 16, 3)
13: (9, 8, 14, 0)
14: (8, 13, 15, 19, 7)
15: (10, 0, 14, 2)
16: (6, 17, 12, 1)
17: (5, 10, 16)
18: (4, 7, 1)
19: (8, 11, 14)

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate how many 3-stars can be formed around them:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is formed: <2, (6, 10, 15)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so 4 3-stars are formed: <4, (6, 10, 18)>, <4, (6, 10, 12)>, <4, (6, 18, 12)>, <4, (10, 18, 12)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so 4 3-stars are formed: <6, (2, 4, 16)>, <6, (2, 4, 0)>, <6, (2, 4, 10)>, <6, (4, 16, 1)>
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so 4 3-stars are formed: <10, (6, 4, 17)>, <10, (6, 4, 15)>, <10, (6, 4, 10)>, <10, (4, 17, 16)>
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so 4 3-stars are formed: <13, (8, 14, 19)>, <13, (8, 14, 0)>, <13, (8, 14, 15)>, <13, (8, 19, 11)>
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so 10 3-stars are formed: <14, (8, 13, 19)>, <14, (8, 13, 15)>, <14, (8, 13, 7)>, <14, (8, 19, 11)>, <14, (13, 15, 19)>, <14, (13, 15, 7)>, <14, (13, 19, 7)>, <14, (15, 19, 7)>, <14, (8, 15, 19)>, <14, (8, 15, 7)>
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so 4 3-stars are formed: <16, (6, 17, 12)>, <16, (6, 17, 1)>, <16, (6, 12, 3)>, <16, (17, 12, 1)>
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is formed: <18, (4, 7, 1)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 32.
Thus, the final answer is [32].
