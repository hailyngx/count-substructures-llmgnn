Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 13) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 6) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {5, 9, 13, 6, 2}
Node 1: {9, 4, 10, 11, 14, 13}
Node 2: {5, 7, 0}
Node 3: {4, 6}
Node 4: {5, 7, 12, 1, 3}
Node 5: {2, 4, 0}
Node 6: {10, 0, 14, 3}
Node 7: {4, 12, 11, 14, 2}
Node 8: {9, 10, 11}
Node 9: {8, 1, 0}
Node 10: {11, 6, 8, 1}
Node 11: {7, 10, 1, 8, 12}
Node 12: {4, 7, 11, 13}
Node 13: {12, 0, 14, 1}
Node 14: {7, 6, 1, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 50, so the final answer is [50].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 9, 13)>
<0, (5, 9, 2)>
<0, (5, 9, 6)>
<0, (5, 13, 6)>
<0, (9, 13, 6)>
<1, (9, 4, 10)>
<1, (9, 4, 11)>
<1, (9, 4, 13)>
<1, (9, 10, 11)>
<1, (9, 10, 13)>
<1, (9, 11, 13)>
<1, (4, 10, 11)>
<1, (4, 11, 13)>
<1, (10, 11, 13)>
<4, (5, 7, 12)>
<4, (5, 7, 3)>
<4, (5, 12, 3)>
<4, (7, 12, 3)>
<7, (11, 12, 13)>
