Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 14) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 6) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 18) (18, 16) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 15) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 0) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 17) (17, 19) (17, 12) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 1) (2, 0) (14, 16) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 10) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 15) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 15) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 6) (15, 9) (10, 14) (10, 6) (12, 8) (12, 17) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph using the adjacency list:

```
0: 5, 2
1: 2, 9
2: 11, 19, 1, 0
3: 11, 9, 5
4: 8, 9, 13
5: 3, 0
6: 7, 10, 15
7: 6, 13
8: 4, 13, 14, 12
9: 4, 3, 1, 15
10: 14, 6
11: 16, 3, 2
12: 8, 17
13: 4, 7, 8, 18
14: 16, 8, 15, 10
15: 18, 14, 6, 9
16: 11, 18, 14
17: 19, 12
18: 16, 13, 19, 15
19: 18, 2, 17
```

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Looking at each node, we determine the number of 3-stars centered at that node based on its neighbors:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = 1
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = 1
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = 0
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = 1
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = 0
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = 1
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = 0
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = 1

Summing up the 3-stars from each node:
 \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 = 33 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].

Unique 3-Stars:
<2, 11, 19>, <3, 9, 15>, <4, 8, 13>, <13, 18, 19>, <14, 8, 15>, <16, 11, 3>
