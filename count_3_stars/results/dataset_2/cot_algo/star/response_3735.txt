Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in a more organized way for easier visualization:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 8), (7, 0), (8, 0)
- 1: (5, 1), (4, 1), (2, 1)
- 2: (9, 2), (6, 2), (4, 2), (8, 2), (2, 1)
- 3: (5, 3), (4, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3)
- 4: (6, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (2, 4)
- 5: (9, 5), (8, 5), (1, 5), (0, 5), (3, 5)
- 6: (6, 2), (4, 6)
- 7: (9, 7), (0, 7), (3, 7)
- 8: (5, 8), (9, 8), (2, 8), (8, 0), (8, 3)
- 9: (5, 9), (9, 8), (7, 9), (2, 9)

Next, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
In this case, nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 34 3-stars found in the graph, so the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>.
