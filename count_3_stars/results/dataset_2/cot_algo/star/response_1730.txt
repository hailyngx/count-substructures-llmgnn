Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create an adjacency list based on the given edges:

Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 2}
Node 1: {9, 3, 6, 8, 7}
Node 2: {5, 4, 8, 7, 0}
Node 3: {1, 0, 4}
Node 4: {5, 3, 8, 2, 0}
Node 5: {9, 2, 4}
Node 6: {1, 8, 7, 0}
Node 7: {1, 8, 6, 2}
Node 8: {1, 4, 2, 7, 6}
Node 9: {5, 1}

Now, let's identify the unique 3-star configurations:

Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (9, 6, 8)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (5, 3, 2)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 8, 7)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 7)>

Since each of these nodes forms exactly 1 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
