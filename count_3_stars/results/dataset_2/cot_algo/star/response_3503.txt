Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 14) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 12) (20, 5) (20, 3) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 4) (28, 29) (28, 27) (28, 23) (29, 28) (29, 21) (6, 21) (6, 1) (0, 7) (0, 24) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 23) (3, 20) (3, 11) (3, 26) (3, 22) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 15) (7, 0) (7, 22) (7, 13) (21, 29) (21, 6) (21, 16) (21, 23) (21, 22) (18, 17) (26, 3) (26, 2) (26, 8) (27, 25) (27, 28) (27, 17) (27, 1) (16, 25) (16, 21) (16, 8) (1, 6) (1, 27) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 19) (4, 25) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (8, 11) (8, 26) (8, 16) (2, 26) (2, 13) (2, 24) (2, 17) (15, 11) (15, 24) (19, 1) (24, 0) (24, 2) (24, 15) (10, 1) (10, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 2) (17, 18) (17, 27) (17, 2) (17, 23) (17, 22) (23, 28) (23, 14) (23, 21) (23, 17) (22, 3) (22, 7) (22, 21) (22, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {7, 13, 24}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 10, 19, 27}
- Node 2: {13, 17, 24, 26}
- Node 3: {11, 20, 22, 26}
- Node 4: {1, 10, 12, 25}
- Node 5: {9, 14, 20}
- Node 6: {1, 21}
- Node 7: {0, 13, 22}
- Node 8: {11, 16, 26}
- Node 9: {5, 12}
- Node 10: {1, 4}
- Node 11: {3, 8, 15}
- Node 12: {4, 9}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 14: {5, 23}
- Node 15: {11, 24}
- Node 16: {8, 21, 25}
- Node 17: {2, 18, 22, 23, 27}
- Node 18: {17}
- Node 19: {1}
- Node 20: {3, 5}
- Node 21: {6, 16, 22, 23, 29}
- Node 22: {3, 7, 17, 21}
- Node 23: {14, 17, 21, 28}
- Node 24: {0, 2, 15}
- Node 25: {4, 16, 27}
- Node 26: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 27: {1, 17, 25, 28}
- Node 28: {23, 27, 29}
- Node 29: {21, 28}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 10, 27}.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {11, 22, 26}.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {10, 12, 25}.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 14, 20}.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {13, 22, 27}.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {16, 26, 27}.
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with neighbors {15, 24, 26}.
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors {21, 25, 27}.
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with neighbors {22, 23, 27}.
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with neighbors {22, 23, 29}.
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with neighbors {17, 21, 23}.
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with neighbors {17, 21, 28}.
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with neighbors {15, 2, 0}.
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with neighbors {8, 11, 3}.
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 17, 25}.
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with neighbors {23, 29, 27}.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 15, so the final answer is [15].
