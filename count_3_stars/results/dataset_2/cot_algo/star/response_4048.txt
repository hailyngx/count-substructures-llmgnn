Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 2) (18, 23) (22, 26) (22, 14) (3, 25) (3, 9) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 15) (25, 0) (25, 4) (0, 25) (0, 24) (0, 29) (20, 17) (20, 15) (20, 14) (7, 25) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 5) (12, 10) (12, 9) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 17) (8, 6) (26, 22) (26, 5) (26, 29) (26, 11) (26, 16) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 21) (28, 17) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 19) (17, 20) (17, 2) (17, 28) (17, 1) (17, 21) (4, 25) (4, 27) (27, 4) (27, 24) (27, 9) (21, 6) (21, 17) (5, 7) (5, 26) (5, 10) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 26) (16, 19) (11, 26) (11, 1) (14, 22) (14, 20) (14, 10) (23, 18) (23, 13) (23, 19) (15, 25) (15, 20) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 23) (19, 29) (19, 10) (29, 0) (29, 26) (29, 19) (29, 24) (24, 0) (24, 27) (24, 29) (24, 9) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 19) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 27) (9, 24) (13, 23) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {25, 24, 29}
- Node 1: {17, 11, 19}
- Node 2: {18, 16, 17}
- Node 3: {25, 9}
- Node 4: {25, 27}
- Node 5: {7, 26, 10}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 21}
- Node 7: {25, 16, 6}
- Node 8: {6}
- Node 9: {3, 27, 24, 12}
- Node 10: {12, 5, 14, 19}
- Node 11: {26, 1}
- Node 12: {10, 9}
- Node 13: {23}
- Node 14: {22, 20, 10}
- Node 15: {25, 20}
- Node 16: {2, 26, 19, 7}
- Node 17: {20, 2, 28, 1, 21}
- Node 18: {2, 23}
- Node 19: {1, 16, 23, 29, 10}
- Node 20: {17, 15, 14}
- Node 21: {6, 17}
- Node 22: {26, 14}
- Node 23: {18, 13, 19}
- Node 24: {0, 27, 29, 9}
- Node 25: {3, 7, 15, 0, 4}
- Node 26: {22, 5, 29, 11, 16}
- Node 27: {4, 24, 9}
- Node 28: {17}
- Node 29: {26, 19, 24, 0}

Based on the neighbor sets above, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 4, 9, 10, 19, and 29 have 3 or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total 3-stars: 
\( 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 24 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 24, 25>, <1, 11, 17>, <9, 10, 19>, <19, 24, 29>
