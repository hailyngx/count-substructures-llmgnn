Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {9, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {9, 6, 8, 0, 7}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 0, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 4}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 7: {8, 2, 0, 3}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 3, 1, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-star patterns:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Since each node forms 1 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
