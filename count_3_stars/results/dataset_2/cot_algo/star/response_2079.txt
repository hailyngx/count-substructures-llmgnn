Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edge list:

Node 0 neighbors: 4, 2, 8
Node 1 neighbors: 9, 4, 3, 6, 8
Node 2 neighbors: 5, 7, 6, 0
Node 3 neighbors: 4, 1, 8
Node 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 7, 0, 3, 1
Node 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 7
Node 6 neighbors: 9, 1, 2, 8
Node 7 neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 2
Node 8 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 0
Node 9 neighbors: 6, 4, 1, 7

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors
Node 2 has 4 neighbors
Node 4 has 6 neighbors
Node 5 has 3 neighbors
Node 7 has 4 neighbors
Node 9 has 4 neighbors

For each of the nodes above, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 5: No 3-star formed
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 42

So, the final answer is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (9, 4, 3)>
<1, (9, 4, 6)>
<1, (9, 3, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 2)>
<1, (4, 9, 6)>
<1, (4, 9, 7)>
<1, (6, 2, 9)>
<1, (6, 2, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 4)>
<1, (2, 7, 5)>
<1, (2, 7, 4)>
<4, (9, 1, 3)>
<4, (9, 1, 6)>
<4, (9, 1, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 2)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>

<9, (6, 9, 1)>
<9, (6, 9, 2)>
<9, (6, 9, 8)>
<9, (6, 1, 9)>
<9, (6, 1, 2)>
<9, (6, 2, 8)>
