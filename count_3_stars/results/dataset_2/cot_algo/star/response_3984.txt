Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Now, let's check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if they form any 3-stars:

- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 1,8)>, <2, (1, 9, 3)>, <2, (0, 9, 8)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 2)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars: <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars: <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 6)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars: <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars: <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 41.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [41].
