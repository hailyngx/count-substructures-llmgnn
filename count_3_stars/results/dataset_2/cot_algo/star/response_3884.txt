Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 1) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 13) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 14) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 1) 

Response:
The central nodes will be the nodes with at least three neighbors, and the neighbors of each of those central nodes will form the leaves of a 3-star. 

In this graph, the central nodes are: 5, 4, 7, 2, 8, 13, 12, and 0.

For node 5:
Neighbors: 9, 13, 2, 8, 14
Number of neighbors: 5

For node 4:
Neighbors: 7, 12, 13, 1, 11
Number of neighbors: 5

For node 7:
Neighbors: 4, 6, 14, 13
Number of neighbors: 4

For node 2:
Neighbors: 5, 8, 6, 3, 14, 11
Number of neighbors: 6

For node 8:
Neighbors: 5, 2, 10, 0, 1
Number of neighbors: 5

For node 13:
Neighbors: 5, 4, 7, 12
Number of neighbors: 4

For node 12:
Neighbors: 4, 3, 11, 13
Number of neighbors: 4

For node 0:
Neighbors: 9, 8, 11, 10
Number of neighbors: 4

Since all these nodes have at least 3 neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars each can form:
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up gives a total of 54 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, 9, 13, 2>, <5, 9, 13, 8>, <5, 9, 13, 14>, <5, 9, 2, 8>, <5, 9, 2, 14>, <5, 9, 8, 14>, <5, 13, 2, 8>, <5, 13, 2, 14>, <5, 13, 8, 14>, <5, 2, 8, 14>, <4, 7, 12, 13>, <4, 7, 12, 1>, <4, 7, 12, 11>, <4, 7, 13, 1>, <4, 7, 13, 11>, <4, 7, 1, 11>, (7, 6, 14), <2, 5, 8, 14>, <2, 5, 10, 0>, <2, 5, 10, 1>, <2, 5, 10, 14>, <2, 8, 10, 0>, <2, 8, 10, 1>, <2, 8, 10, 14>.
