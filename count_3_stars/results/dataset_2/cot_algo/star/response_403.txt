Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 14) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 9) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (9, 11) (9, 13) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are connected to each node. Then we will determine if any of the nodes have exactly 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. Here are the calculations:

Node 0: Neighbors {4, 10, 8, 2, 14} (5 neighbors, no 3-star)
Node 1: Neighbors {11, 13} (2 neighbors, no 3-star)
Node 2: Neighbors {11, 5, 0, 1} (4 neighbors, one 3-star: <2, (11, 1, 5)>)
Node 3: Neighbors {7, 8, 12, 5, 14} (5 neighbors, no 3-star)
Node 4: Neighbors {7, 10, 8, 6, 0} (5 neighbors, no 3-star)
Node 5: Neighbors {12, 2, 6, 13, 3} (5 neighbors, no 3-star)
Node 6: Neighbors {4, 8, 5, 14} (4 neighbors, one 3-star: <6, (4, 8, 14)>)
Node 7: Neighbors {4, 12, 3, 14} (4 neighbors, one 3-star: <7, (4, 12, 14)>)
Node 8: Neighbors {4, 10, 0, 6, 3} (5 neighbors, no 3-star)
Node 9: Neighbors {13, 11} (2 neighbors, no 3-star)
Node 10: Neighbors {4, 0, 8} (3 neighbors, one 3-star: <10, (4, 8, 0)>)
Node 11: Neighbors {1, 9, 2} (3 neighbors, one 3-star: <11, (1, 9, 2)>)
Node 12: Neighbors {7, 5, 14, 3} (4 neighbors, one 3-star: <12, (7, 14, 5)>)
Node 13: Neighbors {5, 1, 9} (3 neighbors, one 3-star: <13, (5, 1, 9)>)
Node 14: Neighbors {7, 12, 6, 0, 3} (5 neighbors, no 3-star)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 10) + 1 (from node 11) + 1 (from node 12) + 1 (from node 13) = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
