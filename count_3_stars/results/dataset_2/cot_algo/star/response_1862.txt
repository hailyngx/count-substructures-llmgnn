Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
We will first find the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {1, 3, 6, 12}
Node 1 neighbors: {0, 2, 5, 6}
Node 2 neighbors: {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 3 neighbors: {0, 5, 14}
Node 4 neighbors: {7, 9, 11, 14}
Node 5 neighbors: {1, 3, 6, 7, 14}
Node 6 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 5, 9}
Node 7 neighbors: {2, 4, 5, 9}
Node 8 neighbors: {2, 12, 13}
Node 9 neighbors: {2, 4, 6, 7}
Node 10 neighbors: {11, 13}
Node 11 neighbors: {4, 10, 12, 13}
Node 12 neighbors: {0, 8, 11, 14}
Node 13 neighbors: {8, 10, 11, 14}
Node 14 neighbors: {3, 4, 5, 12, 13}

Now we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14

For each of these nodes, we can form a 3-star, except for node 0 which has 4 neighbors. So, the number of 3-stars is: \( \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<3, (0, 5, 14)>
<4, (7, 9, 14)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<12, (0, 8, 13)>
<13, (8, 10, 11)>
<14, (3, 12, 13)>
