Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 2) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 12) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 14) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 14) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {9, 8, 13, 12}
Node 1: {5, 3, 6, 14, 13, 4}
Node 2: {11, 7, 10}
Node 3: {9, 1, 11, 7, 8}
Node 4: {1, 11, 12}
Node 5: {9, 8, 1, 10}
Node 6: {1, 11, 12}
Node 7: {3, 11, 2}
Node 8: {5, 3, 0}
Node 9: {5, 11, 10, 3, 0}
Node 10: {5, 9, 2, 14}
Node 11: {9, 3, 6, 7, 4, 2}
Node 12: {6, 0, 4, 14}
Node 13: {1, 14, 0}
Node 14: {1, 13, 12, 10}

Next, we'll identify which nodes can form a 3-star:

Node 1: has 6 neighbors, can form 20 3-stars
Node 3: has 5 neighbors, can form 10 3-stars
Node 4: has 2 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
Node 5: has 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars
Node 6: has 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
Node 8: has 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
Node 9: has 5 neighbors, can form 10 3-stars
Node 10: has 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars
Node 11: has 6 neighbors, can form 20 3-stars
Node 12: has 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars
Node 14: has 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 74

Therefore, the final total number of 3-stars is [74].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 3, 6)>
<5, (9, 1, 10)>
<6, (1, 11, 12)>
<9, (5, 11, 10)>
<10, (9, 2, 14)>
<11, (9, 3, 7)>
<12, (6, 0, 14)>
<14, (1, 13, 12)>
