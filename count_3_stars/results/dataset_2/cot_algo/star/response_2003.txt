The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 0) (26, 9) (26, 2) (26, 8) (6, 24) (6, 17) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 28) (7, 8) (10, 21) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 20) (11, 4) (11, 13) (20, 10) (20, 1) (20, 12) (25, 27) (25, 2) (12, 4) (12, 20) (12, 27) (12, 28) (27, 25) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 3) (27, 23) (0, 9) (0, 10) (14, 4) (14, 24) (14, 21) (22, 9) (22, 28) (5, 13) (5, 19) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 2) (19, 10) (19, 5) (19, 28) (19, 1) (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 23) (15, 1) (21, 10) (21, 14) (21, 13) (21, 16) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 14) (24, 2) (24, 23) (16, 21) (29, 1) (29, 8) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 2) (3, 27) (3, 17) (2, 26) (2, 25) (2, 13) (2, 24) (2, 17) (23, 27) (23, 1) (23, 24) (8, 26) (8, 7) (8, 29) (28, 7) (28, 12) (28, 22) (28, 19) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 10}
- Node 1: Neighbors {15, 19, 20, 23, 29}
- Node 2: Neighbors {13, 17, 24, 25, 26}
- Node 3: Neighbors {17, 27}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {13, 19}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 17, 24}
- Node 7: Neighbors {8, 28}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7, 26, 29}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 22, 26}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 19, 20, 21}
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {4, 20, 27, 28}
- Node 13: Neighbors {2, 5, 11, 21}
- Node 14: Neighbors {4, 21, 24}
- Node 15: Neighbors {1}
- Node 16: Neighbors {21}
- Node 17: Neighbors {2, 3, 6}
- Node 19: Neighbors {1, 5, 10, 28}
- Node 20: Neighbors {1, 10, 12}
- Node 21: Neighbors {10, 13, 14, 16}
- Node 22: Neighbors {9, 28}
- Node 23: Neighbors {1, 24, 27}
- Node 24: Neighbors {6, 14, 23, 2}
- Node 25: Neighbors {2, 27}
- Node 26: Neighbors {2, 8, 9}
- Node 27: Neighbors {12, 2, 23, 25, 3}
- Node 28: Neighbors {7, 19, 22, 12}
- Node 29: Neighbors {1, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
For each node with 3 or more neighbors, the number of 3-stars formed is given by \( \binom{n}{3} \), where n is the number of neighbors of the node.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

The total number of 3-stars is the sum of the 3-stars formed by each node:
\[ 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:

- <4, (6, 11, 14)>
- <6, (4, 17, 24)>
- <8, (7, 26, 29)>
- <9, (0, 22, 26)>
- <10, (0, 19, 21)>
