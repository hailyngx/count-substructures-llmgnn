Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 21) (16, 25) (16, 5) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 1) (20, 8) (25, 16) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 19) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 6) (8, 11) (8, 20) (4, 13) (4, 24) (4, 1) (28, 11) (28, 9) (28, 13) (29, 5) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 21) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 27) (12, 2) (27, 12) (27, 1) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 1) (0, 18) (2, 22) (2, 12) (2, 6) (19, 25) (19, 22) (19, 15) (21, 16) (21, 17) (21, 13) (21, 15) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 3) (15, 19) (15, 21) (15, 26) (13, 4) (13, 28) (13, 21) (13, 3) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 10) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 24) (14, 10) (26, 20) (26, 15) (26, 6) (6, 23) (6, 2) (6, 26) (1, 20) (1, 22) (1, 4) (1, 27) (1, 18) (10, 3) (10, 14) (24, 4) (24, 14) (24, 5) (5, 16) (5, 25) (5, 29) (5, 24) 

Response:
Let's first find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {18}
- Node 1: {4, 18, 20, 22, 27}
- Node 2: {6, 12, 22}
- Node 3: {9, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 13, 14, 24}
- Node 5: {16, 24, 25, 29}
- Node 6: {2, 6, 23, 26}
- Node 8: {11, 20}
- Node 9: {3, 9, 14, 28}
- Node 10: {3, 14}
- Node 11: {8, 12, 28}
- Node 12: {2, 11, 17, 27}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 13, 21, 28}
- Node 14: {3, 9, 10, 24}
- Node 15: {19, 21, 26}
- Node 16: {5, 20, 21, 25}
- Node 17: {12, 18, 21}
- Node 18: {0, 1, 17}
- Node 19: {15, 22, 25}
- Node 20: {1, 8, 16, 25, 26}
- Node 21: {13, 15, 16, 17}
- Node 22: {1, 2, 19, 23}
- Node 23: {6, 22}
- Node 24: {4, 5, 14}
- Node 25: {5, 16, 19, 20}
- Node 26: {6, 15, 20}
- Node 27: {1, 12}
- Node 28: {9, 11, 13}
- Node 29: {5}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 13: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 15: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 17: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 18: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 21: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 24: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 25: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 26: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 27: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 28: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 29: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors) 

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 19

Therefore, the final answer is [19], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (4, 18, 27)>
- <1, (4, 18, 22)>
- <1, (18, 27, 22)>
- <1, (4, 22, 27)>
- <22, (1, 19, 25)>
