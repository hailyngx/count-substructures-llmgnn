Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 18) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 12) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 18) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 12) (15, 6) (15, 17) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 17) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 14) (14, 11) (14, 16) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 17) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 19) (5, 8) (5, 4) (17, 15) (17, 0) (17, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 11, 17}
- Node 1: {2, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 13, 16, 19}
- Node 3: {4, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 9, 13, 15}
- Node 7: {2, 18}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 18}
- Node 10: {11, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 10, 12, 14, 19}
- Node 12: {10, 11, 18}
- Node 13: {2, 6, 8, 16}
- Node 14: {11, 16}
- Node 15: {6, 17}
- Node 16: {2, 13, 14}
- Node 17: {0, 15, 19}
- Node 18: {7, 9, 12}
- Node 19: {2, 11, 17}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 17, 18, 19}

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 27  
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 11, 17>, <2, 13, 16>, <2, 13, 19>, <2, 16, 14>, <2, 16, 19>, <2, 19, 17>, <4, 0, 5>, <6, 1, 9>, <6, 1, 13>, <6, 9, 8>, <6, 13, 8>, <8, 3, 5>, <11, 0, 4>, <11, 12, 10>, <11, 12, 18>, <11, 14, 16>, <11, 14, 19>, <11, 19, 17>, <13, 2, 16>, <15, 6, 17>, <16, 14, 11>, <16, 14, 19>, <16, 2, 13>, <17, 0, 15>, <17, 0, 19>, <17, 19, 11>, <18, 7, 2>, <19, 2, 11>
