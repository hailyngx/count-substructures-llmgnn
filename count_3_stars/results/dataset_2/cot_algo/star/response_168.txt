Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 7) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 13) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 18) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 15) (8, 5) (8, 2) (4, 13) (4, 1) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 7) (1, 17) (1, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 19) (0, 16) (0, 3) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 13) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 19) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 15) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 16) 

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 16, 3
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 17, 4, 13 (forming 1 3-star)
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 8, 19, 14, 15
4. Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 0, 10
5. Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 1, 13
6. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 6, 8, 18, 16
7. Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 5, 18
8. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 10, 18, 19 (forming 1 3-star)
9. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 2
10. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 11, 14, 13 (forming 1 3-star)
11. Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 17, 3, 7 (forming 1 3-star)
12. Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 19, 9, 13 (forming 1 3-star)
13. Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 17, 16, 19 (forming 1 3-star)
14. Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 11, 4, 9, 16
15. Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 2, 9, 15 (forming 1 3-star)
16. Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 2, 19, 14 (forming 1 3-star)
17. Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 5, 12, 0, 13
18. Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 10, 1, 12 (forming 1 3-star)
19. Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 7 (forming 1 3-star)
20. Node 19 has 5 neighbors: 11, 2, 12, 15, 7

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 7

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, 17, 4>, <7, 10, 18>, <9, 11, 13>, <10, 17, 7>, <11, 19, 12>, <14, 15, 2>, <18, 5, 6>  

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
