Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 22) (14, 17) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 23) (17, 22) (17, 11) (7, 21) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 1) (21, 15) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 10) (21, 29) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 24) (8, 16) (8, 26) (1, 7) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 24) (26, 8) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 18) (0, 4) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 18) (20, 7) (20, 0) (20, 11) (5, 19) (6, 7) (6, 1) (24, 8) (24, 1) (24, 26) (19, 5) (19, 29) (19, 12) (3, 21) (3, 23) (3, 12) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 0) (10, 21) (10, 13) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 25) (16, 2) (22, 27) (22, 17) (28, 8) (28, 13) (28, 25) (28, 2) (11, 17) (11, 20) (23, 17) (23, 3) (29, 27) (29, 21) (29, 19) (29, 12) (2, 16) (2, 28) (13, 10) (13, 28) (13, 25) (25, 0) (25, 16) (25, 28) (25, 13) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 29) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edge connections:

- Node 0: 4, 20, 18
- Node 1: 7, 6, 24, 26
- Node 2: 16, 28
- Node 3: 21, 23, 12
- Node 4: 8, 0, 16
- Node 5: 19
- Node 6: 7, 1
- Node 7: 21, 20, 6, 1
- Node 8: 4, 16, 24, 26, 28
- Node 10: 21, 13
- Node 11: 17, 20
- Node 12: 19, 3, 29
- Node 13: 10, 28, 25
- Node 14: 17, 18
- Node 15: 27, 21
- Node 16: 4, 8, 25, 2
- Node 17: 14, 23, 22, 11
- Node 18: 14, 26, 0
- Node 19: 5, 29, 12
- Node 20: 7, 0, 11
- Node 21: 15, 7, 3, 10, 29
- Node 22: 27, 17
- Node 23: 17, 3
- Node 24: 8, 1, 26
- Node 25: 0, 16, 28, 13
- Node 26: 8, 1, 18, 24
- Node 27: 15, 29, 22
- Node 28: 8, 2, 25, 13
- Node 29: 27, 21, 19, 12

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of those nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 56
Therefore, the final answer is [56].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
