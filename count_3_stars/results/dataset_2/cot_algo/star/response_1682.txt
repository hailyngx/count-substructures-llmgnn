Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 13) (11, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 8) (10, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 10) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {5, 6, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 7, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 1, 10}
- Node 3: {11}
- Node 4: {9, 6, 0, 14}
- Node 5: {13, 1, 0, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 4, 2, 0, 8}
- Node 7: {12, 11, 10, 13, 1}
- Node 8: {6, 1, 0, 10}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 11, 1}
- Node 10: {5, 7, 13, 2, 8}
- Node 11: {9, 7, 12, 13, 3}
- Node 12: {7, 13, 11}
- Node 13: {5, 7, 12, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {5, 4, 13}

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {13, 1, 0} <5, (13, 1, 0)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {12, 11, 13} <7, (12, 11, 13)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 7, 12} <13, (5, 7, 12)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 7, 2} <1, (9, 7, 2)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 6, 14} <4, (9, 6, 14)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 4, 2} <6, (9, 4, 2)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 4, 8} <0, (6, 4, 8)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 13, 8} <10, (7, 13, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
