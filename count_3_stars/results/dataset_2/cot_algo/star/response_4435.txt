Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (14, 18) (14, 4) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 15) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 19) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 19) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 12) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 3) (16, 10) (16, 13) (16, 7) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 3) (3, 19) (3, 7) (3, 18) (3, 4) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (12, 19) (12, 15) (12, 18) 

Response:
The node degrees for this graph are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 5
- Node 19: degree 4

We will now identify the 3-stars in this graph.

For Node 3, as it has a degree of 4, we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
The 3-stars involving Node 3 are:
1. <3, 7, 18>
2. <3, 4, 18>
3. <3, 7, 19>
4. <3, 4, 19>

For Node 4, with a degree of 4, we can form 4 3-stars. 
The 3-stars involving Node 4 are:
1. <4, 2, 14>
2. <4, 1, 5>
3. <4, 3, 18>
4. <4, 1, 5>

For Node 5, with a degree of 4, we can form 4 3-stars. 
The 3-stars involving Node 5 are:
1. <5, 1, 4>
2. <5, 9, 11>
3. <5, 6, 1>
4. <5, 6, 7>

For Node 8, with a degree of 4, we can form 4 3-stars. 
The 3-stars involving Node 8 are:
1. <8, 13, 19>
2. <8, 11, 15>
3. <8, 13, 16>
4. <8, 19, 3>

For Node 18, as it has a degree of 5, we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
The 3-stars involving Node 18 are:
1. <18, 3, 15>
2. <18, 9, 14>
3. <18, 3, 4>
4. <18, 9, 15>
5. <18, 12, 15>
6. <18, 3, 7>
7. <18, 12, 15>
8. <18, 9, 15>
9. <18, 12, 15>
10. <18, 9, 18>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 4 (from Node 3) + 4 (from Node 4) + 4 (from Node 5) + 4 (from Node 8) + 10 (from Node 18) = 26. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].
