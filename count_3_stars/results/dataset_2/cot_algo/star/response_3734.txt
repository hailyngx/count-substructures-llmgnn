2. Node 8: <8, (1, 13, 17)>; <8, (11, 13, 17)>
3. Node 12: <12, (3, 22, 29)>
4. Node 14: <14, (2, 11, 19)>; <14, (2, 19, 24)>
5. Node 16: <16, (10, 20, 25)>
6. Node 18: <18, (3, 19, 23)>
7. Node 21: <21, (0, 9, 28)>
8. Node 22: <22, (6, 12, 27)>
9. Node 23: <23, (7, 27, 28)>
10. Node 26: <26, (5, 20, 26)>
