Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 7, 8, 1}
- Node 1: {6, 0}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 8, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {7, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 7: {5, 4, 0, 6, 8, 2}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 2, 0, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <0, (9, 7, 8)>, <0, (9, 7, 1)>, <0, (9, 8, 1)>, <0, (7, 8, 1)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <2, (5, 7, 6)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (7, 6, 8)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <3, (5, 4, 6)>, <3, (5, 4, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <4, (9, 7, 8)>, <4, (9, 7, 3)>, <4, (9, 8, 3)>, <4, (7, 8, 3)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <5, (9, 2, 7)>, <5, (9, 2, 3)>, <5, (9, 7, 3)>, <5, (2, 7, 3)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  <7, (5, 4, 0)>, <7, (5, 6, 2)>, <7, (5, 8, 2)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 0, 6)>, <7, (4, 0, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 0)>, 
  <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 2)>, <7, (0, 6, 2)>, <7, (0, 8, 2)>, <7, (6, 2, 8)>, <7, (6, 3, 2)>, <7, (6, 8, 2)>, 
  <7, (3, 8, 2)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (8, 0, 2)>, <7, (8, 3, 2)>, <7, (8, 6, 2)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <8, (4, 7, 2)>, <8, (4, 0, 3)>, <8, (4, 0, 8)>, <8, (4, 3, 8)>, <8, (7, 0, 2)>, <8, (7, 6, 2)>, <8, (7, 0, 6)>, 
  <8, (7, 3, 2)>, <8, (0, 3, 1)>, <8, (0, 6, 1)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 50
Thus, the final result is [50].
