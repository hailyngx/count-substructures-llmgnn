Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 0) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) (19, 7) (19, 12) (15, 6) (16, 13) (16, 17) (12, 4) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 18) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 17) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 8) (7, 19) (17, 16) (17, 2) (14, 2) (14, 18) (18, 12) (18, 6) (18, 14) 

Response:
First, we'll find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 10, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 2: {3, 12, 13, 14, 17}
- Node 3: {2, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 12, 15, 18}
- Node 7: {8, 19}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 9: {4, 5}
- Node 10: {0, 8}
- Node 11: {0, 1}
- Node 12: {2, 4, 6, 18, 19}
- Node 13: {2, 8, 16}
- Node 14: {2, 18}
- Node 15: {6}
- Node 16: {13, 17}
- Node 17: {2, 16}
- Node 18: {6, 12, 14}
- Node 19: {7, 12}

Now, we'll find the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 61. 

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is given as [61].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 11>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 10, 8>, <0, 11, 1>,  
<1, 0, 5>, <1, 0, 11>, <1, 4, 0>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 0>, <2, 3, 17>, <2, 12, 13>, <2, 12, 14>, <2, 13, 16>, <2, 17, 16>,  
<4, 0, 6>, <4, 0, 8>, <4, 0, 12>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 6, 12>, <4, 8, 0>, <4, 8, 1>, <4, 8, 7>, <4, 8, 13>, <4, 8, 12>,  
<6, 0, 4>, <6, 1, 4>, <6, 12, 4>, <6, 12, 18>, <6, 15, 18>, <6, 18, 12>, <8, 1, 4>, <8, 4, 0>, <8, 4, 7>, <8, 4, 13>,  
<12, 2, 18>, <12, 4, 6>, <12, 4, 18>, <12, 6, 4>, <12, 6, 18>, <12, 18, 6>, <18, 2, 12>, <18, 6, 12>, <18, 14, 2>.
