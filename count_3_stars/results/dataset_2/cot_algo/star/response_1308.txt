Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 4) (16, 15) (5, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 16) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 18) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 18) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 16) (15, 10) (15, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (19, 1) (19, 10) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 13) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 15) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {12, 17, 18, 19}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 14}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 16}
- Node 5: {13}
- Node 6: {7, 9, 12}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 11}
- Node 8: {3, 9, 11}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 10: {1, 15, 19}
- Node 11: {7, 8, 17}
- Node 12: {1, 6, 15, 14}
- Node 13: {5, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 13, 17, 18, 1, 12}
- Node 15: {4, 10, 12, 16}
- Node 16: {4, 15}
- Node 17: {11, 14, 1}
- Node 18: {14, 13, 1}
- Node 19: {10, 1}

Based on the neighbor set, we can see that nodes 1, 12, 14, and 18 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed around these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is [29], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (12, 14, 17), (12, 14, 1), (12, 14, 18), (12, 14, 19), (14, 13, 17), (14, 13, 1), (14, 13, 18), (14, 17, 1), (1, 12, 15), (1, 12, 6), (12, 6, 7), (12, 6, 9), (1, 17, 11), (1, 17, 14), (17, 14, 13), (18, 13, 1), (18, 14, 1), (18, 14, 13), (14, 17, 1), (14, 17, 18), (14, 17, 13), (1, 14, 17), (1, 14, 18), (1, 14, 13), (1, 18, 13), (17, 18, 13), (12, 14, 17), (12, 14, 18), (12, 14, 19).
