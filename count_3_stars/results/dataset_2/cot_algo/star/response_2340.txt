Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 6, 7}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 different 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 different 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 different 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 different 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 different 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 64

Therefore, the final result is [64], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (0, 3, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 7)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
