Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (11, 9) (11, 5) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 10) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 1 with neighbors {2, 3, 5, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 3 with neighbors {0, 1, 9, 12}
- Node 8 with neighbors {2, 4, 7, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 12 with neighbors {1, 3, 7, 14}
- Node 0 with neighbors {3, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 14 with neighbors {0, 1, 8, 12}
- Node 2 with neighbors {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 9 with neighbors {2, 3, 4, 8, 11}
- Node 10 with neighbors {0, 1, 6, 13}
- Node 5 with neighbors {1, 4, 11}
- Node 6 with neighbors {0, 2, 4, 10}

For the nodes with three neighbors (1, 3, 8, 12, 0, 14, 2, 9, 10, 5, 6), we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each using the formula \(inom{n}{3}\). 

For all these nodes, the total number of unique 3-stars formed is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (2, 5, 14)>
<3, (0, 9, 12)>
<8, (2, 7, 13)>
<12, (1, 7, 14)>
<0, (3, 6, 14)>
<14, (1, 8, 12)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<10, (0, 6, 13)>
<5, (1, 4, 11)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
