Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 3) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 4) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 10
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 9, 13
- Node 2: 1, 4, 7
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 6, 10
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 13, 12, 14
- Node 5: 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 3, 11, 12
- Node 7: 2, 5, 13, 14
- Node 8: 5, 12, 13
- Node 9: 1, 10, 11, 12
- Node 10: 0, 3, 9, 14
- Node 11: 6, 9
- Node 12: 4, 6, 8, 9, 13
- Node 13: 1, 4, 7, 8, 12, 14
- Node 14: 4, 7, 10, 13

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: \( 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 70 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [70].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 13)>, <1, (0, 9, 13)>, <1, (2, 4, 13)>, <1, (4, 12, 13)>, <3, (0, 4, 10)>, <3, (0, 4, 12)>, <3, (0, 4, 14)>, <3, (4, 12, 13)>, <4, (1, 12, 13)>, <4, (2, 12, 13)>, <4, (3, 12, 13)>, <4, (9, 12, 13)>, <4, (12, 13, 14)>, <12, (6, 9, 13)>, <12, (8, 9, 13)>, <12, (9, 13, 14)>, <12, (9, 12, 13)>, <12, (9, 12, 14)>, <13, (7, 12, 14)>, <13, (8, 12, 14)>, <13, (12, 14, 14)>, <13, (12, 7, 14)>, <13, (12, 8, 14)>, <13, (12, 14, 7)>
