Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 4, 12, 11, 3, 13
- Node 1: 4, 7, 12, 14
- Node 2: 6, 9, 12, 5, 3
- Node 3: 4, 2, 12, 0, 5
- Node 4: 7, 0, 10, 1, 3
- Node 5: 2, 14, 3
- Node 6: 7, 2, 11, 8
- Node 7: 4, 6, 1
- Node 8: 6, 13, 10
- Node 9: 2, 13
- Node 10: 4, 8, 13
- Node 11: 6, 14, 0
- Node 12: 13, 2, 0, 3, 1
- Node 13: 9, 8, 12, 10, 14, 0
- Node 14: 13, 11, 1, 5

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 13, 14

So, we can form 3-stars with the following nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 72

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [72].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, (4, 12, 3)>
- <0, (4, 11, 13)>
- <0, (4, 3, 13)>
- <0, (12, 11, 13)>
- <1, (4, 12, 14)>
- <2, (6, 9, 12)>
- <2, (6, 12, 5)>
- <2, (9, 12, 13)>
- <2, (12, 5, 14)>
- <3, (4, 2, 12)>

- <6, (7, 1, 14)>
- <13, (9, 8, 10)>
- <13, (9, 8, 14)>
- <13, (9, 10, 14)>
- <13, (8, 10, 14)>
