- Node 27: {0, 21, 17, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 14}
- Node 29: {7, 11, 18}
- Node 1: {11, 13, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 28}
- Node 10: {17, 24, 16}
- Node 17: {27, 10, 4}
- Node 4: {17, 8, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 9, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {8, 6, 22, 28}
- Node 6: {5, 15}
- Node 15: {6, 20, 23, 12}
- Node 20: {15, 13, 19}
- Node 22: {0, 5, 26}
- Node 26: {22, 11}
- Node 16: {10, 28}
- Node 28: {3, 5, 16, 24}
- Node 9: {27, 1, 8, 14}
- Node 7: {29, 8, 11, 23}
- Node 19: {20, 21}
- Node 12: {15}
- Node 11: {29, 1, 26, 7}
- Node 14: {2, 9, 18}
- Node 24: {10, 28}
- Node 23: {15, 7, 21, 13}
- Node 21: {27, 19, 23}
- Node 18: {0, 29, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 20, 23}

Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 0, 27, 8, 5, 15, 13, 4, 9, 28, 11

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 8, 27>, <0, 8, 3>, <0, 8, 22>, <0, 8, 11>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 22>, <0, 15, 23>, <0, 15, 21>, <0, 15, 13>, <0, 4, 17>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 11, 26>, <27, 21, 23>, <27, 21, 19>, <27, 17, 4>, <27, 17, 10>, <27, 17, 24>, <27, 9, 1>, <27, 9, 14>, <27, 9, 8>, <27, 14, 18>, <27, 14, 4>, <27, 14, 29>, <8, 9, 1>, <8, 9, 14>, <8, 9, 27>, <8, 5, 6>, <8, 5, 22>, <8, 5, 28>, <8, 5, 15>, <8, 5, 23>, <8, 5, 21>, <8, 13, 20>, <8, 7, 23>, <8, 7, 11>, <8, 7, 29>, <8, 7, 27>, <8, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 15>, <5, 6, 20>, <5, 6, 12>, <5, 6, 23>, <5, 6, 21>, <5, 22, 26>, <5, 22, 0>, <5, 22, 28>, <13, 1, 11>, <13, 1, 4>, <13, 1, 9>, <13, 1, 23>, <13, 1, 29>, <13, 4, 17>, <13, 4, 20>, <13, 4, 8>, <13, 4, 23>, <13, 20, 15>, <13, 20, 19>, <13, 20, 21>, <4, 17, 10>, <4, 17, 27>, <4, 17, 24>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 8, 13>, <4, 8, 5>, <4, 8, 26>, <4, 8, 22>, <4, 8, 24>, <9, 1, 11>, <9, 1, 14>, <9, 1, 27>, <9, 1, 29>, <9, 27, 14>, <9, 27, 29>, <9, 14, 18>, <9, 8, 7>, <9, 8, 27>, <9, 8, 14>, <9, 28, 16>, <9, 11, 26>, <28, 3, 2>, <28, 3, 5>, <28, 3, 16>, <28, 3, 24>, <28, 5, 16>, <28, 5, 24>, <28, 16, 10>, <28, 16, 24>, <11, 29, 7>, <11, 29, 1>, <11, 29, 18>, <11, 29, 26>, <11, 1, 13>, <11, 1, 26>, <11, 1, 7>, <11, 26, 22>, <11, 26, 7>, <11, 7, 23>, <14, 2, 3>, <14, 2, 9>, <14, 2, 18>, <14, 2, 29>, <14, 9, 27>, <14, 9, 29>, <14, 18, 29>, <14, 18, 27>, <28, 24, 10>, <28, 24, 16>, <23, 15, 6>, <23, 15, 20>, <23, 15, 7>, <23, 15, 21>, <23, 6, 5>, <23, 6, 21>, <23, 7, 21>, <23, 7, 13>, <23, 21, 19>, <21, 27, 17>, <21, 27, 19>, <21, 27, 23>, <21, 19, 20>, <21, 19, 23>
