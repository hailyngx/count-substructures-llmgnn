Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 14) (15, 21) (27, 15) (14, 15) (14, 26) (14, 8) (17, 22) (17, 8) (17, 2) (20, 1) (20, 12) (20, 2) (20, 16) (25, 6) (25, 21) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 29) (11, 10) (11, 24) (12, 20) (12, 18) (12, 19) (28, 22) (28, 18) (28, 23) (29, 10) (29, 24) (4, 22) (4, 16) (4, 2) (18, 12) (18, 28) (18, 6) (18, 13) (13, 18) (13, 7) (26, 14) (26, 8) (5, 1) (5, 24) (5, 21) (2, 17) (2, 20) (2, 4) (2, 23) (22, 17) (22, 28) (22, 4) (22, 6) (0, 10) (0, 9) (24, 11) (24, 29) (24, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 23) (7, 9) (6, 25) (6, 18) (6, 22) (16, 20) (16, 4) (16, 8) (1, 20) (1, 5) (1, 8) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 26) (8, 16) (8, 1) (23, 28) (23, 2) (23, 7) (23, 21) (21, 15) (21, 25) (21, 5) (21, 23) (19, 12) (19, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 10, 9
Node 1: 20, 5, 8
Node 2: 17, 20, 4, 23
Node 3: 7, 9
Node 4: 18, 2, 16, 22
Node 5: 1, 24, 21
Node 6: 25, 18, 22
Node 7: 13, 3, 19, 9, 23
Node 8: 14, 17, 26, 16, 1
Node 9: 0, 3, 7
Node 10: 11, 0, 29
Node 11: 10, 24
Node 12: 20, 18, 19
Node 13: 18, 7
Node 14: 15, 26, 8
Node 15: 27, 14, 21
Node 16: 20, 4, 8
Node 17: 22, 8, 2
Node 18: 12, 28, 6, 13, 4
Node 19: 12, 7
Node 20: 1, 12, 2, 16
Node 21: 15, 25, 5, 23
Node 22: 17, 28, 4, 6
Node 23: 28, 2, 7, 21
Node 24: 11, 29, 5
Node 25: 6, 21
Node 26: 14, 8
Node 27: 15
Node 28: 22, 18, 23
Node 29: 10, 24

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 7: <7, (3, 19, 23)>
- Node 8: <8, (14, 16, 26)>
- Node 18: <18, (4, 12, 28)>, <18, (6, 13, 28)>
- Node 20: <20, (1, 16, 21)>
- Node 21: <21, (5, 15, 25)>
- Node 22: <22, (4, 6, 28)>

The total number of 3-stars is 7, so the answer is [7].
