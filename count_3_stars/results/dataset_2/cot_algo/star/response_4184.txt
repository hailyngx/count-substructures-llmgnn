Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 16) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 15) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 3) (19, 16) (1, 14) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 16) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 1) (8, 19) (8, 3) (18, 12) (18, 13) (2, 9) (2, 1) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 13) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 1) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 8) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: {4, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {2, 14, 15, 16}
- Node 2: {1, 9}
- Node 3: {8, 17, 19}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 11}
- Node 5: {19}
- Node 7: {4, 13, 15, 16}
- Node 8: {3, 19}
- Node 9: {2, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {9, 11, 17}
- Node 11: {4, 10, 17}
- Node 12: {0, 13, 18}
- Node 13: {7, 9, 12, 18}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 9, 15}
- Node 15: {1, 7, 14}
- Node 16: {1, 7, 17, 19}
- Node 17: {3, 10, 11, 16}
- Node 18: {12, 13}
- Node 19: {3, 5, 8, 16}

Next, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 12, 14>, <1, 14, 15>, <1, 14, 9>, <1, 15, 7>, <7, 13, 18>, <7, 14, 15>, <9, 13, 18>, <9, 14, 15>, <13, 12, 18>, <13, 9, 18>, <14, 0, 1>, <14, 9, 15>, <14, 9, 15>, <16, 1, 7>, <16, 17, 19>, <16, 7, 15>, <16, 7, 17>, <17, 11, 10>, <17, 16, 19>, <17, 16, 19>, <17, 16, 1>, <17, 16, 7>, <19, 16, 3>, <19, 16, 8>, <19, 3, 8>, <19, 5, 8>, <3, 8, 19>, <4, 0, 7>, <7, 4, 11>, <9, 2, 10>, <13, 7, 18>
