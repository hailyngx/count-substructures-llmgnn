- Node 1: {23, 26}
- Node 2: {6, 17, 29}
- Node 3: {0, 9}
- Node 4: {23}
- Node 5: {7, 10, 19, 20}
- Node 6: {2, 15, 23, 25}

- Node 9: {3, 7, 18}
- Node 10: {5, 17, 28}
- Node 11: {0, 8, 22, 24}
- Node 12: {21}
- Node 13: {19, 26}
- Node 14: {0, 16, 26, 27}
- Node 15: {6, 7, 29}
- Node 16: {8, 14, 16, 18}
- Node 17: {2, 10, 16}
- Node 18: {7, 9, 16}
- Node 19: {5, 13, 28}
- Node 20: {5}

- Node 25: {6}
- Node 26: {1, 8, 13, 14, 21}
- Node 27: {14, 24}
- Node 28: {10, 19, 24, 29}
- Node 29: {2, 8, 15, 28}

The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 2
- Node 7
- Node 8
- Node 9
- Node 10
- Node 11
- Node 14
- Node 15
- Node 16
- Node 17
- Node 18
- Node 19
- Node 26
- Node 28
- Node 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 0 * 1 = 0
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
    - Summing \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node: 
        - Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
        - Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
        - Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
Adding these up, we get a total of 46 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].
