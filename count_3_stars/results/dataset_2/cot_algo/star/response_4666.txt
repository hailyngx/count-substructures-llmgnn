Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 4) (13, 29) (13, 14) (22, 14) (22, 20) (3, 15) (3, 28) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 8) (1, 5) (1, 24) (1, 27) (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 19) (6, 16) (21, 6) (21, 10) (21, 8) (20, 22) (20, 29) (20, 2) (20, 16) (29, 13) (29, 20) (29, 24) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 7) (10, 2) (0, 15) (0, 16) (0, 5) (16, 6) (16, 20) (16, 0) (16, 12) (28, 3) (28, 9) (28, 14) (2, 20) (2, 10) (2, 26) (12, 16) (12, 26) (12, 23) (24, 1) (24, 6) (24, 29) (24, 17) (24, 23) (26, 10) (26, 2) (26, 12) (19, 6) (19, 27) (11, 14) (11, 18) (14, 13) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 11) (18, 11) (18, 23) (18, 5) (23, 12) (23, 24) (23, 18) (23, 25) (23, 27) (8, 15) (8, 21) (7, 10) (9, 28) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 27) (4, 13) (4, 17) (17, 24) (17, 5) (17, 4) (27, 1) (27, 19) (27, 23) (27, 5) (25, 23) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {15, 16, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 24, 27}
- Node 2: Neighbors {20, 10, 26}
- Node 3: Neighbors {15, 28}
- Node 4: Neighbors {13, 17}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 0, 18, 17, 27}
- Node 6: Neighbors {21, 24, 19, 16}
- Node 7: Neighbors {10}
- Node 8: Neighbors {15, 21}
- Node 9: Neighbors {28}
- Node 10: Neighbors {21, 26, 7, 2}
- Node 11: Neighbors {14, 18}
- Node 12: Neighbors {16, 26, 23}
- Node 13: Neighbors {4, 29, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {13, 22, 28, 11}
- Node 15: Neighbors {3, 0, 8}
- Node 16: Neighbors {6, 20, 0, 12}
- Node 17: Neighbors {4, 5, 24}
- Node 18: Neighbors {11, 23, 5}
- Node 19: Neighbors {6, 27}
- Node 20: Neighbors {22, 29, 2, 16}
- Node 21: Neighbors {6, 10, 8}
- Node 22: Neighbors {14, 20}
- Node 23: Neighbors {12, 24, 18, 25, 27}
- Node 24: Neighbors {1, 6, 29, 17, 23}
- Node 25: Neighbors {23}
- Node 26: Neighbors {10, 2, 12}
- Node 27: Neighbors {1, 5, 23, 19}
- Node 28: Neighbors {3, 14, 9}
- Node 29: Neighbors {13, 20, 24}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 0, 13, 17, 18, 19, 22, 25, 29
- For each of these nodes, we can form a 3-star. So, [8] 3-stars are formed in total.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (15, 16, 5)>, <13, (4, 29, 14)>, <17, (4, 5, 24)>, <18, (11, 23, 5)>, <19, (6, 27, 19)>, <22, (14, 20, 22)>, <25, (23, 25, 27)>, <29, (13, 20, 24)>
