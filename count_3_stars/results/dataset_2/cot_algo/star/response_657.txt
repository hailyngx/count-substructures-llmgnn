Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 1, 4, 2, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 3, 2, 0, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 1, 4, 8, 7, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 1, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 8, 2, 0}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 6, 2, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 1, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 0}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 1, 3, 4, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 4, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <1, 2, 5>
