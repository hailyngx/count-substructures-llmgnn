Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 19) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 17) (1, 16) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (2, 11) (2, 18) (18, 16) (18, 2) (18, 5) (0, 1) (0, 5) (14, 15) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 1) (13, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (10, 3) (10, 8) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 12) (9, 15) (9, 8) (12, 8) (12, 17) (6, 11) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 19) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 17) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 19) 

Response:
There are 13 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes {3, 5, 8, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}. 

For each of these 9 nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at that node by using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \). 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 16: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up these results: 

\( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 66 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [66].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<3, 1, 16>, <5, 0, 1>, <5, 0, 13>, <8, 7, 5>, <11, 6, 4>, <16, 1, 18>, <16, 3, 19>, <17, 12, 8>
