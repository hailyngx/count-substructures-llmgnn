Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 3, 2, 7}.
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 2}.
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 9, 1, 3, 8, 0}.
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 0, 2}.
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 6, 8}.
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 2, 8, 4, 7}.
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 1, 8, 4}.
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 9, 3, 0}.
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 6, 4, 2}.
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 2, 7, 0}.

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, Node 8, and Node 9 each have 4 or more neighbors, so we can calculate \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each of these nodes.
- Node 7 has exactly 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with that node.

Total number of 3-stars = 5 * 4 + 1 = 21, which we'll represent as [21].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (9, 3, 2)>
- <0, (9, 3, 7)>
- <0, (9, 2, 7)>
- <2, (5, 1, 8)>
- <2, (5, 3, 0)>
- <2, (5, 8, 6)>
- <2, (9, 8, 6)>
- <5, (9, 8, 4)>
- <5, (6, 8, 4)>
- <8, (5, 4, 6)>
- <9, (5, 2, 7)>
