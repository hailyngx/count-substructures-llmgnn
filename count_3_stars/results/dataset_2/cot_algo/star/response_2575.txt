Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a visualization of the graph:

```
    5 — 0
   /|   |\
  1 3—8 2 4
   \|   |/
    7—6 9
```

Now, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 9, 8, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 3, 2, 4}
- Node 2: {9, 1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 1, 7, 2, 8}
- Node 4: {9, 1, 2}
- Node 5: {1, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 7}
- Node 7: {9, 6, 3, 0}
- Node 8: {3, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 2, 7, 0}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms one 3-star: <1, (5, 0, 3)>
- Node 3 forms one 3-star: <3, (5, 1, 7)>
- Node 9 forms one 3-star: <9, (6, 4, 2)>

The total number of 3-stars is [3].
