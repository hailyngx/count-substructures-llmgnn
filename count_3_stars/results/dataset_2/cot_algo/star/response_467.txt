Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {4, 2, 6, 3}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 7, 6}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 3, 0}
- Node 3: {4, 2, 8, 6, 0}
- Node 4: {7, 2, 0, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 1, 3, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 4, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 1, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For the nodes with three neighbors (nodes 0, 3, 4, 8, and 9), there is only one 3-star possible for each node.
- For the nodes with more than three neighbors (nodes 1, 2, and 7), we will calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of them:
  - Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 5
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 4
- Node 7: 10

Total 3-stars: 5 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, 2, 4>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <4, 7, 1>
- <7, 5, 9>
- <7, 5, 1>
- <7, 9, 1>
- <7, 1, 6>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <1, 9, 7>
- <1, 7, 6>
