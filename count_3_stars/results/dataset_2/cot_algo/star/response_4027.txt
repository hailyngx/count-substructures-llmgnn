Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 3) (14, 4) (17, 10) (17, 5) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 16) (12, 10) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 18) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 3) (19, 8) (19, 0) (4, 14) (4, 0) (0, 19) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 18) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 5) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 13) (15, 11) (15, 9) (15, 18) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 15) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 18, 19}
- Node 1: {7, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 16}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 13, 17}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 6, 11}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 8, 19}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 9, 15}
- Node 10: {1, 12, 13, 17}
- Node 11: {7, 15, 16}
- Node 12: {10, 16}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 10, 18}
- Node 14: {4}
- Node 15: {9, 11, 18}
- Node 16: {2, 11, 12}
- Node 17: {5, 10}
- Node 18: {0, 13, 15}
- Node 19: {0, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0, Node 3, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 13, Node 15, Node 18 each have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them.

Calculating \( inom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 22 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 18>, <0, 8, 18>, <0, 18, 15>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 8, 18>, <3, 9, 15>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 11>, <6, 9, 15>, <7, 10, 13>, <10, 12, 16>, <10, 13, 18>, <13, 5, 17>, <13, 10, 17>, <13, 10, 18>, <15, 11, 16>, <15, 11, 18>, <15, 18, 0>, <18, 0, 13>, <18, 13, 15>
