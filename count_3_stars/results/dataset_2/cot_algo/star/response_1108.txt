Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 4, 7, 8, 2
- Node 1: 4, 7, 6, 2
- Node 2: 9, 1, 6, 8, 0
- Node 3: 9, 4, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 7, 3
- Node 5: 6, 0
- Node 6: 5, 9, 1, 3, 2
- Node 7: 9, 4, 0, 1
- Node 8: 9, 2, 0
- Node 9: 6, 8, 2, 3, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: 5, 4, 7, 8, 2 (5 neighbors) -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 4, 7, 6, 2 (4 neighbors) -> No 3-star
- Node 2: 9, 1, 6, 8, 0 (5 neighbors) -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 9, 4, 6 (3 neighbors) -> 1 3-star
- Node 4: 0, 1, 7, 3 (4 neighbors) -> No 3-star
- Node 6: 5, 9, 1, 3, 2 (5 neighbors) -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 9, 4, 0, 1 (4 neighbors) -> No 3-star
- Node 8: 9, 2, 0 (3 neighbors) -> 1 3-star
- Node 9: 6, 8, 2, 3, 7 (5 neighbors) -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 31

Therefore, the final answer is [31] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 2)>
- <2, (9, 1, 6)>
- <2, (9, 1, 8)>
- <2, (9, 6, 8)>
- <3, (9, 6, 7)>
- <6, (5, 9, 2)>
- <6, (5, 9, 3)>
- <6, (5, 1, 2)>
- <6, (9, 1, 8)>
- <9, (6, 8, 2)>
- <9, (6, 3, 7)>
