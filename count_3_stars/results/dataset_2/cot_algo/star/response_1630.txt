Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 6) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 1) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 4) (11, 15) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 17) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 16) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 16) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 8) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 12) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (12, 15) (12, 4) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 13) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 8) (16, 7) (18, 5) (18, 13) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {5, 8, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {17}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 17}
- Node 4: {3, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 10, 18, 19}
- Node 6: {13, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 13, 16}
- Node 8: {0, 9, 10, 16}
- Node 9: {1, 8, 17}
- Node 10: {5, 8, 11, 16}
- Node 11: {4, 10, 14, 15}
- Node 12: {4, 15}
- Node 13: {0, 6, 7, 18}
- Node 14: {6, 11}
- Node 15: {11, 12, 19}
- Node 16: {7, 8, 10, 19}
- Node 17: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 18: {5, 13}
- Node 19: {5, 15, 16}

Now, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes {5, 8, 13}
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes {3, 7, 9}
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 4, 17}
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <5, (0, 10, 18)>, <5, (0, 10, 19)>, <5, (18, 19, 16)>, <5, (0, 18, 19)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 9, 10}
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes {5, 8, 16}
- Node 11 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <11, (4, 14, 15)>, <11, (10, 14, 15)>, <11, (10, 14, 4)>, <11, (10, 15, 4)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 7, 18}
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes {11, 12, 19}
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <16, (7, 8, 10)>, <16, (5, 18, 19)>, <16, (5, 10, 19)>, <16, (7, 13, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
