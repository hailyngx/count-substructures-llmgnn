Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 27) (6, 9) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 25) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 16) (22, 17) (22, 8) (23, 9) (23, 8) (20, 26) (20, 16) (20, 4) (20, 5) (25, 1) (25, 11) (8, 6) (8, 22) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 0) (4, 20) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 5) (18, 4) (18, 24) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 14) (28, 21) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 10) (11, 26) (11, 25) (11, 28) (11, 0) (17, 1) (17, 22) (17, 7) (13, 2) (7, 17) (7, 10) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 11) (27, 26) (27, 29) (29, 27) (29, 15) (29, 12) (19, 4) (15, 9) (15, 29) (15, 5) (16, 3) (16, 20) (16, 10) (10, 8) (10, 28) (10, 7) (10, 16) (12, 21) (12, 28) (12, 29) (12, 24) (24, 18) (24, 12) (24, 2) (5, 1) (5, 20) (5, 4) (5, 15) (2, 13) (2, 24) (2, 14) (14, 21) (14, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8, 11}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 17, 25}
- Node 2: {13, 14, 24}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 16}
- Node 4: {5, 18, 19, 20}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 15, 20}
- Node 6: {8, 9}
- Node 7: {10, 17}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 10, 22, 23}
- Node 9: {6, 15, 23, 26}
- Node 10: {7, 8, 16, 28}
- Node 11: {0, 25, 26, 28}
- Node 12: {21, 24, 28, 29}
- Node 13: {2}
- Node 14: {2, 21}
- Node 15: {5, 9, 29}
- Node 16: {3, 10, 20}
- Node 17: {1, 7, 22}
- Node 18: {4, 24}
- Node 19: {4}
- Node 20: {4, 5, 16, 26}
- Node 21: {12, 14, 28}
- Node 22: {8, 17}
- Node 23: {8, 9}
- Node 24: {2, 12, 18}
- Node 25: {1, 11}
- Node 26: {9, 11, 20, 27}
- Node 27: {26, 29}
- Node 28: {10, 11, 12, 21}
- Node 29: {12, 15, 27}

Next, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each applicable node:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 0 3-stars.
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: 1 3-star each.
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the final answer is [23], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<1, 5, 17, 25> 
<8, 6, 22, 23> 
<12, 21, 24, 28> 
<20, 4, 5, 16> 
<28, 10, 11, 12>
