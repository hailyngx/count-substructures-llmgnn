Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's organize the nodes by their neighbors:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 52

Therefore, there are a total of 52 3-stars in the given graph: [52].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>

<(0, 1, 5), 9>
<(2, 3, 8), 9>
<(2, 4, 8), 9>
<(2, 6, 8), 9>
<(3, 4, 9), 1>
<(3, 6, 9), 1>

<(0, 4, 6), 1>
<(0, 1, 3), 9>
<(1, 5, 9), 8>
<(1, 6, 9), 8>
<(4, 6, 9), 7>
<(4, 8, 9), 6>
<(6, 7, 8), 9>
