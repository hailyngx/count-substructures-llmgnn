Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 7) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 19) (11, 8) (11, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 16) (5, 15) (5, 0) (19, 3) (6, 1) (6, 15) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 7) (12, 2) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 16) (7, 9) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 7) (9, 13) (9, 7) (18, 13) (18, 1) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 5, 10, 15
Node 1: 4, 6, 15, 18
Node 2: 7, 10, 12, 16
Node 3: 5, 10, 11, 19
Node 4: 0, 1, 10
Node 5: 0, 3, 15
Node 6: 1, 15
Node 7: 2, 9, 16, 17
Node 8: 11, 13, 14, 16
Node 9: 7, 13
Node 10: 0, 3, 4, 10
Node 11: 3, 8
Node 12: 2
Node 13: 8, 9, 18
Node 14: 8, 17
Node 15: 0, 1, 5, 6, 16
Node 16: 2, 7, 8, 15
Node 17: 7, 14
Node 18: 1, 13

Now, we can identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of them:

Node 0: 4 neighbors => 1 3-star
Node 1: 4 neighbors => 1 3-star
Node 3: 4 neighbors => 1 3-star
Node 7: 4 neighbors => 1 3-star
Node 8: 4 neighbors => 1 3-star
Node 10: 4 neighbors => 1 3-star
Node 15: 5 neighbors => 10 3-stars
Node 16: 4 neighbors => 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 18

Therefore, the final answer is [18], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 15, 5>
<1, 15, 6>
<3, 10, 0>
<7, 16, 8>
<8, 14, 17>
<8, 16, 15>
<10, 3, 0>
<15, 1, 6>
<15, 5, 0>
<15, 16, 8>
