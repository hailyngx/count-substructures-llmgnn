Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 22) (9, 6) (9, 13) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 27) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 17) (21, 28) (21, 27) (21, 4) (28, 21) (28, 20) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 19) (11, 17) (11, 25) (26, 14) (26, 20) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 12) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 24) (15, 16) (14, 6) (14, 26) (14, 1) (4, 21) (4, 12) (4, 23) (12, 2) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 17) (7, 3) (7, 29) (7, 22) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 11) (17, 12) (29, 7) (29, 19) (29, 23) (5, 15) (5, 25) (5, 0) (22, 6) (22, 7) (22, 0) (22, 20) (20, 28) (20, 26) (20, 22) (20, 10) (27, 13) (27, 21) (27, 24) (27, 23) (19, 3) (19, 29) (19, 25) (24, 15) (24, 27) (24, 23) (24, 25) (18, 15) (0, 5) (0, 22) (25, 11) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 24) (25, 16) (23, 3) (23, 4) (23, 29) (23, 27) (23, 24) (16, 15) (16, 25) (10, 20) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 22}
- Node 1: {12, 14, 15}
- Node 2: {8, 12, 17}
- Node 3: {7, 19, 23}
- Node 4: {12, 21, 23}
- Node 5: {0, 15, 25}
- Node 6: {9, 14, 17, 22}
- Node 7: {3, 22, 29}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {6, 13}
- Node 10: {20}
- Node 11: {17, 25}
- Node 12: {1, 2, 4, 17}
- Node 13: {9, 27}
- Node 14: {1, 6, 26}
- Node 15: {1, 5, 16, 18, 24}
- Node 16: {15, 25}
- Node 17: {2, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 18: {15}
- Node 19: {3, 25, 29}
- Node 20: {10, 22, 26, 28}
- Node 21: {4, 27, 28}
- Node 22: {6, 7, 20, 0}
- Node 23: {3, 4, 24, 27, 29}
- Node 24: {15, 23, 25, 27}
- Node 25: {5, 11, 19, 24, 16}
- Node 26: {14, 20}
- Node 27: {13, 21, 24}
- Node 28: {20, 21}
- Node 29: {7, 19, 23}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 20: 1 3-star
- Node 23: 1 3-star
- Node 24: 1 3-star
- Node 25: 2 3-stars
- Node 27: 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [12].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <6, 9, 14>
- <9, 6, 13>
- <12, 1, 2>
- <14, 1, 6>
- <15, 1, 5>
- <17, 2, 6>
- <20, 10, 22>
- <23, 3, 24>
- <24, 15, 27>
- <25, 5, 16>
- <25, 11, 19>
- <27, 13, 21>
