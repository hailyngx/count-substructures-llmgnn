Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 11) (2, 13) (2, 3) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 3) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 14) (19, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 16) (9, 18) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 6) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (11, 17) (11, 1) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 0) (14, 5) (14, 8) (15, 7) (16, 4) (16, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
We first need to create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {1, 3, 12, 13}
Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 11, 12}
Node 2: {3, 13}
Node 3: {0, 2, 10, 18, 0}
Node 4: {1, 7, 16, 18}
Node 5: {1, 14, 19}
Node 6: {13}
Node 7: {4, 8, 10, 15}
Node 8: {7, 10, 14, 16}
Node 9: {18}
Node 10: {3, 7, 8, 17}
Node 11: {1, 17}
Node 12: {0, 1, 13, 17}
Node 13: {0, 2, 6, 12, 17}
Node 14: {5, 8}
Node 15: {7}
Node 16: {4, 8}
Node 17: {10, 11, 12, 13}
Node 18: {3, 4, 9}  
Node 19: {5}

Now, we can check each node that has three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars formed, we get: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 58

Therefore, the final answer is [58]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 12, 13)>, 
<1, (0, 11, 12)>, 
<3, (0, 10, 18)>, 
<4, (1, 7, 16)>, 
<7, (4, 8, 10)>, 
<8, (7, 10, 14)>, 
<10, (3, 7, 8)>, 
<12, (0, 1, 13)>, 
<13, (0, 12, 17)>, 
<17, (10, 11, 12)>
