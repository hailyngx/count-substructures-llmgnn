- Node 3: {2, 5, 7, 28}
- Node 4: {0, 17, 19, 24}
- Node 5: {2, 3}
- Node 6: {8, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {3, 23, 25}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 20}
- Node 9: {8, 13, 28}
- Node 10: {6, 12, 19}
- Node 11: {15, 17, 21, 24}
- Node 12: {2, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 9, 23}
- Node 14: {6, 18, 27}
- Node 15: {11, 18, 29}
- Node 16: {21, 24}
- Node 17: {4, 11, 27}
- Node 18: {14, 15, 23}
- Node 19: {4, 10, 22}
- Node 20: {8}
- Node 21: {11, 16, 25, 26, 29}
- Node 22: {19, 27}
- Node 23: {7, 13, 18}
- Node 24: {2, 4, 11, 16}
- Node 25: {7, 21}
- Node 26: {1, 21, 28}
- Node 27: {14, 17, 22}
- Node 28: {3, 9, 26}
- Node 29: {15, 21}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: Ineligible (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 2: Ineligible (has more than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: Ineligible (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: Eligible
- Node 5: Ineligible (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 6: Eligible
- Node 7: Ineligible (has more than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: Ineligible (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 9: Eligible
- Node 10: Ineligible (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: Eligible
- Node 12: Ineligible (has more than 3 neighbors)
- Node 13: Eligible
- Node 14: Ineligible (has more than 3 neighbors)
- Node 15: Ineligible (has more than 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: Ineligible (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 17: Ineligible (has more than 3 neighbors)
- Node 18: Eligible
- Node 19: Ineligible (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 20: Ineligible (has only 1 neighbor)
- Node 21: Ineligible (has more than 3 neighbors)
- Node 22: Ineligible (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 23: Ineligible (has more than 3 neighbors)
- Node 24: Ineligible (has more than 3 neighbors)
- Node 25: Ineligible (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 26: Ineligible (has more than 3 neighbors)
- Node 27: Ineligible (has more than 3 neighbors)
- Node 28: Ineligible (has more than 3 neighbors)
- Node 29: Ineligible (has only 2 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <4, 0, 17>
- <6, 10, 12>
- <9, 13, 23>
