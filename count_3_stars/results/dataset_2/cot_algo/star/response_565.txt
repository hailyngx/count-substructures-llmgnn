Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:
- Node 3 has 7 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars centered at Node 3.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed with Node 4.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed with Node 5.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed with Node 6.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed with Node 7.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars centered at Node 8.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars centered at Node 9.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 35 + 10 + 10 = 55, which can be written as [55].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>
