Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 19) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 17) (17, 11) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 18) (18, 1) (18, 4) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 2) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 6) (12, 15) (12, 16) (6, 19) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 16) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 13) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 2) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
Given that there are 20 nodes in this graph and a total of 60 edges, we can start by checking the neighbors of each node to identify potential 3-stars. 

After analyzing the given edges, we can determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 15, 2}
- Node 1: {3, 15, 13, 18}
- Node 2: {5, 15, 16, 0}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 13, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 18}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 4, 16, 14}
- Node 6: {19, 13}
- Node 7: {3, 11}
- Node 8: {3, 16}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 0}
- Node 10: {19, 14}
- Node 11: {7, 17}
- Node 12: {15, 16}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 6, 14}
- Node 14: {5, 10, 13}
- Node 15: {1, 19, 0, 12, 2}
- Node 16: {5, 12, 8, 2}
- Node 17: {11}
- Node 18: {1, 4}
- Node 19: {10, 15, 6}

From the neighbor sets, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 5: <5, 9, 4>
- Node 15: <15, 1, 0>, <15, 1, 2>, <15, 0, 2>

Thus, there are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
