Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 3, 2, 4}
- Node 1: {6, 3, 5, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {6, 0, 8, 7, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 5, 0}
- Node 4: {6, 9, 1, 5, 0, 2}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 8, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 2}
- Node 8: {9, 5, 2}
- Node 9: {8, 4, 0}

Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4 have more than 3 neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (6, 1, 4)>
- <4, (6, 1, 2)>
