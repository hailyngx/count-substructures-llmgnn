Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 7) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 11) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 14) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 14) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 14) 

Response:
After analyzing the given graph, we find the following information:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, and 11.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 13.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 12.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 10.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 9, and 13.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 11, 12, and 14.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 8, 13, and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 7 and 11.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 4 and 14.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 8, and 14.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 14.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 14.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 11, 12, and 13.

From the information gathered, we can see that nodes 2, 6, 7, 11, and 14 have 6 or more neighbors, making them potential central nodes for 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \([20 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10] = [80]\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, 0, 11, 14>
- <2, 6, 7, 14>
- <2, 7, 11, 14>
- <2, 7, 13, 14>
- <2, 9, 1, 5>
- <6, 1, 9, 5>
- <6, 4, 5, 13>
- <6, 4, 10, 14>
- <6, 11, 0, 7>
- <7, 3, 9, 1>
- <7, 3, 9, 5>
- <7, 3, 12, 6>
- <7, 8, 11, 14>
- <7, 13, 5, 4>
- <14, 6, 12, 3>
