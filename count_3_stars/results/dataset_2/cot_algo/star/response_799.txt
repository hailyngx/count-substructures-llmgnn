Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 4) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 4) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's organize the given edges to see the neighborhood of each node:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 11.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8, 13.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, 10, 13.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 11, 14.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 10, 14.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, 11, 12.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 10, 12, 13.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 9, 12, 14.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8, 12, 13.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 8, 9, 10, 11.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 9, 11.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 10.

Now, we will find the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, and 13 have 5 neighbors each.
- Nodes 1, 5, 7, 9, and 12 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 7 nodes * 10 3-stars/node = 70 3-stars
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 5 nodes * 4 3-stars/node = 20 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 70 + 20 = 90. 

Therefore, the final answer is [90], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (5, 6, 10)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 7, 11)>
<10, (3, 6, 14)>
<11, (4, 8, 12)>
<13, (2, 9, 11)>
