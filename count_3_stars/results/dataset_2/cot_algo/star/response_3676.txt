Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 12) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 12) (0, 10) (0, 9) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 9) (12, 14) (1, 4) (1, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {10, 9}
- Node 1: {10, 4}
- Node 2: {3, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 7: {3, 4}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 11: {3, 4, 5, 12}
- Node 12: {5, 6, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {8, 10}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 5, 12}

Node 2, Node 5, and Node 12 each have five neighbors, so we can form 10 unique 3-stars with each of them.
Node 3, Node 6, and Node 9 each have four neighbors, so we can form 4 unique 3-stars with each of them.
Node 4 has five neighbors, so we can form 10 unique 3-stars with it as well.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42 3-stars. 
Therefore, the final number to put inside brackets is [42].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 5, 12)>, <2, (5, 9, 14)>, <2, (10, 12, 14)>, <2, (10, 12, 3)>, <2, (10, 5, 6)>, <2, (10, 5, 9)>, <2, (10, 6, 9)>, <2, (12, 14, 3)>, <2, (12, 14, 5)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, 
<5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 11, 12)>, <5, (5, 11, 3)>, <5, (5, 11, 12)>, 
<12, (6, 9, 14)>, <12, (6, 11, 14)>, <12, (6, 9, 5)>, <12, (6, 12, 14)>, 
<3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 11, 12)>, <3, (3, 11, 12)>, <3, (7, 8, 11)>, 
<6, (4, 5, 11)>, <6, (4, 5, 12)>, <6, (6, 10, 12)>, <6, (10, 12, 5)>, 
<4, (1, 4, 14)>, <4, (4, 7, 11)>, <4, (4, 7, 14)>, <4, (7, 11, 14)>, 
<3, (2, 8, 11)>, <3, (2, 11, 14)>, 
<9, (0, 2, 10)>, <9, (0, 2, 14)>, 
<3, (2, 10, 14)>, <3, (8, 9, 13)>
