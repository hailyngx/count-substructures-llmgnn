Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 22) (17, 4) (3, 25) (3, 24) (25, 14) (25, 3) (25, 15) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 18) (5, 2) (5, 29) (5, 20) (6, 21) (6, 11) (6, 27) (11, 6) (11, 23) (11, 9) (28, 13) (28, 20) (13, 17) (13, 28) (13, 7) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 15) (21, 6) (21, 16) (21, 23) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 18) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 23) (23, 11) (23, 26) (23, 21) (23, 9) (23, 20) (7, 13) (7, 18) (7, 2) (16, 21) (16, 8) (4, 17) (4, 22) (4, 24) (22, 17) (22, 4) (22, 29) (19, 2) (19, 10) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 19) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 19) (2, 15) (15, 25) (15, 26) (15, 2) (15, 24) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 18) (24, 3) (24, 4) (24, 15) (24, 29) (20, 5) (20, 28) (20, 23) (27, 6) (29, 5) (29, 22) (29, 24) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

1: {0, 9, 18}
2: {5, 7, 9, 15, 19}
3: {24, 25}
4: {17, 22, 24}
5: {2, 20, 29}
6: {11, 21, 27}
7: {2, 13, 18}
8: {10, 16, 18}
9: {1, 2, 11, 23}
10: {8, 19, 26}
11: {6, 9, 23}
13: {7, 17, 28}
14: {17, 25}
15: {2, 15, 24, 25}
16: {8, 16, 21}
17: {4, 13, 14, 22}
18: {0, 1, 7, 8}
19: {2, 10}
20: {5, 20, 23, 28}
21: {6, 16, 23}
22: {4, 17, 29}
23: {9, 11, 20, 21, 26}
24: {3, 4, 15, 24, 29}
25: {3, 14, 15, 25}
26: {10, 15, 23, 26}
27: {6}
28: {13, 20}
29: {5, 22, 24}

Next, we identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form a 3-star:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (5, 9, 15)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (2, 24, 25)>
- Node 23 forms a 3-star: <23, (9, 11, 20)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [3].
