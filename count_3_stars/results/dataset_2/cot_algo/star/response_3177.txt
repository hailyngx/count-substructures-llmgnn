Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 10) (26, 13) (15, 27) (15, 7) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 18) (27, 10) (27, 5) (2, 6) (2, 11) (29, 28) (29, 17) (29, 5) (28, 29) (28, 19) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 24) (17, 7) (1, 14) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 10) (18, 27) (18, 4) (18, 23) (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 21) (16, 24) (16, 22) (20, 21) (20, 23) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 28) (19, 8) (19, 14) (5, 27) (5, 29) (5, 3) (25, 17) (25, 14) (22, 4) (22, 16) (22, 10) (22, 21) (24, 17) (24, 16) (24, 21) (3, 5) (3, 12) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 25) (23, 18) (23, 20) (23, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 10) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 23) (7, 6) (0, 13) (0, 12) (21, 15) (21, 11) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 24) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 0) (10, 9) (10, 27) (10, 4) (10, 22) (10, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {12, 13}
- Node 1: {14}
- Node 2: {6, 11}
- Node 3: {5, 12}
- Node 4: {10, 18, 22}
- Node 5: {3, 27, 29}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 10}
- Node 7: {6, 15, 17, 23}
- Node 8: {9, 14, 19}
- Node 9: {8, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {4, 6, 9, 22, 27}
- Node 11: {2, 13, 21}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 9, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 11, 12, 26}
- Node 14: {1, 8, 19, 25}
- Node 15: {7, 21, 27}
- Node 16: {22, 24}
- Node 17: {7, 17, 24, 25, 29}
- Node 18: {4, 23, 27}
- Node 19: {8, 14, 28}
- Node 20: {21, 23}
- Node 21: {11, 15, 20, 22, 24}
- Node 22: {4, 10, 16, 21}
- Node 23: {7, 18, 20}
- Node 24: {16, 17, 21}
- Node 25: {14, 17}
- Node 26: {13}
- Node 27: {5, 10, 15, 18}
- Node 28: {19, 29}
- Node 29: {5, 17, 28}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 4, Node 10, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 17, Node 21, Node 22, and Node 27 each have 3 or more neighbors. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 47

Therefore, the final answer is [47], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (10, 18, 22)>, <10, (4, 6, 9)>, <12, (0, 3, 13)>, <13, (0, 11, 12)>, <14, (8, 19, 25)>, <17, (7, 24, 25)>, <21, (11, 22, 24)>, <22, (4, 10, 21)>, <27, (5, 10, 18)>.
