Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 9) (4, 14) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 12) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 12) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {13, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {5, 10, 11}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 3, 12}
- Node 3: {9, 7, 2}
- Node 4: {9, 14}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 8, 1, 10}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 10, 2}
- Node 7: {6, 3, 8, 13, 0}
- Node 8: {5, 13, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 14, 3}
- Node 10: {13, 6, 1, 12, 5}
- Node 11: {1, 0, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {13, 0, 2, 11, 10}
- Node 13: {8, 12, 10, 7, 0}
- Node 14: {9, 4, 11}

Node 5 forms a 3-star <5, (1, 10, 8)>.
Node 9 forms two 3-stars <9, (4, 14, 3)> and <9, (6, 5, 3)>.
Node 0 forms a 3-star <0, (11, 12, 13)>.
Node 13 forms a 3-star <13, (7, 12, 10)>.
Node 12 forms a 3-star <12, (2, 10, 11)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
