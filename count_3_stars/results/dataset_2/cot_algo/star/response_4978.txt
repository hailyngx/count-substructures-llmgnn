Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {8, 9, 10}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 10, 13}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 4, 12}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 11: {0, 6, 13}
- Node 12: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 13: {3, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 5, 7}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 77 3-stars, represented as:

\[ [77] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 9, 12)>, <0, (4, 9, 13)>, <0, (4, 12, 13)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 14)>, <0, (5, 7, 14)>, <0, (9, 12, 13)>, <3, (4, 7, 13)>, <3, (7, 12, 13)>, <7, (5, 6, 14)>, <7, (5, 7, 14)>, <7, (6, 11, 13)>, <7, (6, 12, 13)>, <7, (12, 13, 11)>, <13, (8, 11, 3)>
