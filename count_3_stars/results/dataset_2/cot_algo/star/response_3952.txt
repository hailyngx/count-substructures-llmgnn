Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 28) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 29) (8, 11) (5, 23) (5, 29) (5, 27) (6, 19) (6, 20) (6, 16) (0, 2) (0, 23) (0, 19) (2, 0) (2, 23) (2, 24) (14, 22) (14, 12) (11, 8) (26, 10) (26, 12) (28, 3) (28, 19) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 24) (17, 19) (17, 27) (17, 18) (10, 26) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 27) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 24) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 28) (19, 17) (19, 18) (22, 4) (22, 14) (23, 5) (23, 0) (23, 2) (23, 27) (7, 13) (7, 29) (29, 8) (29, 5) (29, 7) (9, 15) (9, 27) (20, 6) (20, 21) (20, 16) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 1) (24, 18) (24, 21) (21, 4) (21, 20) (21, 24) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 20) (27, 5) (27, 17) (27, 10) (27, 23) (27, 9) (12, 14) (12, 26) (12, 15) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 19, 23}
- Node 1: {4, 10, 16, 24}
- Node 2: {0, 23, 24}
- Node 3: {28}
- Node 4: {1, 8, 13, 21, 22}
- Node 5: {23, 27, 29}
- Node 6: {16, 19, 20}
- Node 7: {13, 29}
- Node 8: {4, 11, 24, 29}
- Node 9: {15, 27}
- Node 10: {1, 15, 26, 27}
- Node 11: {8}
- Node 12: {14, 15, 26}
- Node 13: {4, 7}
- Node 14: {12, 22}
- Node 15: {10, 12, 9}
- Node 16: {1, 6, 18, 20}
- Node 17: {18, 19, 27}
- Node 18: {16, 17, 19, 24}
- Node 19: {0, 6, 17, 18, 28}
- Node 20: {6, 16, 21}
- Node 21: {4, 20, 24}
- Node 22: {4, 14}
- Node 23: {0, 2, 5, 27}
- Node 24: {2, 8, 18, 21}
- Node 26: {10, 12}
- Node 27: {5, 9, 10, 17, 23}
- Node 28: {3, 19}
- Node 29: {5, 7, 8}

Now, let's find the nodes which can form 3-star structures:

- Node 0: Cannot form a 3-star structure.
- Node 1: Can form a 3-star structure.
- Node 4: Can form a 3-star structure.
- Node 8: Can form a 3-star structure.
- Node 15: Can form a 3-star structure.
- Node 18: Can form a 3-star structure.
- Node 19: Can form a 3-star structure.
- Node 24: Can form a 3-star structure.
- Node 27: Can form a 3-star structure.

Calculating the total number of 3-star structures:
\[ \binom{1}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 40 \]

Thus, the total number of 3-star structures in this graph is [40].

Unique 3-star structures:
<1, (4, 10, 24)>, <4, (1, 8, 21)>, <8, (4, 11, 29)>, <15, (10, 12, 9)>, <18, (16, 17, 24)>, <19, (6, 17, 18)>, <24, (2, 8, 21)>, <27, (5, 17, 23)>
