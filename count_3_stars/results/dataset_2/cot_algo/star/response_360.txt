Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 20) (3, 25) (3, 12) (3, 22) (3, 18) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 13) (25, 24) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 16) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 1) (28, 12) (28, 23) (29, 9) (29, 28) (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 1) (7, 10) (7, 0) (13, 25) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 24) (14, 8) (14, 1) (26, 10) (26, 21) (19, 22) (19, 2) (19, 23) (22, 3) (22, 19) (22, 27) (18, 3) (18, 8) (24, 25) (24, 13) (1, 25) (1, 28) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 4) (2, 15) (4, 2) (4, 23) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 13) (20, 9) (20, 27) (8, 14) (8, 18) (8, 27) (21, 0) (21, 26) (21, 27) (21, 23) (27, 22) (27, 20) (27, 8) (27, 21) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 23) (23, 28) (23, 19) (23, 4) (23, 21) (23, 15) (12, 3) (12, 28) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 7, 21}
- Node 1: {0, 11, 14, 25, 28}
- Node 2: {4, 11, 15, 19}
- Node 3: {12, 18, 22, 25}
- Node 4: {2, 23}
- Node 5: {9, 15, 16}
- Node 7: {0, 10}
- Node 8: {14, 18, 27}
- Node 9: {5, 20, 28, 29}
- Node 10: {7, 17, 26}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 28}
- Node 12: {3, 28}
- Node 13: {16, 17, 24, 25}
- Node 14: {1, 8}
- Node 15: {2, 5, 23}
- Node 16: {5, 13, 17}
- Node 17: {10, 13, 16}
- Node 18: {3, 8}
- Node 19: {2, 22, 23}
- Node 20: {9, 27}
- Node 21: {0, 26, 27}
- Node 22: {3, 19, 27}
- Node 23: {4, 15, 21, 23}
- Node 24: {13, 25}
- Node 25: {1, 13, 24, 3}
- Node 26: {10, 21}
- Node 27: {8, 20, 21, 22}
- Node 28: {1, 9, 11, 12, 23}
- Node 29: {9, 28}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1, 3, 5, 9, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 23, 25, 27, and 28 each have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 51

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars formed in this graph is [51], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, 11, 14>, <1, 11, 25>, <1, 11, 28>, <1, 14, 8>, <1, 14, 25>, <1, 14, 8>, <1, 14, 11>, <1, 14, 28>, <1, 25, 28>, <1, 25, 11>, <3, 12, 28>, <3, 18, 22>, <3, 18, 25>, <3, 18, 8>, <3, 22, 19>, <5, 15, 2>, <9, 20, 27>, <9, 20, 27>, <9, 29, 28>, <13, 16, 17>, <13, 16, 5>, <13, 16, 17>, <13, 16, 5>, <23, 15, 2>, <23, 19, 2>, <23, 19, 4>, <23, 21, 0>, <23, 21, 4>, <25, 24, 13>, <25, 1, 11>, <25, 1, 28>, <25, 13, 24>, <27, 20, 9>, <27, 8, 18>, and <27, 8, 21>.
