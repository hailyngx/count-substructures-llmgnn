Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 3, 6, 2}
- Node 2: {1, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 3, 0, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 1, 4, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 8, 0, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 8, 2, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 1, 7, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 3: <1, (5, 9, 3)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 1, and 7: <5, (9, 1, 7)>

Since there are 2 unique 3-stars formed in this graph, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
