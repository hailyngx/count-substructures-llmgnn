Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 9) (3, 11) (3, 6) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 10) (7, 8) (7, 19) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 9) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 15) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 0) (0, 18) (2, 4) (2, 6) (5, 14) (5, 12) (16, 10) (16, 9) (16, 6) (19, 17) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 6) (9, 1) (9, 12) (9, 16) (9, 15) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (6, 19) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {18}
- Node 1: {9, 10, 13, 19}
- Node 2: {4, 6}
- Node 3: {6, 11}
- Node 4: {2, 15, 18}
- Node 5: {12, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 16, 19}
- Node 7: {8, 19}
- Node 8: {7, 11, 13, 17, 18}
- Node 9: {1, 12, 15, 16}
- Node 10: {1, 11, 16}
- Node 11: {3, 8, 10}
- Node 12: {5, 9, 15}
- Node 13: {1, 8}
- Node 14: {5, 17}
- Node 15: {4, 9, 12}
- Node 16: {6, 9, 10}
- Node 17: {8, 14, 19}
- Node 18: {4, 8, 14}
- Node 19: {1, 6, 7, 17}

Now, we compute the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 27

Therefore, the final answer is [27].

The unique 3-stars identified are:
<1, 9, 10, 13>, <1, 9, 10, 19>, <1, 9, 13, 19>, <1, 10, 13, 19>, <4, 15, 18>, <6, 9, 16>, <8, 11, 13>, <8, 11, 17>, <8, 13, 17>, <8, 18, 17>, <9, 12, 15>, <19, 6, 17>, <19, 6, 7>, <19, 7, 17>
