Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 27) (21, 1) (21, 2) (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (18, 2) (18, 26) (22, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 29) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 19) (12, 11) (12, 27) (12, 3) (27, 1) (27, 12) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 15) (5, 22) (5, 13) (5, 25) (5, 15) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 24) (2, 21) (2, 18) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 20) (15, 19) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 3) (26, 18) (26, 28) (26, 29) (28, 26) (28, 0) (28, 24) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 23) (0, 8) (0, 28) (0, 16) (0, 23) (24, 6) (24, 28) (24, 19) (24, 25) (3, 12) (3, 20) (3, 16) (3, 7) (7, 1) (7, 20) (7, 3) (7, 9) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 24) (19, 25) (9, 7) (9, 23) (29, 11) (29, 26) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 9) (25, 5) (25, 24) (25, 19) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 16, 23, 28}
- Node 1: {7, 10, 16, 21, 27}
- Node 2: {18, 21}
- Node 3: {7, 12, 16, 20}
- Node 4: {8, 10, 15}
- Node 5: {13, 15, 22, 25}
- Node 6: {10, 14, 24}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 7, 9, 20}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 13}
- Node 9: {7, 23}
- Node 10: {1, 4, 6, 11}
- Node 11: {10, 12, 29}
- Node 12: {3, 11, 27}
- Node 13: {5, 8, 19}
- Node 14: {6, 17}
- Node 15: {4, 5, 19, 20}
- Node 16: {0, 1, 3, 23}
- Node 17: {14}
- Node 18: {2, 26}
- Node 19: {13, 15, 24, 25}
- Node 20: {3, 7, 15}
- Node 21: {1, 2}
- Node 22: {5}
- Node 23: {0, 9, 16}
- Node 24: {6, 19, 25, 28}
- Node 25: {5, 19, 24}
- Node 26: {18, 28, 29}
- Node 27: {1, 12}
- Node 28: {0, 24, 26}
- Node 29: {11, 26}

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 7 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 21 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 23 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 28 does not have 3 or more neighbors.

The total number of 3-stars formed is 9, so we put the final number inside brackets as [9].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 10, 27>
- <3, 7, 16>
- <4, 8, 15>
- <8, 13, 19>
- <10, 11, 29>
- <12, 3, 27>
- <13, 5, 19>
- <15, 4, 20>
- <24, 19, 25>
