Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 22) (21, 3) (21, 29) (21, 14) (18, 22) (18, 24) (18, 25) (18, 29) (22, 1) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 20) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 17) (13, 5) (17, 5) (17, 20) (17, 2) (20, 22) (20, 17) (20, 3) (20, 6) (3, 21) (3, 20) (3, 27) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 23) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 14) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 0) (28, 26) (28, 27) (28, 4) (28, 24) (14, 21) (14, 15) (14, 26) (14, 8) (14, 29) (25, 18) (25, 27) (25, 16) (27, 3) (27, 28) (27, 25) (27, 2) (6, 20) (6, 19) (24, 18) (24, 28) (24, 9) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 12) (29, 21) (29, 18) (29, 14) (7, 9) (11, 9) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 14) (16, 22) (16, 25) (16, 19) (0, 26) (9, 24) (9, 7) (9, 11) (12, 3) (12, 19) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 27) (2, 11) (4, 3) (4, 28) (4, 23) (23, 10) (23, 4) 

Response:
First, we'll determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 1: {22}
- Node 21: {3, 14, 29}
- Node 18: {22, 24, 25, 29}
- Node 22: {1, 18, 16, 20}
- Node 5: {13, 8, 17}
- Node 13: {5}
- Node 17: {5, 20, 2}
- Node 20: {22, 17, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {21, 20, 27, 12, 4}
- Node 10: {15, 8, 2, 23}
- Node 15: {10, 8, 14}
- Node 26: {28, 14, 0}
- Node 28: {26, 27, 4, 24}
- Node 14: {21, 15, 26, 8, 29}
- Node 25: {18, 27, 16}
- Node 27: {3, 28, 25, 2}
- Node 6: {20, 19}
- Node 24: {18, 28, 9}
- Node 19: {6, 16, 12}
- Node 29: {21, 18, 14}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 11: {9, 2}
- Node 8: {5, 10, 15, 14}
- Node 16: {22, 25, 19}
- Node 0: {26}
- Node 9: {24, 7, 11}
- Node 12: {3, 19}
- Node 2: {17, 10, 27, 11}
- Node 4: {3, 28, 23}
- Node 23: {10, 4}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <18, (22, 24, 25)>
    - <18, (22, 24, 29)>
    - <18, (22, 25, 29)>
    - <18, (24, 25, 29)>

- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
    - <22, (18, 16, 20)>
    - <22, (18, 16, 29)>
    - <22, (18, 20, 29)>
    - <22, (16, 20, 29)>

- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
    - <20, (17, 3, 6)>
    - <20, (17, 20, 3)>
    - <20, (17, 3, 20)>
    - <20, (3, 6, 19)>

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
    - <3, (20, 27, 12)>
    - <3, (20, 27, 4)>
    - <3, (20, 12, 4)>
    - <3, (27, 12, 4)>
    - <3, (21, 20, 27)>
    - <3, (21, 20, 12)>
    - <3, (21, 20, 4)>
    - <3, (21, 27, 12)>
    - <3, (21, 27, 4)>
    - <3, (21, 12, 4) 

Adding them up, we get a total of 22 unique 3-stars. 
Thus, the final answer is [22].
