Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 17) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 24) (18, 27) (18, 15) (18, 12) (0, 8) (14, 26) (14, 19) (14, 20) (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 22) (11, 5) (28, 11) (28, 22) (28, 13) (28, 23) (20, 14) (20, 29) (20, 27) (20, 10) (29, 20) (29, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 22) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 10) (10, 20) (10, 9) (10, 22) (21, 15) (21, 17) (22, 11) (22, 28) (22, 8) (22, 10) (5, 2) (5, 11) (26, 14) (26, 25) (26, 17) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 23) (16, 17) (16, 25) (16, 15) (15, 18) (15, 21) (15, 16) (15, 19) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 15) (17, 4) (17, 3) (17, 21) (17, 26) (17, 16) (24, 2) (24, 8) (24, 6) (6, 7) (6, 24) (6, 27) (6, 13) (27, 18) (27, 20) (27, 6) (13, 7) (13, 28) (13, 12) (13, 6) (25, 26) (25, 16) (23, 28) (23, 12) 

Response:
After exploring the neighbor nodes for each node, we can see that the following nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has neighbors: 4, 5, 24
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 9, 24
- Node 9 has neighbors: 8, 10, 29
- Node 11 has neighbors: 5, 19, 22
- Node 12 has neighbors: 1, 13, 18, 23
- Node 14 has neighbors: 19, 20, 26
- Node 15 has neighbors: 16, 18, 19, 21
- Node 17 has neighbors: 3, 4, 16, 21, 26
- Node 20 has neighbors: 10, 14, 27, 29
- Node 22 has neighbors: 8, 10, 11, 28
- Node 24 has neighbors: 2, 6, 8

Now we apply \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes, where n is the number of neighbors of the node:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 31 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [31], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 5, 24)>, <8, (0, 9, 24)>, <9, (8, 10, 29)>, <11, (5, 19, 22)>, <12, (1, 18, 23)>, <15, (16, 18, 21)>, <17, (3, 21, 26)>, <20, (10, 27, 29)>, <22, (8, 10, 28)>.
