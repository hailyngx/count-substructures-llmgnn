Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 14) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 2) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 19) (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 5) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 2) (6, 5) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 18) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 0) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 1) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 11) (12, 13) (12, 18) (19, 7) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 18) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {5, 11, 14}
Node 1: {2, 8, 11}
Node 2: {1, 13, 15, 17, 8}
Node 3: {7, 11, 15}
Node 4: {11, 13, 17}
Node 5: {0, 6, 7, 9, 17}
Node 6: {5}
Node 7: {3, 5, 19}
Node 8: {1, 2, 10, 18}
Node 9: {5, 14}
Node 10: {8, 14}
Node 11: {0, 1, 3, 4}
Node 12: {13, 18}
Node 13: {2, 4, 12, 18}
Node 14: {0, 9, 10, 15}
Node 15: {2, 3, 14, 17}
Node 17: {2, 4, 5, 15}
Node 18: {8, 12, 13}
Node 19: {7}

Next, let's note the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 3 neighbors
Node 1: 3 neighbors
Node 2: 5 neighbors
Node 3: 3 neighbors
Node 4: 3 neighbors
Node 5: 5 neighbors
Node 7: 3 neighbors
Node 8: 4 neighbors
Node 9: 2 neighbors
Node 10: 2 neighbors
Node 11: 4 neighbors
Node 13: 4 neighbors
Node 14: 4 neighbors
Node 15: 4 neighbors
Node 17: 4 neighbors
Node 18: 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: C(3,3) = 1
Node 1: C(3,3) = 1
Node 2: C(5,3) = 10
Node 3: C(3,3) = 1
Node 4: C(3,3) = 1
Node 5: C(5,3) = 10
Node 7: C(3,3) = 1
Node 8: C(4,3) = 4
Node 11: C(4,3) = 4
Node 13: C(4,3) = 4
Node 14: C(4,3) = 4
Node 15: C(4,3) = 4
Node 17: C(4,3) = 4

Adding all the possible 3-stars gives: 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 47

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [47].
