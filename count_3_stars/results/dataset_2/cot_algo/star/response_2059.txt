  - <1, (10, 26, 24)>
  - <1, (25, 26, 24)>

- Node 3, 3 neighbors: No 3-star formed.

- Node 4, 4 neighbors: \(\binom{4}{3}=4\) 3-stars
  - <4, (2, 6, 8)>

  - <24, (2, 27, 28)>
  - <24, (2, 12, 27)>
  - <24, (2, 12, 28)>
  - <24, (2, 27, 12)>
  - <24, (27, 12, 28)>
  - <24, (27, 12, 24)>
  - <24, (27, 28, 24)>
  - <24, (12, 28, 24)>
  - <24, (12, 29, 28)>
  - <24, (12, 29, 24)>

- Node 28, 5 neighbors: \(\binom{5}{3}=10\) 3-stars
  - <28, (19, 26, 24)>
  - <28, (19, 26, 25)>
  - <28, (19, 26, 28)>
  - <28, (19, 24, 25)>
  - <28, (19, 24, 28)>

Total 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 74

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [74].
