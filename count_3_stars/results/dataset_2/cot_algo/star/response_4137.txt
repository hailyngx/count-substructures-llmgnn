Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 0) (1, 8) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we start by identifying the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 13}
- Node 1: {8, 3, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 10, 5, 11, 2}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 6, 2, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 12}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 13, 11, 0, 1}
- Node 9: {6, 10, 13, 12}
- Node 10: {4, 9, 1, 11}
- Node 11: {4, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {6, 9, 1, 11, 2, 14}
- Node 13: {9, 8, 3, 0}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 5, 12}

Now, for the nodes with three or more neighbors, we have:

- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 1 = 11, which we put inside brackets as [11].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (8, 10, 12)>
<1, (8, 3, 14)>
<1, (8, 10, 11)>
<1, (8, 10, 1)>
<1, (8, 12, 14)>
<1, (3, 12, 14)>
<1, (10, 11, 12)>
<1, (10, 11, 1)>
<1, (10, 12, 14)>
<1, (11, 12, 14)>
<2, (4, 5, 12)>
