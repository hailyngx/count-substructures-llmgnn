Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) 

Response:
Calculating the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 6, 2, 7, 9} = 5 neighbors
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 9, 7} = 4 neighbors
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 9, 0} = 5 neighbors
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 6, 2} = 3 neighbors
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5, 2, 9} = 4 neighbors
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 8, 4, 0, 7} = 5 neighbors
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 5, 0} = 3 neighbors
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 0} = 4 neighbors
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9} = 2 neighbors
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 8, 0, 4} = 5 neighbors

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 9

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40

So, the final answer is [40].
