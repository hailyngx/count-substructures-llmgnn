Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 58

Therefore, the final answer is [58], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 7, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>
