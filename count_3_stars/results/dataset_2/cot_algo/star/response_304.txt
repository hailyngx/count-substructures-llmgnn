Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 13) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 5) (10, 17) (10, 4) (11, 19) (11, 15) (17, 6) (17, 10) (17, 18) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 13) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 5) (7, 3) (7, 14) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 5) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 15) (15, 9) (15, 11) (15, 19) (14, 7) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 18) (13, 16) (13, 12) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

1: {0, 4, 12, 13}
2: {6, 8, 18}
3: {5, 7, 19}
4: {1, 8, 10, 19}
5: {0, 3, 12, 16}
6: {2, 9, 17}
7: {3, 14}
8: {2, 4}
9: {6, 13, 15}
10: {4, 17}
11: {15, 19}
12: {1, 5, 13}
13: {1, 9, 12, 16, 18}
14: {7}
15: {9, 11, 19}
16: {0, 5, 13}
17: {6, 10, 18}
18: {2, 13, 17}
19: {3, 4, 11, 15}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has only 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has only 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has only 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 10 has \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 13 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has only 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 15 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 16 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 17 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 18 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 19 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (13, 16, 0)>, <1, (13, 12, 5)>, <1, (13, 12, 5)>, <1, (13, 12, 5)>, <13, (1, 12, 5)>, <13, (1, 12, 5)>, <13, (1, 12, 5)>, <13, (1, 16, 0)>, <13, (1, 16, 0)>, <13, (1, 16, 0)>.
