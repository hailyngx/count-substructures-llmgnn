Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 29) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 13) (15, 22) (15, 24) (15, 4) (27, 18) (27, 9) (4, 15) (4, 21) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 26) (9, 27) (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 17) (26, 7) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 8) (0, 20) (0, 5) (0, 1) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 19) (20, 23) (14, 6) (14, 10) (17, 11) (17, 9) (17, 20) (17, 13) (3, 23) (21, 4) (21, 22) (13, 16) (13, 17) (5, 11) (5, 26) (5, 0) (5, 12) (6, 14) (6, 24) (6, 23) (24, 15) (24, 6) (24, 12) (24, 23) (2, 7) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 24) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 29) (29, 11) (29, 10) (29, 25) (8, 26) (8, 10) (22, 15) (22, 21) (22, 28) (22, 25) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 10) (25, 11) (25, 29) (25, 22) (18, 27) (18, 7) (28, 9) (28, 22) (28, 19) (19, 20) (19, 28) (23, 20) (23, 3) (23, 6) (23, 24) 

Response:
The first step is to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 5, 20}
- Node 1: {0, 10, 16}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {23}
- Node 4: {15, 21}
- Node 5: {0, 11, 12, 26}
- Node 6: {14, 23, 24}
- Node 7: {2, 18, 26}
- Node 8: {10, 26}
- Node 9: {17, 18, 26, 27, 28}
- Node 10: {1, 8, 14, 29}
- Node 11: {5, 16, 17, 25, 29}
- Node 12: {1, 5, 16, 24}
- Node 13: {16, 17}
- Node 14: {6, 10}
- Node 15: {4, 22, 24}
- Node 16: {1, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 17: {9, 11, 13, 20}
- Node 18: {7, 9, 27}
- Node 19: {20, 28}
- Node 20: {0, 17, 19, 23}
- Node 21: {4, 22}
- Node 22: {15, 21, 25, 28}
- Node 23: {3, 6, 20, 24}
- Node 24: {6, 12, 15, 23}
- Node 25: {11, 22, 29}
- Node 26: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 27: {9, 18}
- Node 28: {9, 19, 22}
- Node 29: {10, 11, 25}

Now, we need to identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the number of 3-star subgraphs:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
Nodes with 4 neighbors: None
Nodes with 5 neighbors: None
Nodes with 6 neighbors: None
Nodes with 7 neighbors: 1 (Node 11)
Nodes with 8 neighbors: 2 (Nodes 16, 26)
Nodes with 9 neighbors: 4 (Nodes 9, 10, 17, 22)
Nodes with 10 neighbors: None

Calculating the number of 3-star subgraphs:
- For Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 16: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- For Node 26: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 35 + 56 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 123

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [123].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<11, (5, 16, 25)>
<16, (1, 12, 24)>
<26, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (17, 22, 28)>
<10, (1, 14, 29)>
<17, (11, 13, 20)>
<22, (15, 25, 28)>
