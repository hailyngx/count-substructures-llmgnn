Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 10) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 5
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 6
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 3
- Node 10 has degree 5
- Node 11 has degree 4
- Node 12 has degree 3
- Node 13 has degree 5
- Node 14 has degree 3

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 4 (degree 6)
- Node 6 (degree 5)
- Node 10 (degree 5)
- Node 13 (degree 5)

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 50, which should be presented as [50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, (2, 7, 13)>
- <6, (0, 10, 14)>
- <10, (0, 1, 3)>
- <13, (5, 4, 11)>
