Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) 

Response:
The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 8, 0)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (8, 9, 2)>
<2, (6, 7, 0)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>

Since we have 10 unique 3-stars in total, the final number inside brackets is [10].
