Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 8) (15, 5) (4, 12) (4, 19) (7, 0) (7, 5) (14, 16) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 2) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 2) (2, 17) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 18) (1, 17) (1, 6) (0, 7) (0, 10) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 19) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 6) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 12) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 10) (13, 11) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 19. 

First, let's find the set of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 10}
- Node 1: {6, 17}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 17, 18}
- Node 3: {8, 10, 12, 15}
- Node 4: {12, 19}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 9, 15}
- Node 6: {1, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 15, 18}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 15}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 15, 19}
- Node 11: {13, 16, 19}
- Node 12: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 13: {11, 14}
- Node 14: {6, 13, 16, 17}
- Node 15: {3, 5, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 16: {11, 14, 19}
- Node 17: {1, 2, 14}
- Node 18: {2, 8}
- Node 19: {4, 10, 11, 16}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 15.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 10, and 15.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9, and 15.
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 15, and 19.
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 19, and 13.
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 17, and 6.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars found are <2, 5, 9, 15>, <3, 8, 10, 15>, <5, 7, 9, 15>, <0, 10, 15, 19>, <11, 16, 19, 13>, and <14, 16, 17, 6>.
