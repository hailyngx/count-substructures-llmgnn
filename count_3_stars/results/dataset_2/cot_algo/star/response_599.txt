Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 24) (27, 16) (2, 21) (29, 15) (29, 1) (1, 29) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 12) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 25) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 13) (23, 28) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 23) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 0) (6, 8) (6, 28) (6, 7) (6, 4) (28, 23) (28, 6) (28, 10) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 21) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 9) (26, 13) (16, 27) (16, 21) (16, 18) (16, 10) (21, 2) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 16) (21, 5) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 25) (12, 3) (12, 22) (12, 9) (19, 22) (19, 7) (19, 24) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 5) (5, 21) (5, 11) (5, 10) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 10) (24, 27) (24, 19) (24, 20) (10, 8) (10, 28) (10, 16) (10, 5) (10, 7) (25, 22) (25, 23) (25, 4) (18, 16) (18, 20) (20, 24) (20, 18) (17, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

1: {29, 3}
2: {21}
3: {1, 12, 21}
4: {6, 25}
5: {10, 11, 21}
6: {4, 7, 8, 28}
7: {6, 10, 19}
8: {6, 10, 13}
9: {12, 14}
10: {5, 7, 8, 10, 28}
11: {5, 14, 15}
12: {3, 9, 22}
13: {0, 8, 23, 26}
14: {0, 11, 15, 9}
15: {11, 14, 17, 27, 29}
16: {10, 16, 18, 21, 27}
17: {15}
18: {16, 20}
19: {7, 22, 24}
20: {18, 24}
21: {2, 3, 5, 16}
22: {12, 19, 23, 25}
23: {13, 22, 25, 28}
24: {19, 20, 27}
25: {4, 22, 23}
26: {13}
27: {15, 16, 24}
28: {6, 10, 23}
29: {1, 15}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 17
- Node 18
- Node 20
- Node 26

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{17}{3} + \binom{18}{3} + \binom{20}{3} + \binom{26}{3} = 680 + 816 + 1140 + 2600 = 5236 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5236].

The unique 3-stars are:
<17, 15, 27>
<18, 16, 27>
<20, 18, 24>
<26, 13, 23>
