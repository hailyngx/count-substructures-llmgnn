Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 27) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 29) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 7) (23, 20) (12, 20) (12, 17) (12, 1) (27, 9) (27, 13) (0, 9) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 7) (20, 22) (20, 23) (20, 12) (20, 0) (20, 19) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 28) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 18) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 3) (28, 18) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 11) (29, 26) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 24) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 17) (11, 5) (7, 22) (7, 0) (7, 16) (1, 12) (1, 29) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 14) (19, 9) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 13) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 24) (16, 7) (16, 4) (16, 6) (10, 21) (10, 13) (6, 29) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 16) (13, 27) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 10) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 24) (24, 29) (24, 5) (24, 4) (14, 15) (18, 21) (18, 28) (18, 17) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 22, 20, 7}
- Node 1: {12, 29, 15}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {28, 6, 5}
- Node 4: {5, 16, 24}
- Node 5: {3, 11, 4, 24}
- Node 6: {3, 15, 29, 16}
- Node 7: {22, 0, 16}
- Node 8: {2, 19, 28}
- Node 9: {26, 0, 11, 27, 19}
- Node 10: {21, 13}
- Node 11: {9, 17, 5}
- Node 12: {20, 17, 1}
- Node 13: {27, 19, 10, 15}
- Node 14: {15}
- Node 15: {1, 13, 6, 14}
- Node 16: {7, 4, 6}
- Node 17: {12, 18, 11}
- Node 18: {21, 28, 17}
- Node 19: {9, 20, 8, 13}
- Node 20: {22, 23, 12, 0, 19}
- Node 21: {28, 10, 18}
- Node 22: {0, 20, 7}
- Node 23: {20}
- Node 24: {29, 5, 4}
- Node 26: {9, 29}
- Node 27: {9, 13}
- Node 28: {8, 21, 3, 18}
- Node 29: {26, 1, 6, 24}

Nodes 0, 9, 19, 20, 28, and 29 have at least 3 neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them:

- Node 0: [6]
    - <0, (9, 22, 20)> 
    - <0, (9, 20, 7)>
- Node 9: [2]
    - <9, (0, 11, 27)>
    - <9, (26, 0, 19)>
- Node 19: [1]
    - <19, (9, 8, 13)>
- Node 20: [9]
    - <20, (22, 12, 0)>
    - <20, (22, 23, 0)>
    - <20, (22, 12, 17)>
    - <20, (22, 12, 1)>
    - <20, (12, 0, 19)>
    - <20, (12, 17, 19)>
    - <20, (12, 1, 19)>
    - <20, (0, 19, 8)>
    - <20, (12, 17, 13)>
- Node 28: [4]
    - <28, (8, 21, 3)>
    - <28, (8, 21, 18)>
    - <28, (21, 3, 18)>
    - <28, (21, 10, 18)>
- Node 29: [1]
    - <29, (1, 6, 24)>

Summing up the total number of unique 3-stars gives us a final count: [14].
