Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 0) (22, 11) (22, 10) (22, 15) (14, 17) (14, 5) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 15) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 20) (0, 24) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 2) (15, 22) (15, 17) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 25) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 7) (26, 13) (26, 7) (27, 23) (27, 7) (27, 16) (7, 18) (7, 26) (7, 27) (25, 15) (25, 9) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 25) (9, 29) (29, 9) (29, 6) (8, 11) (8, 12) (28, 19) (28, 24) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 29) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 20) (2, 23) (2, 10) (16, 17) (16, 27) (16, 19) (16, 10) (24, 0) (24, 28) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 10) (10, 22) (10, 2) (10, 16) (10, 12) (11, 13) (11, 22) (11, 4) (11, 8) (23, 27) (23, 2) (23, 19) (19, 28) (19, 16) (19, 23) (21, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 13, 20, 24}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 10, 20, 23}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {11, 18}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 12, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {17, 18, 29}
- Node 7: Neighbors {8, 18, 26, 27}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7, 11, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 9, 15, 25, 29}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 12, 16, 22}
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 8, 13, 22}
- Node 12: Neighbors {5, 8, 10}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 11, 26}
- Node 14: Neighbors {5, 17, 21}
- Node 15: Neighbors {9, 15, 17, 20, 22, 25}
- Node 16: Neighbors {10, 17, 19, 27}
- Node 17: Neighbors {6, 14, 15, 16}
- Node 18: Neighbors {4, 6, 7}
- Node 19: Neighbors {16, 23, 28}
- Node 20: Neighbors {0, 2, 15}
- Node 21: Neighbors {14}
- Node 22: Neighbors {10, 11, 15}
- Node 23: Neighbors {2, 19, 27}
- Node 24: Neighbors {0, 28}
- Node 25: Neighbors {9, 15}
- Node 26: Neighbors {7, 13}
- Node 27: Neighbors {7, 16, 23}
- Node 28: Neighbors {19, 24}
- Node 29: Neighbors {6, 9}

Next, we need to find the number of 3-stars that can be formed using each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 67

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [67].
