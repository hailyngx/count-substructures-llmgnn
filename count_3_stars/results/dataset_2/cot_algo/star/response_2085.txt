Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 7
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 7: 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 4

Now, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: 1 3-star (with nodes 1, 5, 9)
- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 6: 1 3-star (with nodes 1, 5, 3)
- Node 9: 1 3-star (with nodes 1, 4, 9)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 31
Hence, the final answer is [31].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 4, 9>
