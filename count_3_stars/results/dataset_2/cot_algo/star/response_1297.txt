Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 9) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 14) (7, 10) (8, 4) (8, 0) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 0) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 12) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 9) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 17) (6, 15) (6, 12) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 2) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 2) (14, 13) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (12, 19) (12, 6) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 17) (9, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 16, 8, 18, 17
- Node 1: 5, 2, 9
- Node 2: 5, 1, 14, 17
- Node 3: 11, 16, 15, 4
- Node 4: 3, 8, 18, 14
- Node 5: 19, 2, 1
- Node 6: 15, 12
- Node 7: 10
- Node 8: 4, 0
- Node 9: 16, 10, 17, 1
- Node 10: 15, 7, 9
- Node 11: 3, 19, 18
- Node 12: 19, 6
- Node 13: 14
- Node 14: 4, 18, 2, 13
- Node 15: 3, 10, 6
- Node 16: 0, 3, 9, 15
- Node 17: 0, 9, 2
- Node 18: 11, 4, 14, 0
- Node 19: 11, 5, 12

Now, we will check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors to form potential 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 9, 14, 16, 18

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us: 4+4+4+4+4+4 = 24. 
So the final answer is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 17, 18)>
<4, (8, 14, 18)>
<9, (4, 16, 17)>
<14, (2, 18, 13)>
<16, (0, 15, 9)>
<18, (0, 11, 4)>
<19, (5, 11, 12)>
