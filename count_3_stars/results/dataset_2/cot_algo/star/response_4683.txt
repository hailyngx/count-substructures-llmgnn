Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 10) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 5) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 10) 

Response:
Given the graph with the provided edges, let's first determine the neighborhood set for each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {9, 8, 12, 2}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {6, 9, 14, 5}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {6, 7, 0, 14}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {9, 7, 12, 5}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {6, 9, 8}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {12, 3, 11, 1, 10}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 11, 4, 13}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {11, 3, 2}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {9, 13, 4, 0, 12}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {8, 4, 3, 1, 0}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {13, 14, 5}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {6, 7, 14, 5}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {8, 5, 0, 3}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {6, 8, 10}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {11, 1, 2, 10}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- **Node 6**: (1, 2, 11)
- **Node 9**: (8, 4, 0), (8, 4, 13), (8, 0, 12), (4, 0, 8), (4, 0, 9)
- **Node 8**: (9, 4, 8), (9, 8, 13), (9, 8, 0), (4, 8, 0)
- **Node 12**: (3, 5, 2)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15]. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <6, (1, 2, 11)>, <9, (8, 4, 0)>, <9, (8, 4, 13)>, <9, (8, 0, 12)>, <9, (4, 0, 8)>, <9, (4, 0, 9)>, <8, (9, 4, 8)>, <8, (9, 8, 13)>, <8, (9, 8, 0)>, <8, (4, 8, 0)>, <12, (3, 5, 2)>.
