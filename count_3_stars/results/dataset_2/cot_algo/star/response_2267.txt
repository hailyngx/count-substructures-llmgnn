Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 26) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 2) (2, 21) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 16) (29, 3) (29, 2) (29, 0) (29, 22) (0, 29) (0, 17) (0, 13) (20, 9) (20, 23) (20, 11) (12, 7) (12, 25) (12, 1) (12, 9) (28, 21) (28, 1) (28, 22) (28, 14) (28, 24) (13, 0) (13, 26) (13, 18) (26, 15) (26, 13) (26, 5) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 20) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 25) (10, 18) (10, 23) (10, 16) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 27) (19, 2) (5, 26) (22, 29) (22, 28) (22, 16) (25, 12) (25, 9) (14, 3) (14, 28) (24, 28) (24, 8) (27, 18) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 10) (16, 22) (11, 4) (11, 20) (11, 17) (17, 0) (17, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 28) (1, 23) (6, 8) (6, 23) (23, 20) (23, 10) (23, 1) (23, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {29, 13, 17}
- Node 1: {7, 12, 28, 23}
- Node 2: {21, 29, 19, 16}
- Node 3: {15, 14, 9, 18, 29}
- Node 4: {16, 11}
- Node 5: {26}
- Node 6: {8, 23}
- Node 7: {21, 12, 1}
- Node 8: {9, 24, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 20, 12, 8, 25}
- Node 10: {18, 23, 16}
- Node 11: {4, 20, 17}
- Node 12: {7, 25, 1, 9}
- Node 13: {0, 26, 18}
- Node 14: {3, 28}
- Node 15: {3, 26}
- Node 16: {4, 2, 10, 22}
- Node 17: {0, 11}
- Node 18: {3, 13, 10, 27}
- Node 19: {2}
- Node 20: {9, 23, 11}
- Node 21: {7, 28, 2}
- Node 22: {29, 28, 16}
- Node 23: {20, 1, 6}
- Node 24: {8, 28}
- Node 25: {12, 9}
- Node 26: {15, 13, 5}
- Node 27: {18}
- Node 28: {21, 1, 22, 24, 14}
- Node 29: {3, 2, 0, 22}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Nodes forming 3-stars: 3, 9, 12, 21, 28, 29

Now, we need to count the total number of 3-stars:

- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 1 + 10 = 11 \)

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [11], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- Unique 3-stars: <3, (29, 15, 14)>
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (3, 20, 12)>
- Unique 3-stars: <12, (7, 25, 1)>
- Unique 3-stars: <21, (7, 28, 2)>
- Unique 3-stars: <28, (1, 22, 24)>
- Unique 3-stars: <29, (0, 22, 2)>
