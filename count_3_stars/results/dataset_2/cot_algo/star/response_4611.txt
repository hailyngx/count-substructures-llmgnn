Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (17, 8) (17, 7) (5, 15) (5, 0) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 1) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 4) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (19, 8) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 12) (8, 1) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 16) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 15) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 1) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 13) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (13, 16) (13, 7) (13, 14) (15, 5) (15, 2) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 9, 10}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 8, 11}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 15, 16}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 7, 11}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 12, 18}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 15}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 18}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 10, 13, 14, 17}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 12, 17, 19}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 6, 18}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 3, 10}
- Node 12: Neighbors {4, 8, 16}
- Node 13: Neighbors {7, 14, 16}
- Node 14: Neighbors {7, 10, 13}
- Node 15: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 16: Neighbors {2, 12, 13}
- Node 17: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 18: Neighbors {4, 6, 9}
- Node 19: Neighbors {8}


Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 7 and Node 10 each have 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 8, and Node 12 each have 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- No other nodes have 3 or more neighbors, so they cannot form 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<7, (3, 10, 14)>, <7, (10, 13, 14)>, <7, (10, 14, 13)>, <7, (13, 14, 16)>, <7, (14, 13, 16)>, <10, (0, 7, 14)>, <10, (7, 13, 14)>, <1, (0, 8, 11)>, <1, (4, 8, 11)>, <1, (8, 12, 16)>, <1, (10, 11, 14)>, <4, (1, 12, 18)>, <4, (12, 16, 18)>, <8, (1, 12, 17)>, <8, (7, 12, 17)>
