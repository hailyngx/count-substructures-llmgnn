Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 0) 

Response:
Let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 1, 3, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 11, 0, 7}
- Node 2: {8, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 1, 0}
- Node 4: {8, 13}
- Node 5: {8, 12, 3, 14}
- Node 6: {10, 2, 12}
- Node 7: {1, 8, 12, 14, 13}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 4, 2, 7}
- Node 9: {8, 14, 0}
- Node 10: {11, 6}
- Node 11: {1, 10, 14, 12}
- Node 12: {5, 11, 6, 7, 13, 0}
- Node 13: {4, 7, 12, 2, 0}
- Node 14: {5, 9, 11, 7, 2}

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 10: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 11: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 74

Therefore, the final answer is [74]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 1, 3, 12>
- <0, 1, 7, 12>
- <0, 1, 13, 12>
- <0, 3, 5, 12>
- <0, 3, 12, 13>
- <0, 5, 12, 14>
- <1, 3, 7, 12>
- <1, 7, 8, 12>
- <1, 7, 12, 13>
- <5, 7, 8, 12>
- <5, 7, 12, 14>
- <0, 7, 12, 13>
- <1, 7, 12, 13>
- <2, 7, 12, 13>
- <7, 12, 13, 14>
