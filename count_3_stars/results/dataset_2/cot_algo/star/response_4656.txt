Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 0) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 12) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 9, 11}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 11}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 6, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 10, 12}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 8, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 8, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 10: Neighbors {5, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 1, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 13: Neighbors {2, 7, 9, 14, 6}
- Node 14: Neighbors {2, 10, 11, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10C3 = 120 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10C3 = 120 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 15C3 = 455 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10C3 = 120 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10C3 = 120 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10C3 = 120 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 6C3 = 20 3-stars.

Adding these up: 120 + 120 + 455 + 120 + 120 + 120 + 20 = 1075

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1075].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<2, (9, 13, 14)>
<6, (3, 8, 12)>
<9, (0, 11, 13)>
<11, (0, 9, 10)>
<12, (2, 6, 8)>
