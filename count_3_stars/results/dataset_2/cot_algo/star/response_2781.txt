Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (15, 9) (15, 8) (15, 5) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 2) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 18) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 12) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 14) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 12) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 14) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 14) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 7) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 18) (13, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6}
- Node 1: {12, 14, 17}
- Node 2: {9, 10, 12, 14, 17}
- Node 3: {7, 10, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 8}
- Node 5: {8, 14, 15, 18, 19}
- Node 6: {0, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {3, 11}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 6, 15, 18}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 11, 15}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 17}
- Node 11: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 12: {1, 2, 19}
- Node 13: {19}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 3, 5, 18}
- Node 15: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 17: {1, 2, 10}
- Node 18: {5, 8, 14}
- Node 19: {5, 12, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars from nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: [\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)]
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: [\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)]
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: [\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)]
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: [\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)]
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: [\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)]
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: [\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)]
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: [\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)]
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: [\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)]
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: [\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)]
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: [\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)]
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: [\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)]
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: [\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)]
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: [\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)]
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: [\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)]

Total number of 3-stars: [55]

- <2, 9, 14>
- <2, 9, 17>
- <2, 10, 17>

- <3, 7, 14>
- <5, 8, 14>
- <5, 14, 18>
- <5, 14, 18>
- <5, 14, 18>
- <5, 15, 18>
- <6, 8, 9>
- <6, 8, 15>
- <6, 9, 11>
- <8, 15, 18>
