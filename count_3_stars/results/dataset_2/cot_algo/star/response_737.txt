Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (18, 10) (18, 13) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (19, 13) (2, 1) (2, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 17) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 5) (14, 15) (14, 7) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 16) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (13, 15) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 2) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 15, 16, 17}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {3, 11, 17}
- Node 7: {4, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {4, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 16, 17}
- Node 10: {5, 11, 18}
- Node 11: {5, 6, 10}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 13: {2, 15, 18, 19}
- Node 14: {7, 15}
- Node 15: {3, 13, 14, 17}
- Node 16: {3, 9}
- Node 17: {3, 6, 9, 15}
- Node 18: {10, 13}
- Node 19: {13}

Now let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3, 5, 12, 13, and 15 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 17 have 3 neighbors each.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each (total of 6 * 4 = 24)
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 3-star for each (total of 8 * 1 = 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 24 + 8 = 32. 
So, the answer is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 5, 12)>, <3, (0, 15, 16)>, <5, (0, 4, 10)>, <12, (0, 5, 7)>, <13, (2, 15, 18)>, <15, (3, 13, 17)>.
