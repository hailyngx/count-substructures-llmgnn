Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 29) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 4) (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 28) (14, 17) (14, 1) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 27) (17, 11) (18, 22) (18, 5) (18, 29) (12, 27) (12, 29) (12, 8) (27, 17) (27, 12) (4, 22) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 24) (8, 12) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 28) (6, 11) (28, 15) (28, 6) (5, 17) (5, 18) (5, 19) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 9) (21, 3) (21, 10) (21, 9) (9, 8) (9, 19) (9, 21) (10, 19) (10, 21) (10, 0) (10, 7) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 23) (2, 16) (7, 10) (7, 25) (7, 26) (25, 7) (0, 10) (0, 23) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 20) (11, 13) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 26) (20, 1) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 26) (23, 2) (23, 0) (26, 7) (26, 11) (26, 16) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 12) (24, 4) 

Response:
The central nodes (nodes with exactly 3 neighbors) are: 13, 17, 19, 2, 10, 1.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each central node:
For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding them up: 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<13, (11, 22, 29)>
<17, (1, 5, 27)>
<19, (2, 9, 10)>
<2, (16, 22, 23)>
<10, (0, 7, 21)>
<1, (11, 14, 20)>
