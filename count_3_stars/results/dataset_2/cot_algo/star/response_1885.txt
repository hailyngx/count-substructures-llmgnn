Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 5, 7
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. 
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 58 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [58], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<7, 5, 9>
