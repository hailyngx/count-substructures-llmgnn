Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 4) (13, 9) (13, 12) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 8, 10}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 10}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 10}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 10, 11}
- Node 6: {4, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {8, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 11: {5, 14}
- Node 12: {6, 7, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {9, 12}
- Node 14: {4, 6, 8, 9, 11}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 0 3-stars
- Node 3: 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 0 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 0 3-stars
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 0 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 0 3-stars
- Node 14: 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 7, so we put the final number inside brackets: [7].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, 1, 8>, <4, 5, 10>, <6, 10, 12>, <8, 10, 14>, <0, 4, 10>, <5, 11, 14>, <8, 12, 14>.
