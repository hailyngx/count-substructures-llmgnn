Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 6, 2, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 8, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 1, 0, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8, 0, 5, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 7, 6, 0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 2, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 9, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7, 2, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 6} <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 2, 8} <1, (3, 2, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 8, 9} <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 1, 8} <3, (4, 1, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 8, 5} <4, (7, 8, 5)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
