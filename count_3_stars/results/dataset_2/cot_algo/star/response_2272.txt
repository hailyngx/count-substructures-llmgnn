Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 8) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
The central nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 4, 5, 7, 10, and 13. Let's calculate the number of unique 3-stars in this graph.

For node 4:
- Neighbors: 7, 10, 5, 0
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (7, 10, 5)>, <4, (7, 10, 0)>, <4, (7, 5, 0)>, <4, (10, 5, 0)>

For node 5:
- Neighbors: 4, 6, 12, 1, 0, 14
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (4, 6, 12)>, <5, (4, 6, 1)>, <5, (4, 6, 0)>, <5, (4, 6, 14)>, <5, (4, 12, 1)>, <5, (4, 12, 0)>, <5, (4, 12, 14)>, <5, (4, 1, 0)>, <5, (4, 1, 14)>, <5, (4, 0, 14)>, <5, (6, 12, 1)>, <5, (6, 12, 0)>, <5, (6, 12, 14)>, <5, (6, 1, 0)>, <5, (6, 1, 14)>, <5, (6, 0, 14)>, <5, (12, 1, 0)>, <5, (12, 1, 14)>, <5, (12, 0, 14)>, <5, (1, 0, 14)>

For node 7:
- Neighbors: 4, 12, 13
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (4, 12, 13)>

For node 10:
- Neighbors: 4, 11, 0, 1, 13
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <10, (4, 11, 0)>, <10, (4, 11, 1)>, <10, (4, 11, 13)>, <10, (4, 0, 1)>, <10, (4, 0, 13)>, <10, (4, 1, 13)>, <10, (11, 0, 1)>, <10, (11, 0, 13)>, <10, (11, 1, 13)>, <10, (0, 1, 13)>

For node 13:
- Neighbors: 7, 10, 14, 1
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <13, (7, 10, 14)>, <13, (7, 10, 1)>, <13, (7, 14, 1)>, <13, (10, 14, 1)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 39
Therefore, the final answer is [39].
