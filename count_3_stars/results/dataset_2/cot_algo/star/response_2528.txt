Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the neighbors for each node are as follows:

Node 0: {3, 9}
Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Node 2: {4, 5, 6, 8}
Node 3: {0, 1, 7, 9}
Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 8}
Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 7}
Node 7: {1, 3, 6, 9}
Node 8: {2, 4, 5}
Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 7}

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars in this graph by checking the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 30, and they can be listed as follows:

<[1, 3, 4], [1, 4, 5], [1, 4, 6], [1, 4, 7], [1, 4, 8], [1, 5, 6], [1, 5, 7], [1, 6, 7], [1, 6, 4], [3, 7, 9], [4, 5, 8], [4, 6, 8], [4, 8, 5], [4, 8, 6], [4, 5, 2], [4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 1], [4, 6, 2], [4, 6, 1], [5, 8, 2]> 

Therefore, the final answer is [30].
