Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 19) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 18) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 14) (15, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 12) (16, 0) (16, 2) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 19) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 11) (14, 18) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 17) (18, 3) (18, 14) (18, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 9) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 17) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 6) (17, 9) (17, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {16, 10, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {19}
- Node 2: Neighbors {16, 9, 7, 6, 17}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 8, 18}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 11, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 13, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {10, 18, 2, 12}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 5, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 13, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {11, 4, 2, 17}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 6, 12}
- Node 11: Neighbors {19, 4, 9, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 10, 6}
- Node 13: Neighbors {8, 5, 15}
- Node 14: Neighbors {8, 19, 11, 18}
- Node 15: Neighbors {13}
- Node 16: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 17: Neighbors {9, 2}
- Node 18: Neighbors {3, 14, 6}
- Node 19: Neighbors {1, 11, 14}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up: 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27].

Unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (16, 7, 17)>, 
<4, (5, 11, 9)>, 
<6, (12, 10, 0)>, 
<9, (2, 11, 17)>, 
<11, (19, 14, 4)>, 
<14, (8, 18, 19)>
