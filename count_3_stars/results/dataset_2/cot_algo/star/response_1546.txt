Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 12) (4, 6) (4, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 2) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 13) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7, 10
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7, 13, 14
- Node 2: 3, 11, 13, 14
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2
- Node 4: 6, 13
- Node 5: 0, 6, 14
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8, 10
- Node 7: 0, 1, 8, 9, 12
- Node 8: 6, 7, 12
- Node 9: 7, 13, 14
- Node 10: 0, 6, 11, 12, 13
- Node 11: 2, 10, 12, 13
- Node 12: 7, 8, 10, 11
- Node 13: 1, 4, 9, 10, 11, 2
- Node 14: 1, 2, 5, 9

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors with which a 3-star can be formed:
- Node 0: 3-star with (1, 7, 10), (1, 14, 13)
- Node 1: 3-star with (0, 7, 13), (0, 3, 2), (0, 5, 14)
- Node 2: None (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: None (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: None (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: None (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 3-star with (4, 8 10), (5, 6, 10)
- Node 7: 3-star with (0, 8, 12), (1, 8, 12), (9, 13, 14)
- Node 8: None (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: None (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: None (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: None (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: None (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 13: 3-star with (1, 9, 14), (4, 10, 13), (11, 10, 2)
- Node 14: None (less than 3 neighbors)

Counting these 3-stars gives a total of [13].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 7, 10>, <0, 1, 14, 13>, <1, 7, 8, 12>, <9, 13, 14>, <4, 6, 8, 10>, <4, 5, 6, 10>, <0, 8, 7, 12>, <1, 8, 7, 12>, <1, 9, 14>, <4, 13, 10>, <11, 10, 2>.
