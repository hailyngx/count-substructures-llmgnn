Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 8, 9, 2}
- Node 1: {3, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 9, 4, 0}
- Node 3: {1, 9, 7}
- Node 4: {9, 1, 6, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 0, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {5, 1, 6, 0}
- Node 9: {4, 2, 3, 7}

Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they form.
- Node 0: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Since each of these nodes forms 4 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the final number to put inside brackets is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 2)>, <0, (5, 9, 2)>, <0, (8, 9, 2)>,
<1, (3, 2, 4)>, <1, (3, 2, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>,
<2, (1, 9, 4)>, <2, (1, 9, 0)>, <2, (1, 4, 0)>, <2, (9, 4, 0)>,
<4, (9, 1, 6)>, <4, (9, 1, 2)>, <4, (9, 6, 2)>, <4, (1, 6, 2)>,
<5, (6, 8, 7)>, <5, (6, 0, 7)>, <5, (8, 0, 7)>, <5, (6, 8, 0)>,
<6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 4, 7)>, <6, (7, 4, 8)>, <6, (5, 4, 8)>,
<8, (5, 1, 6)>, <8, (5, 1, 0)>, <8, (1, 6, 0)>, <8, (5, 6, 0)>,
<9, (4, 2, 3)>, <9, (4, 2, 7)>, <9, (4, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>
