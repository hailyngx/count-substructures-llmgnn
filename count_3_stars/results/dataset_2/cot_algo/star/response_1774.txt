Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 5) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 28) (16, 1) (2, 29) (2, 1) (29, 11) (29, 2) (29, 9) (29, 15) (12, 22) (12, 26) (27, 18) (27, 10) (10, 27) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 13) (17, 10) (17, 6) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 8) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 24) (20, 0) (20, 23) (22, 12) (22, 26) (22, 21) (26, 12) (26, 22) (26, 21) (24, 11) (24, 0) (24, 23) (24, 25) (28, 16) (28, 0) (9, 29) (9, 15) (9, 3) (21, 10) (21, 22) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 14) (23, 11) (23, 20) (23, 24) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 7) (14, 21) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 15) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 13) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 18) (19, 4) (15, 29) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 25) (18, 27) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 11) (5, 18) (25, 24) (25, 21) (25, 15) (13, 10) (13, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first identify the neighbor set for each node.

Node 0 neighbors: {8, 20, 24, 28}
Node 1 neighbors: {2, 13, 16}
Node 2 neighbors: {1, 9, 29}
Node 3 neighbors: {8, 9}
Node 4 neighbors: {8, 19}
Node 5 neighbors: {11, 18}
Node 6 neighbors: {7, 14, 17}
Node 7 neighbors: {6, 14}
Node 8 neighbors: {0, 3, 4}
Node 9 neighbors: {2, 3, 15, 29}
Node 10 neighbors: {13, 17, 21, 27}
Node 11 neighbors: {5, 16, 23, 24, 29}
Node 12 neighbors: {22, 26}
Node 13 neighbors: {1, 10}
Node 14 neighbors: {6, 7, 15, 18, 21}
Node 15 neighbors: {9, 14, 25, 29}
Node 16 neighbors: {1, 11, 28}
Node 17 neighbors: {6, 10}
Node 18 neighbors: {5, 7, 14, 27}
Node 19 neighbors: {4}
Node 20 neighbors: {0, 23}
Node 21 neighbors: {10, 14, 21, 25, 26}
Node 22 neighbors: {12, 21, 26}
Node 23 neighbors: {11, 20, 24}
Node 24 neighbors: {0, 11, 23, 25}
Node 25 neighbors: {15, 21, 24}
Node 26 neighbors: {12, 21, 22}
Node 27 neighbors: {10, 18}
Node 28 neighbors: {0, 16}
Node 29 neighbors: {2, 9, 11, 15}

From the neighbor sets, we can see that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 21, 24, 26, and 29. 

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the number of 3-stars from each node: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].
