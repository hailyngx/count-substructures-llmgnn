Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 8, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 3, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 1, 8, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 4, 7, 1}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 7, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 6, 8, 0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 7, 2, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9, 4, 3, 6, 8, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 7, 2, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 4, 3, 1, 7}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0, 1 3-star
- Node 2, 1 3-star
- Node 3, 1 3-star
- Node 4, 1 3-star
- Node 5, 1 3-star
- Node 6, 1 3-star
- Node 7, 4 3-stars
- Node 8, 1 3-star
- Node 9, 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [12], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 5, 8, 6>
- <1, 9, 3, 2>
- <2, 7, 1, 8>
- <3, 9, 4, 7>
- <4, 9, 7, 3>
- <5, 9, 6, 8>
- <6, 5, 7, 2>
- <7, 9, 4, 3>
- <8, 5, 7, 2>
- <9, 5, 4, 3>
