Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 29) (13, 7) (22, 13) (9, 26) (9, 23) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 2) (26, 3) (26, 0) (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 11) (17, 7) (7, 13) (7, 17) (7, 21) (21, 7) (0, 26) (0, 25) (0, 24) (25, 0) (25, 6) (25, 19) (25, 2) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 15) (12, 1) (27, 14) (27, 12) (27, 1) (27, 6) (2, 26) (2, 25) (8, 19) (8, 20) (19, 9) (19, 25) (19, 8) (19, 16) (5, 23) (5, 11) (5, 24) (16, 19) (16, 15) (16, 6) (11, 17) (11, 5) (18, 10) (18, 3) (18, 29) (1, 12) (1, 27) (1, 29) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 1) (29, 23) (29, 15) (3, 26) (3, 18) (23, 9) (23, 5) (23, 29) (6, 25) (6, 27) (6, 16) (6, 10) (10, 18) (10, 6) (10, 28) (24, 0) (24, 5) (24, 28) (20, 14) (20, 8) (20, 4) (28, 10) (28, 24) (28, 4) (4, 20) (4, 28) (15, 12) (15, 16) (15, 29) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges, and based on the provided edge list, we can determine the number of 3-stars in the graph as follows:

1. For each node, identify its neighbors:
   - Node 0: Neighbors {26, 25, 24}
   - Node 1: Neighbors {12, 27, 29}
   - Node 2: Neighbors {26, 25}
   - Node 3: Neighbors {26, 18}
   - Node 4: Neighbors {20, 28}
   - Node 5: Neighbors {23, 11, 24}
   - Node 6: Neighbors {25, 27, 16, 10}
   - Node 7: Neighbors {13, 17, 21}
   - ...
   _(continue with all nodes)_

2. Count the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
   - Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   - Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
   - Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
   - Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
   - Node 14, 17, 21, 0, 25, 19, 5, 27, 24, 20, 15, 16, 11, 18, 29, and 6 all have less than 3 neighbors and do not form any 3-stars.

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
   Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <13, (22, 29, 7)>
- <26, (9, 2, 0)>
- <7, (13, 17, 21)>
- <0, (26, 25, 24)>
