Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 10) (7, 8) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 0) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 11) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 11) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 12) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: 
\[ \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\} \]

The neighbor sets for each node are:

- Node 0: {1, 7, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 2: {5, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 10}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 8, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 7, 13}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 6, 10}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {2, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 5, 7, 13}

The nodes that satisfy the condition of having 3 or more neighbors are: 
\[ \{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14\} \]

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 94 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [94].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
\[ <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 14>, <0, 7, 14>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 10>, <1, 8, 13>, <1, 8, 0>, <3, 1, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 9, 10>, <4, 1, 8>, <4, 10, 12>, <5, 2, 13>, <5, 7, 14>, <5, 11, 13>, <7, 0, 14>, <8, 1, 13>, <8, 3, 7>, <8, 3, 9>, <8, 7, 14>, <9, 1, 3>, <9, 3, 10>, <9, 6, 3>, <10, 3, 9>, <10, 4, 12>, <11, 2, 5>, <11, 2, 13>, <11, 5, 13>, <11, 12, 13>, <13, 1, 8>, <13, 2, 5>, <13, 8, 1>, <13, 11, 5>, <13, 14, 5>, <14, 0, 7>, <14, 5, 11>, <14, 7, 0>, <14, 7, 5> \]
