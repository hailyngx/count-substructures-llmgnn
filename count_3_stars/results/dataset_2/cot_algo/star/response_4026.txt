Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 4, 7
- Node 3: 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 42

So, the total number of 3-stars is [42].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
