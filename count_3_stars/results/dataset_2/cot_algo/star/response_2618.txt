Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 25) (15, 24) (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 13) (9, 19) (18, 26) (18, 14) (18, 24) (22, 9) (22, 14) (22, 25) (22, 21) (25, 3) (25, 15) (25, 22) (25, 1) (1, 3) (1, 25) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 29) (2, 12) (29, 2) (29, 19) (0, 15) (0, 6) (20, 21) (20, 4) (12, 2) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 26) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 23) (8, 11) (8, 7) (23, 8) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 28) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 21) (21, 6) (21, 22) (21, 20) (21, 11) (19, 9) (19, 29) (26, 18) (26, 27) (26, 17) (17, 23) (17, 26) (17, 16) (14, 18) (14, 22) (16, 17) (16, 4) (7, 8) (7, 23) (7, 10) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 28) (24, 15) (24, 18) (4, 20) (4, 16) (4, 28) (28, 23) (28, 13) (28, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: {6, 15}
Node 1: {2, 3, 25}
Node 2: {1, 12, 29}
Node 3: {1, 13, 15, 25}
Node 4: {16, 20, 28}
Node 6: {0, 9, 15, 21}
Node 7: {8, 10, 23}
Node 8: {7, 11, 12, 15, 23}
Node 9: {6, 13, 19, 22}
Node 10: {7, 11}
Node 11: {8, 10, 21}
Node 12: {2, 8, 13, 27}
Node 13: {12, 28, 3, 9}
Node 14: {18, 22}
Node 15: {0, 3, 6, 8, 24, 25}
Node 16: {4, 17}
Node 17: {16, 23, 26}
Node 18: {14, 24, 26}
Node 19: {9, 29}
Node 20: {4, 21}
Node 21: {6, 11, 20, 22}
Node 22: {9, 14, 21, 25}
Node 23: {7, 8, 17, 28}
Node 24: {15, 18}
Node 25: {1, 3, 15, 22}
Node 26: {17, 18, 27}
Node 27: {12, 26}
Node 28: {4, 13, 23}
Node 29: {2, 19}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 3: 1 3-star
Node 15: 1 3-star
Node 22: 1 3-star
Node 28: 1 3-star

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (1, 13, 25)>
<15, (0, 8, 25)>
<22, (9, 14, 25)>
<28, (4, 13, 23)>
