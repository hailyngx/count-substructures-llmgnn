Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 21) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 12) (14, 11) (14, 24) (17, 19) (18, 22) (18, 16) (18, 12) (22, 18) (22, 4) (4, 22) (4, 27) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 11) (21, 9) (21, 28) (21, 23) (21, 25) (21, 29) (28, 21) (28, 1) (28, 12) (13, 11) (13, 7) (20, 2) (20, 23) (20, 11) (20, 10) (27, 4) (27, 3) (27, 5) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 5) (16, 18) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 10) (1, 28) (1, 15) (1, 25) (24, 14) (24, 6) (24, 19) (7, 13) (7, 15) (7, 16) (6, 24) (6, 29) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 20) (29, 21) (29, 6) (29, 25) (29, 3) (3, 8) (3, 27) (3, 29) (25, 21) (25, 1) (25, 29) (25, 0) (10, 20) (10, 16) (10, 5) (0, 25) (0, 12) (19, 17) (19, 24) (5, 27) (5, 15) (5, 10) (12, 26) (12, 18) (12, 28) (12, 0) (12, 23) (23, 9) (23, 21) (23, 20) (23, 12) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {25, 12}
- Node 1: {28, 15, 25}
- Node 2: {8, 11, 20}
- Node 3: {8, 27, 29}
- Node 4: {22, 27}
- Node 5: {27, 10, 15}
- Node 6: {24, 29}
- Node 7: {13, 15, 16}
- Node 8: {2, 3}
- Node 9: {26, 21, 23}
- Node 10: {20, 16, 5}
- Node 11: {14, 2, 13, 20}
- Node 12: {18, 28, 0, 23, 26}
- Node 13: {11, 7}
- Node 14: {11, 24}
- Node 15: {16, 1, 7, 5}
- Node 16: {18, 10, 15, 7}
- Node 17: {19}
- Node 18: {22, 16, 12}
- Node 19: {17, 24}
- Node 20: {2, 11, 23, 10}
- Node 21: {9, 28, 23, 25, 29}
- Node 22: {4, 18}
- Node 23: {9, 21, 20, 12}
- Node 24: {14, 6, 19}
- Node 25: {21, 29, 1, 0}
- Node 26: {9, 12}
- Node 27: {4, 3, 5}
- Node 28: {21, 1, 12}
- Node 29: {21, 6, 25, 3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: <9, 21, 23>
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: <12, 18, 23>, <12, 23, 28>, <12, 0, 25>, <12, 26, 28>
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors: <21, 23, 25>, <21, 25, 29>, <21, 23, 28>, <21, 9, 28>
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: <23, 20, 21>, <23, 21, 29>, <23, 9, 21>, <23, 12, 26>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
