Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 14) (16, 29) (16, 19) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 28) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 15) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 25) (12, 3) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 7) (27, 6) (4, 8) (4, 20) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 21) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 18) (0, 10) (0, 20) (0, 6) (20, 4) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 6) (18, 17) (18, 7) (22, 5) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 1) (13, 5) (13, 26) (26, 13) (26, 14) (1, 10) (1, 22) (1, 15) (15, 9) (15, 1) (15, 25) (15, 21) (23, 11) (23, 10) (29, 16) (29, 9) (29, 27) (29, 24) (14, 11) (14, 26) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 24) (24, 29) (24, 2) (28, 5) (28, 8) (6, 27) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 20) (6, 22) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 25) (3, 12) (3, 20) (3, 19) (25, 12) (25, 15) (25, 21) (7, 27) (7, 18) (19, 16) (19, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: {10, 15, 22}
2: {4, 12, 24}
3: {12, 19, 20}
4: {2, 8, 20}
5: {9, 13, 22, 28}
6: {0, 17, 20, 22, 27}
7: {18, 27}
8: {4, 8, 21, 28}
9: {5, 9, 15, 22, 29}
10: {0, 1, 10, 17, 23}
11: {14, 23}
12: {2, 3, 25, 27}
13: {5, 26}
14: {11, 26}
15: {1, 9, 15, 21, 25}
16: {19, 29}
17: {6, 10, 18}
18: {7, 17}
19: {3, 16, 19}
20: {0, 3, 4, 6}
21: {8, 15, 25}
22: {1, 5, 6, 9}
23: {10, 11}
24: {2, 29}
25: {12, 15, 21}
26: {13, 14}
27: {6, 7, 12, 29}
28: {5, 8}
29: {9, 16, 24, 27}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 21, 22, 25, 27, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed:
\[ \sum_{i}^{n} \binom{deg(i)}{3} \]

\[ = \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \]

\[ = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 72 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [72].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<1, 10, 15>
<1, 10, 22>
<1, 15, 22>
<2, 4, 12>
<6, 17, 20>
<8, 15, 21>
<9, 15, 22>
<9, 15, 25>
<9, 22, 29>
<10, 17, 23>
<12, 25, 27>
<15, 21, 25>
<16, 19, 29>
