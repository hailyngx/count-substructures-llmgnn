Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 13) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 5) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 14) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 10, 11, 9}
- Node 1: {9, 2}
- Node 2: {7, 1, 12, 3, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 2, 14, 5}
- Node 4: {8, 9, 13, 11, 3}
- Node 5: {7, 12, 11, 3}
- Node 6: {7, 11}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 14, 2, 5, 13}
- Node 8: {4, 9, 12, 3}
- Node 9: {4, 8, 0, 1, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 14}
- Node 11: {4, 0, 6, 5, 3}
- Node 12: {8, 2, 5}
- Node 13: {4, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 14: {7, 10, 2, 3, 13}

Now, let's look at the nodes that have more than 3 neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 10 = 92

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [92].
