Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 10) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {5, 8, 12, 11}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {5, 8, 13, 10, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {4, 12, 2, 11}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {9, 7, 12, 14, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {9, 13, 2, 1, 0}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {9, 14, 10}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {4, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {12, 2, 0, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 11, 14}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {6, 2, 14, 1}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {9, 0, 14, 3}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {4, 0, 8, 3}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {5, 2}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {9, 4, 6, 11, 10}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (less than 3), so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 60 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:
