Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {9, 7, 8}
Node 1: {5, 4, 7, 3, 2, 8}
Node 2: {5, 9, 1, 3, 6}
Node 3: {9, 7, 1, 2}
Node 4: {5, 1}
Node 5: {2, 1, 4}
Node 6: {7, 2, 8}
Node 7: {0, 3, 6, 1, 8}
Node 8: {9, 7, 1, 6, 0}
Node 9: {8, 2, 3, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and determine how many 3-stars are formed by each of them:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [59]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
