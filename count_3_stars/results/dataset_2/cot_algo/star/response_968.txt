Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 8}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 78

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [78].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (8, 9, 6)>
