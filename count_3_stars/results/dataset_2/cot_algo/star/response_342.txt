Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges for each node:

Node 0: {3, 4, 7, 9}
Node 1: {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
Node 3: {0, 6}
Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}
Node 5: {2, 6, 8}
Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 5}
Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 9}
Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
Node 9: {0, 1, 7, 8}

Next, we'll determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44, so the final answer is [44].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>
