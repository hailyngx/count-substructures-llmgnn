Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 3) (3, 22) (3, 15) (3, 20) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 4) (14, 6) (14, 28) (14, 9) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 21) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 27) (4, 25) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 28) (21, 17) (21, 28) (21, 23) (28, 14) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 26) (26, 28) (26, 23) (27, 17) (27, 4) (27, 18) (5, 22) (5, 19) (19, 13) (19, 8) (19, 5) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 9) (16, 29) (16, 6) (23, 21) (23, 26) (23, 18) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 2) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 20) (1, 13) (1, 29) (1, 20) (29, 16) (29, 1) (29, 25) (6, 14) (6, 16) (6, 24) (24, 17) (24, 6) (2, 0) (2, 10) (20, 3) (20, 10) (20, 1) (18, 3) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 23) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 7) (11, 13) (11, 22) (11, 12) (12, 0) (12, 11) (25, 4) (25, 29) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented by the following adjacency list:

- Node 0: {10, 12, 2}
- Node 1: {13, 29, 20}
- Node 2: {0, 10}
- Node 3: {22, 15, 20, 18}
- Node 4: {15, 8, 27, 25}
- Node 5: {22, 19}
- Node 6: {14, 16, 24}
- Node 7: {10, 18, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 19, 28}
- Node 9: {13, 14, 7}
- Node 10: {7, 0, 2, 20}
- Node 11: {13, 22, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 11}
- Node 13: {22, 11, 1, 19, 9}
- Node 14: {6, 28, 9}
- Node 15: {3, 4}
- Node 16: {29, 6}
- Node 17: {24, 27, 21}
- Node 18: {3, 27, 7, 23}
- Node 19: {13, 8, 5}
- Node 20: {3, 1, 10}
- Node 21: {17, 28, 23}
- Node 22: {13, 3, 5}
- Node 23: {21, 26, 18}
- Node 24: {17, 6}
- Node 25: {4, 29}
- Node 26: {28, 23}
- Node 27: {17, 4, 18}
- Node 28: {14, 8, 21, 26}
- Node 29: {16, 1, 25}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 13 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <13, (1, 9, 22)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <22, (13, 3, 5)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <3, (22, 15, 20)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <4, (15, 8, 27)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <5, (22, 19, -)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <7, (10, 18, 9)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <10, (20, 7, 2)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <18, (3, 27, 23)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <19, (13, 8, 5)>
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <21, (17, 28, 23)>
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <28, (14, 8, 26)>
- Node 29 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <29, (16, 1, 25)>

Counting them all, we get a total of 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [11].
