Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6
- Node 9: 3, 7

Next, for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 3 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 and Node 6 each have 5 neighbors as well, so they can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 34, hence the answer is [34].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>
