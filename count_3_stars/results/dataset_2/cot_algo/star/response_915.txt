Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 0) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 18) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 17) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 1) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 13) (17, 11) (17, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) (8, 19) (8, 12) (15, 19) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 3) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 17) (3, 5) (3, 19) (3, 6) (3, 16) (6, 14) (6, 3) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 14}
- Node 1: {11, 13, 18}
- Node 2: {5, 17}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 16, 19}
- Node 4: {12, 13}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 9, 13, 18}
- Node 6: {3, 14}
- Node 7: {11, 14, 18}
- Node 8: {12, 19}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 16}
- Node 10: {11, 16}
- Node 11: {1, 7, 10, 12, 17}
- Node 12: {4, 8, 11, 18}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 5, 14}
- Node 14: {6, 7, 13}
- Node 15: {19}
- Node 16: {3, 9, 10}
- Node 17: {2, 11}
- Node 18: {1, 5, 7, 12}
- Node 19: {3, 8, 15}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 5 can form a 3-star with nodes {2, 3, 9, 13, 18}.
- Node 11 can form a 3-star with nodes {1, 7, 10, 12}.
- Node 13 can form a 3-star with nodes {1, 4, 14}.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 3, and the unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (2, 3, 9, 13, 18)>, <11, (1, 7, 10, 12)>, <13, (1, 4, 14)>.

So, the final answer is [3].
