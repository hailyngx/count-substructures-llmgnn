Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 29) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 23) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (18, 5) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 20) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 16) (22, 21) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 24) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 24) (0, 15) (0, 27) (27, 0) (27, 10) (27, 17) (20, 18) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 14) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 19) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 25) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 20) (13, 17) (26, 18) (21, 22) (11, 22) (11, 8) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 17) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 29) (17, 27) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 11) (14, 20) (14, 28) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 19) (28, 24) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 16) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 28) (19, 29) (29, 5) (29, 23) (29, 19) (24, 3) (24, 15) (24, 28) (16, 22) (16, 1) (10, 27) (25, 8) (25, 4) (4, 25) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: nodes 5, 9, 18, 22, 15, 20, and 28. 

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

For node 5, there are 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 9, there are 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 18, there are 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 22, there are 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 15, there are 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 20, there are 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 28, there are 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 28 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<5, (1, 9, 29)>
<9, (2, 6, 23)>
<18, (5, 20, 22)>
<22, (11, 16, 21)>
<15, (0, 3, 24)>
<20, (13, 14, 18)>
<28, (3, 14, 19)>
