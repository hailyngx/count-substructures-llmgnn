Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 2, 7, 1, 9}
- Node 1: {8, 0, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 0, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {8, 5, 6, 3, 2}
- Node 5: {4, 8, 6}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 3}
- Node 7: {0, 9, 1}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 7, 1, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 4 and Node 8 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 0 and Node 9 each have 5 neighbors, so they can also form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 10 (from Node 4) + 10 (from Node 8) + 10 (from Node 0) + 10 (from Node 9) = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <4, (8, 5, 6)>
- <8, (4, 5, 0)>
- <0, (8, 2, 1)>
- <9, (0, 7, 1)>
