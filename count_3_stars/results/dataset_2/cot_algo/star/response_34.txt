Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 14) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 3) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 23) (25, 10) (4, 22) (8, 9) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 11) (15, 20) (15, 7) (15, 13) (18, 6) (1, 20) (1, 26) (1, 13) (1, 22) (26, 1) (3, 20) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 3) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 17) (5, 25) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 29) (19, 25) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 16) (29, 9) (29, 5) (29, 13) (29, 23) (28, 8) (28, 12) (22, 4) (22, 1) (22, 16) (22, 24) (22, 21) (10, 25) (12, 0) (12, 28) (12, 16) (16, 19) (16, 22) (16, 12) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 17) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 29) (13, 21) (21, 0) (21, 19) (21, 22) (21, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 3) (24, 22) (24, 23) (23, 25) (23, 29) (23, 24) (17, 7) (17, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: [7, 21, 12]
- Node 1: [20, 26, 13, 22]
- Node 2: [6, 5, 17]
- Node 3: [20, 11, 14]
- Node 4: [22]
- Node 5: [25, 19, 2, 29]
- Node 6: [9, 14, 2, 18]
- Node 7: [0, 15, 17]
- Node 8: [9, 28, 14, 11]
- Node 9: [6, 8, 29, 14]
- Node 10: [25]
- Node 11: [8, 3]
- Node 12: [0, 28, 16]
- Node 13: [15, 1, 29, 21]
- Node 14: [6, 9, 8, 3]
- Node 15: [20, 7, 13]
- Node 16: [19, 22, 12]
- Node 17: [7, 2]
- Node 18: [6]
- Node 19: [25, 5, 21, 16]
- Node 20: [25, 15, 1, 3]
- Node 21: [0, 19, 22, 13]
- Node 22: [4, 1, 16, 24, 21]
- Node 23: [25, 29, 24]
- Node 24: [22, 23]
- Node 25: [20, 5, 19, 23, 10]
- Node 26: [1]
- Node 28: [8, 12]
- Node 29: [9, 5, 13, 23]

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with neighbors: <0, (7, 21, 12)>
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with neighbors: <1, (20, 13, 26)>, <1, (20, 13, 22)>, <1, (26, 13, 22)>
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with neighbors: <5, (25, 19, 29)>
- Node 9 forms 3-stars with neighbors: <9, (6, 29, 14)>
- Node 13 forms 3-stars with neighbors: <13, (15, 21, 29)>
- Node 14 forms 3-stars with neighbors: <14, (6, 9, 8)>, <14, (6, 9, 3)>, <14, (9, 8, 3)>
- Node 16 forms 3-stars with neighbors: <16, (19, 22, 12)>
- Node 19 forms 3-stars with neighbors: <19, (25, 21, 16)>
- Node 20 forms 3-stars with neighbors: <20, (25, 15, 3)>
- Node 21 forms 3-stars with neighbors: <21, (0, 22, 13)>
- Node 22 forms 3-stars with neighbors: <22, (4, 21, 16)>, <22, (1, 21, 13)>, <22, (21, 13, 19)>, <22, (21, 13, 24)>, <22, (13, 21, 24)>
- Node 23 forms 3-stars with neighbors: <23, (25, 29, 24)>
- Node 25 forms 3-stars with neighbors: <25, (20, 19, 23)>
- Node 29 forms 3-stars with neighbors: <29, (9, 13, 23)>

Total number of 3-stars: 19, so the final number to put inside brackets is: [19].
