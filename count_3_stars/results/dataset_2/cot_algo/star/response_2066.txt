Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 8, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {7, 10, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 11}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 11: {1, 4, 5, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 7, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 6, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {1, 9}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 84

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [84].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 12>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 2, 13>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 10>, <0, 4, 11>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 7>, <1, 10, 2>, <1, 10, 4>, <1, 10, 11>, <1, 11, 12>, <2, 5, 11>, <2, 5, 13>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 13>, <2, 9, 12>, <4, 10, 2>, <4, 10, 11>, <4, 11, 12>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 9, 12>, <7, 3, 10>, <7, 3, 13>, <7, 12, 9>, <9, 12, 13>
