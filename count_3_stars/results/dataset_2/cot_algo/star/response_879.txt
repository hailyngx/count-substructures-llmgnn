Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (10, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 1, 12, 6}
- Node 1: {9, 3, 14, 10, 0, 8}
- Node 2: {7, 13, 12, 11}
- Node 3: {9, 4, 1, 14}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 0, 3}
- Node 5: {13, 12, 11}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 14, 2}
- Node 8: {1, 13, 14, 6, 12}
- Node 9: {4, 3, 1, 0}
- Node 10: {1}
- Node 11: {5, 2, 12}
- Node 12: {5, 8, 13, 2, 0, 11}
- Node 13: {5, 8, 12, 2}
- Node 14: {7, 1, 3, 8}

Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 12, and 14 have 5 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars formed: 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 62

Thus, the final answer is [62]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, 
<0, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<0, (1, 4, 12)>, 
<0, (1, 6, 8)>, 
<0, (1, 12, 13)>, 
<0, (4, 6, 7)>, 
<0, (4, 6, 12)>, 
<0, (4, 12, 13)>, 
<0, (6, 7, 14)>, 
<0, (6, 8, 12)>, 
<1, (3, 9, 14)>, 
<1, (8, 13, 14)>, 
<3, (4, 9, 1)>, 
<4, (7, 6, 0)>, 
<12, (5, 8, 13)>.
