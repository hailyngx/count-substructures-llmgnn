Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {6, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {5, 3, 2, 8, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 0, 4}
- Node 4: {9, 6, 3, 8, 0, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 1, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 8, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 1, 8, 2}
- Node 8: {6, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 2}

Now we need to identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to see if they can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <0, 3, 4>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <1, 8, 4>
- <1, 8, 7>
- <1, 8, 2>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <6, 5, 1>
- <6, 5, 7>
- <6, 8, 7>
- <7, 1, 5>
- <7, 1, 8>
