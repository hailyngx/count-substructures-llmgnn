Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 8) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 8) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 14) (5, 1) (5, 11) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 8, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 2: {9, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {1, 11}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 8, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 9, 10}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 6, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 7, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 4, 13, 14}
- Node 14: {3, 6, 8, 13}

Now, we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 3-stars: <0, (8, 10, 11)>, <0, (8, 10, 12)>, <0, (8, 11, 12)>, <0, (10, 11, 12)>, <0, (8, 11, 14)>
- Node 1, 3-stars: <1, (3, 8, 11)>, <1, (3, 8, 13)>, <1, (3, 11, 13)>, <1, (8, 11, 13)>
- Node 3, 3-stars: <3, (0, 6, 14)>
- Node 6, 3-stars: <6, (8, 12, 14)>
- Node 8, 3-stars: <8, (12, 14, 13)>
- Node 10, 3-stars: <10, (7, 9, 10)>
  
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
