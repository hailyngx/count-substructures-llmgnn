Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {7, 6, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {7, 6, 0}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {8, 9, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 1, 6}
- Node 6: {8, 5, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 1, 9, 0, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 3, 8, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars each. Total = 4 * 10 = 40.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
