Response:
Calculating the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 7, 19, 23, 26}
- Node 1: {10, 15, 27}
- Node 2: {4, 25}
- Node 3: {17, 26}
- Node 4: {2, 18, 21}
- Node 5: {12}
- Node 6: {0, 24, 27}
- Node 7: {0, 9, 14, 16, 20}
- Node 8: {10, 12, 29}
- Node 9: {7, 13, 18, 27}
- Node 10: {1, 8, 14}
- Node 11: {12, 13, 20}
- Node 12: {5, 8, 11, 15, 24}
- Node 13: {9, 11, 19, 27}
- Node 14: {7, 9, 10, 19}
- Node 15: {1, 12, 16, 19}
- Node 16: {7, 15, 21, 23, 24}
- Node 17: {3}
- Node 18: {4, 9}
- Node 19: {0, 13, 14, 15, 20}
- Node 20: {7, 11, 19}
- Node 21: {4, 16, 22}
- Node 22: {21}
- Node 23: {0, 16, 24, 26}
- Node 24: {6, 12, 16, 23}
- Node 25: {2}
- Node 26: {0, 3, 23}
- Node 27: {1, 6, 9, 13}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 24, 26, 27

Applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) for these nodes, we get:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 71 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [71].

Unique 3-stars found: <0, (6, 19, 26)>, <7, (9, 14, 20)>, <9, (13, 18, 27)>, <12, (8, 15, 24)>, <13, (11, 19, 27)>, <14, (9, 10, 19)>, <15, (1, 16, 19)>, <16, (7, 21, 24)>, <19, (13, 14, 20)>, <24, (16, 23, 12)>, <26, (0, 23, 3)>, <27, (6, 13, 9)>.
