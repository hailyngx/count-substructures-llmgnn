Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 18) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 7) (18, 8) (0, 17) (0, 9) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 19) (5, 3) (5, 10) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 15) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 7) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 9) (7, 2) (7, 15) (7, 16) (16, 12) (16, 7) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 12) (19, 1) (19, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 19) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {17, 9}
- Node 1: {17, 4, 6, 19}
- Node 2: {8, 10, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 5}
- Node 4: {8, 12, 1}
- Node 5: {3, 10}
- Node 6: {14, 17, 1, 12}
- Node 7: {2, 15, 16}
- Node 8: {4, 2, 10, 18}
- Node 9: {14, 0, 12, 19}
- Node 10: {8, 2, 5, 13, 15}
- Node 12: {4, 13, 16, 6, 9}
- Node 13: {12, 15, 10}
- Node 14: {17, 6, 9}
- Node 15: {13, 10, 7}
- Node 16: {12, 7}
- Node 17: {14, 6, 1, 0}
- Node 18: {8}
- Node 19: {1, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars found: 
<1, 4, 6, 17>, 
<1, 4, 19>, 
<1, 6, 12, 17>, 
<1, 6, 14>, 
<2, 3, 7>, 
<2, 3, 5>, 
<2, 7, 15>, 
<2, 8, 10>, 
<10, 13, 15>, 
<12, 13, 16>, 
<12, 6, 9, 14>, 
<14, 9, 17>, 
<15, 7, 16>
