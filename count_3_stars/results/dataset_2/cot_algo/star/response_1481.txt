Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 24) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 3) (3, 22) (3, 21) (3, 0) (6, 25) (6, 19) (9, 26) (9, 25) (9, 16) (18, 22) (18, 27) (18, 17) (26, 9) (26, 28) (26, 11) (26, 8) (2, 29) (2, 1) (2, 20) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 23) (29, 24) (29, 11) (23, 22) (23, 29) (23, 28) (7, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 28) (12, 14) (28, 26) (28, 23) (28, 12) (28, 17) (21, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (24, 13) (24, 2) (24, 29) (24, 4) (11, 26) (11, 29) (11, 14) (11, 19) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 8) (5, 25) (5, 16) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 20) (25, 6) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 4) (17, 18) (17, 28) (17, 0) (17, 4) (8, 26) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 25) (16, 9) (16, 5) (27, 18) (4, 24) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 17) (20, 2) (20, 19) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed in this graph:

1. For each node, identify its neighbors:
   - Node 0: {3, 4, 8, 17}
   - Node 1: {2, 4, 7, 10, 19}
   - Node 2: {1, 20, 24, 29}
   - Node 3: {0, 21, 22}
   - Node 4: {0, 1, 17, 24}
   - Node 5: {16, 25}
   - Node 6: {19, 25}
   - Node 7: {1, 8, 12}
   - Node 8: {0, 7, 10, 25, 26}
   - Node 9: {16, 25, 26}
   - Node 10: {1, 8}
   - Node 11: {14, 19, 26, 29}
   - Node 12: {7, 14, 28}
   - Node 13: {24}
   - Node 14: {11, 12}
   - Node 16: {5, 9}
   - Node 17: {0, 4, 18, 28}
   - Node 18: {17, 22, 27}
   - Node 19: {1, 6, 11, 20}
   - Node 20: {2, 19}
   - Node 21: {3}
   - Node 22: {3, 18, 23, 29}
   - Node 23: {22, 28, 29}
   - Node 24: {2, 4, 13, 29}
   - Node 25: {5, 6, 8, 9}
   - Node 26: {8, 9, 11, 28}
   - Node 27: {18}
   - Node 28: {12, 17, 23, 26}
   - Node 29: {2, 11, 22, 23, 24}

2. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
   - Nodes 0, 1, 4, 8, 9, 19, 25, 26, 28, 29.

3. For each of these nodes, calculate the number of 3-stars:
   - Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

4. Sum up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 51\)

Therefore, there are a total of 51 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer to this problem is [51].
