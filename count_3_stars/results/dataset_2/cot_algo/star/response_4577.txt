Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 13) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star structures in this graph can be calculated using the number of neighbors each node has. 

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 11, 12.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 14.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 9, 13.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 10.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 8, 10, 11.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 13.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 5, 13, 14.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 4, 9, 10, 11, 14.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 2, 8, 14.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 8, 12, 13.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 8.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 0, 10, 13.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 10, 12.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 1, 7, 8, 9.

Now, we need to find the number of 3-star structures. 

Node 2, 4, 8, and 13 have 5 neighbors each, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star structures each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-star structures in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 \). 

Thus, the final answer is [40], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 8, 10)>
<8, (4, 9, 11)>
<13, (2, 5, 10)>
