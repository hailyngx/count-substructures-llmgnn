Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are two nodes, 5 and 13, which have 3 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes.

Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 4, 10, and 13. So, it can form 1 3-star.

Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 5, 4, 7, 3, and 8. So, it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2, which we represent as [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <5, (4, 10, 13)> and <13, (5, 4, 7)>.
