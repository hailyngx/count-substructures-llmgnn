Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges based on nodes for easier reference:

Node 0: {9, 6, 7}
Node 1: {5, 9, 6, 4}
Node 2: {4, 7, 8, 3}
Node 3: {5, 4, 7, 2}
Node 4: {5, 9, 3, 1, 2}
Node 5: {9, 1, 4, 3}
Node 6: {9, 1, 0}
Node 7: {9, 0, 3, 2, 8}
Node 8: {7, 2}
Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 1, 7, 0}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0: inom(3, 3) = 1 3-star
Node 1: inom(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
Node 2: inom(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
Node 4: inom(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
Node 5: inom(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
Node 7: inom(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
Node 9: inom(6, 3) = 20 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 53

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [53]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 9, 6)>, <1, (5, 9, 4)>, <1, (9, 6, 4)>, <1, (5, 6, 4)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 3)>, <2, (7, 3, 8)>, <4, (5, 9, 3)>, <4, (5, 9, 1)>, <4, (5, 3, 1)>, <4, (9, 3, 1)>, <4, (5, 3, 2)>, <5, (9, 1, 4)>, <7, (9, 0, 3)>, <7, (9, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 1, 4)>, <9, (5, 4, 7)>, <9, (6, 1, 0)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>
