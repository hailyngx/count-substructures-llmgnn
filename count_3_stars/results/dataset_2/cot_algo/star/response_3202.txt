Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 6}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
