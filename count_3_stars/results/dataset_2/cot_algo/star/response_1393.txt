Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {27, 15, 24, 19}
- Node 4: {7, 12, 16, 3}
- Node 7: {4, 25, 14, 17}
- Node 8: {13, 23, 11}
- Node 13: {8, 26, 5, 11, 23}
- Node 18: {22, 15, 11, 20, 17}
- Node 22: {18, 5, 29}
- Node 23: {8, 13, 17, 9}
- Node 15: {0, 18, 20, 14}
- Node 20: {18, 15, 3, 19}
- Node 5: {13, 22, 3}
- Node 6: {28, 1, 29}
- Node 16: {4, 21, 28, 14}
- Node 29: {22, 21, 6}
- Node 24: {0}
- Node 19: {0, 20}
- Node 25: {7, 2}
- Node 1: {6, 11}
- Node 12: {4, 9}
- Node 9: {23, 12, 17}
- Node 2: {25, 17}
- Node 26: {13}
- Node 11: {8, 13, 18, 1}
- Node 21: {16, 29}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 47

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [47].
