Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 4) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 15) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 9) (12, 2) (12, 7) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 15) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 16) (19, 2) (19, 11) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 13) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 6) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 14) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 15) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 15) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 4) (13, 18) (13, 0) (5, 4) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 14) (15, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 13, 16}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 2: {12, 14, 17, 18, 19}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 17}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 9, 15}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {10, 14, 16}
- Node 7: {9, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {1, 16, 17}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 10}
- Node 10: {6, 9, 17}
- Node 11: {7, 15, 19}
- Node 12: {2, 7}
- Node 13: {0, 18}
- Node 14: {2, 6, 15}
- Node 15: {4, 11, 14, 17}
- Node 16: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 17: {2, 3, 8, 10, 15}
- Node 18: {2, 13}
- Node 19: {2, 11}

Next, we'll analyze the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1, 3 stars
- Node 2, 3 stars
- Node 4, 1 star
- Node 6, 1 star
- Node 7, 1 star
- Node 8, 1 star
- Node 9, 1 star
- Node 10, 1 star
- Node 11, 1 star
- Node 12, 1 star
- Node 13, 1 star
- Node 14, 1 star
- Node 15, 1 star
- Node 16, 3 stars
- Node 17, 1 star
- Node 18, 1 star
- Node 19, 1 star

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [7]. The unique 3-stars found are: 

<1, (0, 8, 16)>, <1, (3, 8, 17)>, <1, (8, 16, 17)>, <3, (17, 15, 4)>, <2, (14, 15, 17)>, <2, (15, 17, 4)>, <2, (17, 18, 19)>
