Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 16) (27, 24) (27, 18) (27, 9) (2, 29) (2, 26) (2, 7) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 17) (29, 22) (29, 24) (8, 20) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 26) (10, 7) (10, 9) (17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 23) (17, 22) (28, 29) (5, 23) (19, 1) (19, 20) (3, 17) (3, 24) (3, 16) (21, 20) (21, 12) (14, 26) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 9) (26, 2) (26, 10) (26, 14) (26, 6) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (12, 13) (12, 21) (12, 4) (11, 13) (11, 24) (11, 25) (24, 27) (24, 29) (24, 3) (24, 11) (23, 17) (23, 5) (23, 14) (1, 19) (1, 4) (1, 25) (1, 22) (22, 29) (22, 17) (22, 1) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 6) (25, 11) (25, 1) (25, 16) (20, 8) (20, 19) (20, 21) (20, 9) (20, 16) (18, 27) (18, 14) (18, 0) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 9) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 25) (16, 20) (6, 26) (6, 0) (9, 27) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 20) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

1: 19, 4, 25, 22
2: 29, 26, 7
3: 17, 24, 16
4: 12, 0, 1, 19, 25
5: 23
6: 26, 0
7: 2, 10, 9
8: 20
9: 27, 10, 14, 20, 7
10: 26, 7, 9
11: 13, 24, 25
12: 13, 21, 4
13: 12, 11
14: 26, 18, 23, 9
15: 16
16: 15, 3, 25, 20
17: 29, 3, 23, 22
18: 27, 14, 0
19: 1, 4, 20
20: 8, 19, 21, 9, 16
21: 20, 12
22: 29, 17, 1
23: 5, 17, 14
24: 27, 29, 3, 11
25: 11, 1, 16
26: 2, 10, 14, 6
27: 24, 18, 9
28: 29
29: 2, 29, 17, 22, 24

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

Nodes 4, 9, 14, 16, 20, and 24 have 5 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.
Nodes 2, 7, 10, 17, 18, 25, and 26 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they can each form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 6 (from nodes with 5 or more neighbors) + 7 (from nodes with exactly 3 neighbors) = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [13].

Unique 3-stars found:
<4, (12, 19, 25)>
<9, (10, 14, 20)>
<14, (26, 18, 23)>
<16, (15, 3, 25)>
<20, (8, 19, 21)>
<24, (27, 29, 3)>
<2, (29, 26, 7)>
<7, (2, 10, 9)>
<10, (26, 7, 9)>
<17, (29, 3, 23)>
<18, (27, 14, 0)>
<25, (11, 1, 16)>
<26, (2, 10, 14)>
