Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (8, 5) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 10) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {9, 7, 14, 12}
Node 1: {9, 14, 2, 6}
Node 2: {4, 1, 3}
Node 3: {5, 8, 10, 14, 2, 6}
Node 4: {5, 7, 13, 6, 2}
Node 5: {9, 8, 4, 3}
Node 6: {4, 13, 10, 1, 3, 12}
Node 7: {4, 0, 14}
Node 8: {5, 3}
Node 9: {5, 11, 1, 0, 12}
Node 10: {11, 3, 6, 12}
Node 11: {9, 13, 10}
Node 12: {9, 10, 0, 6}
Node 13: {4, 11, 6}
Node 14: {7, 0, 3, 1}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star graphs:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<0, (9, 7, 14)>, <0, (9, 7, 12)>, <0, (9, 14, 12)>, <0, (7, 14, 12)>

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<1, (9, 14, 2)>, <1, (9, 14, 6)>, <1, (9, 2, 6)>, <1, (14, 2, 6)>

Node 2: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.

Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<4, (5, 7, 13)>, <4, (5, 7, 6)>, <4, (5, 13, 6)>, <4, (7, 13, 6)>, <4, (7, 2, 6)>, <4, (13, 2, 6)>, <4, (7, 13, 2)>, <4, (5, 2, 6)>, <4, (5, 13, 2)>, <4, (13, 2, 6)>

Node 5: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.

Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
<6, (4, 13, 10)>, <6, (4, 13, 1)>, <6, (4, 13, 3)>, <6, (4, 10, 1)>, <6, (4, 10, 3)>, <6, (4, 1, 3)>, <6, (13, 10, 1)>, <6, (13, 10, 3)>, <6, (13, 1, 3)>, <6, (10, 1, 3)>, <6, (4, 13, 12)>, <6, (4, 1, 12)>, <6, (4, 3, 12)>, <6, (13, 1, 12)>, <6, (13, 3, 12)>, <6, (1, 3, 12)>, <6, (10, 1, 12)>, <6, (10, 3, 12)>, <6, (1, 3, 12)>, <6, (13, 10, 12)>

Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<7, (4, 0, 14)>

Node 8: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.

Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<11, (9, 13, 10)>

Node 13: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.

Node 14: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 40

Therefore, the final answer is [40].
