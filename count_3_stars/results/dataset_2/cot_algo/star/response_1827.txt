Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors -> [inom{6}{3} = 20]
- Node 3: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3} = 10]
- Node 4: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 6: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3} = 10]

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 44

Unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 3, 7)>
2. <0, (1, 3, 6)>
3. <0, (1, 3, 2)>
4. <0, (1, 6, 7)>
5. <0, (3, 4, 6)>
6. <0, (3, 6, 7)>
7. <0, (4, 6, 7)>
8. <3, (4, 6, 8)>
