Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 16) (18, 5) (18, 17) (18, 1) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 15) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 0) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 19) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 14) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 9) (12, 0) (11, 19) (14, 1) (14, 10) (3, 9) (16, 2) (16, 17) (16, 9) (17, 18) (17, 16) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 3) (9, 16) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 12) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 8, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 14, 15, 18}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 8, 16}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 6, 18}
- Node 6: {5, 13, 15}
- Node 7: {4, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 8, 10}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 9, 16, 19}
- Node 10: {7, 8, 10, 14, 15}
- Node 11: {19}
- Node 12: {0}
- Node 13: {4, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 14: {1, 10}
- Node 15: {1, 6, 10, 15, 19}
- Node 16: {2, 9, 16, 17}
- Node 17: {16, 18}
- Node 18: {1, 5, 17}
- Node 19: {9, 11, 15}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: 
  - Total neighbors = 4, so number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4

- Node 1: 
  - Total neighbors = 5, so number of 3-stars = C(5, 3) = 10

- Node 2: 
  - Total neighbors = 4, so number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4

- Node 5: 
  - Total neighbors = 5, so number of 3-stars = C(5, 3) = 10

- Node 6: 
  - Total neighbors = 3, so number of 3-stars = 1

- Node 7: 
  - Total neighbors = 4, so number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4

- Node 8: 
  - Total neighbors = 4, so number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4

- Node 9: 
  - Total neighbors = 5, so number of 3-stars = C(5, 3) = 10

- Node 10: 
  - Total neighbors = 5, so number of 3-stars = C(5, 3) = 10

- Node 13: 
  - Total neighbors = 4, so number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4

- Node 15: 
  - Total neighbors = 5, so number of 3-stars = C(5, 3) = 10

- Node 16: 
  - Total neighbors = 4, so number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4

- Node 18: 
  - Total neighbors = 3, so number of 3-stars = 1

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 72

Therefore, the final answer is [72]. Below are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 14, 15)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (5, 13, 15)>
<7, (4, 10, 13)>
<8, (0, 2, 10)>
<9, (4, 16, 19)>
<10, (7, 14, 15)>
<13, (4, 6, 7)>
<15, (1, 10, 19)>
<16, (2, 9, 17)>
<18, (1, 5, 17)>
