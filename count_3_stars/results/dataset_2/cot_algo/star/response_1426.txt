Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 21) (3, 12) (3, 18) (15, 22) (15, 25) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 29) (8, 6) (8, 23) (8, 21) (8, 18) (23, 8) (23, 10) (23, 0) (23, 12) (4, 13) (4, 28) (4, 29) (1, 26) (1, 25) (1, 7) (26, 1) (26, 27) (26, 12) (28, 4) (28, 27) (28, 5) (29, 9) (29, 4) (29, 19) (29, 12) (0, 23) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (21, 3) (21, 8) (21, 13) (21, 20) (13, 4) (13, 21) (13, 17) (17, 13) (17, 25) (2, 22) (22, 15) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 27) (16, 0) (16, 10) (16, 20) (25, 15) (25, 1) (25, 17) (11, 14) (11, 27) (11, 12) (14, 22) (14, 11) (14, 18) (18, 3) (18, 8) (18, 14) (20, 21) (20, 16) (19, 29) (19, 5) (19, 10) (27, 26) (27, 28) (27, 22) (27, 11) (10, 6) (10, 23) (10, 16) (10, 19) (5, 28) (5, 19) (12, 3) (12, 23) (12, 26) (12, 29) (12, 11) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 16, 23}
- Node 1: {7, 25, 26}
- Node 2: {14, 22}
- Node 3: {12, 18, 21}
- Node 4: {13, 28, 29}
- Node 5: {19, 28}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 8: {6, 18, 21, 23}
- Node 9: {6, 29}
- Node 10: {6, 16, 19, 23}
- Node 11: {12, 14, 27}
- Node 12: {3, 11, 23, 26, 29}
- Node 13: {4, 17, 21}
- Node 14: {2, 11, 18, 22}
- Node 15: {22, 25}
- Node 16: {0, 10, 20}
- Node 17: {13, 25}
- Node 18: {8, 14}
- Node 19: {5, 10, 29}
- Node 20: {16, 21}
- Node 21: {3, 8, 13, 20}
- Node 22: {2, 14, 15, 27}
- Node 23: {8, 10, 12}
- Node 25: {1, 15, 17}
- Node 26: {1, 12, 27}
- Node 27: {11, 14, 22, 26, 28}
- Node 28: {4, 5, 27}
- Node 29: {4, 9, 12, 19}

Next, let's identify any nodes that have at least three neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, 7, 8, 9>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, 6, 21, 23>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, 3, 11, 23>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, 11, 18, 22>
- Node 21 forms a 3-star: <21, 3, 13, 20>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star: <22, 2, 15, 27>
- Node 23 forms a 3-star: <23, 8, 10, 12>
- Node 26 forms a 3-star: <26, 1, 12, 27>
- Node 27 forms a 3-star: <27, 11, 22, 28>
- Node 29 forms a 3-star: <29, 4, 9, 12>

The total number of 3-stars is 9, so the final answer is [9].
