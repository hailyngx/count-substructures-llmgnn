Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in an adjacency list format for easier visualization:

Node 0: (3)
Node 1: (5, 9, 7, 8, 2)
Node 2: (5, 8, 6, 1)
Node 3: (4, 7, 8, 0)
Node 4: (5, 8, 6, 3)
Node 5: (9, 6, 2, 1, 4)
Node 6: (5, 4, 8, 2)
Node 7: (9, 3, 8, 1)
Node 8: (4, 7, 2, 6, 3, 1)
Node 9: (5, 1, 7, 4)

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
For Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
For Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
For Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
For Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
For Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
For Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20
For Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (5, 2, 8)>
<1, (5, 4, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (7, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
