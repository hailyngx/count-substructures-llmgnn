Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (22, 13) (22, 16) (22, 24) (5, 25) (5, 24) (5, 20) (9, 6) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 2) (6, 20) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 28) (17, 8) (17, 21) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 21) (20, 5) (20, 6) (20, 0) (20, 27) (8, 17) (8, 27) (23, 10) (23, 25) (23, 1) (23, 19) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 29) (28, 6) (28, 17) (28, 18) (26, 16) (26, 27) (26, 4) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 14) (11, 1) (11, 4) (7, 25) (25, 5) (25, 23) (25, 7) (25, 21) (19, 23) (19, 16) (19, 12) (16, 13) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 19) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 24) (12, 19) (12, 2) (1, 23) (1, 11) (1, 24) (29, 14) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 25) (21, 15) (21, 4) (15, 21) (24, 22) (24, 5) (24, 2) (24, 1) (24, 27) (27, 20) (27, 8) (27, 26) (27, 24) (27, 18) (18, 28) (18, 27) (4, 26) (4, 11) (4, 21) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {20, 14}
- Node 1: {24, 11, 23}
- Node 2: {6, 24, 12}
- Node 3: {17, 14, 10}
- Node 4: {26, 11, 21}
- Node 5: {25, 24, 20}
- Node 6: {9, 28, 2, 20}
- Node 7: {25}
- Node 8: {17, 27}
- Node 9: {6}
- Node 10: {17, 3, 23}
- Node 11: {1, 4}
- Node 12: {19, 2}
- Node 13: {22}
- Node 14: {0, 29, 3}
- Node 15: {21}
- Node 16: {13, 22, 19}
- Node 17: {10, 8, 3, 28, 21}
- Node 18: {28, 27}
- Node 19: {16, 12, 23}
- Node 20: {5, 6, 0, 27}
- Node 21: {17, 25, 0, 15, 4}
- Node 22: {13, 16, 24}
- Node 23: {10, 25, 1, 19}
- Node 24: {22, 5, 2, 1, 27}
- Node 25: {5, 23, 7, 21}
- Node 26: {16, 27, 4}
- Node 27: {20, 8, 26, 24, 18}
- Node 28: {6, 17, 18}
- Node 29: {14}

Now let's identify the 3-stars based on the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom(2, 3) = 1
- Node 1: inom(3, 3) = 1
- Node 2: inom(2, 3) = 1
- Node 3: inom(3, 3) = 1
- Node 4: inom(3, 3) = 1
- Node 5: inom(3, 3) = 1
- Node 6: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 16: inom(3, 3) = 1
- Node 17: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 19: inom(3, 3) = 1
- Node 20: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 21: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 23: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 24: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 25: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 26: inom(3, 3) = 1
- Node 27: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 28: inom(3, 3) = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [59].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 20, 14>
- <1, 24, 23>
- <2, 24, 12>
- <3, 17, 14>
- <4, 26, 21>
- <5, 24, 20>
- <6, 28, 2>
- <16, 22, 24>
- <17, 8, 21>
- <19, 12, 23>
- <20, 6, 27>
- <21, 25, 15>
- <23, 25, 1>
- <24, 27, 5>
- <25, 23, 7>
- <26, 27, 4>
- <28, 17, 18>
