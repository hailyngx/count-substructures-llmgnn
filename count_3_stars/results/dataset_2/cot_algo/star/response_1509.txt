Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 4) (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 13) (9, 19) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 6) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 19) (2, 19) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 6) (7, 1) (7, 14) (7, 17) (12, 14) (12, 1) (4, 15) (4, 18) (4, 14) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 17) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 1) (0, 3) (0, 19) (0, 6) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 0) (14, 16) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 4) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 3, 6, 19
Node 1: 7, 8, 12, 17
Node 2: 19
Node 3: 0, 10
Node 4: 15, 14, 18
Node 5: 8, 9
Node 6: 0, 10, 16, 18
Node 7: 1, 14, 17
Node 8: 1, 5, 13
Node 9: 5, 13, 16, 19
Node 10: 3, 6, 15
Node 11: 17
Node 12: 1, 14
Node 13: 8, 9, 19
Node 14: 4, 6, 7, 12, 16, 18
Node 15: 4, 10, 19
Node 16: 6, 9, 14
Node 17: 1, 7, 11
Node 18: 4, 6, 14
Node 19: 0, 9, 13, 15, 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 4: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 14: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
Node 19: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [59].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 3, 6, 19>
<1, 7, 14, 17>
<4, 14, 16, 18>
<6, 9, 13, 16>
<19, 13, 15, 9>
