Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 28) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 12) (22, 25) (3, 5) (15, 23) (15, 7) (15, 14) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 29) (4, 26) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 6) (28, 13) (28, 29) (28, 10) (28, 23) (29, 4) (29, 28) (29, 10) (0, 20) (0, 18) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 23) (20, 11) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 25) (18, 0) (18, 2) (18, 27) (18, 24) (18, 17) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (26, 4) (26, 20) (26, 14) (9, 22) (9, 1) (9, 27) (17, 18) (17, 6) (27, 18) (27, 9) (27, 19) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 2) (19, 27) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 6) (16, 24) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 19) (14, 15) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 19) (12, 22) (12, 10) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 23) (23, 15) (23, 28) (23, 20) (23, 24) (7, 15) (7, 1) (7, 5) (25, 22) (25, 2) (10, 28) (10, 29) (10, 2) (10, 12) (11, 20) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges by each node:

Node 0: {20, 18}
Node 1: {6, 9, 7}
Node 2: {4, 18, 19, 25, 10}
Node 3: {5}
Node 4: {8, 2, 29, 26}
Node 5: {3, 19, 7}
Node 6: {8, 1, 17, 19}
Node 7: {15, 1, 5}
Node 8: {4, 14, 6}
Node 9: {22, 1, 27}
Node 10: {28, 29, 2, 12}
Node 11: {20}
Node 12: {22, 10}
Node 13: {22, 28}
Node 14: {15, 8, 26, 19}
Node 15: {23, 7, 14}
Node 16: {24}
Node 17: {6, 18}
Node 18: {0, 2, 27, 24, 17}
Node 19: {2, 5, 14, 6, 27}
Node 20: {0, 26, 23, 11}
Node 22: {13, 9, 12, 25}
Node 23: {15, 28, 20, 24}
Node 24: {18, 16, 23}
Node 25: {22, 2}
Node 26: {4, 20, 14}
Node 27: {18, 9, 19}
Node 28: {13, 22, 29, 23, 10}
Node 29: {4, 28, 10}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Node 2:} \; \binom{5}{3} &= 10 \\
\text{Node 4:} \; \binom{4}{3} &= 4 \\
\text{Node 6:} \; \binom{4}{3} &= 4 \\
\text{Node 8:} \; \binom{3}{3} &= 1 \\
\text{Node 10:} \; \binom{4}{3} &= 4 \\
\text{Node 14:} \; \binom{5}{3} &= 10 \\
\text{Node 18:} \; \binom{5}{3} &= 10 \\
\text{Node 19:} \; \binom{5}{3} &= 10 \\
\text{Node 20:} \; \binom{4}{3} &= 4 \\
\text{Node 22:} \; \binom{4}{3} &= 4 \\
\text{Node 23:} \; \binom{4}{3} &= 4 \\
\text{Node 26:} \; \binom{3}{3} &= 1 \\
\text{Node 27:} \; \binom{4}{3} &= 4 \\
\text{Node 28:} \; \binom{5}{3} &= 10 \\
\text{Node 29:} \; \binom{3}{3} &= 1 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Adding up the 3-stars from each node: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 77 \)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [77].
