Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 16) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (17, 1) (17, 4) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 18) (7, 5) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 19) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 14) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 4) (13, 9) (18, 6) (19, 12) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 1) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 16) (16, 15) (16, 4) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 10, 4}
- Node 1: {17, 14, 4}
- Node 2: {9, 8, 14}
- Node 3: {15, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 17, 1, 0, 16}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 11, 7}
- Node 6: {15, 5, 18}
- Node 7: {5, 12}
- Node 8: {15, 11, 12, 2, 14}
- Node 9: {5, 0, 2, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 12}
- Node 11: {5, 9, 8}
- Node 12: {10, 7, 14, 8, 19}
- Node 13: {9}
- Node 14: {12, 2, 8, 1}
- Node 15: {3, 6, 8, 16}
- Node 16: {15, 4}
- Node 17: {1, 4}
- Node 18: {6}
- Node 19: {12}

Next, we apply the combinatorial calculation to nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [1 3-star] - <0, 9, 10>, <0, 4, 16>, <0, 4, 1>
- Node 1: [1 3-star] - <1, 17, 4>
- Node 2: [1 3-star] - <2, 9, 8>, <2, 8, 14>
- Node 4: [1 3-star] - <4, 3, 17>
- Node 5: [1 3-star] - <5, 9, 11>
- Node 6: [1 3-star] - <6, 15, 16>
- Node 8: [1 3-star] - <8, 15, 16>
- Node 9: [1 3-star] - <9, 0, 4>
- Node 11: [1 3-star] - <11, 5, 7>
- Node 12: [1 3-star] - <12, 7, 19>
- Node 15: [1 3-star] - <15, 3, 16>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
