Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 7) (10, 13) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (20, 4) (21, 16) (21, 26) (21, 11) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 5) (26, 22) (26, 21) (26, 7) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 12) (7, 13) (7, 22) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 26) (3, 28) (3, 23) (8, 19) (9, 17) (9, 23) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 15) (27, 25) (27, 29) (27, 23) (16, 21) (16, 14) (5, 28) (5, 1) (5, 14) (29, 25) (29, 27) (29, 6) (29, 4) (29, 18) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 29) (14, 28) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 24) (15, 25) (15, 23) (15, 11) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 19) (23, 3) (23, 9) (23, 27) (23, 15) (2, 24) (4, 20) (4, 19) (4, 29) (4, 24) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 18) (11, 21) (11, 15) (24, 14) (24, 2) (24, 4) (18, 29) (18, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 18}
- Node 2: {24}
- Node 3: {23, 28}
- Node 4: {19, 20, 24, 29}
- Node 5: {1, 14, 28}
- Node 6: {0, 10, 29}
- Node 7: {0, 10, 13, 22, 26}
- Node 8: {19}
- Node 9: {17, 23}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 12, 13, 17}
- Node 11: {15, 21}
- Node 12: {10, 17, 19}
- Node 13: {0, 7, 10, 22}
- Node 14: {5, 16, 24, 28}
- Node 15: {11, 23, 25}
- Node 16: {14, 21}
- Node 17: {9, 10, 12}
- Node 18: {1, 29}
- Node 19: {4, 8, 12}
- Node 20: {4}
- Node 21: {11, 16, 26}
- Node 22: {7, 13, 26}
- Node 23: {3, 9, 15, 27}
- Node 24: {2, 4, 14}
- Node 25: {15, 27, 29}
- Node 26: {7, 21, 22}
- Node 27: {23, 25, 29}
- Node 28: {3, 5, 14}
- Node 29: {4, 6, 18, 25, 27}

Now, we'll identify the nodes that can form at least one 3-star:

- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 1: Not enough neighbors
- Node 2: Not enough neighbors
- Node 3: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 5: Not enough neighbors
- Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 8: Not enough neighbors
- Node 9: Not enough neighbors
- Node 10: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 11: Not enough neighbors
- Node 12: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 13: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 14: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 15: Not enough neighbors
- Node 16: Not enough neighbors
- Node 17: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 18: Not enough neighbors
- Node 19: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 20: Not enough neighbors
- Node 21: Not enough neighbors
- Node 22: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 23: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 24: Not enough neighbors
- Node 25: Not enough neighbors
- Node 26: Not enough neighbors
- Node 27: Not enough neighbors
- Node 28: Not enough neighbors
- Node 29: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Total number of 3-stars = \(4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 35\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 13>
<0, 4, 19>
<6, 10, 29>
<7, 10, 13>
<7, 10, 22>
<7, 13, 22>
<10, 12, 17>
<13, 22, 26>
