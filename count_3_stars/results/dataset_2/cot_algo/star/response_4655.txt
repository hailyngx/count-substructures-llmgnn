Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 13) (16, 12) (16, 14) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 14) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 18) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 15) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 18) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (10, 19) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 6) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 14) (15, 17) (15, 14) (6, 12) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 15) (14, 2) (13, 11) (13, 7) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 8) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 14) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 17) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 7, 2}
- Node 1: {14, 19, 8}
- Node 2: {7, 17, 0, 14}
- Node 3: {9, 5, 18}
- Node 4: {7, 19, 5, 0}
- Node 5: {4, 3, 17}
- Node 6: {12}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 13, 18, 2}
- Node 8: {1, 17, 18}
- Node 9: {11, 3, 12}
- Node 10: {19}
- Node 11: {9, 13}
- Node 12: {16, 9, 6}
- Node 13: {11, 7}
- Node 14: {16, 1, 19, 15, 2}
- Node 15: {17, 14}
- Node 16: {12, 14}
- Node 17: {5, 8, 2, 15}
- Node 18: {7, 3, 8}
- Node 19: {1, 14, 10, 4}

Now, let's look for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 3-stars: <0, (4, 7, 2)>
- Node 1, 3-stars: <1, (14, 19, 8)>
- Node 2, 3-stars: <2, (7, 17, 0)>, <2, (7, 17, 14)>
- Node 4, 3-stars: <4, (7, 19, 5)>, <4, (7, 19, 0)>, <4, (7, 5, 0)>
- Node 7, 3-stars: <7, (4, 0, 2)>, <7, (4, 13, 18)>, <7, (0, 13, 18)>
- Node 8, 3-stars: <8, (1, 19, 14)>, <8, (1, 19, 15)>, <8, (1, 19, 2)>, <8, (17, 18, 8)>, <8, (17, 18, 2)>
- Node 9, 3-stars: <9, (11, 3, 12)>, <9, (11, 3, 9)>, <9, (11, 12, 9)>, <9, (3, 12, 9)>
- Node 12, 3-stars: <12, (16, 14, 2)>, <12, (16, 14, 15)>
- Node 14, 3-stars: <14, (16, 1, 19)>, <14, (16, 1, 15)>, <14, (16, 1, 2)>, <14, (16, 19, 15)>, <14, (16, 19, 2)>, <14, (16, 15, 2)>
- Node 17, 3-stars: <17, (5, 8, 2)>, <17, (5, 8, 15)>, <17, (5, 8, 14)>, <17, (8, 15, 14)>
- Node 18, 3-stars: <18, (7, 3, 8)>, <18, (7, 3, 17)>, <18, (7, 8, 17)>, <18, (3, 8, 17)>
- Node 19, 3-stars: <19, (14, 1, 8)>, <19, (14, 1, 15)>, <19, (14, 1, 2)>, <19, (14, 8, 15)>, <19, (14, 8, 2)>, <19, (14, 15, 2)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars listed above, we have a total of [27] 3-stars in this graph.
