Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 25) (26, 9) (26, 21) (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 6) (16, 14) (6, 16) (6, 13) (14, 16) (14, 17) (14, 5) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 25) (17, 4) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 24) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 28) (7, 12) (7, 23) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 20) (12, 15) (21, 26) (21, 14) (21, 28) (28, 18) (28, 21) (28, 19) (28, 23) (22, 5) (22, 29) (22, 8) (24, 11) (24, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 0) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 29) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 3) (25, 9) (25, 17) (25, 8) (25, 29) (25, 0) (5, 14) (5, 22) (5, 23) (5, 29) (23, 7) (23, 28) (23, 5) (23, 20) (19, 11) (19, 28) (19, 13) (0, 1) (0, 25) (20, 12) (20, 23) (29, 22) (29, 15) (29, 25) (29, 5) (8, 22) (8, 3) (8, 25) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 25
- Node 1: 0, 13, 15
- Node 2: 10, 16, 18
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 12, 17
- Node 5: 14, 22, 23, 29
- Node 6: 13, 16
- Node 7: 12, 23
- Node 8: 3, 8, 22, 25
- Node 9: 25, 26
- Node 10: 2, 17, 24
- Node 11: 16, 19, 24
- Node 12: 4, 7, 15, 20
- Node 13: 1, 6, 19
- Node 14: 5, 16, 17, 21
- Node 15: 1, 12, 18, 29
- Node 16: 2, 6, 11, 14
- Node 17: 4, 10, 14, 25
- Node 18: 2, 15, 28
- Node 19: 11, 13, 28
- Node 20: 12, 23
- Node 21: 14, 26, 28
- Node 22: 5, 8, 29
- Node 23: 5, 7, 20, 28
- Node 24: 10, 11
- Node 25: 0, 8, 9, 17, 29
- Node 26: 9, 21
- Node 28: 18, 21, 23, 19
- Node 29: 5, 15, 22, 25

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (14, 22, 23)>.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (22, 25, 29)>.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star: <25, (8, 29, 5)>.
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star.

Adding them up, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [16].
