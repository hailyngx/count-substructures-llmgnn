Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 7) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 7, 12, 14
- Node 1: 2, 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6, 11, 14
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 11
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 8, 10
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 7, 12, 14
- Node 7: 0, 6, 13
- Node 8: 1, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14
- Node 9: 11, 12
- Node 10: 5, 8, 10, 12, 14
- Node 11: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 12: 0, 6, 9, 10
- Node 13: 7
- Node 14: 0, 2, 6, 8, 10

Now, we can identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each:
- Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 2: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 88.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [88].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 14>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 11>
<0, 6, 12>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 14>, <2, 1, 5>
<2, 1, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 10>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 5, 14>
<4, 6, 0>, <4, 6, 12>, <4, 6, 14>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 2>
<5, 8, 10>, <5, 8, 11>, <5, 8, 1>, <5, 8, 14>, <6, 7, 13>
<8, 11, 9>, <8, 11, 4>, <8, 11, 2>, <8, 10, 12>, <8, 10, 14>
