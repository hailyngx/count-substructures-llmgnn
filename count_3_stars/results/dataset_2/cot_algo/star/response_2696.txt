Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, we will find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {4, 5, 6, 7}
Node 1 neighbors: {2, 3, 5, 6}
Node 2 neighbors: {1, 3, 5, 8}
Node 3 neighbors: {1, 2, 4, 9}
Node 4 neighbors: {0, 3, 7, 8}
Node 5 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
Node 6 neighbors: {0, 1, 5, 9}
Node 7 neighbors: {0, 4, 9}
Node 8 neighbors: {2, 4, 5}
Node 9 neighbors: {3, 5, 6, 7}

Now, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<(5, 6, 9), (5, 8, 9), (5, 6, 8), (5, 1, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
