Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 26) (15, 20) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 18) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 20) (20, 15) (20, 8) (20, 14) (17, 29) (17, 6) (17, 24) (17, 27) (29, 17) (29, 5) (29, 18) (13, 26) (13, 28) (13, 19) (26, 3) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 2) (28, 13) (28, 26) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 12) (25, 5) (18, 7) (18, 29) (18, 26) (18, 10) (18, 16) (0, 11) (0, 16) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 5) (2, 15) (2, 26) (2, 1) (2, 21) (22, 27) (22, 6) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 23) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 22) (6, 27) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (24, 17) (24, 21) (21, 2) (21, 24) (21, 27) (21, 23) (21, 14) (27, 17) (27, 22) (27, 6) (27, 21) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 19) (5, 29) (5, 25) (5, 16) (23, 12) (23, 21) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 10) (14, 20) (14, 21) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 11, 16  
Node 1: 2, 4, 7, 9  
Node 2: 1, 15, 21, 26  
Node 3: 6, 26  
Node 4: 1, 7, 8, 9, 11  
Node 5: 16, 25, 29  
Node 6: 3, 17, 22, 27  
Node 7: 1, 4, 18  
Node 8: 4, 10, 20  
Node 9: 1, 4  
Node 10: 8, 18, 19  
Node 11: 0, 4, 12  
Node 12: 11, 19, 23  
Node 13: 19, 26, 28  
Node 14: 20, 21  
Node 15: 2, 20  
Node 16: 0, 5  
Node 17: 6, 24, 27, 29  
Node 18: 7, 10, 16, 26, 29  
Node 19: 10, 12, 13  
Node 20: 8, 14, 15  
Node 21: 2, 14, 21, 23, 24  
Node 22: 6, 27  
Node 23: 12, 21  
Node 24: 17, 21  
Node 25: 5  
Node 26: 2, 13, 18, 28  
Node 27: 6, 21, 22  
Node 28: 13, 26  
Node 29: 5, 17, 18  

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 1: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars  
Node 2: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars  
Node 4: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars  
Node 7: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star  
Node 8: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star  
Node 10: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star  
Node 11: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star  
Node 12: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star  
Node 13: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star  
Node 14: 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star  
Node 15: 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star   
Node 16: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star  
Node 17: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars  
Node 18: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars  
Node 19: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star  
Node 20: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star  
Node 21: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars  
Node 26: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars  
Node 27: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars  
Node 28: 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star  
Node 29: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star  

Total number of 3-stars: 50  
Unique 3-stars:
<1, 2, 4, 7>, <1, 2, 4, 9>, <1, 2, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 7, 9>,  
<4, 7, 11, 12>, <7, 17, 18, 29>, <18, 19, 26, 29>, <2, 16, 21, 25>,  
<16, 18, 21, 29>, <10, 18, 19, 21>
