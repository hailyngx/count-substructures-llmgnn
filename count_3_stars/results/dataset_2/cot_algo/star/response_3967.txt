Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 17) (15, 27) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 3) (0, 27) (0, 24) (0, 12) (0, 23) (18, 7) (18, 29) (18, 13) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 29) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 25) (3, 14) (20, 25) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 16) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 21) (21, 7) (21, 13) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) (28, 11) (28, 23) (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 8) (1, 5) (1, 19) (17, 26) (17, 2) (24, 26) (24, 0) (24, 4) (29, 27) (29, 18) (29, 22) (13, 15) (13, 18) (13, 21) (13, 12) (8, 11) (8, 19) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 6) (4, 22) (4, 12) (4, 24) (4, 14) (5, 22) (5, 1) (5, 16) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 17) (2, 14) (10, 22) (10, 16) (6, 19) (6, 23) (6, 16) (23, 9) (23, 0) (23, 28) (23, 6) (16, 25) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 12, 24, 27, 23
- Node 1 has neighbors: 5, 19
- Node 2 has neighbors: 14, 17
- Node 3 has neighbors: 14, 15, 25, 27
- Node 4 has neighbors: 12, 14, 22, 24
- Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 16, 22
- Node 6 has neighbors: 16, 19, 23
- Node 7 has neighbors: 13, 15, 18, 21
- Node 8 has neighbors: 11, 19
- Node 9 has neighbors: 23, 26
- Node 10 has neighbors: 16, 22
- Node 11 has neighbors: 8, 19, 28
- Node 12 has neighbors: 0, 4, 13
- Node 13 has neighbors: 12, 15, 18, 21
- Node 14 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4
- Node 15 has neighbors: 3, 7, 13, 27
- Node 16 has neighbors: 5, 6, 10, 25
- Node 17 has neighbors: 2, 26
- Node 18 has neighbors: 7, 13, 21, 29
- Node 19 has neighbors: 1, 6, 8, 11
- Node 20 has neighbors: 25
- Node 21 has neighbors: 7, 13
- Node 22 has neighbors: 4, 5, 10, 29
- Node 23 has neighbors: 0, 6, 9, 28
- Node 24 has neighbors: 0, 4, 26
- Node 25 has neighbors: 3, 16, 20
- Node 26 has neighbors: 9, 17, 24
- Node 27 has neighbors: 0, 3, 15, 29
- Node 28 has neighbors: 11, 23
- Node 29 has neighbors: 18, 22, 27

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 3 forms the 3-star: <3, (14, 4, 2)>
- Node 15 forms the 3-star: <15, (7, 13, 18)>
- Node 16 forms the 3-star: <16, (5, 10, 6)>

There are a total of 3 3-stars identified, so the final answer is [3].
