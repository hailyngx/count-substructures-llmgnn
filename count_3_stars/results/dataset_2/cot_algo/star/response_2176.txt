Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 7) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 13) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 14) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 3) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {1, 2, 5, 10}
Node 1 neighbors: {0, 6, 11, 12, 14}
Node 2 neighbors: {0, 5, 6, 9}
Node 3 neighbors: {5, 7, 13, 14}
Node 4 neighbors: {9, 12, 13, 14}
Node 5 neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 7, 9, 14}
Node 6 neighbors: {1, 2, 11}
Node 7 neighbors: {3, 5, 9, 10}
Node 8 neighbors: {10, 14}
Node 9 neighbors: {2, 4, 5, 7}
Node 10 neighbors: {0, 7, 8, 12}
Node 11 neighbors: {1, 6, 13}
Node 12 neighbors: {1, 4, 10, 13}
Node 13 neighbors: {3, 4, 11, 12}
Node 14 neighbors: {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}

Nodes with more than 2 neighbors:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes 1, 4, 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each

Total number of 3-stars = \( 7 \times 4 + 3 \times 10 = 28 + 30 = 58 \)

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [58]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 12, 14)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 13, 14)>
<4, (9, 12, 13)>
<5, (0, 2, 14)>
<7, (5, 9, 10)>
<10, (0, 7, 12)>
<12, (1, 4, 13)>
<14, (1, 3, 4)>
