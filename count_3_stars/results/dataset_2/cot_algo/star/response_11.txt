Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (22, 28) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 29) (15, 20) (15, 6) (0, 27) (0, 7) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 9) (27, 16) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 21) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 18) (21, 2) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 29) (1, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (17, 25) (17, 23) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 28) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 20) (20, 15) (20, 8) (20, 11) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 18) (19, 26) (19, 11) (18, 21) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 10) (29, 3) (29, 1) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 28) (9, 27) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 23) (24, 25) (2, 21) (2, 11) (16, 27) (16, 9) (16, 6) (25, 27) (25, 17) (25, 24) (25, 23) (11, 20) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 2) (6, 15) (6, 14) (6, 16) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 28) (10, 18) (10, 12) (23, 3) (23, 7) (23, 17) (23, 9) (23, 25) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 5) (28, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 7, 27
- Node 1: 3, 5, 26, 29
- Node 2: 11, 21
- Node 3: 1, 7, 13, 23, 29
- Node 4: 8, 18, 28
- Node 5: 1, 12, 13, 28
- Node 6: 14, 15, 16
- Node 7: 0, 3, 21, 23
- Node 8: 4, 9, 14, 20
- Node 9: 8, 11, 16, 23, 27
- Node 10: 12, 18
- Node 11: 2, 9, 19, 20
- Node 12: 5, 10, 28
- Node 13: 3, 5
- Node 14: 6, 8
- Node 15: 6, 20
- Node 16: 6, 9, 27
- Node 17: 23, 25
- Node 18: 4, 10, 21, 26
- Node 19: 11, 26
- Node 20: 8, 11, 15
- Node 21: 2, 7, 18
- Node 22: 28
- Node 23: 3, 7, 9, 17, 25
- Node 24: 25
- Node 25: 17, 24, 27, 23
- Node 26: 1, 18, 19
- Node 27: 0, 9, 16, 25
- Node 28: 4, 5, 12, 22

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with (1, 7, 29)
- Node 5: Forms a 3-star with (1, 12, 28)
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with (1, 3, 23)
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with (8, 16, 27)
- Node 11: Forms a 3-star with (9, 19, 20)
- Node 18: Forms a 3-star with (4, 21, 26)
- Node 20: Forms a 3-star with (8, 11, 15)
- Node 23: Forms a 3-star with (7, 9, 25)
- Node 25: Forms a 3-star with (17, 24, 27)
- Node 26: Forms a 3-star with (1, 18, 19)

Total number of 3-stars = 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10] and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, 3, 7, 29>
<1, 5, 12, 28>
<4, 18, 21, 26>
<4, 8, 14, 20>
<7, 9, 23, 25>
<8, 11, 15, 20>
<9, 16, 27, 8>
<9, 11, 19, 20>
<17, 23, 25, 24>
<1, 18, 19, 26>
