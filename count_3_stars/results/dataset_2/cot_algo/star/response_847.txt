Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (14, 11) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 12) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8, 2, 12}
- Node 1: {8, 2, 13, 12}
- Node 2: {9, 5, 1, 13, 0}
- Node 3: {7, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 10, 5, 11}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 2}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 12, 8}
- Node 7: {6, 3, 11, 10, 5}
- Node 8: {6, 1, 10, 0}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 11, 10}
- Node 10: {9, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 11: {9, 4, 7, 3, 14}
- Node 12: {6, 3, 1, 13, 0}
- Node 13: {1, 14, 2, 12}
- Node 14: {11, 13}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find 3-stars:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: No 3-stars
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: No 3-stars
- Node 6: No 3-stars
- Node 7: <7, (6, 11, 10)>
- Node 8: No 3-stars
- Node 9: No 3-stars
- Node 10: No 3-stars
- Node 11: <11, (9, 7, 4)>; <11, (7, 3, 14)>; <11, (4, 7, 3)>
- Node 12: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 13: No 3-stars
- Node 14: No 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is [29].
