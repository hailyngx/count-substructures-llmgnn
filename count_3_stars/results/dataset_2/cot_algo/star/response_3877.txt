Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 15) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 15) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 3) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 14) (7, 15) (7, 13) (8, 18) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 13) (10, 15) (10, 3) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 18) (9, 2) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 18) (6, 2) (6, 13) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 1) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 10) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 13) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
Based on the information provided, we can analyze the neighbors for each node and identify the 3-stars in the graph.

1. Node 1: Neighbors {2, 5, 16, 18}. As it has 4 neighbors, we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. 
2. Node 2: Neighbors {1, 6, 9, 11}. As it has 4 neighbors, we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
3. Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5, 10, 17}. As it has 4 neighbors, we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
4. Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5}. It does not have enough neighbors to form any 3-stars.
5. Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 12, 19}. As it has 5 neighbors, we can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
6. Node 6: Neighbors {2, 13}. It does not have enough neighbors to form any 3-stars.
7. Node 7: Neighbors {13, 14, 15}. As it has 3 neighbors, we can form 1 3-star.
8. Node 8: Neighbors {18}. It does not have enough neighbors to form any 3-stars.
9. Node 9: Neighbors {2}. It does not have enough neighbors to form any 3-stars.
10. Node 10: Neighbors {3, 15}. It does not have enough neighbors to form any 3-stars.
11. Node 11: Neighbors {1, 12, 16, 17}. As it has 4 neighbors, we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
12. Node 12: Neighbors {5, 11, 13}. As it has 3 neighbors, we can form 1 3-star.
13. Node 13: Neighbors {6, 7, 12, 19}. As it has 4 neighbors, we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
14. Node 14: Neighbors {7, 15, 17}. As it has 3 neighbors, we can form 1 3-star.
15. Node 15: Neighbors {7, 10, 14, 16, 18}. As it has 5 neighbors, we can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
16. Node 16: Neighbors {1, 11, 15}. As it has 3 neighbors, we can form 1 3-star.
17. Node 17: Neighbors {11, 14, 3}. As it has 3 neighbors, we can form 1 3-star.
18. Node 18: Neighbors {1, 15, 18, 19}. As it has 4 neighbors, we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
19. Node 19: Neighbors {5, 13, 18}. As it has 3 neighbors, we can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [39]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 5, 16)>
<1, (2, 5, 18)>
<1, (5, 16, 18)>
<2, (1, 11, 16)>
<3, (4, 5, 17)>
<5, (1, 12, 19)>
<7, (13, 14, 15)>
<11, (12, 16, 17)>
<13, (7, 12, 19)>
