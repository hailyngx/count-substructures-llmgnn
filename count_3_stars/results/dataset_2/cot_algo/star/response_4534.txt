Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3
- Node 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7 neighbors: 0, 6, 9
- Node 8 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 9 neighbors: 3, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star(s).
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star(s).
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star(s).
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star(s).
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star(s).
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star(s).

Adding up the 3-stars formed by each node, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [42], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>
