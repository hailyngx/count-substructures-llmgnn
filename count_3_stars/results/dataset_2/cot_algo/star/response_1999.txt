Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (11, 26) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 8) (0, 27) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 20) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 8) (22, 27) (22, 18) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 21) (20, 18) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 26) (25, 19) (25, 15) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 19) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 5) (10, 1) (10, 24) (17, 29) (17, 15) (28, 6) (28, 13) (28, 23) (29, 17) (29, 19) (6, 0) (6, 28) (9, 0) (9, 22) (9, 19) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 15) (23, 27) (23, 28) (23, 26) (26, 11) (26, 25) (26, 23) (26, 21) (3, 18) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 14) (24, 16) (24, 10) (1, 20) (1, 10) (14, 20) (14, 5) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 18) (8, 21) (19, 25) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 29) (19, 9) (21, 22) (21, 26) (21, 8) (13, 0) (13, 18) (13, 28) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0 neighbors: 27, 9, 13, 6
Node 1 neighbors: 20, 10
Node 2 neighbors: 22, 5, 15
Node 3 neighbors: 18
Node 4 neighbors: 11, 7, 19
Node 5 neighbors: 7, 2, 14
Node 6 neighbors: 0, 28
Node 7 neighbors: 4, 5, 19
Node 8 neighbors: 11, 16, 18, 21
Node 9 neighbors: 0, 22, 19
Node 10 neighbors: 1, 24
Node 11 neighbors: 16, 8, 26, 4
Node 13 neighbors: 0, 18, 28
Node 14 neighbors: 20, 5
Node 15 neighbors: 25, 17, 2
Node 16 neighbors: 11, 24, 8
Node 17 neighbors: 29, 15
Node 18 neighbors: 22, 20, 3, 13, 8
Node 19 neighbors: 25, 4, 7, 29, 9
Node 20 neighbors: 18, 25, 1, 14
Node 21 neighbors: 22, 26, 8
Node 22 neighbors: 27, 18, 9, 2, 21
Node 23 neighbors: 27, 28, 26
Node 24 neighbors: 16, 10
Node 25 neighbors: 20, 26, 19, 15
Node 26 neighbors: 11, 25, 23, 21
Node 27 neighbors: 0, 22, 23
Node 28 neighbors: 6, 13, 23
Node 29 neighbors: 17, 19

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 4, 8, 9, 11, 18, 19, 22, 25, 26

Calculating the number of 3-stars for these nodes:
Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 18: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 19: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 22: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 25: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 26: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, 13, 27>, <0, 6, 28>, <0, 9, 22>, <0, 13, 18>, <4, 11, 16>, <4, 7, 19>, <11, 16, 24>, <11, 26, 25>, <11, 4, 7>, <11, 8, 18>, <18, 3, 22>, <18, 13, 28>, <19, 25, 26>, <19, 4, 7>, <19, 7, 5>, <19, 9, 22>, <22, 2, 5>, <22, 5, 14>, <22, 9, 19>, <22, 21, 26>, <25, 15, 17>, <25, 20, 1>, <25, 19, 29>, <22, 21, 8>, <26, 11, 16>, <26, 21, 8>, <26, 23, 27>
