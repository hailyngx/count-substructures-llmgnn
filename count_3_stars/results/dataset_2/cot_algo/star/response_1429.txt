Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (13, 7) (13, 3) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 3) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 10) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 12) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can construct the graph with the following neighbor sets for each node:

1: {9, 8, 5, 12}
2: {6, 7, 5, 14}
3: {4, 7, 13, 0, 12, 10}
4: {7, 8, 12, 10, 11, 3}
5: {8, 2, 1, 11}
6: {14, 2}
7: {4, 3, 10, 2, 13}
8: {9, 4, 5, 0, 1}
9: {8, 1}
10: {4, 7, 0, 12, 3}
11: {4, 5, 14}
12: {4, 3, 1, 10, 14}
13: {7, 3}
14: {6, 12, 11, 2}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node with at least 3 neighbors:

1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing these up, we get a total of 74 3-stars. 

So, the final answer is [74], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (9, 8, 5)>
<3, (4, 7, 10)>
<4, (7, 8, 12)>
<7, (4, 10, 3)>
<8, (4, 5, 11)>
<12, (4, 3, 14)>
