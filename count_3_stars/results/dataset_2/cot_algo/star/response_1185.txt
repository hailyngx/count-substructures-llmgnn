Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 16) (2, 11) (2, 15) (2, 4) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 17) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 15) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 16) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 17) (3, 4) (11, 2) (11, 19) (11, 15) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 12) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 1) (12, 4) (5, 18) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 3) (17, 19) (19, 11) (19, 17) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 10) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 16) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: [8, 14, 15]
Node 1: [7, 10, 12]
Node 2: [4, 11, 15]
Node 3: [4, 8, 9, 17]
Node 4: [2, 3, 6, 12]
Node 5: [18]
Node 6: [4, 9, 10, 18]
Node 7: [1]
Node 8: [0, 3, 13]
Node 9: [3, 6, 13, 17]
Node 10: [1, 6, 16]
Node 11: [2, 15, 19]
Node 12: [1, 4]
Node 13: [8, 9, 16]
Node 14: [0, 16, 18]
Node 15: [0, 2, 11]
Node 16: [10, 13, 14]
Node 17: [3, 9, 18, 19]
Node 18: [5, 6, 14, 17]
Node 19: [11, 17]

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

For nodes with 3 neighbors or more:
Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 10: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 13: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 14: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 16: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 17: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 18: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 24\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (4, 9, 10)>, <9, (3, 6, 13)>, <10, (1, 6, 16)>, <13, (8, 9, 16)>, <14, (0, 16, 18)>, <16, (10, 13, 14)>, <17, (3, 9, 18)>, <18, (5, 6, 14)>
