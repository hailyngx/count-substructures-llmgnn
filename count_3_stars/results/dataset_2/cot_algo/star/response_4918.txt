Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 1) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 10) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 11) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 10) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 14}
- Node 1: {7, 11, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 10, 14}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 6: {8, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {6, 7, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 6, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 2, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 13: {6, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 8, 10, 11}

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 6}, <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 8, 13}, <9, (6, 8, 13)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 5}, <12, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 10, 11}, <14, (3, 10, 11)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [4].
