Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 11) (14, 7) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 2: {3, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 7, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 5: {1, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 10, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 12}
- Node 9: {2, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 3, 12}
- Node 12: {8, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 14: {7}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, Node 10, and Node 11 have 3 or more neighbors.

For nodes with 3 neighbors, we have 1 3-star with the center node and its neighbor nodes. So, there are 4 unique 3-stars:
<0, 3, 6, 13>
<1, 4, 8, 11>
<3, 7, 10, 13>
<7, 10, 12, 14>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
