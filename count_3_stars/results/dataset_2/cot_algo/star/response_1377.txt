- Node 9 neighbors: 12, 26, 28
- Node 10 neighbors: 18, 23, 29
- Node 11 neighbors: 1, 4, 19, 20

- Node 23 neighbors: 10, 29
- Node 24 neighbors: 6, 18
- Node 25 neighbors: 2, 7, 15, 27
- Node 26 neighbors: 5, 6, 9, 29
- Node 27 neighbors: 21, 25
- Node 28 neighbors: 0, 1, 9, 12, 13
- Node 29 neighbors: 10, 23, 26

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 21, 25, 26, 28, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed:
- For each node with 3 neighbors, there is 1 unique 3-star.
- For each node with 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars.
- For each node with 5 neighbors, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is:
\[ 1 \times 16 + 4 \times 0 + 10 \times 0 = 16 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 25>
- <1, 13, 28>
- <2, 13, 28>
- <4, 5, 26>
- <6, 3, 14>
- <11, 1, 16>
- <12, 9, 26>
- <13, 2, 28>
- <14, 0, 3>
- <15, 3, 25>
- <18, 10, 23>
- <21, 6, 27>
- <25, 2, 7>
- <26, 5, 29>
- <28, 1, 13>
- <29, 10, 23>
