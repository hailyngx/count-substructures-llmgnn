Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 14) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 13) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 6) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 5) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 17) (13, 18) (13, 5) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 17) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 0) (19, 1) (19, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 9) (7, 15) (7, 10) (6, 18) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 10) (17, 5) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3, 9, 16
- Node 1: 3, 14, 16, 19
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 9, 11
- Node 4: 3, 12, 14
- Node 5: 11, 13, 17
- Node 6: 8, 10, 17, 18
- Node 7: 10, 15
- Node 8: 6, 16, 18, 19
- Node 9: 0, 3, 17
- Node 10: 6, 7, 12
- Node 11: 3, 5, 18
- Node 12: 4, 10, 14
- Node 13: 5, 18
- Node 14: 1, 4, 12
- Node 15: 7, 16, 17
- Node 16: 0, 1, 8, 15
- Node 17: 5, 6, 9, 15
- Node 18: 6, 11, 13
- Node 19: 1, 8

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3, 14, 16, 19 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 9, 11 (5 neighbors)
- Node 4: 3, 12, 14 (3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 11, 13, 17 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 8, 10, 17, 18 (4 neighbors)
- Node 8: 6, 16, 18, 19 (4 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0, 3, 17 (3 neighbors)
- Node 10: 6, 7, 12 (3 neighbors)
- Node 11: 3, 5, 18 (3 neighbors)
- Node 12: 4, 10, 14 (3 neighbors)
- Node 13: 5, 18 (2 neighbors)
- Node 14: 1, 4, 12 (3 neighbors)
- Node 16: 0, 1, 8, 15 (4 neighbors)
- Node 17: 5, 6, 9, 15 (4 neighbors)
- Node 18: 6, 11, 13 (3 neighbors)

Applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 14, 16, 19>, <3, 1, 4, 9>, <6, 8, 16, 18>, <8, 6, 16, 18>, <8, 16, 15, 17>, <17, 5, 6, 9>
