Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 17) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 16) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 18) (7, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 11) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 0) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 19) (1, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 0) (12, 8) (12, 19) (16, 9) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 6) (6, 15) (6, 14) (6, 19) (13, 15) (13, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first need to identify the neighbor nodes for each of the 20 nodes in the graph:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 18}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 11, 19}
- Node 4: {3, 8, 18}
- Node 5: {2, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {13, 14, 15, 19}
- Node 7: {11}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 8, 12}
- Node 9: {5, 9, 10, 16}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 5, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 11: {3, 7, 11, 17, 19}
- Node 12: {8, 19}
- Node 13: {2, 6, 15}
- Node 14: {5, 6, 10}
- Node 15: {6, 13, 17}
- Node 16: {9}
- Node 17: {11, 15, 18}
- Node 18: {0, 4, 17}
- Node 19: {3, 6, 11, 12, 19}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each of these nodes:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:

\[ 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 72 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [72], and some of the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <2, (0, 8, 10)>
- <3, (4, 8, 11)>
- <4, (3, 8, 18)>
- <5, (2, 9, 10)>
- <6, (13, 14, 19)>
- <10, (0, 2, 14)>
- <11, (3, 17, 19)>
- <19, (6, 11, 12)>
