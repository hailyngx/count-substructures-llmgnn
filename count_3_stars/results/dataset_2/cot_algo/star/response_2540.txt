Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (4, 9) (4, 5) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 0) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (14, 2) (14, 9) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 9) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 11}
Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 7, 9, 13}
Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 14}
Node 3: {0, 7, 8, 12}
Node 4: {5, 9}
Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 11}
Node 6: {0, 5, 7, 12}
Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 6, 13}
Node 8: {0, 3, 10, 12}
Node 9: {1, 4, 13, 14}
Node 10: {8, 9, 11}
Node 11: {0, 5, 10}
Node 12: {3, 6, 8, 13}
Node 13: {1, 7, 9, 12}
Node 14: {2, 9}

Next, we need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to check for 3-stars. These nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, and 13.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Finally, summing up all the 3-stars gives us a total of 91 3-stars. So, the final answer is [91].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 13>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 13>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 5, 13>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 9, 13>, <2, 5, 14>, <3, 7, 13>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 11>, <5, 6, 12>, <5, 7, 13>, <6, 7, 13>, <8, 9, 13>, <9, 12, 13>.
