Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 10) (17, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 15) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 13) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 12) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (1, 2) (1, 11) (6, 8) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 14) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 16) (19, 10) (19, 15) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 9) (3, 17) (3, 13) (5, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 16) (16, 15) (16, 9) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {18, 7, 15, 12}
- Node 1: {2, 11}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 15}
- Node 3: {17, 13}
- Node 4: {8, 14, 11, 15}
- Node 5: {12}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {2, 0, 11}
- Node 8: {4, 14, 11, 6}
- Node 9: {10, 11, 16}
- Node 10: {17, 13, 19, 9}
- Node 11: {4, 8, 7, 1, 9}
- Node 12: {18, 0, 5, 14}
- Node 13: {10, 18, 3}
- Node 14: {4, 8, 12}
- Node 15: {2, 4, 0, 19, 16}
- Node 16: {15, 9}
- Node 17: {10, 3}
- Node 18: {0, 13, 12}
- Node 19: {10, 15}

Now, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as they have the potential to form 3-stars:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 5 neighbors

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 40 \), which we represent as [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 7, 12>
- <0, 7, 15>
- <0, 12, 14>
- <0, 12, 18>
- <2, 7, 15>
- <4, 8, 11>
- <4, 8, 14>
- <8, 11, 14>
- <10, 13, 17>
- <10, 15, 19>
- <10, 16, 9>
- <11, 7, 9>
- <11, 9, 16>
- <12, 14, 18>
- <13, 18, 3>
- <15, 16, 9>
- <17, 3, 10>
