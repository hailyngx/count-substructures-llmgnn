Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 0) (16, 22) (5, 12) (9, 8) (9, 13) (0, 11) (0, 26) (0, 6) (27, 7) (27, 6) (27, 8) (22, 16) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 29) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 3) (28, 11) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 25) (26, 0) (26, 23) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 2) (6, 0) (6, 27) (6, 21) (6, 4) (21, 6) (18, 26) (18, 7) (18, 1) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 25) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 17) (20, 29) (20, 12) (29, 22) (29, 20) (8, 9) (8, 27) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 12) (3, 23) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 2) (4, 22) (4, 6) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 20) (12, 19) (12, 17) (7, 27) (7, 18) (7, 13) (17, 15) (17, 19) (17, 12) (24, 3) (2, 26) (2, 15) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 25) (1, 18) (1, 25) (25, 28) (25, 10) (25, 14) (25, 1) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 7) 

Response:
Given the provided graph, we will first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: (11, 26, 6)
- Node 1: (18, 25)
- Node 2: (26, 3, 4, 14)
- Node 3: (23, 28, 24, 2)
- Node 4: (22, 6, 2)
- Node 5: (12)
- Node 6: (0, 27, 21, 4)
- Node 7: (27, 18, 13)
- Node 8: (9, 27, 19, 14)
- Node 9: (8, 13)
- Node 10: (15, 25, 13)
- Node 11: (28, 19, 0)
- Node 12: (5, 20, 19, 17)
- Node 13: (9, 10, 7)
- Node 14: (8, 2, 25)
- Node 15: (10, 2, 17)
- Node 16: (22)
- Node 17: (19, 15, 12)
- Node 18: (26, 7, 1)
- Node 19: (11, 8, 17, 12)
- Node 20: (29, 12)
- Node 21: (6)
- Node 22: (16, 23, 4, 29)
- Node 23: (22, 26, 3)
- Node 24: (3)
- Node 25: (28, 10, 14, 1)
- Node 26: (0, 23, 28, 18, 2)
- Node 27: (7, 6, 8)
- Node 28: (11, 26, 3, 25)
- Node 29: (20, 22)

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (11, 26, 6)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <2, (26, 3, 4)>, <2, (26, 3, 14)>, <2, (26, 4, 14)>, <2, (3, 4, 14)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, (23, 28, 24)>, <3, (23, 2, 4)>, <3, (28, 24, 2)>, <3, (23, 28, 2)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <4, (22, 6, 2)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <8, (9, 27, 19)>, <8, (9, 27, 14)>, <8, (9, 19, 14)>, <8, (27, 19, 14)>
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <10, (15, 25, 13)>
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <12, (5, 20, 19)>, <12, (5, 20, 17)>, <12, (5, 19, 17)>, <12, (20, 19, 17)>
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <17, (19, 15, 12)>
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <19, (11, 8, 17)>, <19, (11, 8, 12)>, <19, (11, 17, 12)>, <19, (8, 17, 12)>
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <22, (16, 23, 4)>, <22, (16, 23, 29)>, <22, (16, 4, 29)>, <22, (23, 4, 29)>
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <25, (28, 10, 14)>, <25, (28, 10, 1)>, <25, (28, 14, 1)>, <25, (10, 14, 1)>
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <26, (0, 23, 28)>, <26, (0, 23, 18)>, <26, (0, 28, 18)>, <26, (23, 28, 18)>, <26, (0, 23, 2)>, <26, (0, 28, 2)>, <26, (23, 28, 2)>, <26, (0, 18, 2)>, <26, (23, 18, 2)>, <26, (28, 18, 2)>
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <28, (11, 26, 3)>, <28, (11, 26, 25)>, <28, (11, 3, 25)>, <28, (26, 3, 25)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46.

Therefore, the final answer is [46].
