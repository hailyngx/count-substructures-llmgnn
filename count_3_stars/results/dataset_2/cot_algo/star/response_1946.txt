The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 19) (16, 0) (16, 6) (1, 21) (1, 14) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 13) (21, 14) (4, 25) (7, 22) (18, 2) (18, 8) (22, 7) (22, 14) (22, 6) (8, 18) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (13, 21) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 2) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 3) (9, 25) (9, 15) (9, 17) (26, 13) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 3) (15, 9) (15, 20) (15, 25) (20, 15) (28, 29) (28, 12) (29, 28) (29, 5) (29, 12) (29, 24) (12, 28) (12, 29) (23, 11) (23, 1) (23, 0) (23, 27) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 23) (0, 17) (25, 4) (25, 9) (25, 15) (25, 6) (27, 23) (27, 3) (27, 5) (19, 11) (19, 3) (6, 16) (6, 22) (6, 25) (6, 17) (17, 8) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 6) (17, 3) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 27) (3, 19) (3, 17) (14, 1) (14, 21) (14, 22) (14, 5) (24, 29) (24, 5) (5, 29) (5, 27) (5, 14) (5, 24) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. For each node, list all its neighbors:
   
- Node 0: 16, 8, 23, 17
- Node 1: 21, 14, 23
- Node 2: 18, 13, 3
- Node 3: 10, 2, 27, 19, 17
- Node 4: 25
- Node 5: 29, 27, 14, 24
- Node 6: 16, 22, 25, 17
- Node 7: 22
- Node 8: 18, 13, 10, 17, 0
- Node 9: 25, 15, 17
- Node 10: 11, 8, 3
- Node 11: 10, 23, 19
- Node 12: 28, 29
- Node 13: 21, 8, 26, 2
- Node 14: 21, 22, 5, 1
- Node 15: 9, 20, 25
- Node 16: 0, 6
- Node 17: 8, 9, 0, 6, 3
- Node 18: 2, 8
- Node 19: 11, 3
- Node 20: 15
- Node 21: 1, 13, 14
- Node 22: 7, 14, 6
- Node 23: 11, 1, 0, 27
- Node 24: 29, 5
- Node 25: 4, 9, 15, 6
- Node 26: 13
- Node 27: 23, 3, 5
- Node 28: 12, 29
- Node 29: 28, 5, 12, 24

2. Calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
    - Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
    - Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
    - Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
    - Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
    - Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
    - Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
    - Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

3. Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
    - Total = 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [45]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (10, 8, 17)>
- <5, (29, 27, 24)>
- <8, (18, 13, 10)>
- <14, (21, 22, 5)>
- <17, (8, 9, 0)>
- <23, (27, 0, 11)>
- <25, (9, 15, 6)>
- <27, (23, 3, 5)>
- <29, (5, 12, 24)>
