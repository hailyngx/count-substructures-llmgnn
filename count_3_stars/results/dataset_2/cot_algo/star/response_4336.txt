Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 3, 8, 2}
- Node 1: {4, 3}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 6, 1, 0}
- Node 4: {5, 0, 1, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 8, 4, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 3}
- Node 7: {9, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 7, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8, 3, 7, 0}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 8, Node 9

For nodes with 3 neighbors, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 64. So, the answer is [64].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (9, 4, 3)>
- <3, (5, 9, 6)>
- <4, (5, 0, 1)>
- <5, (9, 6, 8)>
- <8, (5, 9, 7)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
