Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 19) (6, 4) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 19) (11, 9) (11, 12) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 18) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 4) (7, 5) (7, 10) (16, 17) (16, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 17) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 13) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 19) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 3) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 19) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 15) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 15) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a table to represent the neighbors of each node:

| Node | Neighbors            |
|------|----------------------|
| 0    | 8, 12               |
| 1    | 2, 12, 13, 18       |
| 2    | 1, 9, 17            |
| 3    | 10, 16, 19          |
| 4    | 6, 14, 17, 19       |
| 5    | 7, 9                |
| 6    | 4                   |
| 7    | 5, 10               |
| 8    | 0, 12, 18           |
| 9    | 2, 5, 11, 19        |
| 10   | 3, 7, 13, 19        |
| 11   | 9, 12               |
| 12   | 0, 1, 8, 11         |
| 13   | 1, 10, 14, 15       |
| 14   | 4, 13, 15           |
| 15   | 14, 18, 13          |
| 16   | 3, 17               |
| 17   | 2, 4, 16            |
| 18   | 1, 8, 15            |
| 19   | 3, 4, 9, 10         |

Now, let's analyze each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.  
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.  
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.  
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.  
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.  
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  
Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  
Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  
Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  
Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 34 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 12, 13>
<1, 12, 18>
<1, 13, 14>
<1, 13, 15>
<2, 9, 17>
<4, 17, 19>
<9, 10, 19>
<9, 11, 12>
<10, 13, 15>
<12, 0, 8>
<12, 1, 8>
<13, 14, 15>
<14, 4, 17>
<18, 1, 15>
<19, 3, 10>
