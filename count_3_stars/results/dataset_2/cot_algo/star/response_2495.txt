Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 14) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 9) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 9) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 4) (14, 11) (14, 8) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 9) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 4) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 12) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {10, 6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {10, 7, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 8, 12, 3, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {11, 2, 13, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 13, 3, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {13, 2, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {8, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {10, 12, 9, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {11, 5, 6, 0, 2, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {10, 7, 12, 13, 4}
- Node 10: Neighbors {11, 0, 7, 1, 9}
- Node 11: Neighbors {10, 3, 14, 13, 8}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 7, 1, 9}
- Node 13: Neighbors {11, 5, 4, 3, 9}
- Node 14: Neighbors {11, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 6 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors
- Node 10: 5 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 5 neighbors

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 82

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [82].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <2, (5, 8, 13)>
- <4, (2, 3, 13)>
- <7, (9, 10, 12)>
- <9, (4, 10, 13)>
- <10, (1, 9, 11)>
- <11, (3, 8, 13)>
- <12, (1, 7, 9)>
- <13, (3, 9, 11)>
- <8, (0, 11, 5)>
