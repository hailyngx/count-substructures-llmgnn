Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {4, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 8}

Next, we need to find the 3-stars. Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 8 have 5 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: Only has 4 neighbors, so no 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 22 \), so the final answer is [22].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 9)>
