Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 7, 8}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [51].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>
