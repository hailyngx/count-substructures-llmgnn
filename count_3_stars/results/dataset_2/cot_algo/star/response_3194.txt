Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 7, 8}


Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with {4, 7, 9} <3, (4, 7, 9)>, and {6, 8, 9} <3, (6, 8, 9)>.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with {7, 9, 5} <4, (7, 9, 5)>.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with {8, 9, 3} <5, (8, 9, 3)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
