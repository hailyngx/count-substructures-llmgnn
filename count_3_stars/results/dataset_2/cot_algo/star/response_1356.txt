Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 8) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 4) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 1) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
Node 0: 1, 3, 7, 8
Node 1: 0, 2, 8, 9, 11, 12
Node 2: 1, 4, 9, 10, 14
Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 4: 2, 3, 10, 11, 13
Node 5: 3, 8, 11, 14
Node 6: 7, 14
Node 7: 0, 3, 6, 13, 14
Node 8: 0, 1, 5
Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 12, 14
Node 10: 2, 4
Node 11: 1, 4, 5
Node 12: 1, 9, 13
Node 13: 4, 7, 12, 14
Node 14: 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 48

So, the final answer is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 11, 12)>
<2, (4, 10, 14)>
<4, (1, 11, 13)>
<9, (1, 12, 13)>
<13, (4, 7, 14)>
