Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (12, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 14
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6, 10, 11
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 5, 6, 7, 13
- Node 5: 3, 4, 11, 14
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 14, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 10, 11, 12
- Node 8: 3, 6, 10, 13
- Node 9: 1, 3, 10, 11, 13
- Node 10: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 11: 2, 5, 7, 9, 13
- Node 12: 7
- Node 13: 4, 8, 9, 11
- Node 14: 0, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars within this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) unique 3-star
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) unique 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) unique 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) unique 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) unique 3-stars
- For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) unique 3-stars
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars

Summing up the total number of unique 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 3>, <3, 2, 6>, <3, 5, 14>, <3, 6, 14>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 8, 13>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 4, 14>, <6, 8, 13>, <6, 8, 10>, <7, 4, 13>, <7, 10, 9>, <7, 11, 13>, <7, 12, 11>, <9, 1, 7>, <9, 1, 6>, <9, 3, 11>, <9, 4, 13>, <9, 8, 13>, <11, 2, 10>, <11, 2, 3>, <11, 5, 14>, <11, 7, 10>, <11, 9, 13>, <13, 4, 6>, <13, 4, 8>
