Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 14) (15, 10) (15, 7) (7, 15) (7, 16) (7, 13) (7, 8) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 18) (19, 4) (19, 14) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 13) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 11) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 11) (4, 19) (4, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (2, 6) (2, 17) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 18) (0, 5) (11, 17) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 13) (3, 12) (18, 16) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 11) (14, 10) (14, 19) (14, 4) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get:
\(4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 31\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 10, 12>
<7, 15, 16>
<8, 7, 16>
<10, 9, 12>
<12, 5, 1>
<14, 10, 19>
<18, 16, 17>
