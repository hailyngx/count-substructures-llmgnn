Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

1. Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 7}
2. Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 7, 8}
3. Node 2: {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
4. Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 8}
5. Node 4: {5, 6}
6. Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 8}
7. Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}
8. Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 9}
9. Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
10. Node 9: {2, 7}

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with them:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, 
  - <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 8)>, 
  - <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (2, 6, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 27

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>,
<6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>,
<8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 8)>, 
<8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (2, 6, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>.
