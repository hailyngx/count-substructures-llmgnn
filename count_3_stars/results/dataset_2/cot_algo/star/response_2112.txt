Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 28) (3, 23) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 16) (28, 3) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 22) (29, 26) (29, 15) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 5) (19, 5) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 21) (26, 29) (26, 10) (26, 17) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 19) (21, 18) (21, 25) (9, 8) (9, 22) (22, 28) (22, 19) (22, 9) (17, 1) (17, 26) (17, 15) (17, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (27, 2) (27, 20) (27, 23) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 0) (20, 27) (20, 14) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 16) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 24) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 24) (10, 26) (10, 2) (18, 19) (18, 21) (24, 16) (24, 12) (24, 7) (2, 1) (2, 27) (2, 10) (2, 14) (7, 8) (7, 24) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 15) (23, 3) (23, 27) (23, 25) (25, 21) (25, 23) (25, 15) (14, 20) (14, 2) (15, 29) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 25) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 5, 16
Node 1: 2, 13, 17
Node 2: 1, 10, 14, 27
Node 3: 23, 28
Node 4: 0, 12
Node 5: 0, 6, 19
Node 6: 5, 11, 12, 21, 28
Node 7: 8, 24
Node 8: 7, 9, 13
Node 9: 8, 22
Node 10: 2, 26
Node 11: 6, 15, 17
Node 12: 4, 6, 24
Node 13: 1, 8, 16
Node 14: 2, 20
Node 15: 11, 17, 25, 29
Node 16: 0, 13, 24
Node 17: 1, 11, 15, 26
Node 18: 19, 21
Node 19: 5, 18, 21, 22
Node 20: 14, 27
Node 21: 6, 18, 19, 22, 25, 28
Node 22: 9, 19, 21, 28
Node 23: 3, 25, 27
Node 24: 7, 12, 16
Node 25: 15, 21, 23
Node 26: 10, 17, 29
Node 27: 2, 20, 23
Node 28: 3, 6, 21, 22
Node 29: 15, 26

Next, we identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, as those are the potential central nodes of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 6, 8, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

- Node 1: 1 3-star 
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star 
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: 1 3-star 
- Node 17: 1 3-star 
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: 1 3-star 
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 48 

Therefore, the final answer is [48]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, 2, 13> 
<6, 11, 21> 
<6, 12, 24> 
<6, 21, 28> 
<6, 21, 19> 
<8, 7, 24> 
<13, 8, 16> 
<15, 11, 25> 
<19, 18, 21> 
<21, 22, 28> 
<23, 25, 27> 
<26, 10, 17>
