Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 8) (4, 3) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 14) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 0) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 17) (18, 3) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 17) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 18) (17, 15) (19, 2) (19, 3) (16, 7) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 13) (12, 2) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 2) (1, 7) (1, 11) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 18) (3, 19) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 18) 

Response:
First, we will construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {8, 6, 18}
- Node 1: {7, 11}
- Node 2: {5, 19, 12, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 10, 18, 19}
- Node 4: {3, 15}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 2, 17}
- Node 6: {15, 18, 0}
- Node 7: {16, 11, 1}
- Node 8: {9, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 8}
- Node 10: {11, 15, 3}
- Node 11: {7, 10, 14, 1}
- Node 12: {13, 2}
- Node 13: {5, 17, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {13, 11, 2}
- Node 15: {4, 10, 6, 17}
- Node 16: {7}
- Node 17: {5, 13, 18, 15}
- Node 18: {6, 0, 17, 3}
- Node 19: {2, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has at least 3 neighbors.

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24 \), which should be represented as [24].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (5, 19, 12)>
<2, (5, 19, 14)>
<2, (5, 12, 14)>
<2, (19, 12, 14)>
<3, (4, 10, 18)>
<3, (4, 10, 19)>
<3, (4, 18, 19)>
<3, (10, 18, 19)>
<5, (9, 13, 17)>
<5, (9, 2, 17)>
<5, (13, 2, 17)>
<5, (9, 13, 5)>
<13, (17, 12, 14)>
<13, (5, 17, 12)>
<13, (5, 17, 14)>
<13, (12, 2, 14)>
<15, (4, 10, 17)>
<15, (6, 17, 18)>
<15, (10, 6, 17)>
<15, (10, 6, 18)>
<17, (5, 13, 18)>
<17, (15, 6, 18)>
<17, (15, 6, 17)>
<17, (15, 10, 17)>
