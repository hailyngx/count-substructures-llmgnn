Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 27) (17, 14) (17, 16) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 9) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 13) (21, 9) (22, 5) (22, 24) (23, 2) (23, 3) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 15) (6, 25) (6, 8) (6, 13) (28, 21) (19, 26) (19, 10) (26, 19) (26, 25) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 8) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 4) (15, 12) (15, 1) (8, 6) (8, 26) (8, 9) (8, 29) (9, 7) (9, 21) (9, 8) (9, 3) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 19) (10, 27) (25, 6) (25, 26) (25, 4) (27, 14) (27, 10) (11, 26) (11, 0) (0, 11) (3, 23) (3, 9) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 24) (16, 18) (16, 20) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 4) (13, 21) (13, 6) (13, 29) (2, 23) (2, 1) (20, 26) (20, 16) (29, 8) (29, 13) (29, 4) (5, 22) (5, 18) (5, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 5) (4, 1) (4, 25) (4, 24) (4, 29) (4, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {11}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 15, 16}
- Node 2: {1, 23}
- Node 3: {9, 23}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 24, 25, 29}
- Node 5: {4, 18, 22}
- Node 6: {8, 13, 25}
- Node 7: {9, 10, 12, 18, 21}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 26, 29}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 8, 21}
- Node 10: {7, 19, 21, 27}
- Node 11: {0, 26}
- Node 12: {7, 15, 18}
- Node 13: {6, 21, 29}
- Node 14: {17, 27}
- Node 15: {1, 12}
- Node 16: {1, 17, 18, 20, 24}
- Node 17: {14, 16}
- Node 18: {5, 7, 16}
- Node 19: {10, 26}
- Node 20: {16, 26}
- Node 21: {7, 9, 10, 13, 28}
- Node 22: {5, 24}
- Node 23: {2, 3}
- Node 24: {4, 16, 22}
- Node 25: {4, 6, 26}
- Node 26: {8, 11, 19, 20, 25}
- Node 27: {10, 14}
- Node 28: {21}
- Node 29: {4, 8, 13}

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 63 \)

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [63].
