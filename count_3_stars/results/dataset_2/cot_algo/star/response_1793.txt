Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 4, 7, 8, 9 (Degree 4)
Node 1: 2, 5, 6 (Degree 3)
Node 2: 1, 5, 6 (Degree 3)
Node 3: 5, 8 (Degree 2)
Node 4: 0, 5, 8, 9 (Degree 4)
Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 (Degree 5)
Node 6: 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 (Degree 5)
Node 7: 0, 6, 8, 9 (Degree 4)
Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (Degree 6)
Node 9: 0, 4, 6, 7 (Degree 4)

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 56 \)

So, the final answer is [56], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>
