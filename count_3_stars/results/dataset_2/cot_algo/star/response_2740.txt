Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 8, 6, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 3, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 1, 3, 6, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 4, 7, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 8, 6, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 6, 8, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 2, 4, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 4, 3, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 2, 3, 1, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 61

So, the final answer is [61], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 3, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 9)>
- <3, (2, 3, 8)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <8, (0, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>
