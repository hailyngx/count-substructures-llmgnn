Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 8) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {12, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {8, 11, 12, 6}
- Node 2: {10, 11, 7}
- Node 3: {8, 4, 7, 6, 5}
- Node 4: {8, 12, 9, 5, 3}
- Node 5: {10, 11, 4, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {13, 11, 0, 1, 3}
- Node 7: {13, 12, 3, 2}
- Node 8: {13, 4, 14, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {10, 4, 14}
- Node 10: {11, 2, 9, 5}
- Node 11: {10, 1, 5, 6, 2}
- Node 12: {4, 7, 0, 1}
- Node 13: {8, 7, 6}
- Node 14: {8, 9}

Now, we can calculate how many 3-stars are formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 68

Therefore, the final answer is [68].

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 3)>, <1, (8, 11, 6)>, <3, (8, 4, 5)>, <4, (8, 12, 3)>, <5, (10, 11, 3)>, <6, (13, 11, 1)>, <7, (13, 12, 3)>, <8, (13, 4, 1)>, <10, (11, 5, 6)>, <11, (10, 1, 6)>
