Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {10, 12, 2}
- Node 1: {3, 2, 4}
- Node 2: {6, 1, 7, 0}
- Node 3: {6, 1, 7, 13, 5}
- Node 4: {1, 8, 10, 5}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 10, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 14, 3, 2, 12}
- Node 7: {9, 3, 12, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {13, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {6, 11, 7}
- Node 10: {11, 0, 12, 4, 5}
- Node 11: {9, 13, 10, 14, 12}
- Node 12: {6, 10, 11, 7, 0}
- Node 13: {8, 3, 11}
- Node 14: {6, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13

Now we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 71

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [71].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (1, 7, 0)>
- <3, (1, 7, 5)>
- <5, (3, 8, 10)>
- <6, (9, 14, 12)>
- <7, (9, 3, 12)>
- <10, (11, 0, 12)>
- <11, (9, 13, 14)>
- <12, (6, 10, 7)>
