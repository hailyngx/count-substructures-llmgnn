Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 12) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 2) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 13}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 7, 12}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 7, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 9: {2, 8}
- Node 10: {1, 8, 11}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {5, 6, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 7, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 4, 5, 7, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- No other nodes have 3 or more neighbors, so the total number of 3-stars is 40.

Therefore, the final answer is [40], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<7, (4, 8, 13)>, <7, (6, 8, 14)>, <11, (1, 8, 13)>, <11, (2, 8, 13)>.
