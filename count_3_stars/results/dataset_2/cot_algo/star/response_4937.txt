Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 9) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 9) (10, 6) (10, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 9) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 14) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 11}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 10, 12}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 8, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 9, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {6, 8}
- Node 11: {1, 5, 13}
- Node 12: {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 13: {5, 7, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 7, 8, 9, 13}

Next, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if they form any 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 95. So, the final answer is [95].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 3)>
- <6, (2, 3, 10)>
- <8, (0, 3, 12)>
- <9, (1, 3, 13)>
- <12, (3, 9, 13)>
- <13, (5, 9, 14)>
- <14, (7, 8, 9)>
