Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 0) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 12) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 12) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 12) (5, 0) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 9, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 6, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 6, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 6, 7}
- Node 10: Neighbors {3, 5, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors {6, 12, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {2, 4, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 3, 11, 12, 13}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 6: Forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 5, 8)
- Node 12: Forms 3-stars with neighbors (3, 5, 14) and (7, 8, 13)
- Node 14: Forms a 3-star with neighbors (3, 12, 13)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <12, (3, 5, 14)>, <12, (7, 8, 13)>, and <14, (3, 12, 13)>.
