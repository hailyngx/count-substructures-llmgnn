Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (22, 13) (22, 27) (22, 21) (3, 1) (3, 5) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 28) (6, 9) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 4) (9, 27) (1, 3) (1, 24) (1, 8) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 24) (14, 20) (17, 29) (17, 5) (17, 11) (29, 9) (29, 17) (29, 7) (21, 13) (21, 22) (21, 19) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 29) (7, 25) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 16) (25, 18) (10, 18) (10, 23) (16, 25) (16, 28) (16, 19) (28, 15) (28, 16) (28, 8) (11, 17) (11, 23) (11, 27) (23, 10) (23, 11) (23, 18) (23, 2) (26, 25) (26, 8) (8, 15) (8, 1) (8, 28) (8, 26) (24, 1) (24, 14) (24, 12) (2, 23) (2, 19) (2, 4) (18, 25) (18, 10) (18, 23) (18, 27) (18, 20) (19, 21) (19, 16) (19, 2) (4, 9) (4, 2) (27, 22) (27, 9) (27, 11) (27, 18) (20, 14) (20, 18) (20, 5) (12, 14) (12, 24) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 20) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 1: {3, 8, 24}
- Node 2: {4, 19, 23}
- Node 3: {1, 5}
- Node 4: {2, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 15, 17, 20}
- Node 6: {7, 9}
- Node 7: {6, 14, 25, 29}
- Node 8: {1, 15, 26, 28}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 27, 29}
- Node 10: {18, 23}
- Node 11: {17, 23, 27}
- Node 12: {14, 24}
- Node 13: {21, 22}
- Node 14: {7, 12, 20, 24}
- Node 15: {5, 8, 28}
- Node 16: {19, 25, 28}
- Node 17: {5, 11, 29}
- Node 18: {10, 23, 25, 27, 20}
- Node 19: {2, 16, 21}
- Node 20: {5, 14, 18}
- Node 21: {13, 19, 22}
- Node 22: {13, 21, 27}
- Node 23: {2, 10, 11, 18}
- Node 24: {1, 12, 14}
- Node 25: {7, 16, 18, 26}
- Node 26: {8, 25}
- Node 27: {9, 11, 18, 22}
- Node 28: {15, 16, 8}
- Node 29: {7, 9, 17}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 13, 26
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 5, 9, 14, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 8 nodes * 1 3-star each = 8
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: \( inom{n}{3} \) for each node

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 8 + \sum_{i=5}^{29} \begin{pmatrix} \text{neighbors of node i} \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \]

Given the information provided, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [41]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, 3, 24>
- <2, 4, 19>
- <6, 7, 29>
- <12, 14, 24>
- <13, 21, 22>
- <26, 25, 8>
- <5, 15, 17>
- <9, 18, 27>
- <20, 5, 14>
- <16, 28, 8>
- <23, 10, 11>
- <9, 7, 29>
- <17, 11, 27>
- <18, 23, 25>
- <18, 25, 27>
