Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 9) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 0) (15, 18) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 18) (10, 3) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 1) (18, 15) (18, 13) (19, 2) (19, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 4) (17, 3) (17, 9) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 2) (4, 1) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 13) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 4) 

Response:
First, we will find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 13, 15}
- Node 1: {4, 8, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 6, 14, 19}
- Node 3: {10, 12, 17}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 19}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 7: {9, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 7, 8, 11, 17}
- Node 10: {3}
- Node 11: {7, 9}
- Node 12: {3, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 12, 18}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 7, 12}
- Node 15: {0, 18}
- Node 17: {3, 9}
- Node 18: {13, 15}
- Node 19: {2, 4}

Now, we will identify the number of 3-stars for each central node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [54]

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 13>, <0, 5, 15>, <0, 6, 13>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 8, 9>, <1, 8, 13>, <1, 9, 13>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 14>, <2, 4, 19>, <2, 5, 14>, <2, 5, 19>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 14, 19>, <4, 5, 19>, <7, 9, 11>, <7, 9, 17>
