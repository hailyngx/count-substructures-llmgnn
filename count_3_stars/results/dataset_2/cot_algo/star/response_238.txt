Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (12, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 6) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 13) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 6) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 5, 8, 11, 13
- Node 1: 0, 8, 9, 10, 11
- Node 2: 4, 6, 14
- Node 3: 5, 11, 14
- Node 4: 2, 6, 8, 11
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 8, 10, 14
- Node 6: 2, 4, 10, 13
- Node 7: 5, 10
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 5, 12
- Node 9: 1, 10
- Node 10: 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13
- Node 11: 0, 1, 3, 4, 10, 14
- Node 12: 8
- Node 13: 0, 6, 10, 14
- Node 14: 2, 3, 5, 11, 13

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 6 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 10: 6 neighbors
- Node 11: 6 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 1: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 10: 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
- Node 11: 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
- Node 14: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 80

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [80].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 5, 8>, 
<0, 5, 11>, 
<0, 8, 11>, 
<0, 13, 14>, 
<1, 5, 8>, 
<1, 5, 11>, 
<1, 8, 11>, 
<1, 10, 13>, 
<4, 6, 10>, 
<4, 6, 13>, 
<4, 8, 11>, 
<5, 10, 13>, 
<5, 10, 14>, 
<5, 13, 14>, 
<8, 10, 11>, 
<8, 10, 12>, 
<8, 10, 13>, 
<10, 11, 14>, 
<10, 13, 14>, 
<11, 13, 14>.
