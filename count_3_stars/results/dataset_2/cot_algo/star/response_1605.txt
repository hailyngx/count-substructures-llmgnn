Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 3) (17, 16) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 15) (13, 6) (13, 19) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 18) (16, 17) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (2, 6) (2, 11) (8, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 19) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 11) (11, 15) (11, 2) (11, 18) (4, 1) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 12) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {1, 6, 10, 12}
Node 1: {0, 4, 7, 15}
Node 2: {6, 11}
Node 3: {14, 15, 17, 18}
Node 4: {1}
Node 5: {7}
Node 6: {0, 2, 9, 13, 19}
Node 7: {1, 5, 9, 18}
Node 8: {10}
Node 9: {6, 7, 10}
Node 10: {0, 8, 12, 9}
Node 11: {2, 18, 15}
Node 12: {0, 10, 14, 19}
Node 13: {6, 15, 19}
Node 14: {3, 12, 19}
Node 15: {1, 3, 11, 13, 17}
Node 16: {17}
Node 17: {3, 15, 16}
Node 18: {3, 7, 11}
Node 19: {6, 12, 13, 14}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors. Nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, and 19 have three or more neighbors. 

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \). 

For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 41

So, the final answer is [41], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 12>, <0, 6, 10>, <0, 6, 12>, <1, 7, 18>, <1, 7, 19>, <1, 15, 17>, <1, 15, 13>, <3, 14, 12>, <3, 14, 19>, <3, 15, 17>, <3, 15, 13>, <3, 18, 11>, <6, 10, 12>, <6, 13, 19>, <6, 19, 14>, <7, 9, 10>, <7, 9, 18>, <11, 15, 13>, <12, 10, 19>
