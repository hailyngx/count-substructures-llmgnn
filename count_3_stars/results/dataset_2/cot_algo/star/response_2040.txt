Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (13, 1) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (4, 18) (4, 2) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 19) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 14) (15, 9) (15, 7) (15, 12) (12, 8) (12, 15) (12, 0) (7, 16) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 19) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {8, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 13, 17}
- Node 2: {4, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 9, 16}
- Node 4: {2, 18}
- Node 5: {6, 9, 18, 19}
- Node 6: {5, 10}
- Node 7: {14, 15, 16, 17}
- Node 8: {0, 9, 12, 18}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 8, 15}
- Node 10: {6, 17, 0}
- Node 11: {16, 17}
- Node 12: {0, 8, 15}
- Node 13: {1}
- Node 14: {7, 19}
- Node 15: {7, 9, 12}
- Node 16: {3, 7, 11}
- Node 17: {1, 7, 10}
- Node 18: {4, 5, 8, 19}
- Node 19: {5, 14, 18}

Considering the neighbors for each node, we find the following 3-stars:
<Node 3, (1, 9, 16)>
<Node 5, (6, 9, 18)>
<Node 7, (14, 15, 16)>
<Node 8, (0, 9, 12)>
<Node 9, (2, 5, 8)>
<Node 15, (7, 9, 12)>
<Node 16, (3, 7, 11)>
<Node 18, (5, 8, 19)>
<Node 19, (14, 18, 5)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we have a total of 9 unique 3-stars. Thus, the final number inside brackets is [9].
