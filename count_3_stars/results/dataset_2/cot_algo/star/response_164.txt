Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 10) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 0) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 2) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 13, 6
Node 1: 5, 9, 7, 0
Node 2: 3, 13, 11, 10
Node 3: 14, 2
Node 4: 7, 12, 13, 14
Node 5: 9, 12, 1
Node 6: 12, 14, 0
Node 7: 4, 11, 13, 1, 8
Node 8: 9, 7, 13, 14
Node 9: 5, 8, 10, 1
Node 10: 9, 12, 2
Node 11: 7, 13, 12, 14, 2
Node 12: 5, 4, 10, 6, 11
Node 13: 4, 7, 8, 2, 11, 0
Node 14: 4, 3, 8, 11, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us: 4 (from Node 1) + 10 (from Node 7) + 4 (from Node 9) + 10 (from Node 12) + 20 (from Node 13) + 10 (from Node 14) = 58.

Thus, the final total number of 3-stars is [58].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 13)>
<9, (1, 8, 10)>
<12, (5, 10, 6)>
<13, (7, 11, 14)>
<14, (3, 8, 11)>
