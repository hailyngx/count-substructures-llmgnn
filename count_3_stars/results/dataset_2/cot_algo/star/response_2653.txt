Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 6) 

Response:
First, we'll create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 8, 3}
- Node 1: {5, 4, 8, 6}
- Node 2: {8, 6, 3}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 7, 2, 0, 6}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 1, 4, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {4, 2, 1, 3}
- Node 7: {9, 3}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 2, 0, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 3, 7}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 52 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- <5, (4, 3, 9)>
- <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- <8, (4, 3, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (3, 5, 7)>
