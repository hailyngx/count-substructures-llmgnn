Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 9) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 12) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (15, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 3) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (16, 4) (16, 7) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 6) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (6, 18) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 2) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 12) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 19) (10, 12) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 10) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 11) 

Response:
The graph has a total of 20 nodes and 60 edges, and the edges are provided. Let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 9, 13, 15}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 14, 19}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 16, 18}
- Node 5: {4, 11, 17}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 17, 18}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 16, 17}
- Node 8: {9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 10: {12}
- Node 11: {5, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {10, 11, 18, 19}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 17, 19}
- Node 14: {2, 11}
- Node 15: {1}
- Node 16: {4, 7}
- Node 17: {5, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 18: {4, 6, 12}
- Node 19: {2, 12, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9, Node 12, Node 13, Node 17, and Node 19

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they each participate in:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (as it only has 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 29 \).

So, the final answer, in brackets, is [29]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 9, 13>
- <4, 9, 16>
- <4, 9, 18>
- <4, 16, 18>
- <6, 7, 17>
- <1, 13, 17>
- <4, 5, 17>
- <1, 9, 15>
- <7, 16, 17>
- <12, 18, 19>
- <11, 12, 14>
- <2, 6, 19>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <0, 1, 13>
- <5, 11, 17>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <0, 1, 15>
- <5, 17, 11>
- <7, 13, 17>
- <4, 9, 5>
- <0, 13, 1>
- <6, 16, 17>
- <2, 14, 11>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <3, 9, 7>
- <12, 18, 6>
- <6, 18, 17>
- <2, 19, 12>
