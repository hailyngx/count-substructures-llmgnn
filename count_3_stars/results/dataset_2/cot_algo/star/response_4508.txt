Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 6) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 12) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {1, 9, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 7, 10}
- Node 2: {3, 10, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 10, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {9, 11}
- Node 6: {8, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 11}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 3, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {6, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 6, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 3, 10, 12}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
- Node 1: [\( \binom{5}{3} \)] = 10
- Node 2: [\( \binom{5}{3} \)] = 10
- Node 3: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4
- Node 4: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
- Node 8: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4
- Node 9: [\( \binom{5}{3} \)] = 10
- Node 10: [\( \binom{6}{3} \)] = 20
- Node 11: [\( \binom{6}{3} \)] = 20
- Node 12: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4
- Node 14: [\( \binom{5}{3} \)] = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 80

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 14), (1, 9)>
<1, (0, 14), (0, 9), (3, 10)>
<2, (3, 10), (3, 14), (10, 14)>
<3, (1, 10), (1, 14), (10, 14)>
<4, (1, 8), (1, 9), (8, 9)>
<8, (4, 9), (4, 12), (9, 12)>
<9, (0, 1), (0, 14), (1, 14)>
<10, (1, 11), (1, 14), (11, 14)>
<11, (5, 9), (5, 11), (9, 11)>
<12, (6, 8), (6, 13), (8, 13)>
