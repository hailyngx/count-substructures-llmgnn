Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 16) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 0) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 13) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 11) (16, 17) (16, 1) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 9) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 13) (11, 7) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 12) (9, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 10) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 7
- Node 1: 13, 16, 17
- Node 2: 0, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 10
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 12
- Node 5: 3, 6, 8, 15
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 4, 11
- Node 8: 5, 8, 10, 11
- Node 9: 2, 12
- Node 10: 3, 8, 19
- Node 11: 7, 8, 12, 15
- Node 12: 4, 9, 11
- Node 13: 1, 15, 18
- Node 15: 5, 11, 13, 18
- Node 16: 1, 17
- Node 17: 1, 14, 16
- Node 18: 13, 15, 19
- Node 19: 8, 10, 18

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
From the neighbor sets:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 13, Node 16, Node 17 each have 3 or fewer neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 15, Node 18, and Node 19 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, 6, 12>
- <4, 7, 12>
- <4, 7, 11>
- <4, 7, 0>
- <5, 8, 11>
- <5, 8, 15>
- <5, 8, 19>
- <5, 11, 15>
- <5, 11, 18>
- <7, 0, 11>
- <8, 10, 19>
- <9, 2, 12>
- <13, 15, 18>
- <18, 15, 19>
