Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 11) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 10) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5, 9, 11}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 6, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 5, 8, 12}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 10, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 8, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 4, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {6, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 14: Neighbors {7, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 8 can each form 1 3-star
- Node 1, Node 3, Node 10, and Node 13 can each form 4 3-stars
- Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 11 can each form 1 3-star

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 10)>
- <1, (10, 11, 13)>
- <3, (1, 11, 13)>
- <10, (7, 1, 14)>
- <13, (7, 11, 1)>
- <2, (3, 6, 11)>
- <5, (3, 6, 13)>
