Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 22) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 29) (20, 2) (25, 29) (25, 28) (28, 6) (28, 25) (28, 29) (29, 3) (29, 25) (29, 28) (29, 14) (18, 23) (19, 26) (19, 8) (19, 10) (26, 19) (26, 14) (26, 15) (26, 0) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 11) (15, 26) (15, 12) (7, 1) (7, 24) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 22) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 27) (16, 21) (16, 2) (16, 5) (21, 16) (21, 22) (21, 2) (2, 20) (2, 16) (2, 21) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 11) (23, 18) (23, 13) (23, 27) (0, 6) (0, 26) (0, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 13) (24, 7) (24, 27) (24, 5) (5, 12) (5, 16) (5, 0) (5, 24) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 22) (22, 1) (22, 8) (22, 21) (22, 11) (27, 14) (27, 23) (27, 24) (27, 13) (13, 23) (13, 10) (13, 27) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by determining the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {5, 6}
Node 1: {3, 7, 9, 22}
Node 2: {16, 20, 21}
Node 3: {1, 10, 17, 29}
Node 5: {0, 12, 16, 24}
Node 6: {0, 9, 10, 28}
Node 7: {1, 24}
Node 8: {9, 17, 19, 22}
Node 9: {1, 6, 8}
Node 10: {3, 6, 13, 19}
Node 11: {12, 17, 22}
Node 12: {5, 11, 15}
Node 13: {10, 23, 27}
Node 14: {26, 27, 29}
Node 15: {12, 26}
Node 16: {2, 5}
Node 17: {3, 8, 11}
Node 18: {23}
Node 19: {8, 10, 26}
Node 20: {2}
Node 21: {2, 16, 22}
Node 22: {1, 8, 11, 21}
Node 23: {13, 18, 27}
Node 24: {5, 7, 27}
Node 25: {28, 29}
Node 26: {14, 15, 19}
Node 27: {13, 14, 24, 23}
Node 28: {6, 25, 29}
Node 29: {3, 14, 25, 28}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 1 3-star
Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 2: 1 3-star
Node 3: 1 3-star
Node 5: 1 3-star
Node 6: 1 3-star
Node 8: 1 3-star
Node 9: 1 3-star
Node 10: 1 3-star
Node 11: 1 3-star
Node 12: 1 3-star
Node 13: 1 3-star
Node 14: 1 3-star
Node 15: 1 3-star
Node 16: 1 3-star
Node 17: 1 3-star
Node 19: 1 3-star
Node 21: 1 3-star
Node 22: 1 3-star
Node 23: 1 3-star
Node 24: 1 3-star
Node 26: 1 3-star
Node 27: 1 3-star
Node 28: 1 3-star
Node 29: 1 3-star

Since each node contributes to a unique 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 26. Therefore, the final answer is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, 5, 6>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 16, 21>
<3, 10, 19>
<5, 12, 24>
<6, 9, 28>
<8, 17, 22>
<11, 17, 22>
<13, 23, 27>
<14, 26, 29>
<15, 26, 27>
<18, 23, 27>
