Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighborhood sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 8, 9, 2}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors (3-stars are formed with these nodes):
    - Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For nodes with 4 neighbors:
    - Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For nodes with 5 neighbors:
    - Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars:
1 (from Node 8) + 4 (from each of the Nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9) + 10 (from each of the Nodes 0, 4, and 7) = 1 + 4*5 + 10*3 = 1 + 20 + 30 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 0, 7)>
<7, (1, 0, 4)>
