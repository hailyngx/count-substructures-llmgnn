Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 8, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 6, 3, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 2}
- Node 4: {9, 6, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 1, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 4, 1, 2}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 0}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 9, 6, 4, 1, 7}

Now let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 and Node 9 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 2, Node 4, and Node 8 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 2 \times 4 + 3 \times 10 = 32 \), so the final answer is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 9, 6)>
<1, (5, 9, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (9, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
<9, (5, 4, 1)>
<9, (6, 4, 1)>
<2, (5, 9, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (9, 6, 8)>
<4, (9, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<8, (9, 6, 2)>
<8, (5, 6, 2)>
<8, (5, 9, 2)>
<8, (5, 9, 6)>
