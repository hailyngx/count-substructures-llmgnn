Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 22) (16, 23) (16, 9) (13, 11) (13, 15) (22, 16) (22, 3) (12, 20) (12, 10) (12, 23) (27, 21) (27, 9) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 23) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 7) (28, 17) (28, 25) (29, 20) (29, 5) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 21) (15, 13) (15, 20) (15, 2) (20, 12) (20, 29) (20, 15) (20, 17) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 17) (17, 28) (17, 20) (17, 24) (3, 11) (3, 22) (3, 8) (5, 11) (5, 29) (5, 0) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 25) (19, 10) (7, 26) (7, 0) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 24) (6, 25) (6, 4) (21, 27) (21, 14) (21, 18) (8, 11) (8, 3) (18, 0) (18, 21) (18, 10) (18, 25) (23, 16) (23, 12) (23, 1) (2, 15) (2, 19) (2, 10) (4, 19) (4, 6) (9, 16) (9, 27) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 18) (10, 2) (25, 28) (25, 19) (25, 6) (25, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 7, 18}
- Node 1: {6, 23, 26}
- Node 2: {10, 15, 19}
- Node 3: {8, 11, 22}
- Node 4: {6, 19}
- Node 5: {0, 11, 29}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 24, 25}
- Node 7: {0, 26}
- Node 8: {3, 11}
- Node 9: {16, 27}
- Node 10: {2, 12, 18, 19}
- Node 11: {3, 5, 13, 16}
- Node 12: {10, 20, 23}
- Node 13: {11, 15}
- Node 14: {21}
- Node 15: {2, 13, 20}
- Node 16: {9, 11, 22}
- Node 17: {20, 24, 28}
- Node 18: {0, 10, 18, 21, 25}
- Node 19: {2, 4, 10, 25}
- Node 20: {12, 15, 17, 29}
- Node 21: {14, 18, 27}
- Node 22: {3, 16}
- Node 23: {1, 12, 16}
- Node 24: {6, 17, 26}
- Node 25: {6, 18, 19, 28}
- Node 26: {1, 7, 24}
- Node 27: {9, 21}
- Node 28: {17, 25}
- Node 29: {5, 20}

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 (node 11)
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 = 15

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
