Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 2) (18, 9) (18, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 17) (5, 13) (5, 16) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 9) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 9) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 14) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 12) (12, 10) (12, 19) (12, 16) (11, 19) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 9) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 6) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 12) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 11) (3, 18) (3, 13) (3, 17) (7, 11) (6, 14) (6, 17) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 1: {9, 13, 15, 16}
- Node 2: {4, 8}
- Node 3: {13, 17, 18}
- Node 4: {2, 19}
- Node 5: {13, 14, 16}
- Node 6: {14, 17}
- Node 7: {11}
- Node 8: {2, 17, 19}
- Node 9: {1, 11, 15, 18}
- Node 10: {12, 14, 15}
- Node 11: {7, 9, 14, 19}
- Node 12: {10, 16, 19}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 5, 15}
- Node 14: {5, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 15: {1, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 16: {1, 5, 12, 19}
- Node 17: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 18: {3, 9}
- Node 19: {4, 8, 11, 12}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

For Node 1:
- Neighbor set size = 4
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <1, 9, 13>
  - <1, 9, 15>
  - <1, 9, 16>
  - <1, 13, 15>

For Node 3:
- Neighbor set size = 3
- Number of 3-stars = 0

For Node 5:
- Neighbor set size = 3
- Number of 3-stars = 0

For Node 8:
- Neighbor set size = 3
- Number of 3-stars = 0

For Node 9:
- Neighbor set size = 4
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <9, 1, 13>
  - <9, 1, 15>
  - <9, 1, 18>
  - <9, 1, 11>

For Node 11:
- Neighbor set size = 4
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <11, 9, 14>
  - <11, 9, 19>
  - <11, 14, 19>
  - <11, 14, 7>

For Node 13:
- Neighbor set size = 4
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <13, 1, 15>
  - <13, 1, 9>
  - <13, 1, 5>
  - <13, 5, 15>

For Node 14:
- Neighbor set size = 4
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <14, 11, 9>
  - <14, 11, 19>
  - <14, 11, 7>
  - <14, 5, 10>

For Node 15:
- Neighbor set size = 4
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <15, 1, 9>
  - <15, 1, 13>
  - <15, 1, 10>
  - <15, 9, 13>

For Node 16:
- Neighbor set size = 4
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <16, 1, 12>
  - <16, 1, 5>
  - <16, 1, 19>
  - <16, 5, 12>

For Node 19:
- Neighbor set size = 4
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <19, 4, 8>
  - <19, 4, 11>
  - <19, 8, 12>
  - <19, 11, 12>

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of \(4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36\). 
Therefore, the final answer is [36].
