Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 16) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 17) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 5) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 19) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 1) (15, 7) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 12) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 18) (16, 4) (1, 2) (1, 19) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 1) (13, 14) (13, 9) (13, 18) (13, 6) (9, 13) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 6) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 18) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 13) (6, 12) (18, 16) (18, 13) (18, 17) (4, 16) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 16
- Node 1: 2, 19, 10, 12
- Node 2: 5, 1, 17
- Node 3: 8, 5
- Node 4: 16
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 8, 15, 13, 12
- Node 7: 11, 15, 5
- Node 8: 10, 6, 3
- Node 9: 13
- Node 10: 14, 8, 19, 1
- Node 11: 14, 7, 19
- Node 12: 15, 1, 6
- Node 13: 14, 9, 18, 6
- Node 14: 11, 13, 10
- Node 15: 7, 16, 6, 12
- Node 16: 0, 15, 18, 4
- Node 17: 2, 19, 18
- Node 18: 16, 13, 17
- Node 19: 11, 17, 10, 1

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 (Degree 4)
- Node 2 (Degree 3)
- Node 5 (Degree 3)
- Node 6 (Degree 4)
- Node 7 (Degree 3)
- Node 8 (Degree 3)
- Node 10 (Degree 4)
- Node 11 (Degree 3)
- Node 12 (Degree 3)
- Node 13 (Degree 4)
- Node 15 (Degree 4)
- Node 16 (Degree 4)
- Node 17 (Degree 3)
- Node 18 (Degree 3)
- Node 19 (Degree 4)

For these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of them:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 28 \). 
So, the final answer is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 10, 12, 19> 
<1, 10, 12, 15> 
<1, 10, 12, 6> 
<1, 10, 19, 12> 
<1, 10, 19, 15> 
<1, 10, 19, 6> 
<1, 12, 15, 6> 
<6, 13, 12, 15> 
<6, 13, 12, 1> 
<6, 13, 15, 1> 
<6, 13, 15, 12> 
<1, 13, 12, 15> 
<16, 4, 18, 13>
