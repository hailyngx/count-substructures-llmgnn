Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 9) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 9) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 6) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 0) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 9) (9, 12) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 2) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 14) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 13}
- Node 2: {1, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 12}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 8, 10}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 11, 12}
- Node 7: {3, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 9: {2, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {5, 8, 14}
- Node 11: {6, 7, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 4, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 8, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {9, 10, 13}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

In total, there are 47 3-stars in the graph, which can be represented as [47].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 12)>, <1, (0, 5, 13)>, <3, (2, 7, 12)>, <4, (5, 6, 12)>, <5, (1, 4, 10)>, <6, (0, 3, 12)>, <7, (8, 9, 11)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 12, 14)>, <10, (5, 8, 14)>, <12, (0, 3, 6)>, <13, (8, 11, 14)>, <14, (9, 10, 13)>.
