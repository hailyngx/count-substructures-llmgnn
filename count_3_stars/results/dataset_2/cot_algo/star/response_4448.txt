Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the list of edges is provided. Let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Now let's identify the 3-star structures:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 4, 7: <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 7, 8, 9: <4, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [2].
