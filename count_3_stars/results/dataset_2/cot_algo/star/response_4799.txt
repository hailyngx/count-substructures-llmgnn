Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 15) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (0, 6) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 10) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 11) (19, 0) (19, 5) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 16) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 18) (2, 12) (2, 11) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 17) (3, 7) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 4) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 1) (17, 8) (17, 18) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 19}
- Node 1: {6, 8, 16, 18}
- Node 2: {11, 12}
- Node 3: {4, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 11, 13}
- Node 5: {11, 12, 19}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 10, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 17}
- Node 9: {6, 15, 18}
- Node 10: {7, 14, 15}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 12: {2, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 13: {4, 7}
- Node 14: {10, 16}
- Node 15: {9, 10, 16}
- Node 16: {1, 14, 15}
- Node 17: {8, 18}
- Node 18: {1, 9, 17}
- Node 19: {0, 5}

Next, we identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 15, and Node 18.

For each of these nodes, we apply the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of unique 3-stars they are involved in:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 27

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [27].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 6, 8, 16>
- <6, 0, 19>
- <6, 1, 8, 9>
- <6, 8, 17>
- <7, 3, 4>
- <7, 10, 14>
- <7, 10, 15>
- <7, 10, 16>
- <7, 11, 12>
- <7, 11, 13>
- <10, 15, 16>
- <11, 2, 5>
- <11, 2, 12>
- <11, 4, 13>
- <11, 5, 12>
- <12, 2, 11>
- <12, 5, 19>
- <12, 7, 11>
- <12, 7, 13>
- <15, 9, 18>
