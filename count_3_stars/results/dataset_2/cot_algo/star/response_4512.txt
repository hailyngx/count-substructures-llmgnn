Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
Node 0: {9, 8, 3, 2}
Node 1: {9, 4, 2}
Node 2: {9, 7, 6, 0, 1}
Node 3: {5, 9, 6, 0}
Node 4: {5, 7, 8, 1}
Node 5: {6, 4, 3}
Node 6: {5, 7, 8, 3, 2}
Node 7: {4, 6, 8, 2}
Node 8: {4, 7, 6, 0}
Node 9: {2, 3, 1, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 6, and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each.

For nodes with 4 neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the 3-stars formed by these nodes: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (8, 3, 9)>
<2, (7, 6, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 3)>
<9, (1, 0, 2)>
