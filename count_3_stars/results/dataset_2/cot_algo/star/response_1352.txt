Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {9, 3, 2, 7, 4}
Node 1: {5, 4, 8}
Node 2: {9, 6, 8, 0, 4}
Node 3: {5, 0, 6, 8}
Node 4: {9, 1, 2, 0}
Node 5: {6, 1, 3}
Node 6: {5, 3, 7, 2}
Node 7: {6, 8, 0}
Node 8: {9, 1, 3, 2, 7}
Node 9: {8, 4, 2, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 46 3-stars in the graph. So the final answer is [46].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 9, 1>
<8, 1, 3>
