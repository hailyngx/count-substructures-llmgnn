Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (26, 9) (26, 21) (26, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 9) (6, 26) (6, 24) (6, 25) (6, 16) (18, 22) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 29) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 15) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 16) (23, 20) (23, 13) (10, 15) (10, 24) (11, 3) (11, 4) (3, 22) (3, 11) (3, 12) (25, 6) (25, 1) (25, 14) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 1) (20, 23) (20, 0) (20, 2) (4, 22) (4, 11) (19, 8) (19, 15) (7, 5) (7, 18) (21, 26) (21, 16) (15, 22) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 28) (13, 23) (13, 17) (13, 2) (17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 28) (17, 27) (8, 19) (8, 29) (8, 27) (16, 6) (16, 23) (16, 21) (16, 14) (27, 17) (27, 8) (27, 1) (2, 20) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (24, 6) (24, 10) (29, 18) (29, 8) (1, 5) (1, 25) (1, 0) (1, 27) (28, 15) (28, 17) (14, 18) (14, 25) (14, 16) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's define the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 17, 20}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 25, 27}
- Node 2: {12, 13, 20}
- Node 3: {11, 12, 22}
- Node 4: {11, 22}
- Node 5: {1, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 16, 24, 25, 26}
- Node 7: {5, 18}
- Node 8: {19, 27, 29}
- Node 9: {6, 26}
- Node 10: {15, 24}
- Node 11: {3, 4}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 17, 23}
- Node 14: {12, 16, 18, 25}
- Node 15: {10, 19, 22, 28}
- Node 16: {6, 14, 21, 23}
- Node 17: {0, 13, 27, 28}
- Node 18: {7, 14, 19, 22, 29}
- Node 19: {8, 15}
- Node 20: {0, 2, 23}
- Node 21: {16, 26}
- Node 22: {3, 4, 15, 18, 23}
- Node 23: {13, 16, 20, 22}
- Node 24: {6, 10}
- Node 25: {1, 6, 14}
- Node 26: {6, 9, 21}
- Node 27: {1, 8, 17}
- Node 28: {15, 17}
- Node 29: {8, 18}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 6 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 22 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 23 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 27 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [43], and the unique 3-stars found are:
