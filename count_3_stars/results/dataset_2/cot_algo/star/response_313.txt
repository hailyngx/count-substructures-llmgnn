Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph: node 0, node 2, and node 3. 

For node 0, the 3-stars formed are: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (0, 1, 3)>
<0, (0, 2, 5)>
<0, (0, 3, 6)>
<0, (0, 4, 6)>

For node 2, the 3-stars formed are: 
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>

For node 3, the 3-stars formed are: 
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we have a total of [18].
