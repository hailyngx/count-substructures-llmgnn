Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 19) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (19, 0) (19, 5) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 15) (10, 8) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 18) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 6) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 13) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 9) (7, 18) (12, 16) (12, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 13) (17, 4) (2, 16) (2, 4) (4, 11) (4, 17) (4, 2) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 13) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 12) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 18) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated as follows:

1. For each node, we will find its neighbors:
- Node 0: {14, 10, 19, 6}
- Node 1: {11, 5}
- Node 2: {16, 4}
- Node 3: {5, 13}
- Node 4: {11, 17, 2}
- Node 5: {19, 8, 1, 3}
- Node 6: {0, 8, 12}
- Node 7: {16, 15, 9, 18}
- Node 8: {5, 10, 6}
- Node 9: {11, 15, 7, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 14, 15, 8}
- Node 11: {16, 1, 9, 4}
- Node 12: {16, 6}
- Node 13: {3, 18, 9}
- Node 14: {0, 10}
- Node 15: {10, 7, 9, 18}
- Node 16: {11, 7, 12, 2}
- Node 17: {4}
- Node 18: {15, 7, 13}
- Node 19: {0, 5}

2. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 9: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star

3. Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 26

Therefore, the final answer is [26], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 14, 10, 19>
- <0, 14, 10, 6>
- <0, 14, 19, 6>
- <0, 10, 19, 6>
- <5, 19, 8, 1>
- <5, 19, 8, 3>
- <5, 8, 1, 3>
- <7, 16, 15, 9>
- <7, 16, 15, 18>
- <7, 16, 9, 18>
- <7, 15, 9, 18>
- <9, 11, 15, 7>
- <9, 11, 15, 18>
- <9, 7, 15, 18>
- <10, 14, 15, 8>
- <10, 14, 15, 6>
- <10, 14, 8, 6>
- <10, 15, 8, 6>
- <11, 1, 9, 4>
- <11, 9, 4, 17>
- <11, 4, 17, 2>
- <16, 2, 4, 17>
- <7, 18, 13>
- <13, 3, 18>
