Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 6) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 3: {8, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {2, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 9, 11}
- Node 8: {0, 3}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10}
- Node 10: {2, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 5, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 13, 14, 3}
- Node 13: {1, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 4, 12}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

- Node 2 and Node 9 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 5 and Node 12 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 7, Node 11, and Node 13 have 4 neighbors each, but they cannot form any 3-stars because they need at least 3 neighbors.
- No other nodes have 3 or more neighbors.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 10 = 20\).

Thus, the final answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (5, 9, 10)>
- <5, (1, 2, 9)>
- <5, (2, 9, 12)>
- <9, (2, 5, 10)>
- <9, (5, 7, 11)>
- <12, (4, 5, 13)>
