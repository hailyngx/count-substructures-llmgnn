Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 9) (15, 16) (15, 3) (5, 6) (5, 17) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 10) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 1) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 18) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (2, 11) (2, 17) (2, 10) (9, 3) (9, 4) (18, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 11, 5, 6, 7
Node 1: 8, 4, 14
Node 2: 11, 17, 10
Node 3: 15, 19, 9
Node 4: 12, 9, 1
Node 5: 6, 17, 0
Node 6: 5, 7, 19, 0
Node 7: 6, 0, 14, 13
Node 8: 17, 19, 1
Node 9: 3, 4
Node 10: 13, 2
Node 11: 0, 13, 2
Node 12: 16, 17, 4, 18
Node 13: 11, 7, 17, 10
Node 14: 7, 1
Node 15: 3, 16
Node 16: 12, 15
Node 17: 5, 13, 12, 8, 2
Node 18: 12
Node 19: 3, 6, 8

Now let's check for each node if it has 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 19

For each of these nodes, we will calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \):

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 32

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (11, 13, 17)>
<3, (15, 19, 9)>
<4, (12, 18, 17)>
<5, (6, 7, 0)>
<6, (5, 19, 0)>
<7, (0, 14, 13)>
<8, (19, 3, 8)>
<12, (16, 17, 4)>
<13, (7, 17, 10)>
<17, (13, 12, 8)>
<19, (6, 8, 3)>
