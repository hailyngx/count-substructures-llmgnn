Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 15) (16, 4) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 13) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 5) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 4) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 13) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 2) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 8) (10, 4) (8, 6) (8, 10) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 12) (4, 16) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 12) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 4) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 7, 19
Node 1: 0, 4, 11
Node 2: 5, 9, 17
Node 3: 9, 12, 15
Node 4: 1, 10, 12, 16, 17
Node 5: 2, 13, 14
Node 6: 8, 9
Node 7: 0, 9, 13
Node 8: 6, 10
Node 9: 2, 3, 6, 7
Node 10: 4, 8, 13, 15
Node 11: 1, 15
Node 12: 3, 4, 19
Node 13: 5, 7, 10, 15
Node 14: 5, 16, 19
Node 15: 3, 10, 11, 13
Node 16: 4, 14
Node 17: 2, 4, 19
Node 19: 0, 12, 14, 17

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26. Therefore, the final answer is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (1, 10, 17)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <10, (4, 13, 15)>, <13, (5, 7, 10)>, <19, (12, 14, 17)>.
