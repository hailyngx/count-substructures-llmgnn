Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 9) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (5, 19) (5, 16) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 6) (8, 17) (8, 6) (0, 7) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 9) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 12) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 13) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 1) (3, 4) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 18) (13, 16) (13, 9) (13, 12) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 15) (18, 1) 

Response:
Since this is a connected graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will first find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {7}
Node 1: {11, 12, 18}
Node 2: {4, 6, 11}
Node 3: {4}
Node 4: {2, 3, 7, 12, 15}
Node 5: {16, 19}
Node 6: {2, 8, 18}
Node 7: {0, 4}
Node 8: {6, 17}
Node 9: {10, 13, 14, 19}
Node 10: {9, 15, 18}
Node 11: {1, 2, 14}
Node 12: {1, 4, 13, 15}
Node 13: {9, 12, 16}
Node 14: {9, 11, 17, 19}
Node 15: {4, 10, 12, 18}
Node 16: {5, 13, 17}
Node 17: {8, 14, 16}
Node 18: {1, 6, 10, 15}
Node 19: {5, 9, 14}

Now we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 4 can form a 3-star with {2, 12, 15}
Node 9 can form a 3-star with {13, 14, 19}

So, there are 2 3-stars in the graph.  
Thus, the final answer is [2].
