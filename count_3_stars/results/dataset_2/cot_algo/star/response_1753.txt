Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 4, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 3, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 4, 7, 1, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 9, 6, 7, 1}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 7, 0, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 2, 8, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 3, 2, 1, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 3, 0}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 4, 2>
- <1, 7, 2>
- <2, 5, 4>
- <2, 7, 1>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <2, 7, 0>
- <2, 1, 3>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <3, 6, 8>
- <3, 7, 1>
- <3, 7, 2>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 7, 2>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <4, 7, 3>
- <5, 9, 8>
- <5, 2, 8>
- <6, 8, 7>
- <7, 1, 3>
- <7, 1, 2>
- <8, 5, 9>
