Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: {2, 3, 6}
Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 7}
Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 9}
Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
Node 7: {2, 3, 6, 8}
Node 8: {1, 5, 7}
Node 9: {1, 4, 6}

Now, let's calculate how many 3-stars can be formed using the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 8, 9
Number of 3-stars formed with these nodes = 4 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
