Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 12) (15, 10) (15, 9) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 4) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 12) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 19) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 4) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 13) (16, 3) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 0) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 9) (12, 3) (12, 18) (7, 3) (7, 18) (7, 8) (5, 2) (5, 18) (6, 8) (6, 13) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 0) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) (1, 0) 

Response:
The given graph represents the following connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 13, and 16.
- Node 1 is connected to node 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 16, 17, and 18.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 12, and 16.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 10, and 17.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 18.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 8 and 13.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 18.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 9, and 10.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 15, and 19.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 15.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 13, 14, and 17.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 3 and 18.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 11.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 16, and 17.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 9 and 10.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 14, and 17.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 11, 14, and 19.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, 12, and 19.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 9, 17, and 18.

Now, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {5, 16, 17, 18}  
Applying \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) we get 4 3-stars:  
<2, (5, 17, 18)>, <2, (5, 16, 18)>, <2, (5, 16, 17)>, <2, (17, 18, 5)>

Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {0, 10, 17}  
Thus, only 1 3-star is formed:  
<4, (0, 10, 17)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars in this graph:  
Total = 4 + 1 = 5  

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
