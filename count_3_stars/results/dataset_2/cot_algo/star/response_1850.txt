Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 10) (15, 12) (27, 11) (27, 1) (27, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 21) (4, 25) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 24) (7, 13) (3, 25) (3, 14) (3, 2) (25, 4) (25, 3) (25, 16) (18, 22) (18, 9) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 16) (22, 6) (22, 29) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 21) (17, 10) (17, 9) (8, 2) (8, 28) (28, 8) (28, 29) (28, 5) (29, 22) (29, 28) (29, 1) (29, 14) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 3) (14, 29) (14, 0) (26, 22) (26, 11) (11, 27) (11, 26) (11, 5) (21, 4) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 20) (21, 19) (19, 21) (16, 7) (16, 25) (16, 22) (6, 27) (6, 22) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 20) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 27) (1, 29) (1, 0) (5, 28) (5, 11) (12, 15) (12, 0) (12, 24) (12, 9) (12, 20) (20, 21) (20, 24) (20, 12) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 12, 14, 21}
- Node 1: {0, 27, 29}
- Node 2: {3, 8, 13}
- Node 3: {2, 14, 25}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 15, 21, 25}
- Node 5: {11, 28}
- Node 6: {22, 27}
- Node 7: {4, 13, 16, 24}
- Node 8: {2, 28}
- Node 9: {12, 17, 18}
- Node 10: {15, 17, 21}
- Node 11: {5, 26, 27}
- Node 12: {0, 9, 15, 20, 24}
- Node 13: {2, 7, 9, 24}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 29}
- Node 15: {4, 10, 12}
- Node 16: {7, 22, 25}
- Node 17: {9, 10}
- Node 18: {9, 22}
- Node 19: {21}
- Node 20: {12, 20, 21, 24}
- Node 21: {0, 4, 10, 19, 20}
- Node 22: {6, 16, 18, 26, 29}
- Node 25: {3, 4, 16}
- Node 26: {11, 22}
- Node 27: {1, 6, 11}
- Node 28: {5, 8, 29}
- Node 29: {1, 14, 22, 28}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:

Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 7, 21, and 25: <4, (7, 21, 25)>
Node 12 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 9, 15, and 20: <12, (9, 15, 20)>
Node 22 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 16, 18, and 29: <22, (16, 18, 29)>
Node 0 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 14, and 21: <0, (1, 14, 21)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 8, and 13: <2, (3, 8, 13)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 11, 26, and 28: <5, (11, 26, 28)>

Summing them up, we have a total of 6 unique 3-stars, so the answer is [6].
