Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, we will list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5}
Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7, 8}
Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}
Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 5}
Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4}
Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 7: Neighbors {1, 4, 8}
Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
Node 9: Neighbors {6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 6, 8) -> <4, (2, 6, 8)>
Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors (7, 8, 5) -> <1, (7, 8, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars is 2, so the final answer is [2].
