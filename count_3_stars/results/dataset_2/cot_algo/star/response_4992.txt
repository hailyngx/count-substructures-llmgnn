Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 48, which we put inside brackets: [48].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 3, 4>
<0, 2, 3, 9>
<0, 2, 4, 8>
<0, 3, 4, 8>
<1, 2, 3, 9>
<3, 5, 6, 7>
