Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 6, 8}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula inom{n}{3} for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Not enough neighbors for 3-star formation
- Node 1: Not enough neighbors for 3-star formation
- Node 3: Not enough neighbors for 3-star formation
- Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) (10 unique 3-stars)
- Node 5: Not enough neighbors for 3-star formation
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 7: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) (20 unique 3-stars)
- Node 8: Not enough neighbors for 3-star formation
- Node 9: Not enough neighbors for 3-star formation

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 20 = 34

So, the final answer is [34], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
