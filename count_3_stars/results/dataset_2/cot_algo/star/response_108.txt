Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 7}

Now, let's identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: No 3-stars (only 4 neighbors)
- Node 3: No 3-stars (only 4 neighbors)
- Node 4: No 3-stars (only 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-stars (only 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 64

Thus, the final answer is [64].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
