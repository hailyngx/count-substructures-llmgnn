Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-star graphs in this network, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 4, 6, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 7, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 4, 6, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8, 0, 6, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 8, 1}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 1, 3, 2, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 1, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9, 4, 7, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 2, 3, 0}

Now, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars. 

- Node 1, Node 4, and Node 8 each have 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 6, and Node 9 each have 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46 \). 

So, the final answer is [46], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 1)>, <8, (5, 9, 1)>, <0, (9, 4, 6)>, <2, (9, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 3, 2)>
