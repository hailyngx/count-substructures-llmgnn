Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 10) (17, 3) (1, 5) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 17) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 13) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (7, 14) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 15) (13, 11) (13, 16) (19, 4) (19, 12) (16, 5) (16, 13) (16, 4) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 12) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 4) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 9) (18, 1) (18, 15) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 19) (12, 15) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {14, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 18, 8}
- Node 2: {10, 9, 4}
- Node 3: {17, 11, 9, 12}
- Node 4: {2, 19, 16, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 8, 16}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 12}
- Node 7: {14, 6, 0, 15}
- Node 8: {1, 5}
- Node 9: {14, 3, 2, 15, 4}
- Node 10: {17, 2}
- Node 11: {3, 13}
- Node 12: {3, 6, 19, 15}
- Node 13: {11, 16}
- Node 14: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 15: {7, 9, 18, 12}
- Node 16: {5, 13, 4}
- Node 17: {10, 3}
- Node 18: {1, 15}
- Node 19: {4, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars by considering nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star formed
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors => \( C(4, 3) = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors => \( C(4, 3) = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors => \( C(4, 3) = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star formed
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors => \( C(4, 3) = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors => \( C(5, 3) = 10 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors => \( C(4, 3) = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors => \( C(4, 3) = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star formed

Adding them up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].

Unique 3-stars found:

<3, 9, 4>
<3, 9, 15>
<3, 13, 16>
<4, 9, 14>
<5, 1, 8>
<7, 14, 0>
<9, 3, 15>
