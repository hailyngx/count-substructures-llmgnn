Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 2) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 7, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 8, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {12, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 11}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 9, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 8, 10}
- Node 10: Neighbors {3, 6, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 8, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {5, 6, 12, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 3, 13>
- <3, 8, 13>
- <8, 10, 13>
- <10, 6, 13>
- <11, 2, 13>
- <12, 0, 14>
- <13, 5, 14>
- <14, 6, 12>
