Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (3, 7) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 14) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {8, 14, 2}
Node 1: {8, 11, 4, 14}
Node 2: {5, 9, 12, 0}
Node 3: {7}
Node 4: {8, 10, 11, 6, 1}
Node 5: {13, 2, 11, 7}
Node 6: {4, 14}
Node 7: {5, 8, 10, 12, 3}
Node 8: {4, 10, 0, 1, 7}
Node 9: {2, 13, 12}
Node 10: {8, 11, 12, 7, 4}
Node 11: {5, 10, 14, 4, 1}
Node 12: {9, 13, 10, 7, 2}
Node 13: {5, 9, 12}
Node 14: {11, 4, 0, 6, 1}

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 12: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 14: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding up all the 3-stars:
1 (from node 0) + 10 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 2) + 10 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 5) + 10 (from node 7) + 10 (from node 8) + 10 (from node 10) + 10 (from node 11) + 10 (from node 12) + 10 (from node 14) = 89

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [89].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (8, 14, 2)>
<1, (8, 11, 4)>
<2, (5, 9, 12)>
<4, (8, 10, 11)>
<5, (13, 2, 11)>
<7, (8, 10, 12)>
<8, (4, 10, 11)>
<10, (8, 11, 12)>
<11, (10, 4, 14)>
<12, (9, 13, 10)>
<14, (4, 0, 6)>
