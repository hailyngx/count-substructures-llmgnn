Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 14) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 0) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 10, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {7, 9, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 12}
- Node 8: {1, 9, 10}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 11: {4, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {7, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 6, 11}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 5, 11, 12}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes {2, 4, 14}
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 2, 9}
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes {2, 5, 6}
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 11, 12}
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes {4, 13, 14}
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes {7, 11, 14}

Counting all unique 3-stars, we get a total of 6. Thus, the final answer is [6].
