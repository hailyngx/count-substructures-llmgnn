Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 10) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 15) (2, 18) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 0) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 15) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 19) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 7) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 7) (15, 10) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 11) (17, 5) (4, 2) (4, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 4) (5, 17) (5, 1) (1, 12) (1, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7, 18}
- Node 1: {5, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 18, 19}
- Node 3: {11, 14}
- Node 4: {2, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 17}
- Node 6: {7, 9, 14, 19}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 12, 15}
- Node 8: {10, 13, 19}
- Node 9: {6, 11, 13, 15}
- Node 10: {8, 15, 18}
- Node 11: {3, 9, 19}
- Node 12: {1, 7, 13}
- Node 13: {8, 9, 12, 15}
- Node 14: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 15: {7, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 17: {5}
- Node 18: {0, 2, 10, 19}
- Node 19: {2, 6, 8, 11, 18}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, 17
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 11
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 8, 9, 14, 18, 19

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
1 3-star is formed with each of the nodes having exactly 3 neighbors.
\( 8 \times \binom{3}{3} = 8 \)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 7, 18)>
<1, (5, 12, 7)>
<3, (11, 14, 4)>
<4, (2, 14, 6)>
<5, (1, 17, 7)>
<10, (8, 15, 18)>
<12, (1, 7, 13)>
<17, (5, 1, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
