Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be described as follows:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, 2, 3 (degree 5)
Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 4, 7, 8 (degree 4)
Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 0 (degree 3)
Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 4, 8, 0 (degree 5)
Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 3 (degree 3)
Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 0 (degree 3)
Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 1, 3, 4 (degree 5)
Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 8, 1 (degree 3)
Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 2, 3, 1 (degree 5)
Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 3, 0 (degree 4)

We can observe that nodes 0, 3, 6, and 8 have 5 or more neighbors, which means they can each form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 40 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [40]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<0, (5, 9, 2)>
<0, (5, 9, 3)>
<0, (5, 7, 2)>
<0, (5, 7, 3)>
<0, (9, 7, 2)>
<0, (9, 7, 3)>
<0, (7, 2, 3)>
<3, (9, 6, 4)>
<3, (9, 6, 8)>
<3, (9, 4, 8)>
<3, (6, 4, 8)>
<6, (5, 1, 4)>
<6, (5, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (5, 1, 7)>
<8, (5, 1, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 7, 8)>
