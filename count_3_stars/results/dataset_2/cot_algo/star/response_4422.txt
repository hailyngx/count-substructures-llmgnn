Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 29) (11, 20) (16, 28) (16, 19) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 27) (0, 20) (0, 18) (0, 1) (27, 0) (27, 25) (18, 0) (18, 20) (18, 24) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 10) (22, 7) (23, 22) (23, 7) (23, 19) (23, 12) (10, 22) (10, 17) (10, 21) (17, 10) (17, 15) (20, 11) (20, 0) (20, 18) (20, 3) (20, 4) (28, 16) (28, 25) (29, 11) (29, 21) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 23) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 14) (26, 6) (3, 20) (3, 4) (4, 20) (4, 3) (4, 24) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 17) (21, 10) (21, 29) (25, 27) (25, 28) (25, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (6, 26) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 22) (2, 24) (2, 14) (2, 7) (24, 18) (24, 4) (24, 2) (24, 12) (14, 16) (14, 26) (14, 2) (8, 11) (8, 25) (8, 1) (7, 22) (7, 23) (7, 6) (7, 2) (12, 23) (12, 24) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {9, 18, 1, 20, 27}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {7, 22, 14, 24}
- Node 3: {4, 20}
- Node 4: {3, 20, 24}
- Node 5: {9, 15, 19}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 26}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 22, 23}
- Node 8: {1, 11, 25}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 15}
- Node 10: {17, 21, 22}
- Node 11: {8, 20, 29}
- Node 12: {23, 24}
- Node 14: {2, 16, 26}
- Node 15: {5, 9, 17}
- Node 16: {14, 19, 28}
- Node 17: {10, 15}
- Node 18: {0, 20, 24}
- Node 19: {5, 16, 23, 26}
- Node 20: {0, 3, 4, 11, 18}
- Node 21: {10, 29}
- Node 22: {2, 7, 10, 23}
- Node 23: {7, 12, 19, 22}
- Node 24: {2, 4, 12, 18}
- Node 25: {8, 27, 28}
- Node 26: {6, 14, 19}
- Node 27: {0, 25}
- Node 28: {16, 25}
- Node 29: {11, 21}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 2: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 5: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 6: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 7: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 9: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 10: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 11: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 15: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 16: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 18: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 19: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].
