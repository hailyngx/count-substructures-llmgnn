Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 13) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 10) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 3) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) 

Response:
For this graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we need to first identify the neighbor nodes for each node. Then, we can determine the number of 3-stars formed in the graph.

Below are the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 7, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 8, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 9, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 7, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 10: {5, 6, 11}
- Node 11: {4, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {2, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 6, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 4, 5, 12}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 70

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (8, 9, 10)>
- <6, (8, 9, 11)>
- <6, (9, 10, 11)>
- <9, (6, 7, 12)>
- <12, (2, 6, 14)>
