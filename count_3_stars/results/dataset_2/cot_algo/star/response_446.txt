Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 8) (15, 2) (27, 12) (27, 5) (27, 13) (27, 16) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 18) (2, 15) (2, 29) (2, 14) (2, 4) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 14) (3, 6) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 10) (25, 3) (25, 28) (18, 9) (18, 22) (18, 11) (18, 12) (18, 21) (22, 9) (22, 18) (22, 7) (22, 1) (12, 27) (12, 18) (12, 11) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 16) (20, 15) (20, 24) (20, 10) (0, 26) (14, 2) (14, 29) (1, 22) (1, 16) (1, 28) (1, 7) (17, 5) (7, 3) (7, 22) (7, 1) (21, 18) (21, 26) (21, 5) (13, 27) (13, 6) (13, 4) (26, 0) (26, 21) (19, 29) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 23) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 20) (11, 18) (11, 12) (11, 19) (24, 8) (24, 20) (28, 25) (28, 1) (16, 27) (16, 8) (16, 1) (23, 19) (5, 27) (5, 17) (5, 21) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 26
- Node 1: 7, 16, 22, 28
- Node 2: 4, 14, 15, 29
- Node 3: 6, 7, 10, 25
- Node 4: 2, 8, 13
- Node 5: 17, 21, 27
- Node 6: 3, 9, 10, 13
- Node 7: 1, 3, 22
- Node 8: 4, 8, 15, 16, 19, 24
- Node 9: 6, 18, 22
- Node 10: 3, 6, 20
- Node 11: 18, 19, 12
- Node 12: 11, 18, 27
- Node 13: 4, 6, 27
- Node 14: 2, 29
- Node 15: 2, 8, 20
- Node 16: 1, 8, 27
- Node 17: 5
- Node 18: 9, 11, 12, 21, 22
- Node 19: 8, 11, 23, 29
- Node 20: 10, 15, 24
- Node 21: 5, 18, 26
- Node 22: 1, 7, 9, 18
- Node 23: 19
- Node 24: 8, 20
- Node 25: 3, 28
- Node 26: 0, 21
- Node 27: 5, 12, 13, 15, 16
- Node 28: 1, 25
- Node 29: 2, 14, 19

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 2: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 3: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 4: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 5: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 6: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 8: 6 choose 3 = 20
- Node 9: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 10: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 11: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 12: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 13: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 15: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 16: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 18: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 19: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 20: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 21: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 22: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 24: 2 choose 3 = 0
- Node 27: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 29: 3 choose 3 = 1

The total number of 3-stars is: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 10 + 1 = 67

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [67].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, 7, 16, 28>,
<2, 14, 15, 29>,
<3, 6, 7, 10>,
<4, 8, 13>,
<5, 17, 21>,
<6, 9, 13>,
<8, 15, 16>,
<11, 18, 19>,
<18, 21, 26>,
<27, 5, 12>.
