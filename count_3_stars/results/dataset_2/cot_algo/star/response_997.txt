Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 2) (13, 4) (13, 9) (0, 3) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 10) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 11) (11, 2) (11, 4) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 9) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first determine the neighbor nodes for each node. 

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 12}
- Node 7: {5, 10, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {2, 4}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 13: {4, 9}
- Node 14: {4, 7, 8, 10}

Now, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 7 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 14 does not have 3 or more neighbors.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 46 \), so the answer is [46].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, 2, 3, 8>
- <2, 4, 10, 11>
- <2, 4, 10, 14>
- <2, 6, 10, 14>
- <2, 9, 10, 14>
- <4, 10, 14, 11>
- <2, 10, 11, 4>
- <4, 10, 14, 11>
- <4, 10, 14, 2>
- <5, 10, 7, 14>
- <3, 9, 1, 8>
- <5, 10, 7, 14>
- <1, 9, 3, 12>
- <9, 0, 3, 1>
- <1, 2, 8, 12>
- <4, 14, 7, 10>
- <2, 10, 5, 14>
- <1, 3, 8, 12>
- <10, 14, 2, 4>
- <3, 9, 1, 8>
- <2, 10, 5, 14>
- <13, 4, 9, 14>
- <2, 10, 5, 14>
- <3, 9, 1, 8>
- <6, 12, 2, 5>
- <9, 10, 2, 4>
- <3, 12, 1, 8>
- <10, 14, 5, 7>
- <4, 13, 2, 9>
