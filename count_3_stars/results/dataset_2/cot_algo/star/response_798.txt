Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 3) (13, 1) (22, 16) (22, 0) (3, 13) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 20) (15, 3) (0, 22) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 12) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 6) (27, 8) (7, 6) (7, 23) (21, 5) (21, 17) (23, 7) (23, 18) (23, 25) (14, 0) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 9) (17, 21) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 11) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 1) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 20) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 2) (28, 20) (18, 23) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 25) (16, 22) (16, 28) (8, 27) (8, 19) (8, 24) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 1) (4, 12) (4, 6) (25, 0) (25, 23) (25, 18) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 29) (10, 3) (10, 26) (10, 19) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 19) (29, 27) (29, 11) (29, 6) (24, 8) (24, 5) (20, 3) (20, 26) (20, 28) (9, 14) (9, 2) (6, 27) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 29) (2, 28) (2, 9) (5, 21) (5, 18) (5, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: { 1, 12, 14, 22, 25, 27 }
- Node 1: { 0, 12, 13, 19 }
- Node 2: { 9, 28 }
- Node 3: { 10, 13, 15, 20 }
- Node 4: { 6, 12 }
- Node 5: { 18, 21, 24 }
- Node 6: { 4, 7, 27, 29 }
- Node 7: { 6, 23 }
- Node 8: { 19, 24, 27 }
- Node 9: { 2, 14 }
- Node 10: { 3, 19, 26 }
- Node 11: { 14, 17, 29 }
- Node 12: { 0, 1, 4 }
- Node 13: { 1, 3 }
- Node 14: { 0, 9, 11, 17 }
- Node 15: { 3 }
- Node 16: { 22, 28 }
- Node 17: { 11, 14, 19, 21 }
- Node 18: { 5, 23, 25, 26 }
- Node 19: { 1, 8, 10, 17 }
- Node 20: { 3, 26, 28 }
- Node 21: { 17, 5 }
- Node 22: { 0, 16 }
- Node 23: { 5, 7, 18, 25 }
- Node 24: { 5, 8 }
- Node 25: { 0, 18, 23 }
- Node 26: { 10, 18, 20, 28 }
- Node 27: { 0, 6, 8, 29 }
- Node 28: { 2, 16, 20, 26 }
- Node 29: { 6, 11, 27 }

Based on the neighbors, we can see that nodes 0, 3, 6, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, and 27 have 3 or more neighbors, so now we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 49 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [49], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 12, 14)>, <3, (10, 13, 20)>, <6, (4, 7, 29)>, <14, (9, 11, 17)>, <17, (11, 14, 21)>, <18, (5, 23, 25)>, <19, (1, 8, 10)>, <20, (3, 26, 28)>, <26, (16, 20, 28)>, <27, (6, 8, 29)>
