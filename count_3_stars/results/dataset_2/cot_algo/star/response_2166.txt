Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 2}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 9, 8, 6. <2, (9, 8, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 8, 7. <4, (3, 8, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 7, 4. <5, (1, 7, 4)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 9, 1, 2. <6, (9, 1, 2)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 9, 4. <8, (1, 9, 4)>

There are no other nodes with 3 or more neighbors, therefore the total number of 3-stars is 5. 
So, the answer is [5].
