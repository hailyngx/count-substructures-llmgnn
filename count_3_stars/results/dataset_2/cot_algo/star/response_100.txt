Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node. 
Here are the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) -> <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) -> <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) -> <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 9, 4)>, <3, (6, 9, 5)>, <3, (7, 8, 5)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) -> <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) -> <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 3)>, <5, (6, 9, 3)>, <5, (6, 9, 4)>, <5, (7, 9, 3)>, <5, (7, 9, 6)>, <5, (7, 3, 4)>, <5, (7, 4, 6)>, <5, (7, 4, 9)>, <5, (7, 6, 4)>, <5, (7, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 4, 9)>
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) -> <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 3)>, <6, (5, 7, 4)>, <6, (7, 9, 4)>, <6, (7, 9, 5)>, <6, (7, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10] = [74].
