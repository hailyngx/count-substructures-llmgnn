Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, with 4 neighbors
- Node 3, with 4 neighbors
- Node 4, with 6 neighbors
- Node 5, with 5 neighbors
- Node 6, with 5 neighbors
- Node 8, with 5 neighbors
- Node 9, with 5 neighbors

Next, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 68 3-stars.

Therefore, the final result is [68], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <5, 8, 9>
