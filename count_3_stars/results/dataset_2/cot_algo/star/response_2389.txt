Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (10, 2) (10, 16) (10, 14) (17, 19) (17, 11) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 11) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 19) (15, 1) (15, 13) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 19) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (7, 18) (7, 19) (7, 5) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 9) (19, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 12) (16, 10) (16, 9) 

Response:
Given that we have 20 nodes and 60 edges in the graph, we will first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 2, 8, 11
- Node 1: 3, 15
- Node 2: 0, 10, 11, 18
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6
- Node 4: 8, 17, 19
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 3, 8, 13
- Node 7: 5, 19
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 8, 13, 16, 19
- Node 10: 2, 14, 16
- Node 11: 0, 2, 12, 17, 18
- Node 12: 11, 14
- Node 13: 6, 9, 15
- Node 14: 10, 12, 19
- Node 15: 1, 13
- Node 16: 9, 10
- Node 17: 4, 11, 19
- Node 18: 2, 7, 11
- Node 19: 4, 7, 9, 14, 17

Now, we will identify the nodes that form 3-stars by having 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
  <0, (8, 11, 2)>
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
  <2, (10, 18, 11)>, <2, (10, 11, 0)>, <2, (18, 11, 7)>, <2, (11, 0, 12)>
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
  <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
  <4, (8, 17, 19)>
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
  <6, (8, 13, 3)>
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
  <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 3)>, <8, (4, 6, 13)>, <8, (9, 6, 3)>
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
  <9, (19, 16, 13)>, <9, (19, 16, 10)>, <9, (19, 13, 6)>, <9, (19, 13, 15)>
- Node 10: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
  <10, (2, 16, 14)>
- Node 11: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
  <11, (0, 17, 18)>, <11, (0, 17, 12)>, <11, (0, 18, 7)>, <11, (0, 18, 12)>, <11, (17, 18, 7)>, <11, (17, 18, 12)>, <11, (18, 7, 12)>, <11, (12, 7, 18)>, <11, (12, 7, 17)>, <11, (12, 18, 17)>
- Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
  <14, (10, 19, 12)>
- Node 16: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars
- Node 17: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
  <17, (4, 19, 11)>
- Node 18: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
  <18, (2, 7, 11)>
- Node 19: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
  <19, (4, 9, 17)>, <19, (4, 9, 7)>, <19, (4, 17, 7)>, <19, (4, 17, 14)>, <19, (4, 7, 14)>, <19, (9, 17, 7)>, <19, (9, 17, 14)>, <19, (9, 7, 14)>, <19, (17, 7, 14)>, <19, (7, 14, 17)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of 27 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the answer is [27].
