Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 16) (7, 21) (7, 23) (7, 17) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 27) (21, 12) (21, 25) (10, 17) (10, 4) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 15) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (18, 26) (18, 0) (18, 8) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 6) (22, 9) (22, 11) (22, 12) (22, 25) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 23) (3, 19) (26, 18) (26, 12) (6, 8) (6, 27) (24, 29) (1, 5) (1, 29) (1, 23) (29, 24) (29, 1) (0, 18) (0, 3) (16, 9) (16, 3) (16, 14) (25, 21) (25, 22) (20, 27) (20, 4) (20, 23) (20, 28) (19, 2) (19, 3) (27, 21) (27, 6) (27, 20) (12, 21) (12, 22) (12, 26) (12, 13) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 28) (13, 14) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 22) (14, 5) (14, 16) (14, 13) (4, 10) (4, 20) (15, 17) (23, 7) (23, 3) (23, 1) (23, 20) (28, 20) (28, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: (18, 3)
- Node 1: (5, 29, 23)
- Node 2: (8, 19, 13)
- Node 3: (21, 0, 16, 23, 19)
- Node 4: (10, 20)
- Node 5: (9, 8, 1, 11, 14)
- Node 6: (8, 27)
- Node 7: (21, 23, 17)
- Node 8: (5, 2, 18, 6)
- Node 9: (5, 22, 16)
- Node 10: (17, 4)
- Node 11: (5, 17, 22)
- Node 12: (21, 22, 26, 13)
- Node 13: (2, 12, 28, 14)
- Node 14: (5, 16, 13)
- Node 15: (17)
- Node 16: (9, 3, 14)
- Node 17: (7, 10, 15, 11)
- Node 18: (8, 26, 0)
- Node 19: (2, 3)
- Node 20: (27, 4, 23, 28)
- Node 21: (7, 3, 27, 12, 25)
- Node 22: (9, 11, 25, 12)
- Node 23: (7, 3, 1, 20)
- Node 24: (29)
- Node 25: (21, 22)
- Node 26: (18, 12)
- Node 27: (21, 6, 20)
- Node 28: (20, 13)
- Node 29: (1, 24)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 1 (Node 15)
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 0

Thus, there is only 1 unique 3-star in this graph, which is <15, (17, 10, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
