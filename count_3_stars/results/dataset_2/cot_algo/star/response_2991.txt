Response:
The graph has the following number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (14, 19, 21)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (5, 21, 28)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (12, 16)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (4, 23, 24, 25)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (19, 26, 3)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (1, 6, 25)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (5, 15, 16, 21, 29)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (11, 14)
- Node 9: 1 neighbor (12)
- Node 10: 3 neighbors (19, 23, 26)
- Node 11: 2 neighbors (8, 20)
- Node 12: 3 neighbors (2, 9, 27)
- Node 13: 3 neighbors (27, 28, 29)
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (0, 8, 24)
- Node 15: 3 neighbors (6, 19, 27)
- Node 16: 3 neighbors (2, 6, 22)
- Node 17: 2 neighbors (22, 25)
- Node 18: 2 neighbors (23, 29)
- Node 19: 5 neighbors (0, 4, 10, 15, 25)
- Node 20: 2 neighbors (11, 23)
- Node 21: 5 neighbors (1, 6, 21, 23, 26)
- Node 22: 4 neighbors (16, 17, 22, 28)
- Node 23: 5 neighbors (3, 10, 18, 20, 21)
- Node 24: 2 neighbors (14, 3)
- Node 25: 5 neighbors (3, 5, 17, 19, 22)
- Node 26: 3 neighbors (4, 10, 21)
- Node 27: 3 neighbors (12, 13, 15)
- Node 28: 3 neighbors (1, 13, 22)
- Node 29: 3 neighbors (6, 13, 18)

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 24 have less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2, 9, 17, 18, 24 have exactly 2 neighbors.
- Nodes 3, 10, 12, 26, 29 have at least 3 neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes.

For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8, which gives us [8].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <3, (23, 24, 25)>
- <10, (19, 23, 26)>
- <12, (2, 27, 9)>
- <26, (10, 21, 4)>
- <29, (18, 13, 6)>
