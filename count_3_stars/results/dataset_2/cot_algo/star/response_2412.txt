Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 10) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 18) (26, 21) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 20) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (18, 26) (18, 22) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 12) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 24) (23, 25) (23, 6) (23, 13) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 2) (20, 4) (20, 0) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 21) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 27) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 24) (17, 5) (5, 17) (5, 19) (19, 22) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 5) (29, 0) (29, 14) (3, 21) (3, 24) (3, 6) (21, 26) (21, 15) (21, 3) (12, 4) (12, 22) (12, 25) (16, 28) (28, 16) (28, 27) (2, 4) (2, 22) (2, 11) (2, 0) (24, 11) (24, 8) (24, 0) (24, 17) (24, 3) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 29) (6, 7) (6, 23) (6, 3) (27, 1) (27, 28) (25, 23) (25, 12) (13, 11) (13, 23) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 20, 24, 29}
- Node 1: Neighbors {17, 19, 27}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 11, 22}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 21, 24}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 7, 12, 20}
- Node 5: Neighbor {17, 19}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 7, 23}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbor {10, 24}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7, 10, 26}
- Node 10: Neighbors {8, 9, 11}
- Node 11: Neighbors {2, 10, 13, 19, 24}
- Node 12: Neighbors {4, 22, 25}
- Node 13: Neighbors {11, 23}
- Node 14: Neighbors {7, 15, 29}
- Node 15: Neighbors {14, 17, 21}
- Node 16: Neighbor {28}
- Node 17: Neighbors {1, 5, 15, 24}
- Node 18: Neighbors {22, 26}
- Node 19: Neighbors {1, 5, 11, 22}
- Node 20: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 21: Neighbors {3, 15, 26}
- Node 22: Neighbors {2, 12, 18, 19}
- Node 23: Neighbors {6, 13, 25}
- Node 24: Neighbors {0, 8, 11, 17, 3}
- Node 25: Neighbors {12, 23}
- Node 26: Neighbors {9, 18, 21}
- Node 27: Neighbors {1, 28}
- Node 28: Neighbors {16, 27}
- Node 29: Neighbors {0, 14}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Since we do not have any node with exactly 3 neighbors, there are no 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [0].
