Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {6, 3, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {6, 3, 2, 5, 4, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {9, 1, 8, 5, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 0, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {9, 1, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2, 7, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {6, 9, 8, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {6, 4, 2, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: 1
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (6, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (6, 9, 8)>
<9, (6, 2, 5)>
