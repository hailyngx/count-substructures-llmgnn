The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 10) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 11) (6, 13) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 9) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges, we can analyze the neighbor relationships for each node and identify the 3-stars formed. Here are the calculations:

1. Node 1 has neighbors {2, 14, 5, 4}. It forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <1, (2, 14, 5)>, <1, (2, 14, 4)>, <1, (2, 5, 4)>, <1, (14, 5, 4)>.

2. Node 3 has neighbors {7, 13, 12}. It forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <3, (7, 13, 12)>.

3. Node 8 has neighbors {4, 10, 11}. It forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <8, (4, 10, 11)>.

4. Node 13 has neighbors {3, 12, 2, 11, 6}. It forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <13, (3, 12, 2)>, <13, (3, 12, 11)>, <13, (3, 12, 6)>, <13, (3, 2, 11)>, <13, (3, 2, 6)>, <13, (3, 11, 6)>, <13, (12, 2, 11)>, <13, (12, 2, 6)>, <13, (12, 11, 6)>, <13, (2, 11, 6)>.

5. Node 4 has neighbors {1, 8, 10}. It forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <4, (1, 8, 10)>.

6. Node 7 has neighbors {3, 12, 9, 5}. It forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <7, (3, 12, 9)>, <7, (3, 12, 5)>, <7, (3, 9, 5)>, <7, (12, 9, 5)>.

7. Node 12 has neighbors {3, 13, 7, 11, 9}. It forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <12, (3, 13, 7)>, <12, (3, 13, 11)>, <12, (3, 13, 9)>, <12, (3, 7, 11)>, <12, (3, 7, 9)>, <12, (13, 7, 11)>, <12, (13, 7, 9)>, <12, (13, 11, 9)>, <12, (7, 11, 9)>, <12, (3, 11, 9)>.

8. Node 0 has neighbors {10, 5, 9}. It forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <0, (10, 5, 9)>.

9. Node 14 has neighbors {1, 2, 10}. It forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <14, (1, 2, 10)>.

10. Node 5 has neighbors {1, 7, 0, 11}. It forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <5, (1, 7, 0)>, <5, (1, 7, 11)>, <5, (1, 0, 11)>, <5, (7, 0, 11)>.

11. Node 6 has neighbors {13, 10}. As it has less than 3 neighbors, it does not form any 3-stars.

12. Node 10 has neighbors {8, 4, 0, 14, 6}. It forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <10, (8, 4, 0)>, <10, (8, 4, 14)>, <10, (8, 4, 6)>, <10, (8, 0, 14)>, <10, (8, 0, 6)>, <10, (8, 14, 6)>, <10, (4, 0, 14)>, <10, (4, 0, 6)>, <10, (4, 14, 6)>, <10, (0, 14, 6)>.

13. Node 2 has neighbors {1, 13, 14, 11}. It forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <2, (1, 13, 14)>, <2, (1, 13, 11)>, <2, (1, 14, 11)>, <2, (13, 14, 11)>.

14. Node 9 has neighbors {7, 12, 0, 10, 11}. It forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <9, (7, 12, 0)>, <9, (7, 12, 10)>, <9, (7, 12, 11)>, <9, (7, 0, 10)>, <9, (7, 0, 11)>, <9, (7, 10, 11)>, <9, (12, 0, 10)>, <9, (12, 0, 11)>, <9, (12, 10, 11)>, <9, (0, 10, 11)>.

15. Node 11 has neighbors {8, 13, 12, 5, 2, 9}. It forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars: <11, (8, 13, 12)>, <11, (8, 13, 5)>, <11, (8, 13, 2)>, <11, (8, 13, 9)>, <11, (8, 12, 5)>, <11, (8, 12, 2)>, <11, (8, 12, 9)>, <11, (8, 5, 2)>, <11, (8, 5, 9)>, <11, (8, 2, 9)>, <11, (13, 12, 5)>, <11, (13, 12, 2)>, <11, (13, 12, 9)>, <11, (13, 5, 2)>, <11, (13, 5, 9)>, <11, (13, 2, 9)>, <11, (12, 5, 2)>, <11, (12, 5, 9)>, <11, (12, 2, 9)>, <11, (5, 2, 9)>.

Adding up the 3-stars from each node, there are 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 85 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [85].
