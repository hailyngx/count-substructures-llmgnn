Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 0) (0, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) 

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Node 0 neighbors: 4, 9, 6, 2 (4 neighbors)
Node 1 neighbors: 7, 12, 10 (3 neighbors)
Node 2 neighbors: 8, 10, 11, 0 (4 neighbors)
Node 3 neighbors: 8, 7, 9 (3 neighbors)
Node 4 neighbors: 8, 9, 14, 11 (4 neighbors)
Node 5 neighbors: 8, 11, 10 (3 neighbors)
Node 6 neighbors: 8, 13, 0 (3 neighbors)
Node 7 neighbors: 12, 3, 11, 14, 1 (5 neighbors)
Node 8 neighbors: 4, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2 (6 neighbors)
Node 9 neighbors: 4, 8, 13, 3, 0 (5 neighbors)
Node 10 neighbors: 2, 5, 0, 1 (4 neighbors)
Node 11 neighbors: 4, 7, 2, 5, 14 (5 neighbors)
Node 12 neighbors: 7, 13, 1 (3 neighbors)
Node 13 neighbors: 12, 9, 14, 6 (4 neighbors)
Node 14 neighbors: 4, 7, 13, 11 (4 neighbors)

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed:
Nodes 0, 2, 4, 8, 9, 11, and 14 have exactly 3 neighbors, so each forms 1 3-star.
The nodes 7 and 13 have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
The nodes 10 have 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 7 + 2*10 + 4 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [31].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 9, 4>
<2, 8, 4>
<3, 8, 7>
<7, 13, 12>
<7, 13, 14>
<10, 2, 11>
