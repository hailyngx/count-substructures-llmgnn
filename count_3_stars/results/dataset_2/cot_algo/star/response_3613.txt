Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 7) (1, 11) (1, 16) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 19) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 15) (8, 5) (8, 18) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (13, 4) (13, 2) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 12) (0, 18) (0, 19) (16, 1) (16, 12) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 18) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 18) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 7) (2, 13) (2, 9) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 9) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first need to find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {18, 19}
- Node 1: {11, 16}
- Node 2: {9, 13}
- Node 3: {11, 12, 19}
- Node 4: {9, 13, 15}
- Node 5: {8, 12, 18}
- Node 6: {10, 14}
- Node 7: {9, 10, 17}
- Node 8: {5, 18}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 7, 15}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 15, 17}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 19}
- Node 12: {3, 5, 15, 16, 18}
- Node 13: {2, 4}
- Node 14: {6, 17}
- Node 15: {4, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 16: {1, 12}
- Node 17: {7, 10, 14}
- Node 18: {5, 8, 12, 19}
- Node 19: {0, 3, 11, 18}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 29 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [29].

Unique 3-stars found are as follows: 
- <3, (11, 12, 19)>
- <5, (8, 12, 18)>
- <7, (9, 10, 17)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
- <10, (6, 15, 17)>
- <12, (5, 15, 18)>
- <18, (8, 12, 19)>
- <19, (11, 18, 3)>
