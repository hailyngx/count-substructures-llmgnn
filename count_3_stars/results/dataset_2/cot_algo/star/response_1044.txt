Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 8) (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 10) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 0) (5, 14) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 19) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 19) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 19) (12, 17) (19, 1) (19, 0) (19, 13) (10, 7) (10, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 1
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 5
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 3

From the degrees, we see that nodes 14 and 17 are the only nodes with 5 neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Unique 3-stars for node 14: <14, (7, 9, 13)>, <14, (7, 9, 5)>, <14, (7, 9, 17)>, <14, (7, 13, 5)>, <14, (7, 13, 17)>, <14, (7, 5, 17)>, <14, (9, 13, 5)>, <14, (9, 13, 17)>, <14, (9, 5, 17)>, <14, (13, 5, 17)>

For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Unique 3-stars for node 17: <17, (16, 1, 14)>, <17, (16, 1, 12)>, <17, (1, 14, 12)>, <17, (1, 14, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 = 14

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
