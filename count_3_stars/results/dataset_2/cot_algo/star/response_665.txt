Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 14) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 12) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 3) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 10) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first need to identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 9, 12}
- Node 1: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 13}
- Node 3: {2, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 5, 10}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 8: {4, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {4, 5, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {3, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 8, 11}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 10, 13}

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors can potentially form 3-stars. 

Nodes that can form 3-stars: 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 13

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 13 each contribute 1 3-star.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we use the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
  - Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 26 

Therefore, the final answer is [26], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (2, 11, 12)>, 
<4, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<5, (6, 10, 13)>, 
<9, (0, 10, 13)>, 
<10, (4, 5, 13)>, 
<13, (2, 5, 14)>.
