Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 5) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 3) (27, 19) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (23, 12) (23, 19) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 12) (20, 15) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 21) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 28) (6, 2) (26, 20) (26, 24) (26, 11) (24, 26) (24, 18) (3, 27) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 19) (11, 8) (11, 26) (11, 3) (11, 25) (21, 20) (21, 29) (21, 17) (17, 20) (17, 21) (17, 1) (17, 4) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 14) (7, 3) (7, 16) (7, 9) (16, 7) (16, 18) (28, 5) (28, 9) (29, 21) (29, 1) (29, 4) (29, 10) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (4, 17) (4, 29) (4, 2) (4, 9) (19, 27) (19, 23) (19, 15) (19, 3) (18, 24) (18, 16) (18, 14) (9, 7) (9, 28) (9, 4) (9, 14) (12, 13) (12, 23) (12, 15) (22, 27) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 9) (25, 11) (25, 10) (10, 13) (10, 29) (10, 25) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {27, 5, 2}
- Node 27: {0, 22, 3, 19}
- Node 8: {13, 11}
- Node 13: {8, 12, 10}
- Node 23: {12, 19}
- Node 15: {20, 19, 12}
- Node 20: {15, 17, 26, 21}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 28}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 26: {20, 24, 11}
- Node 24: {26, 18}
- Node 3: {27, 11, 7, 19}
- Node 11: {8, 26, 3, 25}
- Node 21: {20, 29, 17}
- Node 17: {20, 21, 1, 4}
- Node 1: {17, 29, 14}
- Node 7: {3, 16, 9}
- Node 16: {7, 18}
- Node 28: {5, 9}
- Node 29: {21, 1, 4, 10}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 4}
- Node 4: {17, 29, 2, 9}
- Node 19: {27, 23, 15, 3}
- Node 18: {24, 16, 14}
- Node 9: {7, 28, 4, 14}
- Node 12: {13, 23, 15}
- Node 22: {27}
- Node 14: {1, 18, 9}
- Node 25: {11, 10}
- Node 10: {13, 29, 25}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 28 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <27, (0, 19, 3)>
- <20, (15, 17, 21)>
- <3, (27, 11, 19)>
- <11, (8, 26, 25)>
- <17, (20, 21, 4)>
- <4, (17, 29, 9)>
- <29, (21, 1, 10)>
