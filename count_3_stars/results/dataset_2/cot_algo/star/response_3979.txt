Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 7) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 23) (15, 6) (15, 17) (15, 24) (15, 28) (27, 17) (27, 9) (27, 16) (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 11) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 19) (23, 12) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 3) (18, 20) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 29) (18, 3) (5, 18) (5, 29) (5, 16) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 7) (1, 26) (1, 24) (26, 1) (26, 16) (26, 7) (11, 25) (11, 23) (28, 15) (28, 20) (28, 9) (24, 15) (24, 1) (4, 10) (17, 15) (17, 27) (17, 20) (17, 6) (29, 20) (29, 18) (29, 5) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 9) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 26) (7, 0) (7, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 21) (21, 10) (12, 23) (12, 2) (12, 14) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 7) (9, 27) (9, 25) (9, 28) (9, 0) (19, 25) (19, 23) (19, 14) (14, 12) (14, 19) (16, 27) (16, 5) (16, 26) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Now, we will find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 9, 10}
- Node 1: {24, 26}
- Node 2: {3, 12, 18}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 18}
- Node 4: {10}
- Node 5: {16, 18, 29}
- Node 6: {7, 13, 15, 17}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 6, 13, 26}
- Node 9: {0, 25, 27, 28}
- Node 10: {0, 4, 21}
- Node 11: {19, 23, 25}
- Node 12: {2, 14, 23}
- Node 13: {6, 7, 22}
- Node 14: {12, 19}
- Node 15: {6, 17, 24, 28}
- Node 16: {5, 26, 27}
- Node 17: {6, 15, 20, 27}
- Node 18: {2, 3, 5, 20, 29}
- Node 19: {11, 14, 25}
- Node 20: {17, 18, 25, 28, 29}
- Node 21: {10}
- Node 22: {13, 23}
- Node 23: {11, 12, 19, 22}
- Node 24: {1, 15}
- Node 25: {9, 11, 19, 20}
- Node 26: {1, 7, 16}
- Node 27: {9, 16, 17}
- Node 28: {9, 15, 20}
- Node 29: {5, 18, 20}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20, so the answer is [20].
