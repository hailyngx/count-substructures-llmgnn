Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 5) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first list the neighbors of each node:

1: 6, 9, 12, 14, 7
2: 6, 10, 11, 8, 13, 4
3: 12, 5, 4
4: 2, 0, 3, 5
5: 11, 14, 3, 4
6: 1, 2, 11, 13
7: 8, 13, 1
8: 10, 7, 12, 2, 0
9: 14, 1, 13
10: 11, 0, 8, 2
11: 6, 10, 5, 2
12: 14, 3, 1, 8
13: 6, 9, 7, 2
14: 9, 12, 1, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 60 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [60].
