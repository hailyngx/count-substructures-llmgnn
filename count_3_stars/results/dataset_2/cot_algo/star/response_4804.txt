Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 10) (22, 24) (5, 9) (5, 28) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 23) (15, 0) (15, 17) (15, 16) (27, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (14, 13) (14, 17) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 11) (1, 13) (1, 27) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 29) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 25) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 0) (21, 4) (21, 28) (21, 25) (28, 5) (28, 21) (28, 16) (28, 7) (19, 4) (19, 26) (19, 29) (26, 13) (26, 19) (26, 10) (26, 11) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 26) (11, 29) (20, 17) (16, 15) (16, 28) (16, 12) (16, 24) (0, 15) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 28) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 29) (18, 9) (18, 6) (18, 10) (10, 22) (10, 26) (10, 18) (23, 9) (23, 2) (23, 29) (24, 22) (24, 16) (29, 3) (29, 19) (29, 11) (29, 12) (29, 23) (25, 4) (25, 21) (2, 6) (2, 23) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23, 26, 28, 29.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 58 \)

Thus, there are a total of 58 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Enclosed in brackets: [58]

Listing out the unique 3-stars: 
<0, 3, 8>, <0, 15, 16>, <0, 15, 17>, <0, 3, 29>, <1, 3, 11>, <4, 19, 26>, <4, 8, 21>, <4, 8, 0>, <4, 21, 28>, <6, 9, 18>, <6, 12, 16>, <6, 12, 29>, <6, 18, 9>, <9, 6, 18>, <9, 6, 12>, <9, 5, 28>, <9, 5, 6>, <11, 26, 29>, <11, 3, 29>, <11, 3, 1>, <11, 17, 20>, <13, 22, 10>, <13, 22, 24>, <13, 22, 26>, <13, 1, 27>, <15, 0, 3>, <15, 0, 17>, <16, 15, 0>, <16, 12, 6>, <16, 12, 29>, <16, 15, 17>, <17, 15, 0>, <17, 15, 16>, <17, 14, 20>, <19, 4, 26>, <19, 4, 25>, <19, 4, 21>, <21, 4, 25>, <21, 4, 8>, <21, 4, 28>, <21, 28, 16>, <22, 13, 1>, <22, 13, 26>, <22, 10, 26>, <22, 24, 16>, <23, 9, 29>, <23, 9, 2>, <23, 29, 12>, <23, 29, 2>, <25, 4, 21>, <25, 4, 5>, <25, 21, 28>, <25, 21, 5>, <26, 13, 19>, <26, 13, 10>, <26, 13, 11>, <26, 10, 22>, <28, 5, 9>, <28, 21, 4>, <28, 16, 15>, <28, 16, 24>, <29, 3, 11>, <29, 3, 12>, <29, 3, 19>, <29, 3, 23>, <29, 11, 17>, <29, 11, 23>, <29, 11, 26>, <29, 12, 16>, <29, 12, 23>, <29, 19, 4>, <29, 19, 23>, <29, 23, 2>
