Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 5) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 7) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 11) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (12, 16) (12, 10) (16, 3) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 6) (9, 7) (18, 15) (19, 15) (6, 13) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 0) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 4) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 5) (4, 14) (4, 16) (4, 5) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 6) (10, 12) (10, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be determined by first finding the neighbors of each node, then calculating the number of 3-stars centered at each node with three or more neighbors.

Here are the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 11, 13}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 7, 17}
- Node 3: {8, 15, 16}
- Node 4: {5, 14, 16}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 11, 15}
- Node 6: {0, 10, 13, 16}
- Node 7: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 7, 15}
- Node 9: {7}
- Node 10: {6, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 5, 13, 17}
- Node 12: {10, 16}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 6, 17}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 11}
- Node 15: {3, 5, 8, 18, 19}
- Node 16: {3, 4, 6, 12}
- Node 17: {2, 11, 13}
- Node 18: {15}
- Node 19: {15}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 44 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (6, 11, 13)>
- <1, (2, 14, 5)>
- <2, (1, 17, 7)>
- <3, (8, 15, 16)>
- <4, (5, 14, 16)>
- <5, (1, 11, 2)>
- <6, (0, 10, 13)>
- <7, (2, 9, 8)>
- <11, (0, 13, 17)>
- <13, (0, 17, 1)>
- <15, (3, 18, 19)>
- <16, (3, 4, 6)>
- <17, (2, 13, 11)>
