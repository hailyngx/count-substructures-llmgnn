Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors [2, 8]
- Node 1: Neighbors [2, 3, 4, 7]
- Node 2: Neighbors [0, 1, 5, 6, 8]
- Node 3: Neighbors [1, 4, 5, 7, 9]
- Node 4: Neighbors [1, 3, 5, 6, 8]
- Node 5: Neighbors [2, 3, 4, 6, 8]
- Node 6: Neighbors [2, 4, 5, 7]
- Node 7: Neighbors [1, 3, 6]
- Node 8: Neighbors [0, 2, 4, 5, 9]
- Node 9: Neighbors [3, 8]

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1, 4 3-stars formed: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3, 5 3-stars formed: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4, 5 3-stars formed: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
Adding these up, we find a total of 4 + 10 + 10 = 24 3-stars in the graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
