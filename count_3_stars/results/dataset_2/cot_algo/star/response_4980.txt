Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 0) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 14) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {7, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 2: {3, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 8, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 11}
- Node 6: {7, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 12}
- Node 9: {6, 7, 10}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {4, 5, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 11, 0}
- Node 14: {4, 7, 10, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- Node 0: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 10: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 11: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 12: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 13: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 14: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars from the nodes above: 

\[ 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

\[ <0, 7, 10>, <0, 7, 12>, <0, 7, 13>, <0, 10, 12>, <0, 10, 13>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 4, 12>, <1, 4, 14>, <1, 5, 11>, <1, 8, 12>, <1, 8, 13>, <1, 13, 11>, <3, 4, 12>, <3, 4, 13>, <3, 5, 11>, <4, 8, 12>, <4, 8, 14>, <4, 11, 12>, <4, 11, 14>, <7, 9, 11>, <7, 11, 14>, <10, 14, 2>, <11, 13, 0>, <11, 13, 5>, <11, 13, 1>, <12, 0, 3>, <12, 0, 4>, <12, 0, 8>, <12, 3, 4>, <12, 8, 1>, <13, 0, 1>, <13, 0, 3>, <13, 0, 11>, <13, 1, 3>, <14, 2, 10>, <14, 2, 4>, <14, 2, 7>, <14, 4, 7> \]
