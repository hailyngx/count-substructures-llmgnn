Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 5, 8, 10, 11
- Node 1: 3, 6, 10, 13, 14
- Node 2: 4, 6, 13, 14
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 10, 12
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 8, 9, 13
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 4, 8, 11, 13, 14
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 5, 8, 14
- Node 10: 0, 1, 3
- Node 11: 0, 7
- Node 12: 3, 14
- Node 13: 1, 2, 5, 7, 14
- Node 14: 1, 2, 7, 9, 12

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 69. 
Therefore, the final answer is [69]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 5, 8, 10>
<1, 3, 6, 13>
<1, 3, 10, 12>
<1, 6, 13, 14>
<2, 4, 6, 14>
<4, 7, 8, 13>
<7, 8, 13, 14>
<13, 5, 7, 14>
