Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 0) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 2) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:

Node 0: 5, 4, 10, 8, 13
Node 1: 9, 10, 2, 3, 4
Node 2: 6, 1, 8, 13, 12
Node 3: 1, 11, 7, 13, 8
Node 4: 1, 10, 0
Node 5: 9, 8, 12, 0
Node 6: 9, 7, 2, 13
Node 7: 6, 3, 8
Node 8: 5, 3, 2, 0, 7
Node 9: 5, 6, 14, 1
Node 10: 1, 11, 0, 4, 12
Node 11: 3, 10, 14
Node 12: 5, 10, 2
Node 13: 6, 3, 2, 0
Node 14: 9, 11

After exploring all the neighbors for each node, we find that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: No 3-stars formed (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 14: No 3-stars formed (less than 3 neighbors)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 77

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [77].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 8, 10)>
<1, (4, 10, 2)>
<2, (6, 13, 8)>
<3, (1, 11, 7)>
<5, (8, 12, 0)>
<6, (9, 7, 13)>
<8, (0, 7, 5)>
<9, (5, 6, 14)>
<10, (0, 4, 1)>
<12, (5, 10, 2)>
<13, (0, 6, 3)>
