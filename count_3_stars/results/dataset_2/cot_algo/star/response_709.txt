Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 14) (26, 10) (26, 12) (3, 18) (15, 1) (15, 17) (15, 21) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 28) (7, 27) (7, 22) (21, 15) (21, 2) (8, 23) (8, 11) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 19) (6, 10) (6, 20) (6, 13) (28, 5) (28, 18) (28, 10) (17, 15) (17, 19) (17, 22) (20, 6) (20, 29) (20, 12) (19, 5) (19, 23) (19, 17) (29, 20) (29, 13) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 4) (14, 26) (14, 22) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 13) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 27) (1, 15) (1, 11) (10, 26) (10, 6) (10, 28) (10, 25) (2, 5) (2, 21) (2, 27) (2, 24) (25, 10) (25, 22) (25, 18) (22, 7) (22, 17) (22, 14) (22, 16) (22, 25) (12, 26) (12, 20) (12, 13) (13, 6) (13, 29) (13, 0) (13, 12) (18, 3) (18, 28) (18, 25) (24, 9) (24, 2) (24, 4) (27, 7) (27, 16) (27, 2) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {8, 4, 13, 16}
- Node 1: {15, 11}
- Node 2: {5, 21, 27, 24}
- Node 3: {18}
- Node 4: {11, 0, 24}
- Node 5: {9, 19, 2, 28}
- Node 6: {10, 20, 13}
- Node 7: {27, 22}
- Node 8: {23, 0, 11}
- Node 9: {26, 5, 24}
- Node 10: {26, 6, 28, 25}
- Node 11: {8, 1, 4}
- Node 12: {26, 20, 13}
- Node 13: {6, 29, 0, 12}
- Node 14: {26, 22}
- Node 15: {1, 17, 21}
- Node 16: {0, 22, 27}
- Node 17: {15, 19, 22}
- Node 18: {3, 28, 25}
- Node 19: {5, 23, 17}
- Node 20: {6, 12, 29}
- Node 21: {15, 2}
- Node 22: {7, 17, 14, 16, 25}
- Node 23: {8, 19}
- Node 24: {9, 2, 4}
- Node 25: {10, 22, 18}
- Node 26: {9, 14, 10, 12}
- Node 27: {7, 16, 2}
- Node 28: {5, 18, 10}
- Node 29: {6, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 neighbors or more, and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed is \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + 1 + 1 + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + 1 + 1 + \binom{4}{3} + 1 + 1 = 6 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 6 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 1 = 44 \).

So, the final answer is [44].

The unique 3-stars found are as follows:
- <2, (5, 21, 27)>
- <5, (9, 19, 28)>
- <8, (0, 11, 13)>
- <9, (5, 24, 26)>
- <10, (6, 25, 28)>
- <13, (0, 12, 29)>
- <22, (7, 14, 16, 17, 25)>
- <18, (3, 25, 28)>
- <24, (2, 4, 9)>
- <26, (10, 12, 14, 9)>
- <27, (2, 7, 16)>
- <28, (10, 18, 5)>
