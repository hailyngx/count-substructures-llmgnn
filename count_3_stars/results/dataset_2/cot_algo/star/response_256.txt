Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 8, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
