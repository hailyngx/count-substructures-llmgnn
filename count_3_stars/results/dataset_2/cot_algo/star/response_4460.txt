Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 11) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 3) (10, 8) (10, 18) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 2) (7, 11) (7, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 3) (4, 12) (4, 18) (4, 15) (4, 2) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 15) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 19) (13, 5) (13, 19) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 19) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 8) (19, 15) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 19) (1, 5) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by listing the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {14, 7, 3, 19}
- Node 1: {5, 2}
- Node 2: {11, 4, 1}
- Node 3: {6, 12, 0}
- Node 4: {12, 18, 15, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 1}
- Node 6: {9, 17, 3}
- Node 7: {11, 0}
- Node 8: {9, 14, 10, 19}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8, 19}
- Node 10: {8, 18}
- Node 11: {17, 7, 2}
- Node 12: {14, 4, 3}
- Node 13: {5, 19}
- Node 14: {17, 0, 8, 12}
- Node 15: {4, 18, 19}
- Node 17: {14, 6, 11}
- Node 18: {10, 4, 15}
- Node 19: {9, 0, 13, 8, 15}

Now, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes {7, 14, 19}    <0, (7, 14, 19)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes {2, 15, 18}   <4, (2, 15, 18)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes {9, 14, 19}   <8, (9, 14, 19)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes {3, 14, 4}  <12, (3, 14, 4)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes {4, 18, 19}  <15, (4, 18, 19)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes {8, 15, 9}    <19, (8, 15, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [6].
