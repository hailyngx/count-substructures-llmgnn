Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: Neighbors are 2, 6
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 4, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 7, and 9. <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 4, and 9. <8, (5, 4, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 1, and 8. <5, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, and 5. <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 7, and 8. <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 5, and 7. <1, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 6, and this number should be written as [6].
