Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 14) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 12) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 10, 11, 12, 6}
- Node 1: {9, 7, 10, 11, 2}
- Node 2: {13, 1, 4}
- Node 3: {7, 10, 6}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 6, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 8, 4, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 11, 4}
- Node 7: {3, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 4, 1, 0}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 1, 14}
- Node 11: {13, 0, 1, 6, 12}
- Node 12: {13, 0, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {5, 12, 2, 11}
- Node 14: {5, 10, 12}

Next, we identify the nodes with at least three neighbors, for which we can form a 3-star:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 9, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 67

Therefore, the answer is [67], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 9, 10, 11>, <0, 9, 10, 12>, <0, 9, 11, 12>, <0, 9, 11, 14>, <0, 10, 11, 12>, <0, 10, 11, 14>, <0, 11, 12, 14>, <1, 9, 10, 11>, <1, 9, 10, 12>, <1, 9, 11, 12>, <1, 9, 11, 14>, <1, 10, 11, 12>, <1, 10, 11, 14>, <1, 11, 12, 14>, <4, 5, 9, 13>, <4, 5, 9, 2>, <4, 5, 13, 2>, <4, 6, 11, 12>, <5, 8, 9, 13>, <5, 9, 13, 14>, <9, 11, 12, 13>
