Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 14) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 7) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars, we get a total of 68 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [68], and the unique 3-stars are:
