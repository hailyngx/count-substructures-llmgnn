Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 24) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 28) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 12) (21, 16) (21, 4) (21, 25) (21, 15) (2, 3) (2, 15) (8, 25) (8, 7) (8, 6) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 27) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 22) (11, 18) (11, 17) (17, 11) (17, 20) (17, 12) (20, 17) (20, 13) (20, 28) (7, 8) (7, 25) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 13) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 7) (0, 7) (0, 29) (0, 23) (22, 11) (22, 27) (16, 21) (16, 15) (6, 8) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 4) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 10) (24, 15) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 28) (23, 0) (26, 27) (27, 3) (27, 22) (27, 26) (29, 0) (29, 10) (18, 11) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 13) (15, 9) (15, 21) (15, 2) (15, 16) (15, 24) (13, 1) (13, 20) (13, 7) (13, 12) (10, 24) (10, 29) (10, 4) (28, 9) (28, 20) (28, 14) (19, 1) (19, 7) (4, 21) (4, 6) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, we will create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {7, 23, 29}
Node 1: {12, 13, 19}
Node 2: {3, 15}
Node 3: {2, 11, 27}
Node 4: {6, 10, 21}
Node 5: {9, 14, 24}
Node 6: {4, 8, 14, 24}
Node 7: {0, 8, 13, 19, 25}
Node 8: {6, 7, 25}
Node 9: {5, 14, 15, 28}
Node 10: {4, 24, 29}
Node 11: {3, 14, 17, 18, 22}
Node 12: {1, 13, 17}
Node 13: {1, 7, 12, 20}
Node 14: {5, 6, 9, 11, 28}
Node 15: {2, 9, 16, 21, 24}
Node 16: {15, 21}
Node 17: {11, 12, 20}
Node 18: {11}
Node 19: {1, 7}
Node 20: {13, 17, 28}
Node 21: {4, 15, 16, 25}
Node 22: {11, 27}
Node 23: {0}
Node 24: {5, 6, 10, 14, 15}
Node 25: {7, 8, 21}
Node 26: {27}
Node 27: {3, 22, 26}
Node 28: {9, 14, 20}
Node 29: {0, 10}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to count the number of 3-stars:

Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 24 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star with its neighbors.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star with its neighbors.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star with its neighbors.
Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star with its neighbors.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 48.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<14, 5, 6, 9>
<14, 5, 24, 15>
<14, 6, 24, 10>
<14, 11, 28, 9>
<15, 2, 9, 16>
<15, 21, 16, 24>
<21, 4, 6, 24>
<7, 8, 25, 21>
<7, 13, 12, 1>
<7, 13, 19, 1>
