Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 1 neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 5 neighbors: 6, 8
- Node 6 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8 neighbors: 2, 5, 7
- Node 9 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 37

Therefore, the final answer is [37]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 2)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
