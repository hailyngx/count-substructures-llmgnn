Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 16) (2, 21) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 16) (29, 12) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 10) (3, 9) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 6) (25, 11) (10, 3) (10, 26) (10, 13) (11, 25) (11, 1) (11, 5) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 9) (21, 2) (21, 7) (21, 28) (8, 28) (8, 22) (23, 19) (17, 29) (17, 6) (17, 4) (28, 3) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 14) (28, 24) (13, 10) (13, 26) (13, 14) (26, 10) (26, 13) (26, 14) (26, 6) (26, 4) (1, 25) (1, 11) (1, 22) (19, 23) (19, 18) (19, 16) (4, 17) (4, 26) (4, 12) (12, 29) (12, 4) (12, 16) (22, 8) (22, 1) (22, 0) (16, 2) (16, 29) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 0) (14, 28) (14, 13) (14, 26) (14, 9) (6, 25) (6, 17) (6, 26) (6, 27) (0, 22) (0, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 14) (18, 19) (18, 20) (20, 18) (20, 27) (20, 24) (24, 7) (24, 28) (24, 20) (27, 6) (27, 20) (5, 11) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the neighbor set for each node is as follows:
- Node 0: {16, 22}
- Node 1: {11, 22, 25}
- Node 2: {16, 21, 29}
- Node 3: {9, 10, 25, 28}
- Node 4: {12, 16, 17, 26}
- Node 5: {11}
- Node 6: {17, 25, 26, 27}
- Node 7: {9, 21, 24}
- Node 8: {22, 28}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 13, 26}
- Node 11: {1, 5, 25}
- Node 12: {4, 16, 29}
- Node 13: {10, 14, 26}
- Node 14: {9, 13, 26, 28}
- Node 16: {0, 2, 12, 16, 19}
- Node 17: {4, 6, 17, 26}
- Node 18: {19, 20}
- Node 19: {16, 18, 23}
- Node 20: {18, 24, 27}
- Node 21: {2, 7, 28}
- Node 22: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 23: {19}
- Node 24: {7, 20, 28}
- Node 25: {3, 6, 11, 1}
- Node 26: {4, 6, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 27: {6, 20}
- Node 28: {3, 8, 14, 21, 24}
- Node 29: {2, 12, 16, 17}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Nodes 2, 16, 17, and 26 have 4 neighbors each, hence they can form 4 3-stars each.
- Nodes 3, 9, 11, 12, and 25 have 4 neighbors each, hence they can form 4 3-stars each.

Calculate the total number of 3-stars:
4 (from nodes 2, 16, 17, and 26) + 5 (from nodes 3, 9, 11, 12, and 25) = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
- <2, 16, 21, 29>
- <3, 9, 10, 25>
- <3, 6, 25, 26>
- <11, 1, 5, 25>
- <12, 4, 16, 29>
- <2, 16, 12, 29>
- <17, 4, 6, 26>
- <16, 12, 4, 17>
- <25, 3, 6, 11>
