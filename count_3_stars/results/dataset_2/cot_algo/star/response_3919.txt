Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 9) (16, 21) (16, 29) (16, 18) (28, 4) (28, 18) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 4) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 25) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 7) (13, 6) (20, 29) (20, 24) (29, 16) (29, 1) (29, 20) (29, 0) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 14) (23, 3) (23, 21) (2, 6) (2, 24) (22, 6) (22, 25) (21, 16) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 24) (25, 1) (25, 17) (25, 22) (25, 4) (25, 18) (26, 10) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 27) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 14) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 9) (8, 15) (8, 3) (7, 13) (14, 23) (14, 15) (12, 1) (12, 6) (0, 29) (0, 19) (0, 9) (0, 18) (9, 11) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 3) (27, 10) (18, 16) (18, 28) (18, 25) (18, 10) (18, 0) (4, 28) (4, 1) (4, 23) (4, 25) (24, 20) (24, 2) (24, 21) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 3) (3, 23) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {29, 19, 9, 18}
- Node 1: {17, 29, 25, 4, 12}
- Node 2: {6, 24}
- Node 3: {23, 8, 9, 6}
- Node 4: {28, 1, 23, 25}
- Node 6: {13, 2, 22, 12, 3}
- Node 7: {13}
- Node 8: {15, 3}
- Node 9: {11, 19, 0, 3}
- Node 10: {26, 18, 27}
- Node 11: {23, 9}
- Node 12: {1, 6}
- Node 13: {17, 21, 7, 6}
- Node 14: {23, 15}
- Node 15: {19, 8, 14}
- Node 16: {21, 29, 18}
- Node 17: {1, 13, 25}
- Node 18: {28, 10, 18, 25, 0}
- Node 19: {15, 0, 9}
- Node 20: {29, 24}
- Node 21: {16, 13, 23, 24}
- Node 22: {6, 25}
- Node 23: {11, 4, 14, 3, 21}
- Node 24: {20, 2, 21}
- Node 25: {1, 17, 22, 4, 18}
- Node 26: {10}
- Node 27: {10}
- Node 28: {4, 18}

Based on the provided edges, we find the following 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 25, 29)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (6, 9, 23)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (12, 13, 3)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (0, 11, 19)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (6, 17, 21)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (14, 19, 23)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star: <18, (0, 28, 25)>
- Node 21 forms a 3-star: <21, (16, 23, 24)>
- Node 25 forms a 3-star: <25, (1, 17, 4)>
- Node 29 forms a 3-star: <29, (0, 1, 20)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
