Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 3) (26, 9) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 25) (27, 7) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 25) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 1) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 21) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 28) (17, 12) (17, 20) (17, 3) (17, 7) (20, 17) (20, 22) (20, 14) (20, 24) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 23) (0, 6) (7, 27) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 0) (10, 13) (10, 15) (10, 14) (15, 10) (15, 23) (14, 20) (14, 10) (16, 19) (25, 27) (25, 4) (25, 28) (18, 0) (18, 29) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 17) (24, 8) (24, 20) (24, 19) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 23) (11, 1) (11, 22) (11, 21) (23, 0) (23, 15) (23, 1) (29, 18) (29, 22) (19, 12) (19, 4) (19, 16) (19, 24) (19, 6) (22, 20) (22, 11) (22, 29) (22, 28) (6, 0) (6, 19) (28, 13) (28, 25) (28, 22) (21, 4) (21, 5) (21, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 7, 18, 23}
- Node 1: {8, 11, 23}
- Node 3: {9, 13, 17}
- Node 4: {8, 13, 19, 21, 25}
- Node 5: {7, 12, 13, 21}
- Node 6: {0, 19}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 17, 27}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 24}
- Node 9: {3, 26}
- Node 10: {13, 14, 15}
- Node 11: {1, 21, 22}
- Node 12: {5, 17, 19, 25, 27}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 5, 10, 28}
- Node 14: {10, 20}
- Node 15: {10, 23}
- Node 16: {19}
- Node 17: {3, 7, 12, 20}
- Node 18: {0, 29}
- Node 19: {4, 6, 12, 16, 24}
- Node 20: {14, 17, 22, 24}
- Node 21: {4, 5, 11}
- Node 22: {11, 20, 28, 29}
- Node 23: {0, 1, 15}
- Node 24: {8, 19, 20}
- Node 25: {4, 12, 27, 28}
- Node 26: {9}
- Node 27: {7, 12, 25}
- Node 28: {13, 22, 25}
- Node 29: {18, 22}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 4, 3-stars: 1
- Node 5, 3-stars: 1
- Node 8, 3-stars: 1
- Node 12, 3-stars: 1
- Node 13, 3-stars: 1
- Node 19, 3-stars: 1
- Node 20, 3-stars: 1
- Node 22, 3-stars: 1

Total number of 3-stars: 8

Therefore, the final answer is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are <4, (8, 19, 24)>, <5, (7, 12, 21)>, <8, (1, 4, 24)>, <12, (5, 17, 25)>, <13, (3, 4, 5)>, <19, (6, 12, 24)>, <20, (14, 17, 22)>, <22, (11, 20, 28)>.
