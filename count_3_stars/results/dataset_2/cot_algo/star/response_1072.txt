Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4 and Node 7 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form 10 3-stars each.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 2 and Node 3 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form 10 3-stars each.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 0 + 10 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
