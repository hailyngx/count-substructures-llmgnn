Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 12) (4, 24) (4, 10) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 10) (0, 27) (0, 17) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 26) (27, 8) (22, 14) (22, 20) (22, 29) (23, 25) (23, 1) (28, 6) (28, 16) (28, 2) (29, 9) (29, 22) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 13) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 21) (19, 3) (26, 27) (26, 19) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 10) (20, 22) (20, 12) (20, 21) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 16) (21, 19) (21, 20) (21, 13) (21, 2) (1, 23) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 8) (8, 9) (8, 27) (8, 1) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 14) (17, 4) (17, 0) (17, 24) (15, 5) (15, 12) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 1) (3, 19) (14, 22) (14, 8) (14, 13) (12, 9) (12, 20) (12, 15) (24, 4) (24, 27) (24, 17) (24, 25) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 25) (25, 23) (25, 24) (25, 18) (2, 28) (2, 21) (2, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 27, 17
- Node 1: 23, 6, 11, 8
- Node 2: 28, 21, 13
- Node 3: 19
- Node 4: 24, 10, 17
- Node 5: 15, 10
- Node 6: 28, 1, 18, 13
- Node 7: 11, 10
- Node 8: 9, 27, 1, 14
- Node 9: 29, 8, 12
- Node 10: 5, 4, 7, 16
- Node 11: 7, 19, 1
- Node 12: 9, 20, 15
- Node 13: 6, 21, 2, 14
- Node 14: 22, 8, 13
- Node 15: 5, 12
- Node 16: 28, 18, 10
- Node 17: 4, 0, 24
- Node 18: 6, 16, 25
- Node 19: 26, 11, 21, 3
- Node 20: 22, 12, 21
- Node 21: 19, 20, 13, 2
- Node 22: 14, 29, 20
- Node 23: 25, 1
- Node 24: 4, 27, 17, 25
- Node 25: 23, 24, 18
- Node 26: 27, 19
- Node 27: 0, 24, 26, 8
- Node 28: 6, 16, 2
- Node 29: 9, 22

Now we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 37

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [37].
