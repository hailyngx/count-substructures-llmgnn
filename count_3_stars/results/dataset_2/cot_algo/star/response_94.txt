Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 28) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 16) (0, 27) (0, 9) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 11) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 21) (20, 29) (20, 12) (20, 19) (20, 23) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 24) (22, 15) (22, 26) (22, 19) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 14) (11, 2) (11, 28) (28, 15) (28, 8) (28, 11) (28, 18) (24, 27) (24, 8) (24, 26) (24, 17) (4, 6) (5, 19) (5, 23) (5, 25) (5, 10) (19, 20) (19, 22) (19, 5) (23, 20) (23, 5) (23, 12) (14, 26) (14, 3) (14, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 16) (17, 2) (17, 24) (17, 6) (7, 9) (3, 14) (12, 20) (12, 23) (12, 21) (12, 9) (16, 27) (16, 14) (16, 6) (16, 10) (10, 5) (10, 16) (10, 9) (18, 28) (18, 1) (18, 21) (18, 13) (25, 15) (25, 5) (21, 29) (21, 12) (21, 18) (13, 18) (13, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 13) 

Response:
The nodes that have at least three neighbors are:
- Node 2 (neighbors: 8, 11, 17, 29)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 19, 23, 25, 10)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 1, 4, 16, 17)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 0, 7, 10, 12, 13)
- Node 12 (neighbors: 9, 20, 21, 23)
- Node 15 (neighbors: 22, 25, 28)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 6, 10, 14, 27)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 1, 13, 21, 28)
- Node 20 (neighbors: 12, 19, 23, 29)
- Node 21 (neighbors: 12, 18, 29)
- Node 24 (neighbors: 8, 17, 26, 27)
- Node 28 (neighbors: 8, 11, 15, 18)

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 44 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <2, (8, 11, 17)>
- <5, (19, 23, 25)>
- <6, (1, 4, 17)>
- <9, (0, 7, 10)> <9, (7, 10, 13)>
- <12, (9, 20, 23)>
- <15, (22, 25, 28)>
- <16, (6, 10, 16)>
- <18, (1, 13, 21)>
- <20, (12, 19, 23)>
- <21, (12, 18, 29)>
- <24, (8, 17, 26)>
- <28, (8, 11, 18)>
