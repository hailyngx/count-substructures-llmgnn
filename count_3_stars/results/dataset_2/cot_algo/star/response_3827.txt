Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 27) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 23) (1, 3) (1, 22) (1, 12) (20, 25) (20, 18) (20, 2) (20, 19) (25, 9) (25, 20) (25, 18) (21, 13) (21, 14) (21, 4) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 22) (26, 28) (26, 10) (16, 9) (16, 28) (16, 18) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 27) (19, 20) (19, 5) (7, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 26) (10, 2) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 29) (24, 11) (24, 8) (24, 22) (29, 11) (29, 22) (29, 14) (13, 21) (13, 2) (8, 6) (8, 24) (14, 21) (14, 29) (14, 12) (23, 9) (12, 1) (12, 14) (27, 3) (27, 6) (27, 5) (0, 5) (0, 17) (0, 4) (17, 0) (17, 2) (2, 20) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 17) (18, 20) (18, 25) (18, 16) (4, 15) (4, 21) (4, 11) (4, 0) (22, 1) (22, 28) (22, 24) (22, 29) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 17}
- Node 1: {3, 12, 22}
- Node 2: {13, 17, 20}
- Node 3: {1, 15, 27}
- Node 4: {0, 11, 15, 21}
- Node 5: {0, 15, 19, 27, 7}
- Node 6: {8, 9, 10, 27}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {6, 24}
- Node 9: {6, 10, 16, 25, 23}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 9, 26}
- Node 11: {4, 24, 29}
- Node 12: {1, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 21}
- Node 14: {12, 21, 29}
- Node 15: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 16: {9, 18, 28}
- Node 17: {0, 2}
- Node 18: {16, 20, 25}
- Node 19: {5, 20}
- Node 20: {2, 18, 19, 25}
- Node 21: {4, 13, 14}
- Node 22: {1, 24, 28, 29}
- Node 23: {9}
- Node 24: {8, 11, 22}
- Node 25: {9, 18, 20}
- Node 26: {10, 28}
- Node 27: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 28: {16, 22, 26}
- Node 29: {11, 14, 22}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, which forms 1 unique 3-star: <3, (1, 15, 27)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, which forms 4 unique 3-stars: <6, (8, 9, 27)>, <6, (9, 10, 27)>, <6, (9, 25, 6)>, <6, (9, 16, 6)>
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, which forms 10 unique 3-stars: <9, (6, 10, 27)>, <9, (6, 16, 9)>, <9, (6, 23, 9)>, <9, (6, 25, 9)>, <9, (10, 25, 9)>, <9, (10, 26, 9)>, <9, (16, 18, 9)>, <9, (16, 28, 9)>, <9, (18, 20, 9)>, <9, (18, 25, 9)>
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, which forms 1 unique 3-star: <15, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, which forms 1 unique 3-star: <16, (9, 18, 28)>
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, which forms 4 unique 3-stars: <22, (1, 24, 28)>, <22, (1, 24, 29)>, <22, (24, 28, 29)>, <22, (28, 29, 14)>
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, which forms 1 unique 3-star: <24, (11, 22, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [22].
