Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 6
- Node 9: 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 60

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
