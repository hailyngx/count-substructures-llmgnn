Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 24) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 9) (4, 27) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 22) (7, 17) (1, 19) (3, 20) (3, 26) (3, 22) (20, 3) (20, 25) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 14) (6, 28) (6, 24) (9, 16) (9, 29) (9, 10) (9, 27) (10, 9) (10, 27) (17, 7) (17, 29) (17, 2) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 15) (29, 9) (29, 17) (29, 5) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 8) (28, 2) (28, 23) (26, 3) (26, 28) (26, 27) (27, 4) (27, 9) (27, 10) (27, 26) (5, 29) (5, 24) (19, 1) (19, 20) (19, 15) (8, 28) (8, 21) (8, 18) (0, 16) (0, 23) (24, 11) (24, 6) (24, 5) (24, 18) (24, 21) (14, 11) (14, 25) (15, 4) (15, 12) (15, 19) (2, 17) (2, 28) (2, 13) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 18) (22, 7) (22, 3) (18, 12) (18, 8) (18, 24) (18, 13) (18, 21) (21, 8) (21, 24) (21, 18) (21, 23) (23, 28) (23, 0) (23, 21) 

Response:
Calculating the degree of each node:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 3
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 4
- Node 10: 2
- Node 11: 4
- Node 12: 3
- Node 13: 3
- Node 14: 2
- Node 15: 3
- Node 16: 3
- Node 17: 3
- Node 18: 5
- Node 19: 3
- Node 20: 3
- Node 21: 4
- Node 22: 2
- Node 23: 3
- Node 24: 5
- Node 25: 2
- Node 26: 3
- Node 27: 4
- Node 28: 5
- Node 29: 4

From the degrees, we see that nodes 11, 18, 24, and 28 have 4 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars involving these nodes.

For node 11:
- Neighbors: 13, 14, 16, 24
- Possible 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

For node 18:
- Neighbors: 12, 13, 21, 24, 8
- Possible 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

For node 24:
- Neighbors: 5, 6, 11, 18, 21
- Possible 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

For node 28:
- Neighbors: 2, 6, 8, 23, 26
- Possible 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars:
- <11, 13, 14, 16>
- <18, 12, 13, 21>
- <18, 13, 21, 24>
- <18, 8, 21, 24>
- <24, 5, 6, 21>
- <24, 5, 6, 18>
- <24, 5, 18, 21>
- <24, 6, 21, 28>
- <24, 21, 23, 28>
- <26, 28, 2, 6>
