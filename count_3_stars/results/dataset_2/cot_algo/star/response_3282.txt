Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 4) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 4) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 12) (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (10, 11) (10, 1) (8, 11) (8, 14) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 7) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 6) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 4) (4, 16) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 6) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 0) (12, 15) (12, 13) (19, 9) (19, 6) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node, and then identify any 3-stars formed.

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 1: {3, 10, 17}
- Node 2: {0, 18}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 15}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 16, 17, 18}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {4, 18, 19}
- Node 7: {0, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {11, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 19}
- Node 10: {1, 11}
- Node 11: {0, 7, 8, 10, 16}
- Node 12: {13, 15}
- Node 13: {12, 14, 16, 17}
- Node 14: {7, 8, 13}
- Node 15: {3, 12, 16}
- Node 16: {4, 11, 13, 15}
- Node 17: {1, 4, 13}
- Node 18: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 19: {6, 9}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars:
- Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<11, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 16, 17)>, <13, (12, 14, 16)>
