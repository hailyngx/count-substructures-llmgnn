Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 9, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {9, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {6, 2}
- Node 4: {6, 1, 7}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 0}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 7, 3, 8, 4}
- Node 7: {6, 4, 0, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {6, 1, 7, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 1, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 and Node 6 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Total = 4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<0, (5, 9, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (9, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 3)>
<6, (5, 7, 4)>
<6, (5, 3, 4)>
<6, (7, 3, 4)>
