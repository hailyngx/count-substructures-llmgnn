Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 0) 

Response:
Calculating the degree of each node:

Node 0 has degree 3

Node 1 has degree 2

Node 2 has degree 6

Node 3 has degree 5

Node 4 has degree 5

Node 5 has degree 4

Node 6 has degree 6

Node 7 has degree 5

Node 8 has degree 2

Node 9 has degree 3

Node 10 has degree 3

Node 11 has degree 6

Node 12 has degree 5

Node 13 has degree 5

Node 14 has degree 7

Now, for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, and 10
Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 11, and 14
Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 12, and 13
Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors 8, 11, and 14
Node 11 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 8, and 14
Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, and 7
Node 13 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 6, and 7
Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 7, and 11

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us 7. So, the final answer is [7].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<2, 1, 3, 10>
<4, 0, 11, 14>
<6, 1, 12, 13>
<7, 8, 11, 14>
<11, 4, 8, 14>
<12, 1, 3, 7>
<13, 0, 6, 7>
