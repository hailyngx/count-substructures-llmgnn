Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 6) (5, 6) (5, 15) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 16) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 1) (14, 0) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 15) (8, 0) (19, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 13) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 18) (12, 3) (12, 0) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 15) (18, 6) (18, 16) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 2) (15, 13) (17, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 10, 15}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 5: {6, 15}
- Node 6: {5, 11, 15, 16, 18}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 10, 17}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {3, 11, 13, 16}
- Node 10: {2, 7, 11}
- Node 11: {6, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 3}
- Node 13: {9, 11, 15, 19}
- Node 14: {0, 1}
- Node 15: {2, 5, 6, 13}
- Node 16: {6, 9, 18}
- Node 17: {7}
- Node 18: {6, 16}
- Node 19: {13}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0,  with \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1,  with \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3,  with \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6,  with \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7,  with \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9,  with \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11,  with \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13,  with \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15,  with \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16,  with \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 42

Therefore, the answer is [42].
