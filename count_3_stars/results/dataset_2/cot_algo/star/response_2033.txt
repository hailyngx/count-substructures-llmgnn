Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 6, 7}

Now, we will check the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with it.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with it.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with it.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with it.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 62

So, the final answer is [62], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>.
