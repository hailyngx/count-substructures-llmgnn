Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 12) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 1) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 12) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 6) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 12
- Node 1: 0, 8, 12, 13
- Node 2: 6, 7, 11, 12
- Node 3: 6, 7, 13
- Node 4: 6, 11, 12
- Node 5: 0, 6, 10
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11
- Node 7: 2, 3, 9, 13
- Node 8: 1, 6, 9, 11, 13
- Node 9: 7, 8, 12
- Node 10: 5, 6, 11, 13, 14
- Node 11: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
- Node 12: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9, 12, 14
- Node 13: 1, 3, 7, 8, 10
- Node 14: 10, 12

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can participate in \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) different 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can participate in \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) different 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can participate in \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) different 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 7 neighbors, so it can participate in \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) different 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 10 + 10 + 35 = 75 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [75], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <6, (2, 10, 11)>
- <6, (2, 10, 13)>
- <6, (2, 11, 13)>
- <6, (4, 10, 11)>
- <6, (4, 10, 13)>
- <6, (4, 11, 13)>
- <6, (10, 11, 13)>
- <8, (1, 10, 13)>
- <8, (1, 11, 13)>
- <8, (6, 10, 11)>
- <8, (6, 10, 13)>
- <8, (6, 11, 13)>
- <8, (10, 11, 13)>
- <10, (5, 11, 13)>
- <10, (6, 11, 13)>
- <10, (10, 11, 13)>
- <12, (1, 9, 12)>
- <12, (4, 9, 12)>
- <12, (9, 12, 14)>
- <12, (1, 12, 14)>
