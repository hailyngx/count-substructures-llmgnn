Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {9, 8, 6}
Node 1 neighbors: {9, 3, 2}
Node 2 neighbors: {5, 9, 1, 3, 4}
Node 3 neighbors: {5, 9, 1, 7, 2, 4}
Node 4 neighbors: {3, 8, 6, 2}
Node 5 neighbors: {2, 3, 7}
Node 6 neighbors: {4, 8, 0, 7}
Node 7 neighbors: {5, 3, 6}
Node 8 neighbors: {9, 4, 0, 6}
Node 9 neighbors: {8, 2, 3, 1, 0}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed
Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [54].

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 2, 6)>
<6, (4, 8, 0)>
<8, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (8, 2, 3)>
