Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 1) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in terms of its adjacency list:

1: 13, 4, 7, 12, 0, 5

2: 7, 5, 3

3: 7, 0, 14, 9, 2

4: 8, 12, 9, 0, 14, 1

5: 7, 0, 2, 1

6: 8, 10, 7, 12

7: 12, 3, 6, 1, 5, 2

8: 4, 10, 6

9: 10, 11, 4, 3

10: 8, 11, 6, 9

11: 10, 9

12: 4, 7, 6, 1

13: 1

14: 4, 0, 3

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1: <1, (4, 7, 12)>, <1, (4, 7, 0)>, <1, (4, 12, 0)>, <1, (7, 12, 0)>, <1, (7, 12, 5)>
2. Node 2: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
3. Node 3: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
4. Node 4: <4, (8, 12, 9)>, <4, (8, 12, 0)>, <4, (8, 0, 14)>, <4, (8, 1, 12)>, <4, (8, 1, 5)>, <4, (8, 12, 14)>, <4, (9, 0, 14)>, <4, (9, 3, 14)>, <4, (0, 14, 3)>, <4, (1, 12, 5)>
5. Node 5: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
6. Node 6: <6, (8, 10, 7)>, <6, (8, 10, 12)>, <6, (8, 10, 6)>, <6, (8, 7, 12)>, <6, (10, 7, 12)>, <6, (10, 7, 5)>, <6, (7, 12, 5)>
7. Node 7: <7, (12, 1, 5)>
8. Node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
9. Node 9: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
10. Node 10: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
11. Node 11: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
12. Node 12: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
13. Node 13: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
14. Node 14: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
