Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (10, 7) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first find the neighbor set for each node.

Node 0 neighbors: {1, 6, 8, 9}
Node 1 neighbors: {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
Node 2 neighbors: {1, 11, 12, 14}
Node 3 neighbors: {7, 10, 11, 13, 14}
Node 4 neighbors: {1, 6, 7, 12, 14}
Node 5 neighbors: {9}
Node 6 neighbors: {0, 1, 4, 9}
Node 7 neighbors: {3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 14}
Node 8 neighbors: {0, 1, 9, 11}
Node 9 neighbors: {0, 5, 6, 8, 12}
Node 10 neighbors: {3, 7}
Node 11 neighbors: {2, 3, 7, 8, 13}
Node 12 neighbors: {2, 4, 7, 9}
Node 13 neighbors: {3, 11, 14}
Node 14 neighbors: {2, 3, 4, 7, 13}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 80. 

Therefore, the final answer is [80].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 14>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 14>
<1, 7, 14>
<3, 11, 13>
<3, 11, 14>
<3, 13, 14>
<4, 7, 14>
<11, 13, 14>
