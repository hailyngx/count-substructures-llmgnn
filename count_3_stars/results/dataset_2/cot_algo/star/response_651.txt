Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 12) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 12) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by looking at each node with three or more neighbors. We will explore the neighborhood of each node and count the number of 3-stars formed around it.

For node 0: {7, 8, 14}
No 3-star is formed with node 0 as it has fewer than 3 neighbors. 

For node 1: {4, 6, 12, 13}
In this case, there is only one 3-star: <1, (4, 6, 12)>

For node 2: {4, 10}
No 3-star is formed with node 2 as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

For node 3: {8, 9, 10, 11, 14}
In this case, there are 4 3-stars formed: <3, (8, 9, 14)>, <3, (9, 10, 14)>, <3, (10, 11, 14)>, <3, (3, 10, 11)>

For node 4: {1, 2, 7, 10, 12}
In this case, there is only one 3-star: <4, (1, 7, 12)>

For node 5: {7, 11, 12, 13}
In this case, there is only one 3-star: <5, (7, 11, 13)>

For node 6: {1, 8, 9}
No 3-star is formed with node 6 as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

For node 7: {0, 4, 5, 9, 13}
In this case, there are 3 3-stars formed: <7, (0, 4, 14)>, <7, (4, 5, 12)>, <7, (5, 11, 13)>

For node 8: {0, 3, 6, 12}
No 3-star is formed with node 8 as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

For node 9: {3, 6, 7, 11}
In this case, there is only one 3-star: <9, (3, 7, 11)>

For node 10: {3, 4, 14}
No 3-star is formed with node 10 as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

For node 11: {3, 5, 9, 12, 13}
In this case, there is only one 3-star: <11, (3, 9, 13)>

For node 12: {4, 5, 8, 11}
No 3-star is formed with node 12 as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

For node 13: {5, 7, 11}
No 3-star is formed with node 13 as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

For node 14: {0, 3, 10}
No 3-star is formed with node 14 as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

Adding up the total number of unique 3-stars gives 10. 
Thus, the final number to put inside brackets is [10].
