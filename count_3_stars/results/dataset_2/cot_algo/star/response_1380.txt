Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 5) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 14) (10, 4) (10, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 4, 9, 12, 5}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 9, 10}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 11, 12}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 6, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 1, 11, 13}
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 7, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 6, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 8: neighbors {4, 9, 14}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 10: neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 11: neighbors {3, 4, 5}
- Node 12: neighbors {1, 3, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 13: neighbors {5, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 14: neighbors {7, 8, 12, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: no 3-stars (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \(inom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 2: no 3-stars (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: no 3-stars (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \(inom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 5: no 3-stars (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 6: \(inom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \(inom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 8: no 3-stars (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \(inom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 10: no 3-stars (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 11: no 3-stars (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: \(inom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 13: no 3-stars (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 14: no 3-stars (has 4 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 60

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [60], and they are:
- <1, 4, 5, 12>
- <1, 4, 6, 9>
- <1, 4, 6, 12>
- <1, 4, 9, 12>
- <1, 5, 6, 13>
- <1, 5, 7, 13>
- <1, 5, 11, 13>
- <1, 6, 7, 9>
- <1, 6, 7, 12>
- <1, 6, 9, 12>
- <4, 6, 7, 9>
- <4, 6, 7, 12>
- <4, 6, 9, 12>
- <5, 6, 7, 13>
- <5, 7, 13, 14>
- <6, 7, 9, 13>
- <9, 12, 14, 7>
