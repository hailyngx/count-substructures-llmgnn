- Node 6: {21, 14, 11, 19}
- Node 7: {16, 3, 11, 23}
- Node 8: {21, 19, 25, 22, 3}
- Node 9: {12, 15, 18, 24}
- Node 10: {5}
- Node 11: {6, 7, 1, 22}
- Node 12: {19, 9}
- Node 13: {17, 24}

- Node 24: {13, 9, 18, 22}
- Node 25: {27, 28, 8, 29, 4}
- Node 26: {28, 29, 0}
- Node 27: {25}
- Node 28: {26, 16, 25}
- Node 29: {26, 5, 25, 0}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 5, 8, 9, 11, 15, 22, 24, 25, 26, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars from these nodes:
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 76 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [76].
