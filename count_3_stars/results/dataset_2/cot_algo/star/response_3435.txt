Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 20) (1, 25) (3, 17) (3, 5) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 5) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 0) (12, 7) (12, 20) (27, 5) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 22) (7, 2) (0, 17) (0, 14) (0, 9) (0, 26) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 29) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 27) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 22) (6, 15) (6, 18) (4, 14) (4, 13) (4, 2) (8, 14) (8, 24) (8, 22) (21, 28) (21, 23) (21, 22) (21, 15) (28, 21) (28, 19) (28, 24) (28, 20) (24, 8) (24, 28) (24, 11) (26, 0) (26, 15) (18, 6) (18, 9) (19, 28) (19, 23) (19, 15) (23, 21) (23, 19) (23, 20) (16, 29) (16, 2) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 11) (15, 6) (15, 21) (15, 26) (15, 19) (11, 24) (11, 9) (20, 1) (20, 12) (20, 28) (20, 23) (25, 1) (25, 2) (13, 4) (13, 2) (29, 14) (29, 16) (2, 7) (2, 4) (2, 16) (2, 25) (2, 13) (22, 7) (22, 6) (22, 8) (22, 21) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 17, 14, 9, 26
- Node 1: 20, 25
- Node 2: 7, 4, 16, 25, 13
- Node 3: 17, 5
- Node 4: 14, 13, 2
- Node 5: 3, 10, 27, 6
- Node 6: 5, 22, 15, 18
- Node 7: 10, 12, 22, 2
- Node 8: 14, 24, 22
- Node 9: 0, 18, 11
- Node 10: 17, 7, 5
- Node 11: 24, 9
- Node 12: 7, 20
- Node 13: 4, 2
- Node 14: 0, 4, 29, 8
- Node 15: 6, 21, 26, 19
- Node 16: 2, 29
- Node 17: 3, 10, 0
- Node 18: 6, 9
- Node 19: 28, 15, 23
- Node 20: 1, 12, 28, 23
- Node 21: 28, 23, 22, 15
- Node 22: 7, 6, 8, 21
- Node 23: 21, 19, 20
- Node 24: 8, 28, 11
- Node 25: 1, 2
- Node 26: 0, 15
- Node 27: 5
- Node 28: 21, 19, 24, 20
- Node 29: 14, 16

Now let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 3-stars: {0, 14, 17}, {0, 9, 26}
- Node 2, 3-stars: {2, 7, 22}, {2, 13, 25}
- Node 4, 3-stars: {4, 13, 14}
- Node 5, 3-stars: {5, 10, 27}
- Node 6, 3-stars: {6, 15, 21}
- Node 7, 3-stars: {7, 10, 22}
- Node 8, 3-stars: {8, 14, 22}
- Node 14, 3-stars: {14, 8, 22}
- Node 15, 3-stars: {15, 19, 21}
- Node 17, 3-stars: {17, 10, 0}
- Node 19, 3-stars: {19, 21, 28}
- Node 20, 3-stars: {20, 28, 23}

The total number of 3-stars formed is 13, so the final answer is [13].
