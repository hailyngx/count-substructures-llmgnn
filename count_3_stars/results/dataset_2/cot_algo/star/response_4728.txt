Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and the provided edges, let's first identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 7, 10, 4, 13}
- Node 1: {6, 3, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {9, 5, 14}
- Node 3: {6, 1, 11, 14, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 12}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 11, 4, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 3, 8, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 14}
- Node 8: {6, 3, 5, 10}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 12}
- Node 10: {8, 0, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 0, 13, 5}
- Node 12: {9, 4}
- Node 13: {6, 11, 0, 10}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 2, 7, 10, 5}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 3, 13}: <6, (1, 3, 13)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes {3, 5, 10}: <8, (3, 5, 10)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 5, 14}: <10, (0, 5, 14)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
