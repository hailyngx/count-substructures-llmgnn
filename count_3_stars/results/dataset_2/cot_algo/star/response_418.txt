Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 6}

Now let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (6, 8, 9)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have 3 in total. Thus, the answer is [3].
