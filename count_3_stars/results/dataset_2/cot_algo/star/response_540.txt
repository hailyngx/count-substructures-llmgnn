Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 17) (9, 16) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 14) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 17) (11, 15) (8, 15) (13, 12) (13, 18) (6, 17) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 16) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 1) (16, 9) (16, 7) (16, 14) (16, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 16) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 6) (2, 14) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 12) (18, 13) (18, 12) (15, 4) (15, 11) (15, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 3, 12}
- Node 1: {10, 14, 12}
- Node 2: {14}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 6, 0, 16}
- Node 4: {7, 12, 19, 15}
- Node 5: {19, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {17, 3}
- Node 7: {4, 16, 3, 14}
- Node 8: {15}
- Node 9: {17, 16}
- Node 10: {11, 1, 19}
- Node 11: {10, 17, 15}
- Node 12: {4, 13, 0, 18, 1}
- Node 13: {12, 18}
- Node 14: {7, 1, 2, 16}
- Node 15: {4, 11, 8}
- Node 16: {9, 7, 14, 3}
- Node 17: {9, 11, 6}
- Node 18: {13, 12}
- Node 19: {5, 4, 10}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves {5, 7, 16}
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves {7, 12, 19}
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves {4, 16, 14}
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with leaves {4, 1, 18}
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with leaves {7, 1, 16}

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [5].
