Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 9, 6, 3}
- Node 1: {2, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 8, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 0, 4}
- Node 4: {5, 3, 8, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 8, 4, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 6, 8, 2}
- Node 8: {5, 1, 4, 2, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 2, 7, 0}

Now, we need to find the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 8 have three or more neighbors.

Next, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 48 \).

Thus, the final answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>.
