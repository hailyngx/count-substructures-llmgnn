Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 13) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {8, 9, 10}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 9, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 10}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 10: {6, 8, 12}
- Node 11: {8, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {7, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {3, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {3, 5, 7, 9, 13}

Next, we will count the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 14)>
<8, (1, 10, 12)>
<9, (4, 5, 14)>
<10, (6, 8, 12)>
<11, (8, 9, 12)>
<12, (7, 10, 11)>
<14, (3, 9, 13)>
