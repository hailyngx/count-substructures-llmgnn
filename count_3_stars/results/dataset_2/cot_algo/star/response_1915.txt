Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 2) (16, 17) (16, 4) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 4) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 12) (10, 14) (13, 2) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 6) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 5) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 12) (19, 4) (19, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 17) (3, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 17) (5, 8) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 19) (9, 3) (9, 14) (7, 1) (7, 19) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 8) (12, 14) (6, 0) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 12) (18, 0) (18, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6, 18}
- Node 1: {7, 14, 15}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 9, 17}
- Node 4: {2, 16, 19}
- Node 5: {0, 8, 11, 17}
- Node 6: {0, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 19}
- Node 8: {5, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {3, 14}
- Node 10: {14}
- Node 11: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 12: {8, 13, 14, 15}
- Node 13: {2, 6, 12, 17}
- Node 14: {1, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 15: {1, 12, 18}
- Node 16: {4, 17}
- Node 17: {3, 5, 13, 16}
- Node 18: {0, 15}
- Node 19: {4, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 4 neighbors
- Node 2, 4 neighbors
- Node 3, 4 neighbors
- Node 5, 4 neighbors
- Node 8, 3 neighbors
- Node 11, 3 neighbors
- Node 12, 4 neighbors
- Node 13, 4 neighbors
- Node 14, 4 neighbors
- Node 15, 3 neighbors
- Node 17, 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 12, 13, 14, and 17 each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Total number of 3-stars = 8 * 4 = 32

So, the final answer is [32].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 18)>
<2, (3, 4, 13)>
<3, (0, 2, 17)>
<5, (0, 8, 17)>
<12, (8, 13, 14)>
<13, (2, 6, 17)>
<14, (1, 9, 12)>
<17, (3, 5, 13)>
