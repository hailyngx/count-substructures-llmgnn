Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 16) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 21) (3, 25) (3, 14) (3, 8) (15, 14) (15, 11) (15, 16) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 21) (0, 11) (0, 23) (20, 29) (20, 24) (20, 28) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 11) (5, 26) (5, 18) (6, 28) (6, 17) (6, 23) (28, 20) (28, 6) (28, 16) (28, 22) (28, 27) (7, 25) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (16, 9) (16, 15) (16, 28) (16, 23) (16, 27) (29, 20) (29, 1) (29, 10) (8, 3) (8, 10) (22, 28) (22, 12) (12, 22) (12, 17) (19, 21) (19, 24) (19, 27) (1, 7) (1, 29) (1, 24) (17, 6) (17, 12) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 18) (14, 4) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 19) (21, 27) (27, 28) (27, 16) (27, 19) (27, 21) (13, 7) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 29) (10, 8) (10, 13) (4, 14) (4, 24) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 18) (24, 20) (24, 19) (24, 1) (24, 4) (23, 0) (23, 6) (23, 16) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first organize the list of edges into sets for each node:

Node 0: {11, 23}
Node 1: {7, 24, 29}
Node 2: {18}
Node 3: {8, 14, 25}
Node 4: {14, 24}
Node 5: {18, 26}
Node 6: {17, 23, 28}
Node 7: {1, 10, 13, 25}
Node 8: {3, 10}
Node 9: {16, 26}
Node 10: {7, 8, 13, 29}
Node 11: {0, 15, 18}
Node 12: {17, 22}
Node 13: {7, 10}
Node 14: {3, 4, 15, 18}
Node 15: {11, 14, 16}
Node 16: {9, 15, 23, 27, 28}
Node 17: {6, 12}
Node 18: {2, 5, 11, 14}
Node 19: {21, 24, 27}
Node 20: {24, 28, 29}
Node 21: {19, 25, 26, 27}
Node 22: {12, 28}
Node 23: {0, 6, 16}
Node 24: {1, 4, 19, 20}
Node 25: {3, 7, 21}
Node 26: {5, 9, 21}
Node 27: {16, 19, 21}
Node 28: {6, 16, 20, 22, 27}
Node 29: {1, 10, 20}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 16 has 5 neighbors (15, 23, 27, 28, 9), so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 \), so we represent this as [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<16, (15, 23, 27)>
<16, (15, 28, 27)>
<16, (15, 28, 9)>
<16, (23, 28, 27)>
<16, (23, 28, 9)>
<16, (27, 28, 9)>
<16, (15, 23, 9)>
<16, (15, 23, 28)>
<16, (23, 27, 9)>
<16, (27, 9, 28)>
