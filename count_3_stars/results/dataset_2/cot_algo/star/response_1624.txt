Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in terms of its adjacency list:

Node 0: 5, 2, 1, 6
Node 1: 5, 9, 4, 8, 0
Node 2: 8, 6, 3, 0
Node 3: 5, 4, 2
Node 4: 5, 9, 3, 1, 6
Node 5: 8, 1, 4, 0, 3
Node 6: 4, 2, 8, 0
Node 7: 9, 8
Node 8: 5, 7, 2, 6, 1
Node 9: 4, 1, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 5, 2, 1, 6 (Degree = 4)
Node 1: 5, 9, 4, 8, 0 (Degree = 5)
Node 2: 8, 6, 3, 0 (Degree = 4)
Node 3: 5, 4, 2 (Degree = 3)
Node 4: 5, 9, 3, 1, 6 (Degree = 5)
Node 5: 8, 1, 4, 0, 3 (Degree = 5)
Node 6: 4, 2, 8, 0 (Degree = 4)
Node 8: 5, 7, 2, 6, 1 (Degree = 5)
Node 9: 4, 1, 7 (Degree = 3)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<0, (5, 2, 1)>, <0, (5, 2, 6)>, <0, (5, 1, 6)>, <0, (2, 1, 6)>

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<1, (5, 9, 4)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 0)>, <1, (5, 1, 0)>, <1, (9, 4, 8)>, <1, (9, 4, 0)>, <1, (4, 8, 0)>, <1, (4, 8, 6)>, <1, (4, 0, 6)>, <1, (8, 0, 6)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<2, (8, 6, 0)>, <2, (8, 3, 0)>, <2, (6, 3, 0)>, <2, (8, 6, 3)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<4, (5, 9, 3)>, <4, (5, 3, 1)>, <4, (5, 1, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 6)>, <4, (9, 3, 1)>, <4, (9, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 1, 6)>, <4, (3, 1, 0)>, <4, (3, 6, 0)>, <4, (1, 8, 6)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<5, (8, 1, 4)>, <5, (8, 4, 0)>, <5, (8, 0, 3)>, <5, (1, 4, 0)>, <5, (1, 0, 3)>, <5, (4, 0, 3)>, <5, (1, 4, 3)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<8, (5, 7, 2)>, <8, (5, 2, 6)>, <8, (5, 6, 1)>, <8, (5, 1, 0)>, <8, (7, 6, 1)>, <8, (7, 2, 6)>, <8, (7, 2, 0)>, <8, (2, 6, 0)>, <8, (2, 6, 1)>, <8, (6, 1, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].
