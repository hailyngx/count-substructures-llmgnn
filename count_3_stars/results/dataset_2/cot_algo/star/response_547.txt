Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 17) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 12) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 5) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 12) (5, 18) (5, 2) (5, 8) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 9) (13, 7) (13, 15) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 19) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 16) (16, 1) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 15) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 9) (9, 19) (9, 15) (14, 10) (14, 16) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 3, 10, 11, 16
- Node 2: 5, 6, 16
- Node 3: 1, 11
- Node 4: 1, 17, 18
- Node 5: 2, 8, 18
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8, 15
- Node 7: 6, 13, 19
- Node 8: 5, 6, 12, 17
- Node 9: 15, 19
- Node 10: 1, 11, 14
- Node 11: 1, 3, 10, 12, 18
- Node 12: 8, 11, 16
- Node 13: 7, 15
- Node 14: 10, 16
- Node 15: 6, 9, 13
- Node 16: 1, 2, 12, 14
- Node 17: 4, 8, 19
- Node 18: 4, 5, 11
- Node 19: 7, 9, 17

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 33

So, the final answer is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 10, 11, 16>
<1, 10, 11, 18>
<1, 10, 16, 14>
<1, 11, 12, 16>
<4, 5, 8, 17>
<6, 7, 8, 15>
<8, 12, 16, 14>
<17, 19, 9, 15>
