Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 14) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 12) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 12) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 10) (10, 3) (10, 0) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 9) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 5, 3, 10}
- Node 1: {7, 13, 11, 9}
- Node 2: {7, 6, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 0, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {7, 6, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 13, 0, 3, 14}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 2, 11}
- Node 7: {4, 9, 8, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 9, 0, 12}
- Node 9: {7, 8, 1, 12}
- Node 10: {3, 0}
- Node 11: {6, 1, 12}
- Node 12: {8, 3, 11, 9, 14}
- Node 13: {5, 1, 14}
- Node 14: {5, 13, 2, 12}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- For Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 12)>, <3, (0, 5, 12)>, <3, (4, 5, 12)>
- For Node 5: <5, (0, 3, 14)>, <5, (0, 5, 14)>, <5, (3, 5, 14)>
- For Node 12: <12, (3, 8, 14)>

Finally, counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [10].
