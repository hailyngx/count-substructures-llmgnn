Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 10) (2, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 2: {10, 11}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {1, 9, 11}
- Node 6: {0, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {6, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 6, 12}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 5, 14}
- Node 12: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 10}
- Node 14: {0, 6, 7, 11}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 5, Node 9, Node 11, and Node 14 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form a 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Each of the four nodes forms 1 3-star, so the total number of 3-stars is 4.

Therefore, the final answer is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, 1, 9, 11>
- <9, 6, 10, 12>
- <11, 2, 4, 14>
- <14, 0, 6, 7>
