Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 6) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
Since this graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 10}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 10}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {4, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 13: {4, 6, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 14: {7, 12}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 neighbors or more: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 68

Thus, the final answer is [68], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 12>, <0, 6, 12>, <3, 4, 10>, <3, 4, 13>, <3, 6, 10>, <3, 6, 13>, <4, 5, 10>, <4, 5, 13>, <5, 7, 11>, <5, 8, 13>, <6, 8, 13>, <7, 11, 13>, <10, 11, 13>.
