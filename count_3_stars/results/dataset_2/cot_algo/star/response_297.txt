Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 14) (4, 16) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 9) (7, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (1, 7) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 14) (8, 17) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 3) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 0) (19, 18) (19, 14) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 1) (18, 19) (12, 16) (12, 6) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 0) (3, 9) (3, 13) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 15) (14, 19) (10, 6) (10, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node. Then, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed using that node as the center. 

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 17}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 15, 18}
- Node 2: {0, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {9, 13}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 16, 17}
- Node 5: {0, 14}
- Node 6: {7, 10, 12}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6, 9, 18}
- Node 8: {17}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 7, 13}
- Node 10: {2, 6}
- Node 11: {2, 13}
- Node 12: {6, 16}
- Node 13: {3, 11, 17}
- Node 14: {5, 15, 16, 19}
- Node 15: {1, 14}
- Node 16: {4, 12, 14, 18}
- Node 17: {0, 4, 8, 13}
- Node 18: {1, 7, 16, 19}
- Node 19: {14, 18}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 1: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 4: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 7: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 14: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 16: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 18: inom(4, 3) = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40].

Unique 3-stars:

<1, 0, 7>
<1, 14, 15>
<1, 14, 18>

<1, 18, 7>
<4, 7, 16>
<4, 7, 9>
