Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 10) (5, 11) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (4, 13) (4, 17) (18, 7) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 19) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (15, 13) (15, 17) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 12) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 19) (12, 2) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 13) (17, 4) (17, 15) (13, 4) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 3) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {6, 7, 8, 19}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 7, 16}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 9, 12}
- Node 3: {2, 8, 13}
- Node 4: {13, 17}
- Node 5: {9, 11}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 18}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 9, 16}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 10: {9, 14, 16}
- Node 11: {5, 9, 14, 16}
- Node 12: {2, 19}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 15, 19}
- Node 14: {6, 10, 11}
- Node 15: {13, 17}
- Node 16: {1, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 17: {4, 15}
- Node 18: {7}
- Node 19: {0, 12, 13}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars each node can form:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars)
- Node 3: has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 4: has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 5: has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 6: has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 7: has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (3-stars)
- Node 10: has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars)
- Node 12: has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars)
- Node 14: has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 15: has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars)
- Node 17: has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 18: has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 19: has less than 3 neighbors

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 34 \), so the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 7, 8, 19>
- <0, 6, 7, 1>
- <0, 6, 19, 12>
- <0, 1, 7, 19>
- <1, 2, 3, 9>
- <8, 9, 10, 16>
- <9, 10, 11, 16>
- <9, 10, 14, 16>
- <9, 11, 14, 16>
- <13, 15, 17, 19>
