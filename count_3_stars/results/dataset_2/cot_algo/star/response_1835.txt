Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 24) (25, 20) (25, 26) (25, 14) (25, 11) (10, 21) (10, 2) (11, 25) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 29) (17, 20) (17, 1) (17, 28) (17, 4) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 5) (1, 17) (1, 26) (1, 15) (1, 13) (26, 25) (26, 1) (26, 7) (22, 23) (22, 5) (22, 24) (23, 11) (23, 22) (23, 0) (3, 11) (3, 19) (16, 2) (16, 28) (16, 9) (16, 27) (16, 6) (28, 17) (28, 16) (28, 27) (28, 4) (28, 24) (21, 10) (21, 9) (21, 27) (21, 8) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 29) (12, 13) (19, 3) (19, 15) (4, 17) (4, 28) (4, 0) (27, 16) (27, 28) (27, 21) (9, 16) (9, 21) (0, 23) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 16) (6, 0) (7, 26) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 29) (5, 18) (5, 22) (5, 29) (8, 21) (8, 29) (24, 20) (24, 22) (24, 28) (24, 14) (29, 11) (29, 15) (29, 13) (29, 5) (29, 8) (14, 25) (14, 24) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {23, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {17, 26, 15, 13}
- Node 2: {10, 18, 16}
- Node 3: {11, 19}
- Node 4: {17, 28, 0}
- Node 5: {18, 22, 29}
- Node 6: {16, 0}
- Node 7: {26}
- Node 8: {21, 29}
- Node 9: {16, 21}
- Node 10: {21, 2}
- Node 11: {25, 3, 23, 29}
- Node 12: {13}
- Node 13: {1, 29, 12}
- Node 14: {25, 24}
- Node 15: {1, 19, 29}
- Node 16: {2, 18, 28, 27, 6, 9}
- Node 17: {20, 1, 28, 4}
- Node 18: {2, 5}
- Node 19: {3, 15}
- Node 20: {25, 17, 24}
- Node 21: {10, 9, 27, 8}
- Node 22: {5, 23, 24}
- Node 23: {11, 22, 0}
- Node 24: {20, 22, 28, 14}
- Node 25: {20, 26, 14, 11}
- Node 26: {25, 1, 7}
- Node 27: {16, 28, 21}
- Node 28: {17, 16, 27, 4, 24}
- Node 29: {11, 15, 13, 5, 8}

Nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Now, for each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us: 70

Therefore, the final answer is [70].
