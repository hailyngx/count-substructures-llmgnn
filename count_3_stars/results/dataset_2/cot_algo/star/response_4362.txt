Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 9) (16, 6) (4, 16) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 0) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 6) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 15) (10, 15) (15, 0) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 14) (17, 16) (17, 13) (18, 8) (19, 7) (19, 3) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 15) (14, 8) (14, 15) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 13, 15}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 12, 19}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 8, 16}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 16}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 19}
- Node 8: {4, 13, 14, 18}
- Node 9: {11, 15, 16}
- Node 10: {15}
- Node 11: {5, 9, 12}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 5, 8, 17}
- Node 14: {8, 15}
- Node 15: {0, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 16: {4, 6, 9, 17}
- Node 17: {13, 16}
- Node 18: {8}
- Node 19: {3, 7}

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 7, 8}.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 6, 13}.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 19}.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {13, 14, 18}.
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 11}.
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 8, 17}.
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 10, 14}.
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 9, 17}.

So, there are a total of 8 unique 3-stars formed in this graph. Thus, the final answer is [8].
