Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 8) (5, 14) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 12) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 12) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 10}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 8, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 12}
- Node 7: {4, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 10}
- Node 9: {7, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 4, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 11: {4, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 6, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {4, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 5}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, 13. <4, (7, 8, 13)>

There is 1 unique 3-star in this graph, so the final answer is [1].
