Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 12) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 12) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 7) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 9) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 9) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 4) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 3) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 6, 10, 11 
Node 1: 4, 6, 7, 11 
Node 2: 7, 8, 10, 14 
Node 3: 5, 10, 12, 13 
Node 4: 1, 9, 10, 13 
Node 5: 3, 6, 8 
Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8 
Node 7: 1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 14 
Node 8: 2, 5, 6, 12 
Node 9: 4, 7, 10, 14 
Node 10: 2, 3, 4, 9 
Node 11: 0, 1, 7 
Node 12: 3, 8, 13, 14 
Node 13: 3, 4, 12 
Node 14: 2, 7, 9, 12 

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

For Node 2, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<2, (7, 10, 14)> 
<2, (7, 9, 14)> 
<2, (10, 9, 14)> 
<2, (10, 4, 9)>

For Node 3, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<3, (5, 10, 12)> 
<3, (5, 10, 13)> 
<3, (5, 12, 13)> 
<3, (10, 12, 13)>

For Node 6, we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<6, (1, 5, 7)> 
<6, (1, 5, 8)> 
<6, (1, 7, 11)> 
<6, (1, 11, 0)> 
<6, (5, 7, 11)> 
<6, (5, 8, 6)> 
<6, (7, 1, 11)> 
<6, (7, 9, 14)> 
<6, (11, 0, 1)> 
<6, (11, 7, 1)>

For Node 7, we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<7, (1, 9, 14)> 
<7, (2, 6, 14)> 
<7, (2, 10, 9)> 
<7, (2, 14, 9)> 
<7, (6, 1, 11)> 
<7, (9, 4, 10)> 
<7, (9, 4, 14)> 
<7, (9, 10, 4)> 
<7, (11, 0, 1)> 
<7, (14, 2, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 28, so the final result is [28].
