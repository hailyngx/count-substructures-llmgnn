Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 4) (15, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (17, 19) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 12) (18, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (16, 4) (16, 6) (8, 10) (8, 19) (8, 12) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 12) (1, 10) (1, 18) (14, 2) (14, 19) (14, 13) (4, 3) (4, 16) (4, 9) (4, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 4) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 4) (13, 10) (13, 14) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 0) (6, 16) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 6, 7, 9
Node 1: 8, 10, 18
Node 2: 6, 14, 18
Node 3: 4, 5, 15
Node 4: 3, 5, 9, 16
Node 5: 3, 4, 11
Node 6: 0, 2, 16, 18
Node 7: 0, 9
Node 8: 1, 10, 12, 19
Node 9: 0, 4, 7
Node 10: 1, 11, 13, 18
Node 11: 5, 10, 12
Node 12: 8, 11, 18, 19
Node 13: 10, 14
Node 14: 2, 13, 19
Node 15: 3
Node 16: 4, 6
Node 17: 19
Node 18: 1, 2, 6, 10, 12, 14, 19
Node 19: 8, 12, 14, 17, 18

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <4, (3, 5, 9)>
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <6, (2, 16, 18)>
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <8, (1, 10, 18)>
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <10, (1, 11, 18)>
Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <12, (8, 11, 18)>
Node 13 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 15 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 17 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 18 has 7 neighbors, so it forms 35 3-stars. 
<18, (1, 10, 12)>
<18, (1, 10, 14)>
<18, (1, 10, 19)>
<18, (1, 12, 19)>
<18, (2, 10, 12)>
<18, (2, 10, 14)>

<18, (6, 14, 19)>
<18, (10, 12, 14)>
<18, (10, 12, 19)>
<18, (10, 14, 19)>
<18, (12, 14, 19)>
<18, (1, 12, 18)>
<18, (1, 14, 18)>
<18, (10, 12, 18)>
<18, (10, 14, 18)>
<18, (12, 14, 18)>
<18, (1, 18, 19)>
<18, (10, 18, 19)>
<18, (12, 18, 19)>
<18, (14, 18, 19)>
<18, (2, 12, 18)>
<18, (2, 14, 18)>
<18, (6, 12, 18)>
<18, (6, 14, 18)>
<18, (12, 14, 18)>
<18, (2, 18, 19)>
<18, (6, 18, 19)>
<18, (12, 18, 19)>
<18, (14, 18, 19)>
Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
<19, (8, 12, 14)>
<19, (8, 12, 18)>
<19, (8, 14, 18)>
<19, (12, 14, 18)>
<19, (1, 10, 18)>
<19, (1, 14, 18)>
<19, (10, 12, 18)>
<19, (10, 14, 18)>
<19, (12, 14, 18)>
<19, (2, 12, 18)>

Adding all the 3-stars formed, we have 1 + 1 + 1 + 35 + 10 = 48. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].
