Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: has 4 neighbors
- Node 3: has 5 neighbors
- Node 4: has 5 neighbors
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors
- Node 6: has 4 neighbors
- Node 8: has 5 neighbors
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [46].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 8, 4)>
- <4, (8, 3, 5)>
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- <6, (9, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>
