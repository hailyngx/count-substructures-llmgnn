Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 10) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 4) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 12) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 14) (12, 19) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 4) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 10) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 15) (1, 16) (1, 11) (1, 10) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 13) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 13) (15, 17) (15, 14) (10, 9) (10, 19) (10, 18) (10, 1) (2, 4) (13, 3) (13, 14) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can start by identifying the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {3, 5, 7, 11}
Node 1: {10, 11, 16}
Node 2: {4}
Node 3: {0, 13, 16}
Node 4: {2, 5, 16}
Node 5: {0, 4, 7}
Node 6: {8, 11, 17}
Node 7: {0, 5, 8}
Node 8: {6, 7, 14, 19}
Node 9: {10, 17, 18}
Node 10: {1, 9, 18, 19}
Node 11: {0, 1, 6}
Node 12: {16, 19}
Node 13: {3, 14}
Node 14: {8, 13, 15}
Node 15: {14, 17}
Node 16: {1, 3, 4, 12, 18}
Node 17: {6, 9, 15}
Node 18: {9, 10, 16}
Node 19: {8, 10, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].
