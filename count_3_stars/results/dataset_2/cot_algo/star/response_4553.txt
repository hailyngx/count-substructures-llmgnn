Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 1) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 10) (10, 4) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 9, 11, 7, 12}
- Node 1: {7, 13, 4, 10}
- Node 2: {6, 3, 7, 13, 12}
- Node 3: {9, 11, 13, 2, 8, 4}
- Node 4: {9, 3, 10, 1}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 0}
- Node 6: {5, 14, 2, 13}
- Node 7: {9, 0, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {3, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 3, 7, 0}
- Node 10: {4, 1}
- Node 11: {3, 0, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {11, 0, 2, 8}
- Node 13: {6, 3, 2, 1}
- Node 14: {6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the final answer is [54], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (5, 11, 12)>
- <0, (9, 7, 11)>
- <0, (9, 5, 7)>
- <0, (9, 5, 12)>
- <0, (9, 7, 12)>
- <2, (6, 7, 13)>
- <2, (6, 12, 13)>
- <3, (9, 11, 13)>
- <3, (9, 2, 13)>
- <3, (9, 8, 11)>
- <3, (9, 8, 12)>
- <3, (11, 8, 12)>
- <7, (0, 9, 12)>
- <7, (0, 2, 12)>
- <9, (0, 5, 7)>
- <9, (0, 5, 12)>
