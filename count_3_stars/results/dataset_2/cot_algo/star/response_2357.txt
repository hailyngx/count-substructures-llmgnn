Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up, we get a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 35 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [35], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 1, 9>
<4, 0, 3>
<5, 0, 2>
<8, 0, 1>
<8, 0, 4>
<8, 0, 5>
<8, 1, 4>
<8, 1, 5>
<8, 2, 5>
<8, 4, 5>
<9, 0, 3>
<9, 0, 4>
<9, 0, 5>
<9, 1, 2>
<9, 1, 4>
<9, 1, 8>
<9, 2, 5>
<9, 3, 4>
