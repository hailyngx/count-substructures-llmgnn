Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 12) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 6) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 6) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 10, 12, 6, 9
- Node 1: 14, 10, 4
- Node 2: 8, 12, 9, 10, 7, 11
- Node 3: 6, 5, 12
- Node 4: 1, 13, 6
- Node 5: 3, 14, 13, 12
- Node 6: 3, 0, 13, 11, 7, 4
- Node 7: 2, 8, 10, 11, 6
- Node 8: 2, 7, 7
- Node 9: 2, 0
- Node 10: 1, 2, 0, 12, 7
- Node 11: 2, 14, 7, 6
- Node 12: 3, 2, 0, 14, 5, 10
- Node 13: 5, 4, 6
- Node 14: 1, 11, 12, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 

\[ 4 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 93 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [93]. 

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (10, 12, 6)>
- <0, (10, 12, 9)>
- <0, (10, 6, 9)>
- <1, (10, 4, 14)>
- <2, (7, 10, 11)>
- <2, (7, 10, 12)>
- <2, (7, 11, 12)>
- <2, (10, 11, 12)>
- <6, (11, 7, 6)>
- <6, (11, 13, 6)>
- <6, (11, 7, 4)>
- <6, (13, 4, 6)>
- <7, (10, 2, 11)>
- <12, (5, 10, 12)>
- <12, (5, 12, 14)>
