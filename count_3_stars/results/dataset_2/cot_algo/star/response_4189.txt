Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 17) (9, 16) (26, 9) (26, 19) (26, 29) (26, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 20) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 25) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 23) (1, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 17) (8, 0) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 20) (7, 22) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 24) (12, 14) (12, 19) (6, 26) (6, 28) (6, 25) (28, 6) (28, 23) (19, 26) (19, 12) (19, 17) (19, 24) (19, 27) (2, 4) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 0) (17, 9) (17, 8) (17, 19) (17, 20) (20, 5) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 17) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 29) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 27) (25, 15) (25, 6) (27, 19) (27, 10) (11, 4) (23, 1) (23, 28) (29, 26) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 22) (29, 24) (14, 12) (14, 13) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 18) (24, 12) (24, 19) (24, 29) (22, 7) (22, 29) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 26, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 29 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 69

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [69]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
