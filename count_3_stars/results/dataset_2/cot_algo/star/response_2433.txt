Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 6) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 5) 

Response:
First, we can represent the graph in a more readable format. 

The graph consists of 15 nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

And the edges are:
- Node 0: {11, 8, 2, 13}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 3, 9}
- Node 2: {7, 8, 12, 0}
- Node 3: {1, 6}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 13, 1, 11}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 13, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 11, 9, 5}
- Node 7: {4, 14, 9, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {4, 10, 2, 5, 12, 0}
- Node 9: {7, 1, 6, 14, 12}
- Node 10: {8, 14}
- Node 11: {4, 6, 0}
- Node 12: {9, 8, 5, 2}
- Node 13: {4, 5, 0}
- Node 14: {7, 10, 9, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {7, 8, 13, 1, 11} => [Inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars]
- <4, (7, 8, 13)>
- <4, (7, 1, 11)>
- <4, (8, 13, 11)>
- <4, (7, 8, 1)>
- <4, (13, 1, 11)>
- <4, (7, 13, 11)>
- <4, (7, 8, 11)>
- <4, (1, 8, 11)>
- <4, (1, 13, 11)>
- <4, (1, 7, 11)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
