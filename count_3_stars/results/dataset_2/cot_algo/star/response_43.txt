Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 9) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 19) (4, 12) (18, 14) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (8, 15) (8, 14) (8, 10) (5, 15) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 17) (13, 5) (0, 16) (0, 17) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 10) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 19) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 8) (14, 11) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 9) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 5) (17, 0) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can first construct the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {16, 17}
Node 1 neighbors: {3, 5, 6, 14, 16}
Node 2 neighbors: {6, 9, 11, 15}
Node 3 neighbors: {1, 9}
Node 4 neighbors: {12}
Node 5 neighbors: {1, 13, 15, 17}
Node 6 neighbors: {1, 2, 10}
Node 7 neighbors: {11, 12, 17}
Node 8 neighbors: {10, 14, 15}
Node 9 neighbors: {2, 3, 19}
Node 10 neighbors: {6, 8, 16}
Node 11 neighbors: {2, 7, 14, 19}
Node 12 neighbors: {4, 7, 17, 19}
Node 13 neighbors: {5}
Node 14 neighbors: {1, 8, 11, 18}
Node 15 neighbors: {2, 5, 8}
Node 16 neighbors: {0, 1, 10}
Node 17 neighbors: {0, 5, 7, 12}
Node 18 neighbors: {14}
Node 19 neighbors: {9, 11, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 19

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{13}{3} = 286 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [286].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 5, 16>, <1, 6, 14>, <1, 6, 16>, <1, 14, 16>, <2, 6, 10>, <2, 6, 15>, <2, 6, 11>, <2, 10, 16>, <2, 11, 14>, <2, 11, 19>, <2, 15, 8>, <5, 7, 17>, <5, 8, 15>, <5, 11, 14>, <5, 12, 17>, <6, 7, 17>, <6, 8, 10>, <6, 10, 16>, <7, 11, 19>, <7, 12, 17>, <8, 10, 16>, <11, 12, 17>, <14, 11, 19>, <14, 18, 8>, <15, 8, 14>, <17, 12, 19>
