Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 18) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 11) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 10) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 2) (15, 11) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 0) (16, 7) (16, 17) (18, 5) (18, 13) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 3) (0, 2) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 3) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 15) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

1. Node 0: neighbors {9, 19, 3, 2}
2. Node 1: neighbors {11, 10, 17}
3. Node 2: neighbors {9, 7, 17, 0, 14}
4. Node 3: neighbors {6, 0, 10}
5. Node 4: neighbors {8, 14}
6. Node 5: neighbors {9, 18, 11, 14}
7. Node 6: neighbors {3, 13}
8. Node 7: neighbors {8, 12, 16, 2}
9. Node 8: neighbors {4, 19, 7}
10. Node 9: neighbors {5, 2, 0}
11. Node 10: neighbors {13, 1, 3}
12. Node 11: neighbors {5, 12, 1, 15}
13. Node 12: neighbors {7, 11}
14. Node 13: neighbors {6, 18, 10}
15. Node 14: neighbors {5, 4, 19, 2}
16. Node 15: neighbor {11}
17. Node 16: neighbors {7, 17}
18. Node 17: neighbors {1, 16, 2}
19. Node 19: neighbors {8, 14, 0}

Now, let's calculate how many 3-stars can be formed with each node:

1. Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
2. Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
3. Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
4. Node 3: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
5. Node 4: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
6. Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
7. Node 6: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
8. Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
9. Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
10. Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
11. Node 10: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
12. Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
13. Node 12: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
14. Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
15. Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
16. Node 15: [inom{1}{3}] = 0
17. Node 16: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
18. Node 17: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
19. Node 18: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
20. Node 19: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Total number of unique 3-stars: [30]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 14, 19)>
<1, (10, 11, 17)>
<2, (0, 7, 14)>
<2, (0, 14, 19)>
<2, (7, 14, 17)>
<2, (14, 17, 19)>
<5, (11, 14, 18)>
<5, (14, 18, 19)>
<7, (8, 14, 19)>
