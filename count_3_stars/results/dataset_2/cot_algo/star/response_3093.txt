Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 11) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 12) (1, 17) (1, 8) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 18) (0, 11) (0, 6) (7, 15) (8, 1) (8, 12) (9, 18) (9, 14) (16, 5) (16, 10) (12, 15) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 10) (18, 17) (18, 9) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 19) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 5) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 13) (5, 17) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 10) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list format:

1: 17, 8  
2: 3, 4, 13  
3: 2, 6, 11, 15, 19  
4: 2, 5, 13  
5: 4, 5, 10, 16, 17  
6: 0, 3, 6, 17, 19  
7: 15  
8: 1, 11, 12  
9: 14, 18  
10: 5, 10, 12, 14, 16  
11: 0, 3, 11, 12, 15  
12: 8, 10, 11, 12, 15  
13: 2, 4, 13, 19  
14: 9, 10, 14  
15: 3, 7, 11, 12, 15  
16: 5, 10, 16  
17: 1, 5, 6, 17, 18  
18: 9, 17, 18  
19: 3, 6, 13, 19

Next, let's identify the number of neighbors for each node:  
1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 5, 4: 3, 5: 5, 6: 5, 7: 1, 8: 3, 9: 2, 10: 5, 11: 5, 12: 5, 13: 4, 14: 3, 15: 5, 16: 3, 17: 5, 18: 3, 19: 4  

Now, we'll go through each node that has three or more neighbors to count the 3-stars formed with that node:

For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60

Therefore, there are 60 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<3, 11, 15>, <3, 11, 19>, <3, 15, 19>, <5, 10, 16>, <5, 10, 14>, <5, 10, 12>, <5, 10, 12>, <5, 10, 14>, <6, 3, 17>, <6, 3, 19>, <6, 19, 13>, <6, 19, 3>, <6, 17, 18>, <11, 0, 6>, <11, 12, 8>, <11, 15, 7>, <11, 15, 12>, <12, 8, 1>, <12, 10, 5>, <12, 11, 0>, <12, 11, 8>, <12, 15, 7>, <17, 5, 4>, <17, 5, 16>, <17, 6, 0>, <17, 6, 3> 

Therefore, the final answer is [60].
