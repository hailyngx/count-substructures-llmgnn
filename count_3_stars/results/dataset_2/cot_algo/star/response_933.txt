Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 7, 8, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 1: 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 4: 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 5: 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 6: 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 7: 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 8: 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 9: 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = [4]

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 50 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>
