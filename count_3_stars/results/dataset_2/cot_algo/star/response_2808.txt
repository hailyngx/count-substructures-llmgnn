Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 8, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {9, 8, 2, 0}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 8, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 8, 1, 7}
- Node 6: {7, 1, 2}
- Node 7: {5, 4, 0, 6}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 4, 2, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 4, 3}

Now, let's identify any 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 7, and 9. <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 9, and 4. <8, (2, 9, 4)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 5, and 3. <9, (4, 5, 3)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
