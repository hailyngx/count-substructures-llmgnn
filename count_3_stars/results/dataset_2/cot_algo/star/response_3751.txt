Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6, 2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 9, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbor {2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 8}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least three neighbors:

- Node 0: No 3-stars formed.
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: No 3-stars formed.
- Node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 4: No 3-stars formed.
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 8: No 3-stars formed.
- Node 9: No 3-stars formed.

Adding up the number of 3-stars from each node, we have a total of 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 60 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [60], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, 2, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 6, 9>
<1, 5, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 6, 8>
<3, 5, 6, 8>
