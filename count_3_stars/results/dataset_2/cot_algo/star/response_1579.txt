Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 10) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 12) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 1) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 4) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 4) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 14) 

Response:
We first find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {6, 5, 2, 10, 12}
Node 1: {11, 12, 4}
Node 2: {6, 0}
Node 3: {9, 8, 11, 13, 14}
Node 4: {9, 11, 13, 1, 14}
Node 5: {6, 13, 12, 0, 7}
Node 6: {9, 5, 10, 2, 11, 0}
Node 7: {9, 5}
Node 8: {10, 3}
Node 9: {6, 4, 3, 7}
Node 10: {6, 8, 0, 14}
Node 11: {6, 3, 1, 12, 4}
Node 12: {5, 0, 11, 1}
Node 13: {5, 3, 4, 14}
Node 14: {3, 13, 10, 4}

Now, we identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

We calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 70\).

Therefore, the final answer is [70]. Inside <> to represent the unique 3-stars:

<0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 12>, <0, 6, 10>, <0, 6, 12>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 6, 12>,  
<3, 11, 6>, <3, 11, 14>, <3, 13, 14>, <3, 13, 4>, <3, 13, 5>,  
<4, 11, 6>, <4, 11, 13>, <4, 13, 5>, <4, 13, 14>, <4, 13, 11>,  
<5, 12, 11>, <5, 12, 0>, <5, 13, 4>, <5, 13, 3>, <5, 13, 14>.
