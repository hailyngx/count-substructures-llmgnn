Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (16, 22) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 19) (15, 22) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 25) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 28) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 29) (13, 9) (13, 27) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 20) (0, 12) (0, 6) (20, 0) (20, 2) (20, 28) (28, 7) (28, 20) (28, 18) (29, 13) (29, 1) (29, 21) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 22) (24, 22) (26, 2) (27, 4) (27, 13) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 17) (9, 25) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 26) (22, 16) (22, 15) (22, 17) (22, 24) (21, 29) (21, 14) (14, 11) (14, 21) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 25) (5, 12) (5, 25) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 6) (6, 0) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 23) (6, 1) (25, 4) (25, 9) (25, 14) (25, 5) (25, 12) (1, 8) (1, 29) (1, 6) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 25) (12, 18) (12, 23) (18, 28) (18, 14) (18, 12) (23, 14) (23, 6) (23, 12) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {3, 4, 6, 12, 19, 20}
Node 1 neighbors: {6, 8, 29}
Node 2 neighbors: {15, 20, 26}
Node 3 neighbors: {0, 4, 7, 19}
Node 4 neighbors: {0, 3, 7, 13, 19, 25}
Node 5 neighbors: {12, 25}
Node 6 neighbors: {0, 1, 17, 19, 23}
Node 7 neighbors: {3, 4, 28}
Node 8 neighbors: {1, 9, 13}
Node 9 neighbors: {8, 13, 17, 25}
Node 12 neighbors: {0, 5, 6, 18, 23, 25}
Node 13 neighbors: {4, 8, 9, 27, 29}
Node 14 neighbors: {11, 18, 21, 23, 25}
Node 15 neighbors: {2, 22}
Node 16 neighbors: {22}
Node 17 neighbors: {6, 9, 22}
Node 18 neighbors: {12, 14, 28}
Node 19 neighbors: {0, 3, 4, 6}
Node 20 neighbors: {0, 2, 28}
Node 21 neighbors: {14, 29}
Node 22 neighbors: {15, 16, 17, 24}
Node 23 neighbors: {6, 12, 14}
Node 24 neighbors: {22}
Node 25 neighbors: {4, 5, 9, 12, 14}
Node 26 neighbors: {2}
Node 27 neighbors: {4, 13}
Node 28 neighbors: {7, 18, 20}
Node 29 neighbors: {1, 13, 21}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 99

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [99].
