Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 26) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 22) (15, 24) (2, 29) (2, 1) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 14) (29, 24) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 8) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 26) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 6) (26, 3) (26, 8) (26, 18) (1, 2) (1, 7) (21, 3) (21, 10) (21, 16) (5, 24) (5, 20) (19, 22) (19, 25) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 27) (12, 25) (12, 6) (16, 13) (16, 21) (16, 0) (16, 22) (22, 15) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 27) (22, 20) (0, 15) (0, 16) (0, 23) (11, 13) (7, 1) (27, 9) (27, 22) (27, 6) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 27) (6, 25) (24, 15) (24, 29) (24, 5) (14, 29) (14, 9) (14, 18) (14, 23) (18, 3) (18, 26) (18, 14) (25, 19) (25, 12) (25, 6) (25, 28) (28, 2) (28, 25) (28, 20) (23, 10) (23, 0) (23, 14) (20, 5) (20, 22) (20, 28) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {15, 16, 23}
- Node 1: {2, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 28, 29}
- Node 3: {15, 18, 21, 26}
- Node 4: {8, 17}
- Node 5: {20, 24}
- Node 6: {12, 13, 25, 27}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {4, 10, 26}
- Node 9: {14, 17, 27}
- Node 10: {8, 17, 21, 23}
- Node 11: {13}
- Node 12: {6, 25}
- Node 13: {6, 11, 16}
- Node 14: {9, 18, 23, 29}
- Node 15: {0, 3, 22, 24}
- Node 16: {0, 13, 21, 22}
- Node 17: {4, 9, 10}
- Node 18: {3, 14, 26}
- Node 19: {22, 25}
- Node 20: {5, 22, 28}
- Node 21: {3, 10, 16}
- Node 22: {15, 16, 19, 20, 27}
- Node 23: {0, 10, 14}
- Node 24: {5, 15, 29}
- Node 25: {12, 19, 25, 28}
- Node 26: {3, 8, 18}
- Node 27: {6, 9, 22}
- Node 28: {2, 20, 25}
- Node 29: {2, 14, 24}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {15, 21, 26}: <3, (15, 21, 26)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with neighbors {22, 24, 3}: <15, (22, 24, 3)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 21, 22}: <16, (0, 21, 22)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with neighbors {15, 20, 27}: <22, (15, 20, 27)>

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [4].
