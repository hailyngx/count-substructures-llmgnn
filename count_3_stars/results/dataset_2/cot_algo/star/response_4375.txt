Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 4) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 16) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 18) (7, 1) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 13) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 6) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 5) (8, 15) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 8) (19, 2) (19, 16) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 17) (16, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 17) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 2) (5, 15) (5, 14) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 17) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {14, 16, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 16, 17, 19}
- Node 3: {4, 9, 15}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 6, 18}
- Node 5: {14, 15}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 17}
- Node 7: {1, 13}
- Node 8: {9, 15}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 10: {11, 12}
- Node 11: {10, 18}
- Node 12: {10, 13}
- Node 13: {7, 12, 15}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 15: {3, 5, 8, 13, 16}
- Node 16: {0, 2, 15, 17, 19}
- Node 17: {2, 6, 16}
- Node 18: {4, 11}
- Node 19: {2, 16}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 26

Therefore, the final answer is [26].
