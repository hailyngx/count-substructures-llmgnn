Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 9) (25, 20) (25, 17) (25, 23) (25, 18) (8, 13) (8, 27) (13, 8) (13, 23) (15, 2) (15, 24) (6, 28) (6, 2) (6, 27) (6, 19) (28, 6) (28, 21) (17, 25) (17, 29) (17, 11) (17, 26) (29, 17) (29, 5) (29, 22) (0, 9) (0, 21) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 5) (21, 28) (21, 0) (21, 10) (21, 22) (10, 21) (10, 2) (10, 9) (16, 22) (16, 3) (16, 26) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 23) (12, 2) (12, 1) (26, 20) (26, 17) (26, 16) (3, 16) (3, 18) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 24) (1, 7) (11, 17) (11, 9) (5, 29) (5, 14) (5, 23) (23, 25) (23, 13) (23, 2) (23, 5) (23, 7) (7, 20) (7, 1) (7, 23) (24, 15) (24, 1) (24, 19) (9, 20) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) (4, 19) (19, 6) (19, 24) (19, 4) (18, 25) (18, 14) (18, 3) (22, 29) (22, 21) (22, 16) (27, 8) (27, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: {9, 21}
Node 1: {7, 12, 14, 24}
Node 2: {6, 10, 12, 15, 23}
Node 3: {16, 18}
Node 4: {19}
Node 5: {14, 23, 29}
Node 6: {2, 19, 27, 28}
Node 7: {1, 20, 23}
Node 8: {13, 27}
Node 9: {0, 10, 11, 20}
Node 10: {2, 9, 21}
Node 11: {9, 17}
Node 12: {1, 2}
Node 13: {8, 23}
Node 14: {1, 5, 18}
Node 15: {2, 24}
Node 16: {3, 22, 26}
Node 17: {11, 17, 25, 29}
Node 18: {3, 14, 25}
Node 19: {4, 6, 24}
Node 20: {7, 9, 25, 26}
Node 21: {0, 10, 22, 28}
Node 22: {16, 21, 29}
Node 23: {2, 5, 7, 13, 23}
Node 24: {1, 15, 19}
Node 25: {17, 18, 20}
Node 26: {16, 20, 26}
Node 27: {6, 8}
Node 28: {6, 21}
Node 29: {5, 17, 22}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 17, 23
Number of 3-stars for each node: 9C3 + 4C3 + 5C3 + 3C3 + 4C3 + 3C3 + 4C3 + 3C3 + 4C3 + 10C3 = 84

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [84]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (9, 21, 10)>
<1, (7, 12, 14)>
<2, (6, 10, 12)>
<5, (14, 23, 29)>
<6, (2, 19, 27)>
<7, (1, 20, 23)>
<9, (0, 10, 21)>
<10, (2, 9, 21)>
<17, (11, 25, 29)>
<23, (7, 13, 23)>
