Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 10) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 18) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 19) (2, 13) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 17) (8, 0) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (18, 1) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 14) (15, 7) (15, 19) (19, 9) (19, 12) (19, 15) (11, 18) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 16) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 2) (16, 5) (16, 10) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 18) (17, 12) (17, 8) 

Response:
Given the edge list provided, we can construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 8, 18}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 13, 18}
- Node 2: {6, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 14, 18}
- Node 5: {3, 10, 14, 16}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 14}
- Node 7: {8, 12, 13, 15}
- Node 8: {0, 7, 17}
- Node 9: {10, 19}
- Node 10: {5, 9, 16}
- Node 11: {18}
- Node 12: {7, 14, 17, 19}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 6, 12}
- Node 15: {7, 19}
- Node 16: {5, 10}
- Node 17: {8, 12}
- Node 18: {0, 1, 4, 11}
- Node 19: {9, 12, 15}

Now, we can identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3, 5, 7, 13, and 14 have 4 neighbors each, so 5 * inom{4}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 0, 6, 8, 10, and 12 have 3 neighbors each, so 5 * 1 = 5 3-stars

Adding the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 5 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (3, 6, 13)>
<3, (1, 5, 13)>
<5, (3, 10, 16)>
<7, (12, 15, 19)>
<13, (1, 2, 7)>
