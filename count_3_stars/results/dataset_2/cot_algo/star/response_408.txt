Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 9) (21, 7) (21, 28) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 23) (22, 14) (22, 6) (22, 8) (23, 7) (23, 11) (23, 0) (0, 23) (0, 14) (0, 15) (20, 6) (20, 10) (20, 16) (14, 22) (14, 0) (14, 15) (14, 5) (17, 1) (17, 29) (17, 4) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 25) (28, 21) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 2) (5, 1) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 8) (13, 5) (13, 25) (8, 22) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 28) (9, 8) (11, 23) (11, 26) (11, 2) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 28) (2, 11) (2, 12) (6, 22) (6, 20) (6, 24) (24, 7) (24, 6) (24, 18) (24, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 26) (15, 18) (26, 11) (26, 15) (26, 27) (3, 4) (3, 18) (27, 29) (27, 26) (27, 19) (25, 29) (25, 13) (25, 16) (16, 1) (16, 20) (16, 25) (18, 24) (18, 15) (18, 3) (10, 20) (10, 24) (19, 28) (19, 27) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be found by first determining the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {14, 15, 23}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 16, 17}
- Node 2: {11, 12, 28}
- Node 3: {4, 18}
- Node 4: {3, 12, 17}
- Node 5: {1, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {20, 22, 24}
- Node 7: {21, 23, 24}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 22}
- Node 9: {1, 8, 28}
- Node 10: {20, 24}
- Node 11: {2, 23, 26}
- Node 12: {2, 4}
- Node 13: {5, 25}
- Node 14: {0, 5, 15, 22}
- Node 15: {0, 14, 18, 26}
- Node 16: {1, 20, 25}
- Node 17: {1, 4, 29}
- Node 18: {3, 15, 24}
- Node 19: {27, 28}
- Node 20: {6, 10, 16}
- Node 21: {7, 28}
- Node 22: {6, 8, 14}
- Node 23: {7, 11, 0}
- Node 24: {6, 7, 10, 18}
- Node 25: {13, 16, 29}
- Node 26: {11, 15, 27}
- Node 27: {19, 26, 29}
- Node 28: {2, 9, 19, 21}
- Node 29: {17, 25, 27}

On inspecting the neighbor sets, we find that the following nodes have 3 or more neighbors, which can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 14, 15, 23>, 
<1, 5, 9, 16>, 
<5, 8, 13, 14>, 
<10, 18, 24, 6>, 
<14, 15, 18, 26>, 
<16, 1, 20, 25>, 
<17, 1, 4, 29>, 
<22, 8, 14, 6>, 
<24, 10, 18, 6>, 
<28, 9, 21, 19>.
