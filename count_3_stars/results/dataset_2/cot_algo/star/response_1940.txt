Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 11) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 11) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {3, 10, 11, 12}

Node 1: {2, 8, 9, 11, 13}

Node 2: {1, 3, 9, 11, 13}

Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 8, 10}

Node 4: {3, 6, 14}

Node 5: {7, 14}

Node 6: {4, 9, 10, 11}

Node 7: {5, 9, 13, 14}

Node 8: {1, 3, 8, 14}

Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 7}

Node 10: {0, 3, 6, 12}

Node 11: {0, 1, 2, 6}

Node 12: {0, 10, 14}

Node 13: {1, 2, 7}

Node 14: {4, 5, 7, 8, 12}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node:

For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 4: No 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors
For Node 5: No 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors
For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 10: No 3-star as it only has 3 neighbors
For Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 12: No 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors
For Node 13: No 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors
For Node 14: No 3-star as it only has 4 neighbors

Adding up all the 3-stars formed: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 10, 11, 12>, <1, 2, 8, 13>, <1, 6, 7, 9>, <1, 6, 9, 11>, <2, 3, 8, 13>, <2, 6, 9, 11>, <3, 8, 10, 11>, <6, 9, 10, 11>
