The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 12) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 11) (27, 9) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 25) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 6) (15, 24) (15, 16) (20, 9) (20, 4) (20, 6) (2, 14) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (26, 18) (26, 22) (26, 10) (9, 27) (9, 22) (9, 20) (5, 13) (5, 24) (5, 28) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 29) (13, 3) (7, 25) (7, 23) (7, 17) (25, 18) (25, 7) (10, 26) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 27) (11, 23) (23, 18) (23, 7) (23, 11) (23, 12) (4, 20) (4, 3) (4, 17) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 23) (12, 3) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 14) (6, 22) (6, 20) (6, 24) (24, 15) (24, 5) (24, 6) (17, 13) (17, 7) (17, 4) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 29) (21, 27) (21, 13) (21, 19) (19, 21) (19, 29) (19, 28) (29, 13) (29, 16) (29, 19) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (14, 1) (28, 5) (28, 19) 

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Create a list of neighbors for each node.
2. Identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors.
3. Count the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors.
4. Sum up the total number of 3-stars.

Let's start by creating a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 27, 12
Node 1: 8, 16, 14
Node 2: 14
Node 3: 8, 10, 4, 12, 13
Node 4: 20, 3, 17
Node 5: 13, 24, 28
Node 6: 22, 20, 24
Node 7: 25, 23, 17
Node 8: 12, 3, 1
Node 9: 27, 22, 20
Node 10: 26, 3, 14
Node 11: 27, 23
Node 12: 0, 8, 23, 3
Node 13: 5, 17, 21, 29, 3
Node 14: 2, 10, 1
Node 15: 24, 16
Node 16: 15, 1, 29
Node 17: 13, 7, 4
Node 18: 26, 23, 25
Node 19: 21, 29, 28
Node 20: 9, 4, 6
Node 21: 27, 13, 19
Node 22: 26, 9, 6
Node 23: 18, 7, 11, 12
Node 24: 15, 5, 6
Node 25: 18, 7
Node 26: 18, 22, 10
Node 27: 0, 21, 11, 9
Node 28: 5, 19
Node 29: 13, 16, 19

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 12, Node 13, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19, Node 20, Node 21, Node 22, Node 23, Node 24, Node 26, Node 27, Node 29

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars with the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node:

For the identified nodes:
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 40 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (8, 13, 4)>, <3, (13, 17, 21)>, <12, (0, 8, 23)>, <13, (5, 29, 16)>, <13, (5, 29, 19)>, <18, (26, 22, 10)>, <23, (18, 7, 11)>, <27, (21, 13, 19)>.
