Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 12) (1, 5) (1, 12) (17, 3) (17, 19) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 16) (18, 11) (18, 0) (18, 12) (19, 17) (19, 0) (7, 16) (7, 10) (16, 5) (16, 7) (16, 12) (11, 18) (11, 4) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 15) (12, 2) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 16) (12, 10) (6, 10) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 3) (3, 8) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 4) (9, 10) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 14) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 9) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {18, 19, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors {8, 5, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {8, 17, 14, 0, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {11, 14, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {13, 2, 1, 15, 16}
- Node 6: Neighbor {10}
- Node 7: Neighbors {16, 10}
- Node 8: Neighbors {13, 2, 14, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbor {10}
- Node 10: Neighbors {7, 12, 6, 9}
- Node 11: Neighbors {18, 4}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 1, 18, 16, 10}
- Node 13: Neighbors {8, 5, 15}
- Node 14: Neighbors {8, 3, 4, 15}
- Node 15: Neighbors {13, 5, 14}
- Node 16: Neighbors {5, 7, 12}
- Node 17: Neighbors {3, 19}
- Node 18: Neighbors {11, 0, 12}
- Node 19: Neighbors {17, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 5, Node 10, and Node 12 each have 5 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 35

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 18, 19>
- <3, 17, 0>
- <3, 17, 4>
- <3, 0, 4>
- <3, 4, 14>
- <5, 1, 12>
- <5, 1, 15>
- <5, 2, 12>
- <5, 2, 15>
- <5, 13, 15>
- <7, 10, 12>
- <7, 10, 16>
- <10, 6, 9>
- <12, 2, 16>
- <12, 10, 16>
- <12, 16, 5>
- <12, 16, 10>
- <14, 4, 15>
- <14, 8, 13>
- <14, 8, 3>
- <14, 8, 5>
