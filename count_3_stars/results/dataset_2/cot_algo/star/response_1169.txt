Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 15) (8, 17) (8, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 6) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 9) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 14) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 1) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 12) (19, 0) (19, 12) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 16) (16, 5) (16, 0) (16, 7) (7, 16) (3, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 14) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 15) (12, 19) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {8, 19, 16}
- Node 1: {14, 15, 17}
- Node 2: {6, 10, 15}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {3, 9, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 13, 16, 17}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 12, 18}
- Node 7: {16}
- Node 8: {0, 17}
- Node 9: {4, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 11, 18}
- Node 11: {9, 10, 12, 18}
- Node 12: {6, 11, 13, 15, 19}
- Node 13: {5, 9, 12, 17}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 15: {1, 2, 12}
- Node 16: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 17: {1, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 18: {6, 10, 11}
- Node 19: {0, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19

For each of these nodes, let's calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) where n is the number of neighbors for that node:

- Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Node 1: 0 3-stars
- Node 2: 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 0 3-stars
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 0 3-stars
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 0 3-stars
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 4 3-stars
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 0 3-stars
- Node 15: 0 3-stars
- Node 16: 0 3-stars
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 0 3-stars
- Node 19: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<5, (6, 13, 17)>, <6, (5, 12, 18)>, <9, (4, 11, 13)>, <11, (9, 12, 18)>, <12, (6, 13, 15, 19)>, <13, (5, 9, 17)>, <17, (1, 5, 8, 13)>, <19, (0, 12)>
