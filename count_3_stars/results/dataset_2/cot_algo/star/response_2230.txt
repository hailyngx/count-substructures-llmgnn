Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 14) (26, 22) (26, 3) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 1) (22, 26) (22, 18) (22, 21) (10, 20) (17, 3) (17, 24) (29, 20) (29, 13) (29, 8) (29, 23) (0, 4) (0, 23) (14, 9) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 25) (4, 2) (7, 16) (7, 23) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 29) (8, 7) (8, 25) (20, 10) (20, 29) (20, 27) (20, 28) (19, 15) (19, 6) (1, 18) (1, 6) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 11) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 24) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 21) (12, 15) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 27) (11, 6) (11, 13) (24, 17) (24, 2) (24, 3) (24, 5) (5, 2) (5, 24) (5, 28) (3, 26) (3, 17) (3, 24) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 23) (15, 28) (25, 4) (25, 8) (23, 29) (23, 0) (23, 7) (23, 15) (23, 28) (21, 22) (21, 12) (13, 29) (13, 16) (13, 11) (27, 20) (27, 16) (28, 20) (28, 5) (28, 15) (28, 23) 

Response:
There are 30 nodes and 90 edges. We will calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph.

First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {4, 23}
- Node 1: {6, 18}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 7, 12, 24}
- Node 3: {17, 24, 26}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 16, 18, 25}
- Node 5: {2, 24, 28}
- Node 6: {1, 11, 19}
- Node 7: {2, 8, 16, 23}
- Node 8: {7, 25, 29}
- Node 9: {14}
- Node 10: {20}
- Node 11: {6, 13}
- Node 12: {2, 15, 16, 21}
- Node 13: {11, 16, 29}
- Node 14: {9}
- Node 15: {12, 15, 19, 23, 28}
- Node 16: {4, 7, 12, 13, 27}
- Node 17: {3, 24}
- Node 18: {1, 4, 22}
- Node 19: {6, 15}
- Node 20: {10, 27, 28, 29}
- Node 21: {12, 22}
- Node 22: {18, 21, 26}
- Node 23: {0, 7, 15, 28, 29}
- Node 24: {2, 3, 5, 17}
- Node 25: {4, 8}
- Node 26: {3, 22}
- Node 27: {16, 20}
- Node 28: {5, 15, 20, 23}
- Node 29: {8, 13, 20, 23}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms 10 3-stars: <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 24>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 12>, <2, 7, 24>, <2, 7, 5>, <2, 7, 12>, <2, 7, 16>, <2, 12, 15>, <2, 24, 5>
- Node 4 forms 5 3-stars: <4, 16, 25>, <4, 16, 13>, <4, 16, 7>, <4, 16, 2>, <4, 16, 27>
- Node 7 forms 3 3-stars: <7, 16, 8>, <7, 16, 23>, <7, 16, 2>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, 25, 29>
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star: <12, 15, 21>
- Node 15 forms 2 3-stars: <15, 19, 28>, <15, 23, 28>
- Node 16 forms 2 3-stars: <16, 13, 29>, <16, 27, 20>
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star: <20, 28, 29>
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star: <22, 18, 21>
- Node 23 forms 2 3-stars: <23, 29, 8>, <23, 29, 28>
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star: <24, 17, 3>

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 5 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].
