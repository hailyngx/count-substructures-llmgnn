Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 9) (14, 4) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 2) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 12) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 15) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 7) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 19) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 10) (5, 4) (8, 17) (8, 10) (6, 2) (7, 18) (7, 13) (7, 15) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 7) (9, 14) (9, 16) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 19) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 19) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 18, 19}
- Node 1: {11, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 13, 14, 18}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {13, 15, 18}
- Node 8: {10, 17}
- Node 9: {14, 16}
- Node 10: {2, 8, 19}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 15}
- Node 12: {1, 16, 18}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 7, 17}
- Node 14: {4, 9}
- Node 15: {7, 11, 18}
- Node 16: {9, 12, 17, 19}
- Node 17: {8, 13, 16, 19}
- Node 18: {0, 4, 7, 12, 15}
- Node 19: {0, 10, 16, 17}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get:
1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 4, 18> <0, 4, 19> <0, 18, 19> <1, 11, 12> <2, 3, 6> <2, 3, 10> <2, 6, 10> <4, 5, 14> <7, 13, 15> <10, 16, 19> <12, 16, 17> <13, 4, 7>
