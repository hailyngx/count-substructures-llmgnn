Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 20) (16, 29) (16, 22) (16, 15) (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 21) (26, 9) (26, 14) (26, 10) (26, 29) (14, 26) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 28) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 22) (8, 20) (8, 1) (8, 18) (13, 25) (13, 1) (10, 26) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 12) (2, 12) (18, 8) (18, 20) (6, 21) (6, 23) (21, 9) (21, 6) (29, 16) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 19) (19, 29) (19, 15) (19, 25) (23, 6) (23, 4) (23, 25) (23, 0) (25, 13) (25, 19) (25, 23) (27, 5) (0, 10) (0, 23) (0, 3) (12, 10) (12, 2) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 5) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 20) (7, 14) (7, 24) (7, 28) (7, 1) (20, 11) (20, 8) (20, 18) (20, 3) (24, 7) (24, 28) (24, 5) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (4, 23) (4, 28) (22, 16) (22, 17) (22, 28) (28, 14) (28, 7) (28, 24) (28, 4) (28, 22) (5, 27) (5, 15) (5, 24) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {10, 23, 3}
- Node 1: {13, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 2: {12}
- Node 3: {0, 17, 20}
- Node 4: {23, 28}
- Node 5: {15, 24, 27}
- Node 6: {21, 23}
- Node 7: {1, 14, 24, 28}
- Node 8: {1, 18, 20}
- Node 9: {21, 26, 29}
- Node 10: {0, 12, 17, 26}
- Node 11: {20}
- Node 12: {2, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 25}
- Node 14: {1, 7, 17, 28, 26}
- Node 15: {5, 16, 19}
- Node 16: {15, 22, 29}
- Node 17: {3, 10, 14, 22}
- Node 18: {8, 20}
- Node 19: {15, 25, 29}
- Node 20: {3, 8, 18, 11}
- Node 21: {6, 9}
- Node 22: {16, 17, 28}
- Node 23: {0, 4, 6, 25}
- Node 24: {5, 7, 28}
- Node 25: {13, 19, 23}
- Node 26: {10, 14, 29, 9}
- Node 27: {5}
- Node 28: {4, 7, 14, 24, 22}
- Node 29: {9, 16, 19, 26}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (7, 14, 28)>
- <14, (1, 7, 28)>
- <15, (5, 16, 19)>
- <16, (15, 22, 29)>
- <17, (3, 10, 22)>
- <23, (0, 4, 25)>
- <26, (9, 14, 29)>
- <28, (4, 7, 22)>
