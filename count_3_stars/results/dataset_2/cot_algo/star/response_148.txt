Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 2) (18, 27) (18, 28) (18, 8) (22, 16) (22, 29) (22, 12) (8, 18) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 7) (23, 24) (23, 28) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 27) (14, 25) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 6) (26, 13) (28, 18) (28, 23) (3, 21) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 24) (17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 24) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 9) (12, 22) (12, 16) (12, 25) (16, 22) (16, 12) (16, 29) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 9) (9, 11) (9, 19) (9, 25) (9, 20) (9, 27) (25, 14) (25, 12) (25, 9) (25, 4) (7, 8) (7, 24) (20, 9) (20, 4) (20, 10) (24, 23) (24, 15) (24, 17) (24, 7) (6, 0) (6, 13) (6, 29) (6, 2) (6, 4) (29, 22) (29, 16) (29, 6) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 9) (10, 20) (10, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 21) (2, 6) (2, 10) (4, 25) (4, 20) (4, 6) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 8, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 24, 27, 29.

Now, for each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 1: There is only 1 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 21, 15 as leaves. <1, (21, 15)>

- Node 8: There are 4 neighbors for node 8. So,  \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed. <8, (18, 15, 11)>, <8, (18, 15, 7)>, <8, (15, 11, 14)>, <8, (15, 11, 7)>

- Node 13: There are 3 neighbors for node 13. So,  \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star is formed.  <13, (26, 17, 6)>

- Node 15: There are 4 neighbors for node 15. So,  \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed. <15, (1, 8, 19)>, <15, (8, 19, 24)>, <15, (8, 19, 14)>, <15, (19, 24, 17)>

- Node 16: There are 3 neighbors for node 16. So,  \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star is formed. <16, (22, 12, 29)>

- Node 17: There are 3 neighbors for node 17. So,  \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star is formed.  <17, (0, 13, 24)>

- Node 18: There are 3 neighbors for node 18. So,  \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star is formed.  <18, (27, 28, 8)>

- Node 19: There are 3 neighbors for node 19. So,  \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star is formed.  <19, (3, 15, 9)>

- Node 21: There is only 1 3-star with node 21 as the center and nodes 1, 3 as leaves. <21, (1, 3)>

- Node 24: There are 4 neighbors for node 24. So,  \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed. <24, (23, 17, 7)>, <24, (23, 15, 7)>, <24, (17, 7, 6)>, <24, (15, 17, 7)>

- Node 27: There are 3 neighbors for node 27. So,  \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star is formed.  <27, (18, 14, 9)>

- Node 29: There are 3 neighbors for node 29.  So,  \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star is formed.  <29, (22, 6, 16)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 20 3-stars.
So, the final answer is [20].
