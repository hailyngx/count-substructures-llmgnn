Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 16) (17, 18) (17, 4) (3, 7) (11, 15) (0, 18) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 6) (13, 16) (13, 2) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 14) (19, 15) (19, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 16) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 15) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 16) (16, 10) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 1) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 12) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 18)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (nodes 7, 9, 16)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (nodes 5, 12, 13)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (nodes 7, 18)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (nodes 6, 9, 15, 17)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (nodes 2, 8)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (nodes 4, 9, 10, 13, 14)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 8)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (nodes 5, 7, 14)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 4, 6, 12)
- Node 10: 3 neighbors (nodes 6, 15, 16)
- Node 11: 1 neighbor (node 15)
- Node 12: 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 9, 18, 19)
- Node 13: 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 6, 16)
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (nodes 6, 8, 16)
- Node 15: 5 neighbors (nodes 4, 10, 11, 18, 19)
- Node 16: 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 10, 13, 14)
- Node 17: 2 neighbors (nodes 4, 18)
- Node 18: 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 12, 15, 17)
- Node 19: 2 neighbors (nodes 12, 15)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2 has inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <4, (6, 9, 15)>, <4, (6, 15, 17)>, <4, (9, 15, 17)>, <4, (6, 9, 17)>
- Node 6 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <6, (4, 9, 10)>, <6, (4, 9, 13)>, <6, (4, 9, 14)>, <6, (4, 10, 13)>, <6, (4, 10, 14)>, <6, (4, 13, 14)>, <6, (9, 10, 13)>, <6, (9, 10, 14)>, <6, (9, 13, 14)>, <6, (10, 13, 14)>
- Node 9 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 12)>, <9, (4, 6, 12)>, <9, (1, 4, 12)>
- Node 12 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <12, (2, 18, 19)>, <12, (9, 18, 19)>, <12, (12, 18, 19)>, <12, (2, 12, 19)>
- Node 15 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <15, (4, 18, 19)>, <15, (10, 18, 19)>, <15, (11, 18, 19)>, <15, (4, 11, 19)>, <15, (4, 15, 18)>, <15, (4, 16, 18)>, <15, (4, 16, 19)>, <15, (10, 15, 18)>, <15, (10, 16, 18)>, <15, (15, 16, 18)>
- Node 16 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <16, (1, 10, 13)>, <16, (1, 10, 14)>, <16, (1, 13, 14)>, <16, (6, 13, 14)>
- Node 18 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <18, (0, 12, 17)>, <18, (0, 15, 17)>, <18, (0, 12, 15)>, <18, (12, 15, 17)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].
