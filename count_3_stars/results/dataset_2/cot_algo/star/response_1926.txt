Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 27) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 24) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 24) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 29) (13, 26) (13, 20) (13, 14) (26, 18) (26, 13) (26, 15) (26, 25) (26, 16) (6, 19) (21, 0) (21, 25) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 21) (25, 1) (16, 26) (28, 8) (28, 17) (28, 20) (27, 4) (27, 3) (27, 23) (0, 21) (0, 5) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 20) (19, 6) (19, 5) (19, 10) (2, 1) (2, 11) (8, 28) (8, 10) (8, 1) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 1) (17, 28) (17, 23) (17, 22) (3, 27) (3, 9) (3, 29) (1, 25) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 11) (15, 26) (15, 23) (15, 9) (14, 13) (14, 22) (14, 9) (22, 17) (22, 14) (20, 12) (20, 13) (20, 28) (20, 5) (23, 27) (23, 17) (23, 15) (23, 29) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 14) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 10) (10, 19) (10, 8) (10, 24) (29, 18) (29, 3) (29, 23) 

Response:
First, we need to find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {21, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 8, 11, 25}
- Node 2: {1, 11}
- Node 3: {27, 9, 29}
- Node 4: {7, 18, 27}
- Node 5: {0, 19, 20}
- Node 6: {19}
- Node 7: {4, 12, 24, 25, 11}
- Node 8: {28, 10, 1}
- Node 9: {3, 15, 14}
- Node 10: {19, 8, 24}
- Node 11: {7, 1, 2}
- Node 12: {7, 24, 20}
- Node 13: {26, 20, 14}
- Node 14: {13, 22, 9}
- Node 15: {26, 23, 9}
- Node 16: {26}
- Node 17: {28, 23, 22}
- Node 18: {4, 26, 29}
- Node 19: {6, 5, 10}
- Node 20: {12, 13, 28, 5}
- Node 21: {0, 25}
- Node 22: {17, 14}
- Node 23: {27, 17, 15, 29}
- Node 24: {7, 12, 10}
- Node 25: {7, 26, 21, 1}
- Node 26: {18, 13, 15, 25, 16}
- Node 27: {4, 3, 23}
- Node 28: {8, 17, 20}
- Node 29: {18, 3, 23}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 11, Node 25, Node 7, Node 20, Node 24, Node 26, Node 17, Node 29, Node 8, Node 18, Node 5, Node 3, Node 9, Node 14, Node 15, Node 10, Node 12, Node 13, Node 23

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} \]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives:
\[ 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 92 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [92].
