Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 3, 5}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 2, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 4 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30].

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>
