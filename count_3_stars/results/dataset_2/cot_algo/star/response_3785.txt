Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 13) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 11) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 2) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 16) (7, 16) (7, 11) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 10) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 11) (18, 14) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 8) (11, 17) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 5) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 10) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 13) (4, 9) (4, 19) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 6) (12, 13) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 18) (13, 2) (13, 12) (5, 11) (8, 17) (8, 18) (10, 16) (10, 19) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {2, 13, 19}
Node 1: {2, 11, 15, 16}
Node 2: {0, 1, 13}
Node 4: {9, 19}
Node 5: {11}
Node 6: {12, 14}
Node 7: {11, 16}
Node 8:  {17, 18}
Node 9: {4, 11, 18}
Node 10: {16, 19}
Node 11: {1, 5, 7, 9, 17}
Node 12: {6, 13}
Node 13: {0, 2, 12, 15, 18}
Node 14: {6, 18}
Node 15: {1, 13, 19}
Node 16: {1, 7, 10, 17, 19}
Node 17: {8, 11, 14, 16}
Node 18: {8, 9, 13, 14}
Node 19: {0, 4, 10, 15, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 13, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19

For each of these nodes, we will calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) where n is the number of neighbors of the node.

Calculating for each:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (2, 13, 19)>
<1, (2, 11, 15)>
<1, (2, 11, 16)>
<1, (11, 16, 19)>
<13, (15, 18, 19)>
<16, (17, 19, 10)>
<16, (17, 19, 1)>
<16, (17, 19, 7)>
<16, (17, 11, 1)>
<16, (17, 11, 7)>
