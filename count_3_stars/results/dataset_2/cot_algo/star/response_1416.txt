Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 3, 5
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 2, 5
- Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: Neighbors are 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 6 forms one 3-star: <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 9 forms one 3-star: <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Since each node with three or more neighbors can form a 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
