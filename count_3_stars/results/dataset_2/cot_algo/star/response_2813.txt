Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (9, 11) (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 3) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 22) (17, 8) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 24) (15, 4) (22, 17) (22, 23) (22, 27) (22, 7) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 16) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 11) (27, 22) (27, 29) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 23) (8, 26) (7, 22) (7, 12) (7, 20) (29, 27) (29, 1) (29, 6) (21, 28) (21, 20) (28, 21) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 25) (6, 12) (6, 29) (6, 20) (16, 3) (16, 23) (16, 28) (16, 13) (18, 10) (26, 14) (26, 8) (25, 28) (25, 0) (25, 2) (2, 12) (2, 25) (2, 4) (4, 15) (4, 2) (4, 20) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 19) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 24) (24, 15) (24, 11) (24, 0) (1, 29) (1, 28) (1, 13) (1, 0) (20, 7) (20, 21) (20, 6) (20, 4) (19, 10) (19, 0) (0, 25) (0, 24) (0, 1) (0, 19) (13, 16) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: {1, 19, 24, 25, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 13, 28, 29}
- Node 2: {4, 12, 25}
- Node 3: {10, 15, 16, 17}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 15, 20}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {12, 20, 29}
- Node 7: {12, 20, 22}
- Node 8: {5, 17, 23, 26}
- Node 9: {11}
- Node 10: {3, 18, 19}
- Node 11: {9, 12, 24}
- Node 12: {2, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 16}
- Node 14: {3, 17, 26}
- Node 15: {3, 4, 24}
- Node 16: {1, 3, 13, 23, 28}
- Node 17: {3, 8, 14, 22, 23}
- Node 18: {10}
- Node 19: {0, 10}
- Node 20: {4, 6, 7, 21}
- Node 21: {20, 28}
- Node 22: {7, 17, 23, 27}
- Node 23: {8, 16, 17, 22}
- Node 24: {11, 15}
- Node 25: {0, 2, 28}
- Node 26: {8, 14}
- Node 27: {22, 29}
- Node 28: {1, 16, 21, 25}
- Node 29: {1, 6, 27}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 9, 18, 19
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 13, 15, 21, 25
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 7, 26
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: 5, 24
- Nodes with 7 neighbors: 8, 16
- Nodes with 8 neighbors: 3, 4
- Nodes with 9 neighbors: 12, 22, 29

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 5 * \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 5
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 2 * \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 8
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 1 * \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: 1 * \( \binom{6}{3} \) = 20
- Nodes with 7 neighbors: 2 * \( \binom{7}{3} \) = 35
- Nodes with 8 neighbors: 2 * \( \binom{8}{3} \) = 56
- Nodes with 9 neighbors: 3 * \( \binom{9}{3} \) = 84

Adding these up: 5 + 8 + 10 + 20 + 35 + 56 + 84 = 218

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [218].

Next, listing the unique 3-stars found:

<0, 1, 19>, <2, 12, 25>, <9, 11, 24>, <18, 10, 19>, <13, 1, 16>, <15, 3, 24>, <21, 20, 28>, <25, 2, 4>, <7, 12, 20>, <26, 8, 14>, <5, 8, 17>, <29, 6, 27>, <3, 16, 23>, <4, 15, 24>, <22, 7, 17>
