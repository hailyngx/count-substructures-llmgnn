Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 13) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 19) (15, 17) (15, 4) (15, 12) (15, 11) (19, 8) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 12) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 19) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 7) (6, 0) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 11) (11, 17) (11, 4) (11, 15) (11, 7) (11, 13) (0, 19) (0, 6) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 16) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (16, 18) (16, 10) 

Response:
The graph described has the following 3-star structures:

1. Node 4: <4, (5, 12, 15)>
2. Node 8: <8, (5, 14, 19)>
3. Node 11: <11, (4, 7, 15)>
4. Node 12: <12, (14, 4, 15)>
5. Node 13: <13, (9, 2, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
