Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 5) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 10) (3, 16) (10, 3) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 6) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 9) (5, 17) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 16) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 7) (8, 0) (8, 19) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (18, 0) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 13) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 9) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 13) (15, 14) (2, 4) (2, 9) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 18) (13, 7) (13, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 9, 14, 18}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 7, 17}
- Node 2: {4, 9}
- Node 3: {10, 16}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 12}
- Node 5: {12, 16, 17, 18}
- Node 6: {1, 11, 12}
- Node 7: {1, 13, 19}
- Node 8: {0, 19}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 13, 16}
- Node 10: {3, 11}
- Node 11: {6, 10}
- Node 12: {4, 6, 5}
- Node 13: {7, 9, 18}
- Node 14: {0, 15, 17}
- Node 15: {14}
- Node 16: {3, 5, 9, 17}
- Node 17: {1, 14, 16, 5}
- Node 18: {0, 5, 13, 19}
- Node 19: {7, 8, 18}

Next, let's identify nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 1, 5, 9, 16, 17, and 18 have 4 or more neighbors.

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes, we get:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 28 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [28].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 8, 9, 18>
- <1, 4, 6, 7>
- <5, 12, 16, 17>
- <9, 13, 16, 18>
- <16, 17, 5, 9>
- <17, 14, 16, 5>
- <18, 0, 13, 19>
