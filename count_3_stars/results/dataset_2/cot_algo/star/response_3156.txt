Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 14) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (12, 3) (12, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {9, 11, 8, 12}
Node 1: {3, 11, 13, 8, 7}
Node 2: {9, 7, 8, 14}
Node 3: {1, 11, 7, 13, 12, 8}
Node 4: {5, 9, 7, 8, 14}
Node 5: {9, 6, 4}
Node 6: {5}
Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 2, 13}
Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 2, 0}
Node 9: {5, 4, 2, 14, 0}
Node 10: {13, 14}
Node 11: {1, 3, 14, 0}
Node 12: {3, 0}
Node 13: {1, 3, 10, 7}
Node 14: {9, 10, 11, 4, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes: <0, (9, 11, 8)>
Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes: <1, (3, 11, 13)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes: <3, (1, 11, 7)> and <3, (1, 13, 7)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes: <4, (9, 7, 8)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes: <9, (5, 4, 14)>
Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes: <14, (9, 10, 11)> and <14, (9, 2, 4)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we have a total of 8 3-stars. So, the answer is [8].
