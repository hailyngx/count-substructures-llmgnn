Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-star subgraphs in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 5
Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 2, 6, 7, 9
Node 4: Neighbors are 1
Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 2, 7, 9
Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 3, 7, 9
Node 7: Neighbors are 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: Neighbors are 1, 7, 9
Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8

Now we can calculate the number of 3-star subgraphs for each node:

Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 9: inom{7}{3} = 35

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 35 = 93

Therefore, the total number of 3-star subgraphs in the graph is [93].

The unique 3-star subgraphs found are: 
<0, 1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 8, 9>
<9, 0, 2, 5>
