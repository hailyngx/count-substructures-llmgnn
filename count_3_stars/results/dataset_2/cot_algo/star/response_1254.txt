Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 19) (16, 29) (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 7) (21, 1) (21, 22) (21, 29) (0, 1) (0, 24) (0, 4) (0, 8) (27, 2) (27, 9) (22, 21) (22, 23) (22, 14) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 12) (26, 1) (2, 27) (2, 8) (2, 24) (2, 17) (2, 15) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 15) (28, 24) (28, 25) (6, 17) (6, 12) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 20) (9, 27) (9, 25) (5, 11) (5, 29) (5, 10) (24, 0) (24, 2) (24, 28) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 12) (17, 23) (17, 2) (17, 6) (17, 3) (25, 28) (25, 9) (25, 4) (25, 18) (25, 14) (15, 2) (15, 8) (15, 7) (14, 22) (14, 25) (14, 20) (7, 1) (7, 15) (4, 0) (4, 19) (4, 25) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13) (20, 3) (20, 14) (20, 13) (29, 16) (29, 21) (29, 5) (18, 25) (13, 10) (13, 20) (12, 11) (12, 23) (12, 6) (12, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 8, 24
- Node 1: 0, 7, 10, 21, 26
- Node 2: 8, 15, 17, 24, 27
- Node 3: 5, 10, 11, 17, 20
- Node 4: 0, 19, 25
- Node 5: 3, 10, 11, 29
- Node 6: 12, 17
- Node 7: 1, 15
- Node 8: 0, 2, 15
- Node 9: 25, 27
- Node 10: 1, 3, 5, 13
- Node 11: 3, 5, 12
- Node 12: 6, 11, 19, 23
- Node 13: 10, 20
- Node 14: 20, 22, 25
- Node 15: 2, 7, 8
- Node 16: 19, 21, 29
- Node 17: 2, 3, 6, 23
- Node 18: 25
- Node 19: 4, 12, 16
- Node 20: 3, 13, 14
- Node 21: 1, 16, 22, 29
- Node 22: 14, 21, 23
- Node 23: 12, 17, 22
- Node 24: 0, 2, 4, 28
- Node 25: 4, 14, 18, 28
- Node 26: 1
- Node 27: 2, 9
- Node 28: 24, 25
- Node 29: 5, 16, 21

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are: 26
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 22, 24, 25, 28, 29

Calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with more than 3 neighbors:

- For each of these nodes, apply the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \)
- Sum up the total number of 3-stars from all these nodes

The total number of 3-stars found in the graph is [408].
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, 10, 21>, <1, 10, 26>, <1, 21, 29>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 24>, <0, 8, 24>, <1, 10, 3>, <1, 10, 5>, <11, 3, 5>, <6, 12, 19>, <8, 15, 2>, <8, 15, 7>, <8, 15, 17>, <8, 2, 24>, <17, 2, 6>, <17, 2, 3>, <17, 6, 23>, <17, 3, 20>, <25, 14, 20>, <25, 14, 22>, <25, 14, 28>, <25, 20, 13>, <27, 2, 9>
