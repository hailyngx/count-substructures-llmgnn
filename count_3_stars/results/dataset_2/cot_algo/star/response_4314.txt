Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 26) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 17) (3, 23) (15, 27) (15, 8) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 7) (18, 22) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 25) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 2) (10, 24) (8, 15) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 19) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 0) (5, 20) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 19) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 0) (14, 23) (26, 11) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 25) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 20) (17, 19) (20, 11) (20, 27) (20, 5) (20, 17) (9, 11) (9, 29) (9, 12) (29, 9) (29, 7) (29, 12) (2, 22) (2, 13) (2, 28) (2, 21) (23, 3) (23, 5) (23, 14) (23, 26) (1, 25) (1, 28) (1, 7) (7, 27) (7, 18) (7, 29) (7, 1) (21, 13) (21, 2) (25, 18) (25, 26) (25, 1) (24, 10) (12, 9) (12, 29) (28, 15) (28, 2) (28, 1) (28, 19) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 28) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 14, 17}
- Node 1: {7, 25, 28}
- Node 2: {13, 21, 22, 28}
- Node 3: {23}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 20, 23}
- Node 6: {5, 18, 19}
- Node 7: {1, 18, 27, 29}
- Node 8: {13, 15}
- Node 9: {11, 12, 29}
- Node 10: {24}
- Node 11: {9, 16, 20, 26}
- Node 12: {9, 29}
- Node 13: {2, 8, 17, 19, 21}
- Node 14: {0, 23}
- Node 15: {8, 27, 28}
- Node 16: {11, 17}
- Node 17: {0, 13, 16, 19, 20}
- Node 18: {6, 7, 22, 25}
- Node 19: {13, 17, 28}
- Node 20: {5, 11, 17, 27}
- Node 21: {2, 13}
- Node 22: {2, 18, 26}
- Node 23: {3, 5, 14, 26}
- Node 24: {10}
- Node 25: {1, 18, 26}
- Node 26: {11, 22, 23, 25}
- Node 27: {7, 15, 20}
- Node 28: {1, 2, 15, 19}
- Node 29: {7, 9, 12}

Next, we calculate how many 3-stars can be formed with each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [3]
- Node 2: [4]
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 6: [0]
- Node 7: [2]
- Node 8: [0]
- Node 9: [0]
- Node 11: [1]
- Node 13: [3]
- Node 15: [0]
- Node 16: [0]
- Node 17: [2]
- Node 18: [2]
- Node 19: [1]
- Node 20: [0]
- Node 22: [0]
- Node 23: [1]
- Node 25: [0]
- Node 26: [1]
- Node 27: [0]
- Node 28: [1]
- Node 29: [0]

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: [22].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 7, 25>
- <1, 7, 28>
- <1, 25, 28>
- <2, 13, 19>
- <2, 13, 21>
- <2, 13, 28>
- <5, 0, 20>
- <11, 9, 12>
- <13, 17, 19>
- <15, 27, 20>
- <18, 7, 29>
- <18, 22, 25>
- <22, 2, 26>
- <23, 3, 14>
- <26, 11, 22>
- <26, 11, 23>
- <26, 22, 25>
- <27, 7, 15>
- <27, 7, 20>
- <28, 1, 19>
- <29, 7, 12>
