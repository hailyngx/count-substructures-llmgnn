Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 15) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 18) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 8) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 13) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 16) (15, 6) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 6) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 3) (14, 10) (14, 8) (9, 12) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 0) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 18) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 13) (6, 15) (6, 16) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 14) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 9) (0, 4) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 0) (13, 19) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 9, 18
- Node 2: 5, 9, 13, 16
- Node 3: 7, 12, 18
- Node 4: 0, 5, 19
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4
- Node 6: 15, 16
- Node 7: 3, 8, 15
- Node 8: 7, 12, 14, 17
- Node 9: 0, 2, 12, 18
- Node 10: 11, 14, 17
- Node 11: 10, 15
- Node 12: 3, 8, 9
- Node 13: 2, 19
- Node 14: 10, 8
- Node 15: 6, 7, 11, 16
- Node 16: 2, 6, 15
- Node 17: 8, 10, 18
- Node 18: 3, 9, 17, 19, 0
- Node 19: 4, 13, 18

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 4 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 5 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18 with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total 3-stars = 4 (from nodes with 4 neighbors) + 10 (from node 18) = 14

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, 4, 5, 9>
2. <0, 5, 9, 18>
3. <0, 2, 9, 18>
4. <2, 5, 9, 18>
5. <8, 12, 14, 17>
6. <8, 12, 9, 18>
7. <8, 14, 17, 10>
8. <8, 17, 10, 11>
9. <15, 6, 16, 2>
10. <15, 6, 16, 15>
11. <15, 7, 3, 12>
12. <15, 7, 8, 17>
13. <18, 0, 4, 19>
14. <18, 0, 5, 4>
