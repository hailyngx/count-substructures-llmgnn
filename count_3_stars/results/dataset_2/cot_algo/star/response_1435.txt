Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (5, 8) (5, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 4) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 4) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 10) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 14.

First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 13, 14, 10, 3}
- Node 1: {6, 13, 2, 14, 4}
- Node 2: {9, 8, 1}
- Node 3: {13, 12, 0, 14}
- Node 4: {11, 1, 10}
- Node 5: {8, 10}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 11, 12}
- Node 7: {8, 12}
- Node 8: {13, 2, 5, 12, 7}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 14, 0}
- Node 10: {0, 14, 5, 4}
- Node 11: {6, 13, 4}
- Node 12: {6, 8, 7, 14, 3}
- Node 13: {8, 11, 3, 1, 0}
- Node 14: {9, 12, 0, 3, 1, 10}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [0]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [0]
- Node 5: [0]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: [0]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 10: [0]
- Node 11: [1]
- Node 12: [1]
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 14: [1]

Total number of 3-stars: [10]

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 9, 14>
<1, 6, 13>
<2, 8, 1>
<3, 12, 14>
<4, 11, 1>
<5, 10, 0>
<6, 9, 11>
<7, 8, 12>
<8, 13, 3>
<12, 14, 0>
