Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 4) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 8) (4, 14) (4, 3) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 13, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 8, 12}
- Node 4: {3, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 7, 12}
- Node 7: {6, 8, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 7, 12}
- Node 9: {2, 12}
- Node 10: {1, 13, 11}
- Node 11: {2, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 7, 8, 9, 3}
- Node 13: {1, 7, 10, 14, 0}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 11, 13}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: No 3-star can be formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: No 3-star can be formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 71

Thus, the final number of 3-stars is [71].
