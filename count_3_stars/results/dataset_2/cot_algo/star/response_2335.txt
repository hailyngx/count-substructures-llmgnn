Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 6: {5, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 5, 10}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 3, 7, 11}
- Node 11: {4, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 12: {3, 5, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 6, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 4, 8, 9}

Next, we'll identify the nodes which have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 5, Node 9, and Node 14 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, Node 10, Node 11, and Node 13 have 5 neighbors each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For nodes with 4 neighbors (Node 0, Node 5, Node 9, and Node 14):
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For nodes with 5 neighbors (Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, Node 10, Node 11, and Node 13):
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is:
\[ 4 + 10 = 14 \]

So, the final answer is [14], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 13)>, <5, (6, 7, 12)>, <9, (2, 11, 14)>.
