Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 14) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 13) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 3) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {4, 14}
- Node 1: {6, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {4, 10, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 9, 12, 14, 3}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 6: {1, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 11, 13}
- Node 8: {5, 10, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 7, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {2, 4, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 7, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 4, 8, 10}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: Does not form any 3-star (has 2 neighbors).
- Node 1: Forms one 3-star.
- Node 2: Forms one 3-star.
- Node 3: Does not form any 3-star (has 3 neighbors).
- Node 4: Forms one 3-star.
- Node 5: Forms one 3-star.
- Node 6: Does not form any 3-star (has 2 neighbors).
- Node 7: Does not form any 3-star (has 3 neighbors).
- Node 8: Forms one 3-star.
- Node 9: Forms one 3-star.
- Node 10: Forms one 3-star.
- Node 11: Forms one 3-star.
- Node 12: Forms one 3-star.
- Node 13: Does not form any 3-star (has 4 neighbors).
- Node 14: Forms one 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, there are [7] 3-stars in the graph, and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 9, 11>
<2, 4, 12>
<4, 9, 12>
<5, 8, 10>
<8, 10, 14>
<10, 11, 14>
<11, 12, 14>
