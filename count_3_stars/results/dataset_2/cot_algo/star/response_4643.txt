Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 1) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 11) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 1) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 12) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, let's find the 3-stars in the graph.

Node 0 neighbors: 7, 6, 2, 13, 1
Node 1 neighbors: 4, 7, 13, 0, 11
Node 2 neighbors: 8, 11, 0
Node 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 6, 5
Node 4 neighbors: 7, 12, 1, 6, 3
Node 5 neighbors: 8, 13, 12, 11, 3, 14
Node 6 neighbors: 4, 9, 14, 10, 3, 0
Node 7 neighbors: 4, 0, 3, 1
Node 8 neighbors: 2, 5, 14
Node 9 neighbors: 6
Node 10 neighbors: 6, 13, 12
Node 11 neighbors: 2, 5, 12, 1
Node 12 neighbors: 4, 5, 10, 11
Node 13 neighbors: 5, 1, 10, 0
Node 14 neighbors: 6, 8, 5

Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, and Node 5 have 5 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

\[
\text{{Number of 3-stars at Node 0: }} \binom{5}{3} = 10
\]

<0, 7, 13>, <0, 2, 13>, <0, 13, 1>, <0, 6, 13>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 1>

\[
\text{{Number of 3-stars at Node 1: }} \binom{5}{3} = 10
\]

<1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 7, 13>, <1, 7, 11>, <1, 7, 3>, <1, 13, 11>, <1, 13, 3>, <1, 11, 5>, <1, 13, 0>

\[
\text{{Number of 3-stars at Node 3: }} \binom{5}{3} = 10
\]

<3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 7, 5>, <3, 7, 6>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 11>, <3, 5, 12>, <3, 5, 14>, <3, 6, 14>

\[
\text{{Number of 3-stars at Node 5: }} \binom{6}{3} = 20
\]

<5, 8, 13>, <5, 8, 11>, <5, 8, 14>, <5, 8, 12>, <5, 8, 3>, <5, 8, 14>, <5, 13, 14>, <5, 13, 12>, <5, 13, 11>, <5, 13, 3>, <5, 12, 11>, <5, 12, 14>, <5, 12, 3>, <5, 11, 12>, <5, 11, 14>, <5, 11, 3>, <5, 14, 12>, <5, 14, 11>, <5, 14, 3>, <5, 14, 10>

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 50

Therefore, the final total number of 3-stars is [50].
