Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 5) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 10) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 4) (14, 10) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 13, 2
- Node 1: 3, 11, 0, 12
- Node 2: 13, 0, 5, 14, 4
- Node 3: 6, 1, 8, 4
- Node 4: 6, 3, 2, 5, 14
- Node 5: 12, 2, 11, 4, 10
- Node 6: 14, 10, 3, 11, 4
- Node 7: 9, 13, 12
- Node 8: 3, 13, 10, 11
- Node 9: 7
- Node 10: 6, 8, 12, 5, 14
- Node 11: 6, 1, 8, 5
- Node 12: 1, 7, 5, 10
- Node 13: 8, 2, 7, 0
- Node 14: 6, 2, 4, 10

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 6: 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 10: 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 12: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the final answer is [28], and the unique 3-stars found are <6, (3, 11, 4)>, <10, (6, 8, 14)>, <12, (1, 5, 10)>, <14, (2, 4, 10)>.
