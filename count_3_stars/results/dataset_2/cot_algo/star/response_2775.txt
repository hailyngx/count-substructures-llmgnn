Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 4) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 7) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 12) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 10) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 11}
- Node 1: {2, 7, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 11}
- Node 3: {11, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 9, 13}
- Node 6: {4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 8, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 12}
- Node 10: {1, 4, 6, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 3, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 9, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 5, 12}
- Node 14: {3, 6, 7, 11}

Next, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For each node with more than three neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars as \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors. If \( n = 3 \), there is only 1 3-star formed.

Applying this calculation:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 80

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [80]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (7, 8, 12)>
- <2, (4, 11, 12)>
- <4, (2, 10, 12)>
- <5, (2, 9, 13)>
- <6, (8, 10, 12)>
- <11, (0, 12, 14)>
