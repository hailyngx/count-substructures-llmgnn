Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {9, 6, 7, 3, 2}
Node 1: {5, 7, 2}
Node 2: {4, 6, 0, 7, 1}
Node 3: {5, 9, 0, 7}
Node 4: {2}
Node 5: {9, 6, 8, 1, 3}
Node 6: {5, 8, 2, 0}
Node 7: {8, 0, 3, 2, 1}
Node 8: {5, 9, 7, 6}
Node 9: {5, 8, 3, 0}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and sum them up:
1 3-star is formed by nodes 1, 2, and 7
1 3-star is formed by nodes 3, 0, and 7
1 3-star is formed by nodes 5, 8, and 9
1 3-star is formed by nodes 6, 0, and 5
1 3-star is formed by nodes 8, 6, and 5
1 3-star is formed by nodes 9, 5, and 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 2, 7>
<3, 0, 7>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 0, 5>
<8, 6, 5>
<9, 5, 8>
