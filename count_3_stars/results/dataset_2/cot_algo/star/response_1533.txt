Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 9) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 14) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 3, 10, 12, 9
Node 1: 3, 5, 10, 13, 4
Node 2: 8, 13
Node 3: 1, 7, 0, 14, 6, 5
Node 4: 1, 12
Node 5: 1, 3, 10, 11, 6, 7
Node 6: 3, 5, 13
Node 7: 3, 11, 8, 5, 14
Node 8: 10, 11, 2, 9, 7
Node 9: 11, 8, 0, 14
Node 10: 1, 0, 8, 5, 3
Node 11: 7, 9, 5, 8, 12
Node 12: 11, 4, 0
Node 13: 1, 6, 2
Node 14: 3, 7, 9

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 (as it has 4 neighbors)
Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 5: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 88

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [88].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 10, 12)>, <1, (3, 5, 10)>, <1, (3, 5, 13)>, <1, (3, 5, 11)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 10, 11)>, 
<1, (5, 3, 7)>, <1, (10, 5, 11)>, <3, (1, 5, 10)>, <3, (1, 5, 11)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 10, 11)>, 
<3, (5, 10, 7)>, <3, (10, 5, 11)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 10, 11)>, <5, (3, 10, 11)>, <5, (3, 10, 7)>, 
<10, (1, 3, 5)>, <10, (1, 5, 11)>, <10, (3, 5, 11)>, <11, (1, 5, 10)>.
