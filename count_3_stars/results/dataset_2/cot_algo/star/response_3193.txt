Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 9) (11, 5) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 9) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 14) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 5) (6, 12) (6, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 6) 

Response:
Since we have 15 nodes, we will determine the neighbors of each node first. Then we will identify the 3-stars formed and count them.

Node 0 neighbors: {1, 3, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13}
Node 1 neighbors: {0, 3, 7, 10, 12, 14}
Node 2 neighbors: {3, 5, 12}
Node 3 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 10}
Node 4 neighbors: {5, 13}
Node 5 neighbors: {2, 4, 8, 11, 13, 14}
Node 6 neighbors: {12, 14}
Node 7 neighbors: {0, 1, 8, 10, 12}
Node 8 neighbors: {5, 7, 14}
Node 9 neighbors: {0, 10, 11, 13, 14}
Node 10 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 7, 9, 12}
Node 11 neighbors: {5, 9}
Node 12 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 7, 10, 6, 14}
Node 13 neighbors: {0, 4, 5, 9}
Node 14 neighbors: {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

1 has 5 neighbors: <1, (3, 7, 10)>, <1, (3, 12, 14)>
3 has 4 neighbors: <3, (0, 1, 10)>, <3, (2, 5, 12)>, <3, (0, 7, 12)>
5 has 6 neighbors: <5, (2, 14, 13)>, <5, (4, 8, 14)>, <5, (9, 11, 14)>
7 has 5 neighbors: <7, (0, 1, 12)>
9 has 5 neighbors: <9, (0, 13, 14)>
12 has 7 neighbors: <12, (0, 1, 7)>, <12, (2, 5, 14)>, <12, (6, 10, 14)>

There are a total of 11 unique 3-stars formed. So, the final count is [11].
