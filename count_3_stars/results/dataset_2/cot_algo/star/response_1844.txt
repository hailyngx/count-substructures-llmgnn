Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, we'll calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [52], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>.
