Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 8, 2}
- Node 1: {4, 3, 6, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 1, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 3: {9, 4, 7, 1, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 1, 6, 3}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 4, 1, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 0, 3}
- Node 8: {9, 6, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 3, 7}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (4, 3, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1, so the final answer is [1].
