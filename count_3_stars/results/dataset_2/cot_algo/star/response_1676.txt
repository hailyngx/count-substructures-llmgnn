Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 2, 3}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 4, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 7, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 9, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 5)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 4)>, <8, (1, 7, 5)>, <8, (1, 7, 6)>, <8, (1, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 9, 6)>
