Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (1, 0) (1, 18) (3, 16) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 17) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 15) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 17) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 15) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 18) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 15) (14, 7) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 13) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 16) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 19) (17, 11) (18, 6) (18, 1) (18, 7) (18, 16) (18, 15) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 18
- Node 2: 5, 9, 13
- Node 3: 16
- Node 5: 2, 13, 17
- Node 6: 0, 7, 9, 18
- Node 7: 6, 10, 14, 18
- Node 8: 10, 17, 19
- Node 9: 2, 6
- Node 10: 7, 8, 12, 16
- Node 11: 12, 13, 15, 17
- Node 12: 10, 11, 15
- Node 13: 2, 5, 11, 15
- Node 15: 11, 12, 13, 18, 19
- Node 16: 3, 10, 18
- Node 17: 5, 8, 11, 19
- Node 18: 1, 6, 7, 15, 16
- Node 19: 8, 15, 17

Now, we identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 6: Forms one 3-star
- Node 7: Forms one 3-star
- Node 15: Forms one 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

And the unique 3-stars found are: 
<6, 0, 7>
<7, 6, 18>
<15, 11, 17>
