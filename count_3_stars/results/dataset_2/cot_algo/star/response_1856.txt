Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 0) (1, 21) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 15) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 27) (29, 5) (29, 18) (7, 21) (7, 19) (7, 18) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 15) (23, 4) (0, 22) (0, 1) (20, 27) (20, 4) (24, 26) (24, 12) (11, 1) (11, 23) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 19) (26, 24) (17, 8) (17, 27) (25, 2) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 15) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 3) (3, 9) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 10) (27, 29) (27, 20) (27, 17) (27, 19) (27, 6) (14, 13) (14, 22) (14, 15) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 28) (19, 27) (15, 13) (15, 21) (15, 23) (15, 8) (15, 14) (6, 13) (6, 27) (6, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (16, 9) (16, 4) (12, 1) (12, 24) (12, 10) (18, 29) (18, 7) (4, 23) (4, 20) (4, 16) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we'll first find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {1, 22}
Node 1 neighbors: {0, 8, 11, 12, 21}
Node 2 neighbors: {9, 19, 25, 29}
Node 3 neighbors: {9}
Node 4 neighbors: {16, 20, 23}
Node 5 neighbors: {10, 22, 29}
Node 6 neighbors: {10, 13, 27}
Node 7 neighbors: {18, 19, 21}
Node 8 neighbors: {1, 15, 17}
Node 9 neighbors: {2, 3, 16}
Node 10 neighbors: {5, 6, 12}
Node 11 neighbors: {1, 23, 28}
Node 12 neighbors: {1, 10, 24}
Node 13 neighbors: {6, 14, 15, 22}
Node 14 neighbors: {13, 15, 22}
Node 15 neighbors: {8, 13, 14, 21, 23}
Node 16 neighbors: {4, 9}
Node 17 neighbors: {8, 27}
Node 18 neighbors: {7, 19, 29}
Node 19 neighbors: {2, 7, 18, 27, 28}
Node 20 neighbors: {4, 27}
Node 21 neighbors: {1, 7, 15}
Node 22 neighbors: {0, 5, 13, 14, 29}
Node 23 neighbors: {4, 11, 15}
Node 24 neighbors: {12, 26}
Node 25 neighbors: {2}
Node 26 neighbors: {24}
Node 27 neighbors: {6, 17, 18, 19, 20, 29}
Node 28 neighbors: {11, 19}
Node 29 neighbors: {2, 5, 18, 22, 27}

Now, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes forming 3-stars: 13, 15, 22, 1, 21, 19, 27

For each of these nodes, we can form a 3-star if they have at least 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars: [20]
