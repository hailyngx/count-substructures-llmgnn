Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 13) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 13) (18, 19) (18, 10) (22, 2) (22, 21) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 29) (20, 3) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 2) (12, 27) (12, 28) (8, 26) (23, 15) (23, 17) (23, 14) (15, 20) (15, 23) (15, 11) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 13) (6, 21) (6, 10) (6, 26) (6, 4) (21, 27) (21, 22) (21, 6) (21, 29) (29, 20) (29, 21) (29, 5) (29, 10) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (2, 22) (2, 25) (2, 16) (19, 18) (19, 20) (19, 28) (16, 2) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 26) (7, 17) (11, 0) (11, 15) (11, 9) (5, 25) (5, 29) (3, 0) (3, 20) (3, 4) (3, 14) (24, 17) (24, 28) (14, 23) (14, 3) (26, 8) (26, 6) (26, 7) (10, 18) (10, 6) (10, 29) (10, 7) (1, 7) (1, 13) (17, 23) (17, 9) (17, 7) (17, 24) (13, 0) (13, 27) (13, 9) (13, 1) (28, 12) (28, 19) (28, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 11, 13
- Node 1: 7, 13
- Node 2: 16, 22, 25
- Node 3: 0, 4, 14, 20
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6
- Node 5: 25, 29
- Node 6: 4, 6, 10, 21, 26
- Node 7: 1, 10, 17, 26
- Node 8: 26
- Node 9: 11, 13, 17
- Node 10: 6, 7, 10, 18, 29
- Node 11: 0, 9, 15
- Node 12: 27, 28
- Node 13: 0, 1, 9, 27
- Node 14: 3, 23
- Node 15: 11, 20, 23
- Node 16: 2
- Node 17: 7, 9, 17, 23, 24
- Node 18: 10, 19
- Node 19: 18, 20, 28
- Node 20: 3, 15, 19, 25, 29
- Node 21: 6, 21, 22, 27, 29
- Node 22: 2, 21
- Node 23: 14, 15, 17
- Node 24: 17, 28
- Node 25: 2, 5, 20
- Node 26: 6, 7, 8
- Node 27: 12, 13, 21
- Node 28: 12, 19, 24
- Node 29: 5, 10, 20, 21

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3-star formed with nodes 4, 11, 13. <0, (4, 11, 13)>
- Node 3: 3-star formed with nodes 0, 4, 20. <3, (0, 4, 20)>
- Node 4: 3-star formed with nodes 0, 3, 6. <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 6: 3-star formed with nodes 4, 10, 21. <6, (4, 10, 21)>
- Node 10: 3-star formed with nodes 6, 7, 29. <10, (6, 7, 29)>
- Node 13: 3-star formed with nodes 0, 9, 27. <13, (0, 9, 27)>
- Node 17: 3-star formed with nodes 7, 9, 23. <17, (7, 9, 23)>
- Node 19: 3-star formed with nodes 18, 20, 28. <19, (18, 20, 28)>
- Node 20: 3-star formed with nodes 3, 15, 25. <20, (3, 15, 25)>
- Node 21: 3-star formed with nodes 6, 22, 29. <21, (6, 22, 29)>
- Node 25: 3-star formed with nodes 20, 2, 5. <25, (20, 2, 5)>
- Node 26: 3-star formed with nodes 6, 7, 8. <26, (6, 7, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11].
