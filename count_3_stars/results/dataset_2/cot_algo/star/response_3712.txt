Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (13, 6) (13, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {9, 3}
- Node 1: {4, 3, 10}
- Node 2: {7, 11, 5}
- Node 3: {6, 9, 1, 11, 0, 5}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 8, 5, 1}
- Node 5: {4, 3, 11, 8, 2}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 4, 13, 3}
- Node 7: {6, 4, 10, 14, 2}
- Node 8: {4, 11, 5, 14, 12}
- Node 9: {6, 14, 3, 13, 0}
- Node 10: {7, 1, 11, 12}
- Node 11: {3, 10, 5, 8, 2}
- Node 12: {10, 8}
- Node 13: {6, 9}
- Node 14: {9, 7, 8}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star. 
Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.

Adding all the contributions up: 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 72

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [72].

And the unique 3-stars are:
