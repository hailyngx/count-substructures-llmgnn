Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 10) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 7, 13}
- Node 1: {4, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 9, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 11}
- Node 6: {5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 10, 11}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 10}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 6, 12}
- Node 10: {4, 7, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 5, 7, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 14: {1, 10, 11, 12}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 62

Therefore, the final answer is [62].

Unique 3-stars:

<4, (7, 10, 13)>
<4, (10, 12, 14)>
<7, (0, 10, 11)>
<9, (3, 6, 12)>
<9, (3, 6, 14)>
<9, (3, 12, 14)>
<9, (6, 12, 14)>
<10, (4, 7, 14)>
<12, (1, 10, 14)>
<12, (10, 11, 14)>
<14, (1, 10, 11)>
<14, (1, 11, 12)>
<14, (10, 11, 12)>
