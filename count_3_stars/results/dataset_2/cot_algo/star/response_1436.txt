Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 16) (9, 10) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 16) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 4) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 4) (15, 16) (2, 1) (2, 19) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 7) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 18) (7, 0) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 19) (16, 5) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 12) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (19, 3) (19, 2) (19, 12) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 7, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 2}
- Node 2: {1, 19}
- Node 3: {6, 7, 15, 19}
- Node 4: {7, 10, 11, 15, 17}
- Node 5: {16, 17, 18}
- Node 6: {3, 8, 17}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 9, 18}
- Node 8: {6, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {7, 10}
- Node 10: {4, 9}
- Node 11: {4, 8}
- Node 12: {0, 8, 16, 19}
- Node 14: {16, 17, 18}
- Node 15: {3, 4, 16, 18}
- Node 16: {5, 12, 14, 15}
- Node 17: {4, 5, 6, 14}
- Node 18: {5, 7, 14, 15}
- Node 19: {2, 3, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars and count the total number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 5: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 12: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 15: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 16: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 17: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 18: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total unique 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 25\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \([25]\). 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <5, (4, 17, 18)>
- <7, (4, 17, 18)>
- <12, (0, 8, 16)>
- <15, (4, 16, 18)>
- <16, (5, 14, 15)>
- <17, (4, 5, 6)>
- <18, (5, 7, 14)>
