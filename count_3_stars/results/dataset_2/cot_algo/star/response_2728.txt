Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (3, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 12) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 12) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 10) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 5) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {7, 9, 13}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 10}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 10}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 11: {1, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {5, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 12, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 7, Node 9, Node 10, Node 12, and Node 14 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the final answer is [15], and the unique 3-stars are as follows:
<7, 0, 9>, <9, 0, 4>, <9, 0, 10>, <9, 1, 4>, <9, 1, 10>, <9, 4, 10>, <10, 0, 4>, <10, 0, 7>, <10, 1, 4>, <10, 1, 9>, <10, 2, 4>, <10, 2, 7>, <12, 5, 6>, <12, 5, 11>, <12, 5, 14>.
