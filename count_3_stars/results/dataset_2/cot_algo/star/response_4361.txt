Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 4) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 8) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 14}
- Node 7: {3, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 7, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 4, 14}
- Node 11: {3, 4, 5, 8, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 13: {2, 4}
- Node 14: {5, 6, 10, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 8, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, and Node 14 have three or more neighbors.

For these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- For Node 0: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 1: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 2: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 3: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 4: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 5: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 8: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 10: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 11: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 12: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 14: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 73

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [73].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 9, 12)>, <1, (3, 9, 10)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 11)>, <4, (10, 11, 13)>, <5, (11, 14, 6)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <10, (4, 11, 14)>, <11, (8, 14, 5)>, <12, (0, 1, 8)>, <14, (10, 11, 5)>.
