Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 16) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 8) (10, 7) (10, 2) (11, 0) (11, 18) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 16) (1, 2) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 4) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 14) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 4) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 19) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 18) (6, 17) (16, 9) (16, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 12}
- Node 1: {2}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 10, 12}
- Node 3: {4, 15, 18, 19}
- Node 4: {3, 12, 17, 19}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 6: {17}
- Node 7: {10, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 13, 15}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 14, 15, 16}
- Node 10: {2, 7}
- Node 11: {0, 18}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 13: {7, 8, 17}
- Node 14: {5, 7, 16, 18}
- Node 15: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 16: {9, 14}
- Node 17: {4, 6, 13}
- Node 18: {3, 11, 14, 19}
- Node 19: {3, 4, 18}

Next, we will count the number of unique 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, 9: <5, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, 15: <9, (5, 8, 15)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 16, 18: <14, (7, 16, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
