Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 10) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 0) (7, 14) (10, 16) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (18, 8) (18, 10) (18, 19) (19, 18) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 1) (3, 2) (3, 17) (3, 12) (17, 15) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 17) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 5) (12, 8) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 17) (13, 11) 

Response:
Since the graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, we need to consider the connections between the nodes to identify the 3-star structures. 

Based on the provided information, the neighbors for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: {14, 7}
- Node 1: {11, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {11, 9, 5, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 17, 12}
- Node 4: {16, 8, 1}
- Node 5: {15, 2, 1}
- Node 6: {8, 14, 17}
- Node 7: {0, 14}
- Node 8: {4, 9, 12, 6, 18}
- Node 9: {8, 2}
- Node 10: {16, 15, 18}
- Node 11: {16, 1, 13, 2}
- Node 12: {8, 15, 3, 17}
- Node 13: {11}
- Node 14: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 15: {10, 5, 17, 12}
- Node 16: {11, 4, 10}
- Node 17: {15, 3, 6, 12}
- Node 18: {8, 10, 19}
- Node 19: {18}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \({n \choose 3}\) for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 5: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 8: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 12: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 15: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 16: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 17: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 18: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 30\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (11, 4, 5)>, <2, (11, 9, 5)>, <4, (16, 8, 1)>, <8, (4, 9, 12)>, <12, (8, 15, 3)>, <15, (10, 5, 17)>, <16, (11, 4, 10)>, <17, (15, 3, 6)>, <18, (8, 10, 19)>
