Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 9) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 13) (4, 13) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 4: {13, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {1, 9, 12}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 10}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 10: {1, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 11: {1, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {1, 2, 7, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 4, 14}
- Node 14: {3, 4, 12, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 and its neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 and its neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 and its neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 and its neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 and its neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 and its neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 and its neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 76
Therefore, there are [76] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, 10, 11>, <1, 10, 12>, <1, 10, 13>, <1, 11, 12>, <1, 11, 13>, <1, 12, 13>, <1, 7, 12>, <0, 1, 10>, <0, 1, 11>, <0, 1, 12>, <0, 1, 13>, <2, 12, 13>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 9, 14>, <4, 13, 14>
