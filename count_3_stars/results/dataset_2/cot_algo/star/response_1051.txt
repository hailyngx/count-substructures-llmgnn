Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 18) (13, 8) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 18) (14, 0) (14, 5) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 19) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 16) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 19) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 2) (16, 1) (16, 15) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 5) (6, 15) (6, 2) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 6) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 15) (5, 4) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {14, 7, 15, 18}
- Node 1: {3, 16}
- Node 2: {17, 19, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 17, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 11, 9, 5}
- Node 5: {14, 7, 15, 4}
- Node 6: {15, 2}
- Node 7: {17, 0, 5}
- Node 8: {13, 9, 12, 18}
- Node 9: {8, 4, 19}
- Node 10: {11, 17, 15}
- Node 11: {10, 12, 4}
- Node 12: {11, 8}
- Node 13: {8}
- Node 14: {0, 5}
- Node 15: {10, 0, 6, 5, 16}
- Node 16: {1, 15}
- Node 17: {3, 10, 2, 7}
- Node 18: {8, 0, 19}
- Node 19: {9, 18, 2}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 15, 17, 18, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 30
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
