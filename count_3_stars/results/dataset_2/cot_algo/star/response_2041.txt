Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 6) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 16) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (9, 16) (9, 19) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 17) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 7) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 0) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 1) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 18) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 0) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 18) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 11) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 19) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 12) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 2) (16, 18) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 19) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 8, 5, 18
- Node 1: 8, 10, 13
- Node 2: 5, 16, 7
- Node 3: 10, 6
- Node 4: 8, 13, 11, 17
- Node 5: 2, 18, 0
- Node 6: 3, 11, 18
- Node 7: 2, 10, 19
- Node 8: 0, 1, 12, 4
- Node 9: 16, 19
- Node 10: 3, 7, 1
- Node 11: 6, 4, 17
- Node 12: 15, 8, 19
- Node 13: 4, 14, 1
- Node 14: 13
- Node 15: 17, 12, 16
- Node 16: 9, 15, 2, 18
- Node 17: 15, 4, 11
- Node 18: 5, 6, 16, 0
- Node 19: 9, 12, 7

Next, let's identify if any of the nodes form a 3-star, i.e., have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with nodes (8, 13, 11)
- Node 8: Forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 1, 12)
- Node 12: Forms a 3-star with nodes (15, 8, 19)
- Node 16: Forms a 3-star with nodes (9, 15, 2)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, and they are listed below:
<[8, 13, 11], [0, 1, 12], [15, 8, 19], [9, 15, 2]>
