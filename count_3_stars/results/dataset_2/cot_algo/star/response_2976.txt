Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 20) (22, 26) (22, 12) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 5) (2, 16) (2, 20) (29, 16) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 19) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 24) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 27) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 18) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 28) (1, 19) (26, 22) (26, 14) (26, 10) (18, 8) (18, 27) (18, 6) (17, 3) (17, 11) (21, 28) (28, 1) (28, 21) (28, 19) (28, 24) (28, 23) (11, 17) (11, 19) (23, 28) (23, 25) (14, 1) (14, 26) (14, 20) (14, 10) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 29) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 26) (10, 14) (10, 0) (6, 18) (6, 24) (6, 25) (24, 5) (24, 28) (24, 6) (12, 22) (12, 5) (12, 0) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 28) (19, 11) (20, 13) (20, 2) (20, 9) (20, 14) (27, 3) (27, 9) (27, 18) (25, 23) (25, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighborhood set for each node based on the given edges:

1. Node 0: {4, 8, 10, 12}
2. Node 1: {8, 14, 19, 28}
3. Node 2: {16, 20, 29}
4. Node 3: {15, 17, 27}
5. Node 4: {0, 5, 7, 8}
6. Node 5: {4, 9, 12, 15, 24}
7. Node 6: {18, 24, 25}
8. Node 7: {4, 19}
9. Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 18}
10. Node 9: {5, 15, 20, 27}
11. Node 10: {0, 14, 26}
12. Node 11: {17, 19}
13. Node 12: {0, 5, 22}
14. Node 13: {16, 20}
15. Node 14: {1, 10, 20, 26}
16. Node 15: {3, 5, 9}
17. Node 16: {2, 13, 29}
18. Node 17: {3, 11}
19. Node 18: {6, 8, 27}
20. Node 19: {1, 7, 11, 28}
21. Node 20: {2, 9, 13, 14}
22. Node 21: {28}
23. Node 22: {12, 26}
24. Node 23: {25, 28}
25. Node 24: {5, 6, 28}
26. Node 26: {10, 14, 22}
27. Node 27: {3, 9, 18}
28. Node 28: {1, 19, 21, 23, 24}
29. Node 29: {2, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 5, Node 8, Node 15, and Node 28 have 5, 4, 3, and 5 neighbors respectively. 
- We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
  - Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Total 3-stars formed = 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 25

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<5, (4, 12, 15)>, <5, (4, 15, 24)>, <5, (4, 9, 15)>, <5, (12, 15, 24)>, <5, (9, 15, 24)>, <8, (0, 4, 18)>, <8, (0, 4, 1)>, <8, (0, 1, 18)>, <8, (4, 18, 27)>, <15, (3, 9, 5)>, <28, (1, 19, 24)>, <28, (19, 21, 24)>, <28, (19, 23, 24)>, <28, (21, 23, 24)>, <28, (21, 23, 28)>, <28, (21, 24, 28)>, <28, (23, 24, 28)>, <28, (24, 6, 23)>, <28, (24, 6, 25)>, <28, (24, 21, 23)>
