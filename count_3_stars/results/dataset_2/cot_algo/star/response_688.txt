Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 15) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 1) (15, 13) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 15) (19, 10) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 12) (4, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 10) (11, 18) (11, 6) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 14) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 10) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 16) (16, 9) (16, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 8, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 15, 18}
- Node 3: neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 4: neighbors {5}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 11, 17}
- Node 7: neighbors {5, 10, 17}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 16, 18}
- Node 10: neighbors {1, 7, 13, 16, 19}
- Node 11: neighbors {6, 18}
- Node 12: neighbors {8, 14, 17}
- Node 13: neighbors {8, 10, 15}
- Node 14: neighbors {1, 8, 12, 15}
- Node 15: neighbors {2, 13, 14, 19}
- Node 16: neighbors {9, 10}
- Node 17: neighbors {6, 7, 12}
- Node 18: neighbors {2, 9, 11}
- Node 19: neighbors {10, 15}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1, Node 8, and Node 14 have 4 neighbors each, so each can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Total = 3 * 4 = 12
- Node 15 and Node 10 have 4 neighbors each, so each can form 4 3-stars. Total = 2 * 4 = 8

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 12 + 8 = 20, which we will represent as [20].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (8, 9, 10)>, <8, (1, 12, 13)>, <14, (8, 12, 15)>, <15, (2, 13, 19)>, <10, (1, 13, 16)>
