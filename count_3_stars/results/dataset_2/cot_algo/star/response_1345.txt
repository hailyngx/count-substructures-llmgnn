Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 4, 5, 7, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 9, 4, 2, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 9, 1, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 4, 0, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 5, 1, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 4, 0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 1, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8, 2, 1, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
