Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 25) (20, 15) (20, 29) (20, 6) (19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 13) (26, 7) (21, 5) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 29) (13, 19) (13, 27) (4, 27) (27, 13) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 17) (27, 6) (7, 26) (7, 25) (7, 11) (25, 15) (25, 7) (25, 9) (25, 23) (25, 8) (8, 24) (8, 25) (8, 9) (8, 29) (9, 25) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 12) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 5) (29, 20) (29, 24) (29, 27) (29, 8) (12, 9) (12, 6) (16, 22) (16, 3) (16, 23) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 22) (11, 2) (1, 19) (1, 11) (1, 28) (0, 28) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 5) (28, 10) (28, 1) (28, 0) (28, 14) (28, 5) (14, 19) (14, 28) (2, 24) (2, 11) (2, 3) (5, 21) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 28) (18, 0) (18, 6) (22, 10) (22, 16) (22, 11) (17, 27) (17, 0) (23, 25) (23, 16) (3, 9) (3, 16) (3, 2) (6, 20) (6, 27) (6, 12) (6, 18) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 17, 18, 28}
- Node 1: {11, 19, 28}
- Node 2: {3, 11, 24}
- Node 3: {2, 9, 16}
- Node 4: {27}
- Node 5: {0, 10, 21, 28}
- Node 6: {12, 18, 20, 27}
- Node 7: {11, 25, 26}
- Node 8: {9, 24, 25, 29}
- Node 9: {3, 8, 12, 25}
- Node 10: {5, 22, 28}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 7, 22}
- Node 12: {6, 9}
- Node 13: {19, 27}
- Node 14: {19, 28}
- Node 15: {20, 25}
- Node 16: {3, 22, 23}
- Node 17: {0, 27}
- Node 18: {0, 6}
- Node 19: {1, 13, 14}
- Node 20: {6, 15, 29}
- Node 21: {5)
- Node 22: {10, 11, 16}
- Node 23: {16, 25}
- Node 24: {2, 8, 29}
- Node 25: {7, 8, 9, 15, 23}
- Node 26: {7}
- Node 27: {4, 6, 13, 17, 29}
- Node 28: {0, 1, 5, 10, 14}
- Node 29: {8, 20, 24, 27}

Now, let's identify the nodes with at least three neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9, Node 11, Node 19, Node 25, Node 27, Node 28, Node 29

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up these results: 
\(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 55\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [55].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, 5, 28>, <0, 17, 27>, <0, 18, 6>, <0, 5, 28>, <5, 10, 28>, <5, 0, 28>, <5, 21, 10>, <5, 28, 14>, <6, 12, 9>, <6, 18, 0>, <6, 27, 29>, <6, 20, 15>, <8, 25, 15>, <8, 25, 23>, <8, 25, 9>, <8, 25, 24>, <8, 24, 2>, <8, 24, 29>, <9, 8, 25>, <9, 8, 29>, <9, 3, 2>, <9, 3, 16>, <9, 12, 6>, <11, 1, 28>, <11, 2, 24>, <11, 7, 26>, <11, 22, 10>, <19, 1, 28>, <19, 13, 27>, <25, 7, 11>, <25, 7, 26>, <25, 23, 16>, <27, 4, 17>, <27, 4, 6>, <27, 4, 29>, <27, 17, 0>, <29, 8, 24>
