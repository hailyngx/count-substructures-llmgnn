Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 18) (4, 8) (4, 18) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 17) (5, 15) (5, 10) (19, 0) (19, 9) (9, 8) (9, 19) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 16) (0, 19) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (16, 1) (16, 6) (14, 9) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 15) (7, 18) (7, 17) (7, 13) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 7) (11, 18) (11, 9) (11, 12) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 12) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Based on the given edges, the neighbor sets for each node are:
- Node 0: {9, 10, 12, 13, 19}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 12, 16}
- Node 2: {8, 13, 17}
- Node 3: {1, 18}
- Node 4: {8, 18}
- Node 5: {10, 15}
- Node 6: {1, 16}
- Node 7: {13, 17, 18}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 8, 11, 14, 19}
- Node 10: {0, 5, 13}
- Node 11: {9, 12, 18}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 11, 15}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 7, 10}
- Node 14: {9}
- Node 15: {5, 12, 18}
- Node 16: {1, 6}
- Node 17: {2, 7}
- Node 18: {3, 4, 7, 11, 15}
- Node 19: {0, 9}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 38

Therefore, the final answer is [38]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, 9, 10>, <0, 9, 12>, <0, 9, 13>, <0, 9, 19>, 
<1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 16>, <1, 6, 16>, <1, 12, 16>, 
<9, 11, 12>, <9, 11, 18>, <9, 12, 15>, <12, 15, 18>, 
<2, 8, 9>, <7, 17, 18>.
