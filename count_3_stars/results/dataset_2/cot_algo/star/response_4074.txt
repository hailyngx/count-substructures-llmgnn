Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 7, 8}

Now we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars with that node as the center:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
