Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 0.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 3.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 4.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 5.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 6.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with Node 8.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 9.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] unique 3-stars, and they are as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>
