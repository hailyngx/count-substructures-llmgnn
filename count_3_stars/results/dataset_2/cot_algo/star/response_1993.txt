The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (16, 27) (16, 15) (0, 4) (0, 18) (27, 16) (27, 29) (27, 26) (18, 0) (18, 14) (18, 28) (22, 26) (22, 7) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 8) (13, 20) (13, 24) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 21) (17, 10) (17, 5) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (20, 13) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 2) (25, 20) (7, 22) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 26) (12, 7) (12, 19) (21, 14) (21, 3) (21, 9) (21, 5) (28, 18) (28, 4) (28, 2) (26, 27) (26, 22) (26, 7) (26, 5) (24, 13) (24, 9) (3, 21) (3, 6) (3, 19) (29, 27) (29, 20) (29, 15) (4, 0) (4, 28) (4, 23) (4, 2) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 21) (5, 26) (5, 1) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 9) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 29) (9, 10) (9, 21) (9, 24) (9, 1) (9, 19) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 19) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 4) (2, 23) (23, 14) (23, 4) (23, 2) (19, 12) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2 neighbors (4, 18)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (5, 9, 11)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (4, 20, 23, 28)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (6, 19, 21)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (0, 2, 23, 28)
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (1, 8, 17, 21, 26)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (3, 10, 19)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (12, 15, 22, 26)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (5, 13)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (1, 6, 9, 19, 24)
- Node 10: 4 neighbors (6, 9, 17, 21)
- Node 11: 1 neighbor (1)
- Node 12: 2 neighbors (7, 19)
- Node 13: 3 neighbors (8, 20, 24)
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (18, 21, 23)
- Node 15: 3 neighbors (7, 16, 29)
- Node 16: 2 neighbors (15, 27)
- Node 17: 3 neighbors (5, 10, 17)
- Node 18: 3 neighbors (0, 14, 28)
- Node 19: 4 neighbors (3, 6, 9, 12)
- Node 20: 4 neighbors (13, 2, 29, 20)
- Node 21: 4 neighbors (10, 14, 5, 3)
- Node 22: 2 neighbors (7, 26)
- Node 23: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 14)
- Node 24: 2 neighbors (9, 13)
- Node 25: 1 neighbor (20)
- Node 26: 4 neighbors (5, 7, 22, 27)
- Node 27: 3 neighbors (16, 26, 29)
- Node 28: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 18)
- Node 29: 3 neighbors (20, 27, 15)

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49].
