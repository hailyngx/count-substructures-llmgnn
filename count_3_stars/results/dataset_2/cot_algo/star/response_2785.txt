Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 15) (14, 17) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (4, 12) (4, 5) (8, 11) (8, 10) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 10) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 16) (15, 10) (15, 2) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 19) (18, 5) (2, 15) (2, 9) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {6, 7, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 13}
- Node 2: {9, 15}
- Node 3: {1, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {5, 12}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 10, 14, 18}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 17}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 9, 10}
- Node 8: {10, 11}
- Node 9: {2, 7, 19}
- Node 10: {5, 7, 8, 15, 19}
- Node 11: {8, 12, 13, 16}
- Node 12: {3, 4, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 3, 11}
- Node 14: {5, 17}
- Node 15: {2, 10, 16}
- Node 16: {11, 15, 17, 19}
- Node 17: {6, 14, 16}
- Node 18: {5}
- Node 19: {9, 10, 16}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: Nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 16, and 19.

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up all the possible 3-stars:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 41 \]

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 7, 9>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <1, 13, 0>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <5, 7, 10>
- <5, 10, 15>
- <5, 14, 17>
- <7, 9, 19>
- <10, 15, 16>
- <11, 13, 0>
- <11, 15, 16>
- <13, 0, 7>
- <16, 10, 19>
