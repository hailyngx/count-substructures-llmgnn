Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 8) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 12) (5, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 2) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {12, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 10}
- Node 10: {1, 9, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 11}
- Node 13: {8, 10}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 5, 6, 10}

Now let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms the 3-star <1, (10, 11, 14)>
- Node 3 forms the 3-star <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 10 forms the 3-star <10, (1, 11, 14)>
- Node 11 forms the 3-star <11, (1, 10, 12)>

Since each of these nodes has exactly 3 neighbors, they each form exactly 1 3-star. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
