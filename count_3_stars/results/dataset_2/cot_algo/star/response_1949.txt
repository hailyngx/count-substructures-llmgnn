Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 11) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 2) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 12) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 14, and the graph can be represented as follows:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, 13, 14.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 12, 13.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 10, 14.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 14.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 9, 12.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 10.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, 8, 9.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 11, 13, 14.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 11.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6.
Node 10 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 12.
Node 11 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 12, 13.
Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 10, 11, 13.
Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 11, 12, 0.
Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7.

Next, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: This node has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1: This node has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: This node has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: This node has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: This node has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12: This node has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13: This node has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14: This node has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 78 \)

Therefore, the final answer is  [78], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 7, 14>, <1, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 12>, <6, 7, 11>, <9, 2, 14>, <7, 11, 13>
