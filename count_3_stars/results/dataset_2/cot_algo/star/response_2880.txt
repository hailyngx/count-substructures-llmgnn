Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 18) (9, 17) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 17) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 19) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 4) (11, 3) (11, 15) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 12) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 15) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 4) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 16) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 4) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 18) (7, 2) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 4) (16, 7) (18, 9) (18, 7) (15, 11) (15, 17) (2, 0) (2, 7) (10, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 6}
- Node 1: {12, 13, 16, 17}
- Node 2: {0, 7}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 10, 11, 16}
- Node 4: {3, 12, 13, 16, 19}
- Node 5: {8, 12, 17, 19}
- Node 6: {0, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 14, 16, 18}
- Node 8: {3, 5}
- Node 9: {17, 18}
- Node 10: {3}
- Node 11: {3, 15}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 14: {7, 19}
- Node 15: {11, 17}
- Node 16: {1, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 17: {1, 5, 9, 15}
- Node 18: {7, 9}
- Node 19: {4, 5, 14}

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [36]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (12, 16, 17)>
- <3, (4, 16, 19)>
- <4, (12, 13, 16)>
- <5, (8, 12, 17)>
- <7, (14, 16, 18)>
- <17, (1, 5, 15)>
