Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 18) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 14) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 8) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (12, 7) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 19) (5, 4) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 6) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 14) (6, 8) (6, 19) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 16) (14, 13) (9, 15) (9, 13) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 9) 

Response:
There are 20 nodes and 60 edges in the graph. 

Let's first determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 16, 19}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 18}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 13, 14, 18}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 10}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {8, 19}
- Node 7: {0, 12, 15, 17, 19}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 18}
- Node 9: {13, 15}
- Node 10: {4, 13, 15}
- Node 12: {7}
- Node 13: {2, 9, 10, 14, 19}
- Node 14: {2, 13, 16, 18}
- Node 15: {7, 9, 10}
- Node 16: {0, 14, 18}
- Node 17: {7}
- Node 18: {1, 2, 8, 14, 16}
- Node 19: {0, 7, 13, 6}

Now we can determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 1 3-star (<2, 13, 14>)
- Node 3: 1 3-star (<1, 2, 8>)
- Node 7: 1 3-star (<0, 15, 19>)
- Node 13: 2 3-stars (<2, 9, 14>, <10, 13, 15>)
- Node 18: 1 3-star (<8, 16, 2>)

Adding up all the 3-stars gives a total of [6].

Unique 3-stars: 
- <2, 13, 14>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <0, 15, 19>
- <2, 9, 14>
- <10, 13, 15>
- <8, 16, 2>
