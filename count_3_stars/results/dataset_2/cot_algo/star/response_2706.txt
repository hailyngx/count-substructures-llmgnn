Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 9) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 1) (2, 0) (2, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 6, 9, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 6, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 11}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 8, 11}
- Node 7: Neighbors {10, 12, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 6, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 10: Neighbors {7, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 13: Neighbors {7, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 14: Neighbors {4, 9, 0}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [20]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [2]
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 11: [3]
- Node 12: [3]
- Node 13: [1]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [34]

The unique 3-stars found:
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 3)>
<1, (1, 0, 2)>
<1, (1, 9, 12)>
<1, (3, 8, 6)>
<4, (4, 0, 14)>
<4, (4, 11, 12)>
<11, (11, 4, 12)>
<12, (12, 1, 9)>
<13, (13, 7, 10)>
