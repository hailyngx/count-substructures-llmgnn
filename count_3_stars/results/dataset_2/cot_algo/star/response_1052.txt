Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 4) (6, 4) (6, 13) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 14) (18, 26) (18, 19) (26, 18) (26, 14) (26, 8) (26, 7) (8, 26) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 20) (9, 3) (29, 9) (29, 1) (7, 11) (7, 26) (7, 25) (7, 3) (25, 7) (14, 21) (14, 26) (14, 1) (19, 18) (19, 20) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 22) (4, 1) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 28) (22, 0) (16, 23) (16, 27) (2, 22) (2, 24) (2, 15) (20, 9) (20, 19) (20, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 11) (1, 29) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 24) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 21) (13, 15) (5, 8) (5, 20) (5, 28) (5, 27) (27, 16) (27, 5) (27, 23) (0, 21) (0, 22) (12, 10) (12, 3) (17, 24) (24, 2) (24, 1) (24, 17) (23, 16) (23, 27) (28, 22) (28, 5) (28, 15) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 28) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {21, 22}
- Node 1: {4, 11, 14, 24, 29}
- Node 2: {15, 22, 24}
- Node 3: {8, 9, 7, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 11, 22}
- Node 5: {8, 20, 27, 28}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 13}
- Node 7: {3, 11, 25, 26}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 9, 26}
- Node 9: {3, 8, 20, 29}
- Node 10: {11, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {1, 4, 7, 10}
- Node 12: {3, 10}
- Node 13: {6, 10, 15, 21}
- Node 14: {1, 21, 26}
- Node 15: {2, 13, 28}
- Node 16: {23, 27}
- Node 17: {24}
- Node 18: {19, 26}
- Node 19: {18, 20}
- Node 20: {5, 9, 19}
- Node 21: {0, 13, 14}
- Node 22: {0, 2, 4, 28}
- Node 23: {16, 27}
- Node 24: {1, 2, 17}
- Node 25: {7}
- Node 26: {7, 8, 14, 18}
- Node 27: {5, 15, 16, 23}
- Node 28: {5, 15, 22}
- Node 29: {1, 9}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <1, 4, 11>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <4, 1, 11>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <5, 8, 20>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <8, 3, 9>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <9, 3, 20>
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <13, 6, 10>
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <15, 2, 28>
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <20, 5, 9>
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <22, 4, 28>
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <26, 7, 14>

Summing up all the 3-stars found, we have a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
