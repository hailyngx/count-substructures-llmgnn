Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 9) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 5) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will analyze the neighbors of each node to identify any 3-star structures.

1. Node 0: Neighbors {13, 12, 14, 9}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {8, 11, 6, 5}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {10, 4, 6}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {10, 7, 4, 12, 14}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {13, 6, 3, 2}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {11, 10, 1}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {13, 11, 4, 7, 1, 2}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {10, 12, 3, 6, 9}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {13, 9, 1}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {8, 7, 0, 14}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {3, 7, 2, 5}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {14, 1, 5, 6}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {7, 0, 3}
14. Node 14: Neighbors {11, 0, 3, 9}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, 1, 6, 9 have 4 or more neighbors, so we calculate \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 3, 7, 11, 14 have 5 or more neighbors, so we calculate \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 56 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (13, 12, 14)>, <0, (13, 12, 9)>, <0, (13, 14, 9)>, <0, (12, 14, 9)>,
<1, (8, 11, 6)>, <1, (8, 11, 5)>, <1, (8, 6, 5)>, <1, (11, 6, 5)>,
<6, (13, 11, 4)>, <6, (13, 11, 7)>, <6, (13, 11, 1)>, <6, (13, 4, 7)>,
<9, (8, 7, 0)>, <9, (8, 7, 14)>, <9, (8, 0, 14)>, <9, (7, 0, 14)>,
<3, (10, 7, 2)>, <3, (10, 7, 5)>, <3, (10, 2, 5)>, <3, (7, 2, 5)>,
<7, (10, 12, 3)>, <7, (10, 12, 14)>, <7, (10, 3, 14)>, <7, (12, 3, 14)>,
<11, (14, 1, 5)>, <11, (14, 1, 6)>, <11, (14, 5, 6)>, <11, (1, 5, 6)>.
