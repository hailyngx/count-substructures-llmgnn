Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 3) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 0) (22, 1) (22, 3) (9, 27) (26, 14) (26, 25) (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 29) (27, 9) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 8) (1, 22) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 13) (3, 22) (3, 1) (3, 28) (6, 24) (6, 11) (0, 22) (14, 26) (14, 24) (14, 21) (17, 29) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 2) (29, 15) (29, 17) (16, 17) (16, 10) (28, 3) (28, 25) (8, 27) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 21) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 20) (10, 16) (10, 19) (10, 4) (24, 6) (24, 14) (24, 12) (24, 2) (2, 17) (2, 24) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 2) (7, 20) (7, 23) (7, 25) (11, 1) (11, 6) (20, 19) (20, 7) (20, 21) (21, 27) (21, 14) (21, 5) (21, 20) (21, 4) (25, 26) (25, 28) (25, 7) (25, 18) (18, 15) (18, 1) (18, 25) (23, 13) (23, 7) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 21) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {22}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 11, 18, 19, 22}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 12, 17, 24}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 13, 22, 28}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 10, 21}
- Node 5: Neighbors {12, 17, 19, 21}
- Node 6: Neighbors {11, 24}
- Node 7: Neighbors {20, 23, 25}
- Node 8: Neighbors {27}
- Node 9: Neighbors {27}
- Node 10: Neighbors {4, 16, 19}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 5, 24}
- Node 13: Neighbors {3, 22, 23}
- Node 14: Neighbors {21, 24, 26}
- Node 15: Neighbors {18, 27, 29}
- Node 16: Neighbors {10, 17}
- Node 17: Neighbors {2, 5, 16, 29}
- Node 18: Neighbors {1, 15, 25}
- Node 19: Neighbors {1, 5, 10, 20}
- Node 20: Neighbors {7, 19, 21}
- Node 21: Neighbors {4, 5, 14, 20, 27}
- Node 22: Neighbors {1, 3, 13}
- Node 23: Neighbors {7, 13}
- Node 24: Neighbors {2, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 25: Neighbors {7, 18, 26, 28}
- Node 26: Neighbors {14, 25}
- Node 27: Neighbors {8, 15, 21}
- Node 28: Neighbors {3, 25}
- Node 29: Neighbors {15, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star

There are 21 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final number is [21].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 3, 19>
- <2, 4, 10>
- <3, 1, 22>
- <4, 2, 21>
- <5, 12, 17>
- <7, 20, 21>
- <10, 4, 16>
- <12, 2, 24>
- <13, 3, 22>
- <14, 21, 24>
- <15, 18, 27>
- <16, 10, 17>
- <17, 2, 5>
- <18, 1, 25>
- <19, 1, 5>
- <21, 4, 27>
- <22, 1, 13>
- <24, 12, 14>
- <25, 18, 26>
- <26, 14, 25>
- <27, 15, 21>
