Response:
The 3-stars formed in this graph can be found by examining each node with its neighbors.

For node 0, the neighbors are: {8, 18, 24, 29, 12}. There are 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0. 

For node 1, the neighbors are: {21}. There are only 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is possible with node 1.

For node 2, the neighbors are: {15, 19}. There are 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is possible with node 2.

For node 3, the neighbors are: {15, 7, 14}. There are 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is possible with node 3, <3, (15, 7, 14)>.

For node 4, the neighbors are: {19, 29}. There are 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is possible with node 4.

For node 5, the neighbors are: {14, 27, 20}. There are 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is possible with node 5, <5, (14, 27, 20)>.

For node 6, the neighbors are: {29, 27}. There are 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is possible with node 6.

For node 7, the neighbors are: {3, 8, 14, 24}. There are 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7.

For node 8, the neighbors are: {0, 28, 17, 7}. There are 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8.

For node 9, the neighbors are: {28}. There is only 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is possible with node 9.

For node 10, the neighbors are: {21}. There is only 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is possible with node 10.

For node 11, the neighbors are: {24, 20}. There are 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is possible with node 11.

For node 12, the neighbors are: {14, 0}. There are 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is possible with node 12.

For node 13, the neighbors are: {17, 16, 24}. There are 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is possible with node 13, <13, (17, 16, 24)>.

For node 14, the neighbors are: {3, 7, 12, 5}. There are 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 14.

For node 15, the neighbors are: {3, 26, 2}. There are 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is possible with node 15, <15, (3, 26, 2)>.

For node 16, the neighbors are: {13, 19, 25}. There are 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is possible with node 16, <16, (13, 19, 25)>.

For node 17, the neighbors are: {21, 8, 13, 27}. There are 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 17.

For node 18, the neighbors are: {19, 20, 0}. There are 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is possible with node 18, <18, (19, 20, 0)>.

For node 19, the neighbors are: {4, 18, 2, 16}. There are 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 19.

For node 20, the neighbors are: {28, 18, 11, 5}. There are 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 20.

For node 21, the neighbors are: {1, 10, 25, 17}. There are 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 21.

For node 22, the neighbors are: {23, 24}. There are 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is possible with node 22.

For node 23, the neighbors are: {22}. There is only 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is possible with node 23.

For node 24, the neighbors are: {22, 13, 11, 7, 0}. There are 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 24.

For node 25, the neighbors are: {21, 26, 16}. There are 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is possible with node 25, <25, (21, 26, 16)>.

For node 26, the neighbors are: {15, 28, 29, 25}. There are 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 26.

For node 27, the neighbors are: {6, 17, 5}. There are 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is possible with node 27, <27, (6, 17, 5)>.

For node 28, the neighbors are: {9, 8, 26, 20}. There are 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 28.

For node 29, the neighbors are: {6, 4, 26, 0}. There are 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 29.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars, we have a total of 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 102.

So, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [102].
