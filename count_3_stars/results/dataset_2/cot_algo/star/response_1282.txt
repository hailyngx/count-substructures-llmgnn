Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 9) (4, 12) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 10) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 15) (0, 4) (0, 2) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 19) (9, 12) (9, 18) (9, 14) (1, 2) (1, 5) (19, 7) (19, 16) (19, 17) (5, 3) (5, 1) (8, 3) (8, 16) (8, 10) (6, 4) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 15) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 10) (15, 11) (15, 14) (15, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (10, 18) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 10, 14
- Node 3: 5, 8, 11
- Node 4: 0, 6, 12, 18
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 11, 12, 19
- Node 8: 3, 10, 16
- Node 9: 12, 14, 18
- Node 10: 2, 8, 18
- Node 11: 3, 7, 15
- Node 12: 4, 7, 9, 13, 17
- Node 13: 12, 16
- Node 14: 2, 9, 15
- Node 15: 11, 14, 17
- Node 16: 8, 13, 17, 19
- Node 17: 12, 15, 16, 19
- Node 18: 4, 9, 10
- Node 19: 7, 16, 17

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2, 10, 14 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 12, 17, 19 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4, 9, 18 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 3, 5, 8 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 11, 15, 17 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star

Calculate the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the final answer is [8], and the unique 3-stars are:
<2, 10, 14>, <12, 17, 19> (appears 4 times), <4, 9, 18>, <3, 5, 8>, <11, 15, 17>.
