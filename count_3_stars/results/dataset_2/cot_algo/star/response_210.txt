Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 1) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 4) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 6) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 9, 12}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 10}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 6: {10, 14}
- Node 7: {5, 8, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {4, 6, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 11: {4, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 8, 10}
- Node 14: {2, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with the leaves (5, 13, 14). <8, (5, 13, 14)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with the leaves (1, 5, 10). <13, (1, 5, 10)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with the leaves (4, 7, 11). <10, (4, 7, 11)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with the leaves (5, 8, 10). <7, (5, 8, 10)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with the leaves (1, 4, 7). <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with the leaves (1, 9, 11). <12, (1, 9, 11)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with the leaves (4, 5, 13). <1, (4, 5, 13)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with the leaves (1, 5, 10). <4, (1, 5, 10)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with the leaves (2, 6, 8). <14, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
