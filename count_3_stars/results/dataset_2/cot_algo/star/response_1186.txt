Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 2) (7, 13) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 1) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 10) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 1) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 10}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 7: {2, 13}
- Node 8: {6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {9, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {4, 11, 10, 6, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 5, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 9, 10}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <4, (1, 12, 13)>, <4, (2, 13, 14)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <6, (0, 2, 12)>, <6, (2, 8, 10)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <9, (3, 10, 14)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <10, (1, 12, 14)>, <10, (3, 6, 14)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <12, (4, 11, 13)>, <12, (6, 10, 14)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <13, (1, 4, 5)>, <13, (4, 7, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [12].
