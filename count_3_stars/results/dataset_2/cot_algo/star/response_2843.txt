Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 21) (16, 7) (16, 24) (16, 17) (16, 8) (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 18) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 27) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 17) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 10) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 14) (1, 10) (22, 6) (22, 5) (23, 7) (23, 29) (12, 2) (12, 10) (27, 9) (27, 25) (27, 4) (27, 17) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 8) (20, 1) (20, 0) (20, 18) (14, 1) (14, 0) (19, 26) (19, 2) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 8) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 7) (4, 27) (4, 15) (15, 4) (15, 13) (7, 16) (7, 23) (7, 28) (7, 24) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 21) (24, 16) (24, 7) (17, 16) (17, 3) (17, 27) (13, 25) (13, 15) (13, 29) (5, 22) (5, 18) (5, 21) (18, 6) (18, 20) (18, 5) (18, 10) (10, 25) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 18) (29, 23) (29, 0) (29, 13) (29, 21) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 26) (21, 11) (21, 2) (21, 5) (21, 29) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {20, 14, 29, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 20, 14, 10}
- Node 2: {12, 19, 21}
- Node 3: {1, 28, 17}
- Node 4: {27, 15}
- Node 5: {22, 18, 21}
- Node 6: {9, 22, 18, 8}
- Node 7: {16, 23, 28, 24}
- Node 8: {6, 0, 26, 16}
- Node 9: {6, 27}
- Node 10: {25, 1, 12, 18}
- Node 11: {21}
- Node 12: {2, 10}
- Node 13: {25, 15, 29}
- Node 14: {1, 0}
- Node 15: {4, 13}
- Node 16: {8, 7, 24, 17}
- Node 17: {16, 3, 27}
- Node 18: {6, 5, 10}
- Node 19: {26, 2}
- Node 20: {0, 1}
- Node 21: {5, 2, 29, 11}
- Node 22: {6, 5}
- Node 23: {7, 29}
- Node 24: {16, 7}
- Node 25: {10, 1, 13}
- Node 26: {19, 8, 28}
- Node 27: {9, 17, 4}
- Node 28: {3, 26, 7}
- Node 29: {23, 21, 13, 0}

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars centered at each node:

- Node 0, 1, 15, 18, 21, 25, and 29 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they each form 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 6, 8, 10, 13, 16, 17, and 28 have more than 3 neighbors, so we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each:
  - Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up all the unique 3-stars, we get: 
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 24

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 14, 20>, <1, 3, 10>, <15, 13, 29>, <18, 6, 10>, <21, 2, 5>, <25, 10, 1>, <29, 0, 23>, <6, 22, 8>, <8, 26, 16>, <17, 16, 27>, <28, 26, 3>, <6, 9, 27>, <1, 14, 0>, <18, 21, 5>, <10, 12, 25>, <29, 21, 23>, <8, 0, 26>, <16, 24, 7>, <2, 19, 21>, <13, 25, 15>, <16, 8, 7>, <6, 18, 5>, <16, 17, 27>, <28, 7, 3>.
