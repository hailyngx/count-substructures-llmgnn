Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 8, 2, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 8, 0}
- Node 3: {6, 1, 0}
- Node 4: {9, 6, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 1}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 3, 4, 8, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 1, 8, 0}
- Node 8: {6, 2, 0, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0, Node 6, and Node 9 have more than three neighbors.
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 35 + 4 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [49], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
