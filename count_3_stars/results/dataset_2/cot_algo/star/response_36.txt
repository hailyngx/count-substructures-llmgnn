Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 7}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \text{inom}(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \text{inom}(6, 3) = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \text{inom}(2, 3) = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Summing up the 3-stars formed by each node: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 55

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
