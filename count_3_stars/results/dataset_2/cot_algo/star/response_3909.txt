Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 4, 5, 8
Node 1: 3, 6, 9
Node 2: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 3: 1, 2, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 2, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 9
Node 6: 1, 2, 7, 9
Node 7: 2, 4, 6
Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 4
Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Next, we will identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

Node 2 forms a 3-star with the following sets of nodes:
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 9>

Node 4 forms a 3-star with the following set of nodes:
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Node 6 forms a 3-star with the following set of nodes:
<6, 1, 9>
<6, 2, 7>
<6, 2, 9>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars, we find 12 in total. Therefore, the final answer is [12].
