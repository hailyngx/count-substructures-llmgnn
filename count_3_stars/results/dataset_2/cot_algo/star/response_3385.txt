Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 1) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 2) (3, 25) (3, 27) (25, 13) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 9) (23, 22) (23, 29) (23, 19) (2, 22) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 24) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 20) (19, 23) (19, 29) (19, 14) (19, 27) (26, 20) (26, 6) (9, 22) (9, 25) (9, 20) (11, 28) (11, 29) (28, 8) (28, 11) (28, 17) (28, 12) (28, 27) (6, 26) (6, 21) (6, 4) (21, 6) (21, 5) (7, 25) (10, 12) (10, 20) (15, 17) (4, 6) (4, 27) (4, 1) (27, 3) (27, 19) (27, 28) (27, 4) (27, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 24) (12, 28) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 0) (16, 27) (16, 24) (17, 28) (17, 15) (17, 12) (24, 18) (24, 1) (24, 16) (14, 19) (14, 5) (20, 2) (20, 8) (20, 26) (20, 9) (20, 10) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 5) (29, 23) (29, 19) (29, 11) (5, 21) (5, 14) (5, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 12}
- Node 1: {4, 13, 24}
- Node 2: {0, 8, 18, 20, 22}
- Node 3: {7, 25, 27}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 27}
- Node 5: {0, 14, 21}
- Node 6: {4, 21, 26}
- Node 7: {3, 25}
- Node 8: {2, 20, 28}
- Node 9: {20, 22, 25}
- Node 10: {12, 20}
- Node 11: {28, 29}
- Node 12: {0, 10, 17, 28}
- Node 13: {1, 22, 25}
- Node 14: {5, 19}
- Node 15: {17}
- Node 16: {24, 27}
- Node 17: {12, 15, 28}
- Node 18: {2, 24}
- Node 19: {14, 23, 27, 29}
- Node 20: {2, 9, 10, 26, 8}
- Node 21: {5, 6}
- Node 22: {2, 9, 13, 23}
- Node 23: {19, 22, 29}
- Node 24: {1, 16, 18}
- Node 25: {3, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 26: {6, 20}
- Node 27: {3, 4, 16, 19, 28}
- Node 28: {8, 11, 12, 17, 27}
- Node 29: {11, 19, 23}

Next, let's identify which nodes have at least 3 neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Each node with 3 neighbors contributes 1 3-star, so the total number of 3-stars is 26.

Therefore, the final answer is [26], and the unique 3-stars are as follows:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <1, 4, 13>
- <3, 7, 25>
- <4, 1, 27>
- <5, 0, 21>
- <6, 4, 21>
- <7, 3, 25>
- <8, 2, 20>
- <9, 20, 22>
- <10, 12, 20>
- <11, 28, 29>
- <12, 0, 17>
- <13, 1, 25>
- <14, 5, 19>
- <16, 24, 27>
- <17, 12, 28>
- <18, 2, 24>
- <19, 14, 27>
- <20, 2, 9>
- <22, 2, 9>
- <23, 19, 29>
- <24, 1, 16>
- <25, 3, 9>
- <26, 6, 20>
- <27, 4, 16>
- <28, 11, 17>
- <29, 11, 19>
