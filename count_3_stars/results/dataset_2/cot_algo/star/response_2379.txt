Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 5) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (2, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 1) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 4) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we can determine the 3-stars formed within this graph by following the procedure outlined above. 

First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
1. Node 0 neighbors: {1, 3, 4}
2. Node 1 neighbors: {0, 7, 8, 13}
3. Node 2 neighbors: {4, 7, 13}
4. Node 3 neighbors: {0, 4, 10, 11, 14}
5. Node 4 neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 9, 14}
6. Node 5 neighbors: {7, 10, 11, 13}
7. Node 6 neighbors: {9, 10, 12, 14}
8. Node 7 neighbors: {1, 2, 5, 12}
9. Node 8 neighbors: {1, 9, 12}
10. Node 9 neighbors: {4, 6, 8, 11, 12}
11. Node 10 neighbors: {3, 5, 6, 11, 12}
12. Node 11 neighbors: {3, 5, 9, 10}
13. Node 12 neighbors: {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
14. Node 13 neighbors: {1, 2, 5}
15. Node 14 neighbors: {3, 4, 6}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there is 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there is 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there is 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there is 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there is 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there is 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there is 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so there is 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there is 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so there is 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 7, 8, 13>
<3, 10, 11, 14>
<4, 9, 12, 14>
<5, 10, 11, 13>
<6, 9, 10, 12>
<7, 12, 1, 2>
<9, 11, 3, 5>
