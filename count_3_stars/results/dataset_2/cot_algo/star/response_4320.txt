Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 14) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 0) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}.

For each node, let's find its neighbors:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 2: {8, 10, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 9, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 6, 11}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 6, 10}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 8, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 14: {0, 6, 12}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars, we get a total of 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 65.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [65].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, 4, 9>, <1, 9, 10>, <1, 9, 11>, <1, 9, 4>, <1, 10, 11>, <3, 11, 12>, <3, 11, 13>, <3, 5, 13>, <3, 9, 13>, <5, 6, 7>, <8, 0, 12>, <8, 0, 13>, <8, 0, 14>, <8, 2, 12>, <8, 2, 0>, <8, 4, 9>, <9, 13, 7>, <10, 1, 11>, <10, 2, 6>, <11, 1, 3>
