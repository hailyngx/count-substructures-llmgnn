Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 14) (1, 10) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 15) (21, 29) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 13) (5, 6) (5, 24) (22, 26) (22, 24) (22, 20) (22, 29) (22, 7) (26, 22) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 17) (7, 22) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 17) (25, 7) (25, 23) (10, 1) (15, 21) (15, 23) (15, 28) (11, 9) (11, 20) (23, 25) (23, 15) (23, 2) (23, 24) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 27) (14, 1) (14, 26) (14, 7) (24, 5) (24, 22) (24, 23) (24, 16) (17, 26) (17, 7) (17, 27) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 28) (0, 18) (0, 19) (3, 0) (3, 4) (16, 24) (16, 20) (28, 15) (28, 0) (28, 13) (2, 26) (2, 7) (2, 23) (12, 21) (12, 8) (20, 22) (20, 11) (20, 16) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 13) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 4) (29, 21) (29, 22) (13, 9) (13, 28) (13, 4) (18, 0) (27, 8) (27, 17) 

Response:
First, we'll create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: 21, 14, 10
21: 1, 12, 15, 29
6: 9, 5, 19
9: 6, 8, 0, 11, 13
5: 6, 24
22: 26, 24, 20, 29, 7
26: 22, 14, 2, 17
7: 22, 25, 14, 2, 17
25: 7, 23
10: 1
15: 21, 23, 28
11: 9, 20
23: 25, 15, 2, 24
8: 9, 12, 27
14: 1, 26, 7
24: 5, 22, 23, 16
17: 26, 7, 27
0: 9, 3, 28, 18, 19
3: 0, 4
16: 24, 20
28: 15, 0, 13
2: 26, 7, 23
12: 21, 8
20: 22, 11, 16
4: 3, 19, 13
19: 6, 0, 4
29: 21, 22
13: 9, 28, 4
18: 0
27: 8, 17

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we'll count the number of unique 3-stars it participates in:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it participates in 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it participates in 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so it participates in 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it participates in 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it participates in 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it participates in 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it participates in 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars.

Total unique 3-stars: [6]

Unique 3-stars:
<21, (1, 12, 15)>
<9, (6, 8, 11)>
<22, (26, 24, 7)>
<26, (22, 14, 17)>
<7, (22, 25, 14)>
<0, (9, 3, 28)>
