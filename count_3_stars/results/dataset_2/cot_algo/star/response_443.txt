Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 5, 2, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 9, 0, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 8, 9, 0}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 5}
- Node 4: {7, 9}
- Node 5: {7, 3, 2, 0}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 9, 8, 5}
- Node 8: {7, 1, 6, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 1, 2}

Next, we will identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-star graphs formed by each such node:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Adding up the total number of 3-star graphs, we get 46. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in this graph is [46], and the unique 3-star graphs found are:

- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <7, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (1, 2, 7)>
