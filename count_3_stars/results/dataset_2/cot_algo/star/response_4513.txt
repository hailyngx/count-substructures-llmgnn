Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 

The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 8

Now, we need to find the 3-stars. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors can potentially form 3-stars. 

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 2: <2, (3, 6, 0)>
- Node 5: <5, (4, 8, 0)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 6, 8)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{2}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{1}{3} = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [0].
