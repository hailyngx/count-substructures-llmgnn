Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 6) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 12) (11, 15) (17, 18) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (19, 4) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 16) (13, 3) (0, 1) (0, 16) (16, 19) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 10) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 14) (12, 11) (12, 5) (10, 16) (10, 8) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 15) (14, 18) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 14) (18, 8) (8, 16) (8, 10) (8, 18) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 16}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 19}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 12, 14, 19}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 15}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 9, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {10, 16, 18}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7}
- Node 10: Neighbors {8, 16}
- Node 11: Neighbors {3, 12, 15, 18, 19}
- Node 12: Neighbors {5, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors {3}
- Node 14: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 15, 18}
- Node 15: Neighbors {6, 11, 14}
- Node 16: Neighbors {0, 8, 10}
- Node 17: Neighbors {18}
- Node 18: Neighbors {8, 11, 14, 17}
- Node 19: Neighbors {4, 5, 11, 16}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 7} <1, (3, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 6, 11} <3, (1, 6, 11)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 14, 19} <5, (2, 14, 19)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 4, 15} <6, (3, 4, 15)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with neighbors {15, 18, 19} <11, (15, 18, 19)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 15, 18} <14, (7, 15, 18)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 8, 10} <16, (0, 8, 10)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [7] 3-stars in this graph.
