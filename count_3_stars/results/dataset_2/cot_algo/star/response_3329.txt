Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 9) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 11) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 10) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 6, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 4: {3, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {5, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 12: {1, 9}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {4, 6, 10, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, and 14 have three or more neighbors.
- The total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes is \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \).

Thus, the final answer is [56].

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (0, 12, 9)>
<5, (1, 11, 7)>
<7, (2, 9, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, 13)>
<9, (1, 12, 13)>
<11, (1, 5, 8)>
<13, (8, 10, 14)>
<14, (4, 10, 13)>
