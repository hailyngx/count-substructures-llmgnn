Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 44.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>.

So, the final answer is [44].
