Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 6) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {9, 7, 3}
Node 1: {5, 6, 14, 12}
Node 2: {4, 6}
Node 3: {4, 13, 0, 6, 12}
Node 4: {5, 14, 3, 2}
Node 5: {9, 12, 1, 4, 14}
Node 6: {8, 13, 2, 1, 10, 3}
Node 7: {0, 11, 10, 13}
Node 8: {13, 6}
Node 9: {5, 10, 13, 0}
Node 10: {9, 7, 13, 6}
Node 11: {7, 12}
Node 12: {5, 1, 14, 11, 3}
Node 13: {9, 7, 8, 3, 10, 6}
Node 14: {5, 4, 1, 12}

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 86 3-stars. So, the final answer is [86].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (4, 13, 6)>
<9, (10, 13, 6)>
<10, (9, 13, 6)>
<13, (9, 7, 6)>
<1, (5, 12, 14)>
<3, (0, 12, 6)>
<5, (9, 12, 14)>
<6, (1, 10, 13)>
