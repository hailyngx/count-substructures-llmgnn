Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors = {5, 6, 2}
- Node 1: neighbors = {4, 8, 6, 2}
- Node 2: neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 1, 0}
- Node 3: neighbors = {9, 4, 8, 6}
- Node 4: neighbors = {5, 9, 8, 3, 1, 2}
- Node 5: neighbors = {9, 2, 4, 0}
- Node 6: neighbors = {7, 1, 3, 0}
- Node 7: neighbors = {9, 6, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 1}
- Node 9: neighbors = {5, 2, 3, 7}

Now, let's check for 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 3 or more neighbors, 3-stars possible
- Node 1: has 4 neighbors, 3-stars possible
- Node 2: has 5 neighbors, 3-stars possible
- Node 3: has 4 neighbors, 3-stars possible
- Node 4: has 6 neighbors, 3-stars possible
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors, 3-stars possible
- Node 6: has 4 neighbors, 3-stars possible
- Node 7: has 3 or more neighbors, 3-stars possible
- Node 8: has 4 neighbors, 3-stars possible
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors, 3-stars possible

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{0}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{0}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 0 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <6, 1, 7>
- <7, 8, 9>
