Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 5) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 9) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 13) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 16) (6, 12) (2, 0) (2, 16) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 19) (16, 19) (16, 6) (16, 2) (12, 11) (12, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 13, 2, 14
- Node 1: 0, 3, 8, 15, 17
- Node 2: 0, 16
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 4, 15, 19
- Node 6: 12, 15, 16, 17, 19
- Node 7: 8, 11, 13, 17
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4, 19
- Node 11: 7, 12
- Node 12: 6, 11
- Node 13: 0, 7, 15
- Node 14: 0, 17
- Node 15: 1, 5, 6, 13, 17
- Node 16: 2, 6, 19
- Node 17: 1, 6, 7, 14, 15
- Node 19: 5, 6, 9, 16

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 5 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 5 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- With 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- With 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 13>
- <0, 1, 14>
- <0, 4, 13>
- <0, 13, 14>
- <1, 6, 15>
- <1, 6, 17>
- <1, 7, 15>
- <1, 7, 17>
- <1, 15, 17>
- <6, 7, 17>
- <0, 4, 13>
- <0, 4, 14>
- <13, 15, 17>
- <6, 15, 17>
