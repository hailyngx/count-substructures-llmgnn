Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 19) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 18) (3, 5) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 7) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 1) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 12) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 12) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 19) (19, 16) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 6) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 12) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 19) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

1: 5, 13, 17, 12
2: 11, 10, 19
3: 5, 15
4: 15, 8, 13
5: 13, 1, 3
6: 8, 12, 19
7: 17, 18, 19
8: 9, 4, 6, 12
9: 8, 18
10: 0, 2
11: 16, 2
12: 8, 1, 14, 18, 6
13: 5, 4, 1
14: 18, 12
15: 3, 4
16: 11, 0, 19
17: 1, 0, 7
18: 9, 14, 7, 12
19: 16, 6, 7, 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

1, 4, 5, 8, 12, 13, 18, 19

Calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 38 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (5, 13, 17)>
<4, (15, 8, 13)>
<5, (13, 1, 3)>
<8, (9, 4, 8)>
<12, (1, 12, 18)>
<13, (5, 4, 1)>
<18, (9, 7, 18)>
<19, (6, 7, 19)>
