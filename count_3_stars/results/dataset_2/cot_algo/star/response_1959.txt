Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can determine the number of 3-stars formed in this graph using the method described.

Let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 5, 8}

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed. Since node 1 has 4 neighbors, node 5 has 5 neighbors, and node 8 has 4 neighbors, we can calculate the combinations for these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 18 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
