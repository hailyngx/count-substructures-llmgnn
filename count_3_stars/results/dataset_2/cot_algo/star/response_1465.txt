Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 5) (12, 11) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {3, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 1}
- Node 8: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 8, 11}
- Node 10: {5, 6, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 11: {6, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {5, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 6, 13}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 and Node 6 have 6 or more neighbors, so each contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 7 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 35 = 37 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [37] and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<1, (2, 7, 14)>, <6, (1, 10, 14)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 14)>, <7, (2, 8, 10)>, <7, (8, 9, 10)>, <7, (1, 9, 10)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 9, 10)>, <7, (1, 6, 10)>, <7, (1, 6, 13)>, <7, (1, 2, 10)>, <7, (1, 2, 14)>, <7, (2, 6, 14)>, <7, (6, 10, 14)>.
