Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 6) (14, 17) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 2) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 14) (13, 10) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 19) (5, 7) (5, 18) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 10) (19, 1) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 0) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 19) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 6) (16, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 4) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 5) (18, 9) (6, 15) (6, 0) (1, 8) (1, 19) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 17) (4, 16) (4, 11) 

Response:
Calculating the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {1, 6, 9, 11}
Node 1: {0, 8, 19}
Node 2: {3, 14, 17}
Node 3: {2, 15, 18}
Node 4: {11, 16}
Node 5: {7, 18}
Node 6: {0, 15}
Node 7: {5, 12, 15}
Node 8: {1, 11}
Node 9: {0, 11, 18}
Node 10: {13, 15, 19}
Node 11: {0, 4, 8, 9}
Node 12: {7, 18, 19}
Node 13: {10, 14}
Node 14: {2, 13, 17}
Node 15: {3, 6, 7, 10, 18}
Node 16: {4}
Node 17: {2, 14, 19}
Node 18: {3, 5, 9, 12, 15}
Node 19: {1, 10, 12, 17}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 40

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 8, 19>
<2, 3, 14>
<3, 15, 18>
<7, 12, 15>
<9, 11, 18>
<10, 13, 15>
<11, 0, 4>
<12, 7, 18>
<14, 2, 13>
<15, 7, 10>
<17, 2, 14>
<18, 5, 9>
<19, 1, 10>
