Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 10) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 0) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: {1, 6, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 10}
- Node 2: {7, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {3, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 10}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 6, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 4, 5, 13}
- Node 11: {3, 4, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {7, 9, 10}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 4, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the 3-stars formed by each node, we get: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 48 \).

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 12>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 8, 12>
<0, 9, 12>
<2, 7, 13>
<2, 7, 14>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 10>
<3, 4, 14>
<3, 5, 10>
<3, 7, 13>
<3, 10, 13>
<4, 10, 13>
<6, 7, 12>
<6, 9, 13>
<6, 12, 14>
<7, 13, 14>
<8, 9, 13>
<8, 12, 14>
<12, 11, 14>
