Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 28) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 20) (14, 3) (14, 27) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 23) (7, 21) (7, 12) (21, 7) (21, 29) (21, 24) (20, 9) (20, 25) (25, 17) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 23) (25, 12) (0, 10) (0, 28) (0, 19) (12, 7) (12, 25) (12, 22) (29, 9) (29, 17) (29, 21) (29, 11) (26, 28) (26, 16) (26, 6) (28, 5) (28, 0) (28, 26) (28, 13) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 22) (18, 5) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 6) (8, 22) (13, 25) (13, 28) (13, 3) (16, 26) (16, 3) (16, 27) (16, 15) (10, 0) (10, 4) (22, 12) (22, 19) (22, 8) (1, 11) (1, 23) (11, 29) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 2) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 16) (24, 21) (24, 8) (24, 23) (27, 14) (27, 16) (15, 5) (15, 16) (2, 11) (2, 4) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 1) (23, 24) (6, 26) (6, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {10, 19, 28}
- Node 1: {11, 23}
- Node 2: {4, 11}
- Node 3: {13, 14, 16}
- Node 4: {2, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {9, 15, 18, 19, 28}
- Node 6: {8, 26}
- Node 7: {12, 21}
- Node 8: {6, 8, 19, 22, 24}
- Node 9: {5, 20, 29}
- Node 10: {0, 4}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 4, 29}
- Node 12: {7, 22, 25}
- Node 13: {3, 25, 28}
- Node 14: {3, 27}
- Node 15: {5, 16}
- Node 16: {3, 15, 26, 27}
- Node 17: {23, 25, 29}
- Node 18: {5}
- Node 19: {0, 5, 8, 22}
- Node 20: {9, 25}
- Node 21: {7, 24, 29}
- Node 22: {8, 12, 19}
- Node 23: {1, 17, 24, 25}
- Node 24: {8, 21, 23}
- Node 25: {12, 17, 20, 23}
- Node 26: {6, 16, 28}
- Node 27: {14, 16}
- Node 28: {0, 5, 13, 26}
- Node 29: {9, 11, 17, 21}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors that form a 3-star:
- Node 0: <0, (10, 19, 28)>
- Node 4: <4, (10, 11, 2)>
- Node 5: <5, (9, 15, 28)>, <5, (9, 18, 19)>, <5, (15, 18, 28)>, <5, (18, 19, 28)>, <5, (15, 19, 28)>
- Node 16: <16, (3, 15, 26)>
- Node 23: <23, (1, 17, 24)>
- Node 25: <25, (12, 17, 23)>

There are 8 unique 3-stars formed in this graph, so the total number of 3-stars is [8].
