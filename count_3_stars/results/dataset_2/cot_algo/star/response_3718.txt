Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 3) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 14) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 1) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 9, 7, 3, 11
- Node 1: 8, 12, 13, 14
- Node 2: 10, 14, 11
- Node 3: 5, 9, 8, 0, 11
- Node 4: 5, 8, 10, 6
- Node 5: 13, 8, 4, 3
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 12, 0, 6, 10, 13
- Node 8: 5, 9, 4, 3, 1
- Node 9: 8, 14, 3, 0
- Node 10: 4, 7, 2
- Node 11: 12, 0, 2, 3
- Node 12: 7, 13, 14, 11, 1
- Node 13: 5, 7, 12, 1
- Node 14: 9, 12, 2, 1

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0: [3 stars]
    - <0, (9, 7, 3)>
- Node 1: [3 stars]
    - <1, (8, 12, 13)>
    - <1, (8, 14, 1)>
    - <1, (12, 13, 1)>
    - <1, (12, 14, 1)>
- Node 3: [3 stars]
    - <3, (5, 9, 8)>
    - <3, (5, 8, 4)>
- Node 4: [1 star]
    - <4, (5, 8, 4)>
- Node 5: [3 stars]
    - <5, (13, 8, 5)>
- Node 7: [3 stars]
    - <7, (12, 13, 7)>
- Node 8: [3 stars]
    - <8, (9, 4, 8)>
- Node 12: [3 stars]
    - <12, (13, 7, 12)>
- Node 14: [3 stars]
    - <14, (9, 12, 14)>
  
Total number of 3-stars: [14]
