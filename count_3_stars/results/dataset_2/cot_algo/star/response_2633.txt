Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 19) (25, 0) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 10) (22, 29) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 14) (23, 29) (23, 20) (1, 26) (1, 19) (1, 27) (1, 18) (26, 1) (26, 10) (20, 23) (20, 18) (20, 5) (20, 11) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 17) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 17) (8, 7) (13, 21) (13, 7) (5, 20) (5, 18) (11, 20) (16, 19) (16, 27) (28, 0) (28, 19) (28, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 21) (12, 10) (12, 21) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (17, 25) (17, 23) (17, 2) (17, 8) (19, 25) (19, 22) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 28) (10, 22) (10, 26) (10, 12) (27, 1) (27, 16) (21, 13) (21, 4) (21, 12) (21, 0) (0, 25) (0, 28) (0, 4) (0, 21) (24, 3) (24, 14) (29, 22) (29, 23) (29, 8) (14, 23) (14, 4) (14, 24) (18, 1) (18, 20) (18, 5) (18, 28) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 21, 25, 28}
- Node 1: {18, 19, 26, 27}
- Node 2: {3, 8, 17}
- Node 3: {2, 24, 25}
- Node 4: {0, 14, 21}
- Node 5: {18, 20}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {6, 8, 13}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 7, 17, 29}
- Node 9: {6}
- Node 10: {12, 22, 26}
- Node 11: {20}
- Node 12: {10, 21}
- Node 13: {7, 21}
- Node 14: {4, 23, 24}
- Node 16: {19, 27}
- Node 17: {2, 8, 23, 25}
- Node 18: {1, 5, 20, 28}
- Node 19: {1, 16, 22, 25, 28}
- Node 20: {5, 11, 18, 23}
- Node 21: {4, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 22: {10, 19, 23, 29}
- Node 23: {14, 17, 20, 22, 29}
- Node 24: {3, 14, 25}
- Node 25: {0, 3, 17, 19, 24}
- Node 26: {1, 10}
- Node 27: {1, 16}
- Node 28: {0, 18, 19}
- Node 29: {8, 22, 23}

Next, we look for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-star graphs. In this case, nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 25 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-star graphs they are a part of:

- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 1 3-star is guaranteed.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we can use \( \binom{n}{3} \) to calculate the total number of 3-stars.

Calculating:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: No 3-star can be formed
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: No 3-star can be formed
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: No 3-star can be formed
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up all these 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (4, 21, 28)>
- <1, (18, 26, 27)>
- <3, (2, 24, 25)>
- <8, (6, 7, 17)>
- <17, (2, 8, 25)>
- <19, (1, 22, 28)>
- <20, (5, 18, 23)>
- <22, (10, 23, 29)>
- <23, (14, 17, 29)>
- <25, (0, 17, 19)>
