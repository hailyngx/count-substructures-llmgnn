Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following structure:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7.

From the given edges, the 3-star structures are as follows:

1. <0, (3, 4, 8)>
2. <1, (3, 7, 9)>
3. <1, (4, 7, 8)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 7)>
5. <6, (0, 1, 2)>
6. <8, (0, 1, 4)>

Counting these unique 3-star structures, we have a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
