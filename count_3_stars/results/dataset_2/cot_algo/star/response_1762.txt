Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 11) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 14) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 12) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 4, 14, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 10, 11, 13, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 12, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 11, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {8, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 9, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 6, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 5, 8, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 9, 13}

Now, let's identify which nodes form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 9, and Node 14 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars.
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 34

Therefore, the answer is [34].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 14)>
<3, (0, 9, 13)>
<9, (3, 6, 14)>
<14, (0, 7, 13)>
