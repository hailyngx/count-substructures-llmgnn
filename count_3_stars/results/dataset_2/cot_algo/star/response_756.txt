Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 6) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 8) (17, 18) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 15) (0, 5) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 19) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 1) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 10) (7, 16) (7, 10) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 6) (3, 4) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 15) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 15) (10, 14) (10, 9) (10, 7) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 12) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 1) (1, 0) (1, 19) (1, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {0, 12, 19}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {5, 19}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {4}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {3, 11, 15}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 15, 19}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {8, 15, 16, 18}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {10, 16}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {6, 9, 16, 17}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {8, 10, 18}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {7, 9, 14}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {4, 12, 16}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {1, 11, 14, 15}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {15}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {10, 12, 19}
16. Node 15: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 12, 13}
17. Node 16: Neighbors {6, 7, 8, 11}
18. Node 17: Neighbors {8, 18}
19. Node 18: Neighbors {6, 9, 17}
20. Node 19: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 14}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 (Node 2)

Nodes with 4 neighbors: 3 (Nodes 0, 13, 18)

Nodes with 5 neighbors: 5 (Nodes 3, 7, 10, 13, 17)

Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{1}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 1 + 1 + 10 = 12 \)

Thus, we have a total of 12 unique 3-stars: <2, (5, 19, 1)>, <0, (5, 19, 1)>, <13, (15, 12, 14)>, <18, (9, 6, 8)>, <18, (9, 10, 6)>, <18, (9, 10, 7)>, <3, (4, 15, 6)>, <7, (10, 14, 16)>, <10, (14, 15, 12)>, <10, (14, 19, 1)>, <13, (15, 5, 19)>, <13, (15, 6, 12)>

Therefore, the final answer, rounded to the nearest whole number, is [12].
