Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 15) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 8) (12, 16) (12, 0) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 15) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 18) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 4) (18, 11) (18, 13) (18, 19) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 4) (9, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 15) (4, 16) (4, 19) (4, 5) (15, 17) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 8, 10}
- Node 2: {6, 15}
- Node 3: {1, 9, 11}
- Node 4: {5, 16, 19}
- Node 5: {4, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {6, 8, 16}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 6, 7, 17}
- Node 9: {3}
- Node 10: {1, 14, 19}
- Node 11: {3, 18, 19}
- Node 12: {0, 16}
- Node 13: {15, 16, 17, 18}
- Node 14: {10, 15}
- Node 15: {2, 13, 14, 17}
- Node 16: {4, 6, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 17: {8, 13, 15}
- Node 18: {11, 13, 19}
- Node 19: {4, 10, 11, 18}

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:

- Node 1: [1]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 8: [6]
- Node 10: [1]
- Node 11: [3]
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 15: [1]
- Node 16: [1]
- Node 17: [1]
- Node 18: [1]
- Node 19: [1]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 3, 8>
<3, 1, 11>
<4, 5, 8>
<6, 0, 12>
<7, 6, 8>
<8, 1, 10>
<8, 6, 7>
<8, 17, 15>
<10, 1, 14>
<11, 3, 19>
<13, 15, 17>
<16, 4, 19>
<17, 8, 13>
<18, 11, 19>
