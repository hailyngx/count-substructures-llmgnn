Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 10) (9, 1) (26, 16) (6, 14) (6, 29) (6, 3) (10, 9) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 27) (11, 13) (11, 25) (8, 15) (8, 7) (23, 4) (23, 0) (23, 28) (4, 23) (4, 22) (4, 16) (4, 14) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 28) (18, 13) (21, 28) (21, 5) (28, 23) (28, 18) (28, 21) (28, 24) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 14) (17, 29) (17, 19) (17, 22) (17, 27) (29, 6) (29, 17) (29, 25) (5, 18) (5, 21) (19, 17) (19, 1) (15, 8) (25, 11) (25, 29) (25, 22) (22, 4) (22, 17) (22, 25) (22, 24) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 16) (0, 23) (0, 2) (0, 18) (24, 28) (24, 22) (24, 1) (24, 20) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 13) (20, 24) (20, 16) (27, 11) (27, 17) (1, 9) (1, 19) (1, 24) (16, 26) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 3) (16, 20) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 18, 23}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 19, 24}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 16, 18}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 7, 16}
- Node 4: Neighbors {14, 16, 22, 23}
- Node 5: Neighbors {18, 21}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 14, 29}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7, 15}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 10}
- Node 10: Neighbors {9, 11}
- Node 11: Neighbors {10, 13, 25, 27}
- Node 12: Neighbors {7, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {7, 11, 14, 18}
- Node 14: Neighbors {4, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 15: Neighbors {8}
- Node 16: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 20, 26}
- Node 17: Neighbors {19, 22, 27, 29}
- Node 18: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 13, 28}
- Node 19: Neighbors {1, 17}
- Node 20: Neighbors {16, 24}
- Node 21: Neighbors {5, 28}
- Node 22: Neighbors {4, 17, 24, 25}
- Node 23: Neighbors {0, 4, 28}
- Node 24: Neighbors {1, 20, 22, 28}
- Node 25: Neighbors {11, 22, 29}
- Node 26: Neighbors {16}
- Node 27: Neighbors {11, 17}
- Node 28: Neighbors {18, 21, 23, 24}
- Node 29: Neighbors {6, 17, 25}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4, Node 14, Node 16, and Node 24 have 4 or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for them:
    - Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - <4, (14, 16, 23)>, <4, (14, 16, 22)>, <4, (14, 22, 23)>, <4, (16, 22, 23)>
    - Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - <14, (4, 6, 13)>, <14, (4, 6, 12)>, <14, (4, 13, 12)>, <14, (6, 13, 12)>
    - Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
        - <16, (2, 3, 4)>, <16, (2, 4, 26)>, <16, (3, 4, 20)>, <16, (3, 4, 16)>, <16, (3, 20, 26)>, <16, (4, 20, 22)>, <16, (4, 22, 25)>, <16, (4, 22, 16)>, <16, (20, 22, 24)>, <16, (20, 24, 26)>
    - Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - <24, (1, 20, 22)>, <24, (1, 20, 24)>, <24, (1, 22, 24)>, <24, (20, 22, 28)>
- Summing up, we have a total of 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 22 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [22].
