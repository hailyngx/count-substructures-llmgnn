The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 11) (22, 0) (22, 29) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (14, 17) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 28) (17, 11) (12, 27) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 24) (27, 6) (6, 7) (6, 27) (6, 28) (6, 11) (6, 16) (28, 17) (28, 6) (28, 21) (1, 26) (1, 16) (26, 13) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 20) (21, 13) (21, 28) (21, 18) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 18) (11, 22) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 3) (24, 27) (24, 26) (24, 8) (24, 2) (20, 26) (0, 22) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (10, 2) (10, 23) (10, 25) (23, 10) (23, 29) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 5) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 25) (5, 0) (5, 15) (5, 8) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 25) (25, 10) (25, 19) (25, 9) (8, 24) (8, 15) (8, 5) (2, 24) (2, 10) (29, 22) (29, 27) (29, 23) (16, 14) (16, 6) (16, 1) (18, 21) (18, 3)

Based on the provided graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first identify the neighbor set for each node:

1. Node 0 has neighbors: {22, 4, 7, 5}
2. Node 1 has neighbors: {26, 16}
3. Node 2 has neighbors: {24, 10}
4. Node 3 has neighbors: {11, 19, 18}
5. Node 4 has neighbors: {9, 0}
6. Node 5 has neighbors: {15, 0, 8}
7. Node 6 has neighbors: {7, 27, 28, 11, 16}
8. Node 7 has neighbors: {0, 6, 9}
9. Node 8 has neighbors: {24, 15, 5}
10. Node 9 has neighbors: {13, 4, 7, 25}
11. Node 10 has neighbors: {2, 23, 25}
12. Node 11 has neighbors: {22, 17, 6, 3}
13. Node 12 has neighbors: {27}
14. Node 13 has neighbors: {22, 26, 21, 9}
15. Node 14 has neighbors: {17, 16}
16. Node 15 has neighbors: {19, 8, 5}
17. Node 16 has neighbors: {14, 6, 1}
18. Node 17 has neighbors: {14, 28, 11}
19. Node 18 has neighbors: {21, 3}
20. Node 19 has neighbors: {3, 15, 25}
21. Node 20 has neighbors: {26}
22. Node 21 has neighbors: {13, 28, 18}
23. Node 22 has neighbors: {13, 11, 0, 29}
24. Node 23 has neighbors: {10, 29}
25. Node 24 has neighbors: {27, 26, 8, 2}
26. Node 25 has neighbors: {10, 19, 9}
27. Node 27 has neighbors: {12, 29, 24, 6}
28. Node 28 has neighbors: {17, 6, 21}
29. Node 29 has neighbors: {22, 27, 23}

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have exactly 3 or more neighbors from the neighbor sets:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <0, (22, 4, 7)>, <0, (22, 4, 5)>, <0, (22, 7, 5)>, <0, (4, 7, 5)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 8, 15)>
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <6, (7, 27, 28)>, <6, (7, 27, 11)>, <6, (7, 27, 16)>, <6, (7, 28, 11)>, <6, (7, 28, 16)>, <6, (7, 11, 16)>, <6, (27, 28, 11)>, <6, (27, 28, 16)>, <6, (27, 11, 16)>, <6, (28, 11, 16)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <9, (13, 4, 7)>, <9, (13, 4, 25)>, <9, (13, 7, 25)>, <9, (4, 7, 25)>
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <11, (22, 17, 6)>, <11, (22, 17, 3)>, <11, (22, 6, 3)>, <11, (17, 6, 3)>
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <13, (22, 26, 9)>, <13, (22, 26, 21)>, <13, (22, 9, 21)>, <13, (26, 9, 21)>
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <15, (5, 8, 19)>
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <16, (14, 6, 1)>
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <17, (14, 28, 11)>
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <19, (3, 15, 25)>
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <21, (13, 28, 18)>
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <24, (27, 26, 8)>, <24, (27, 26, 2)>, <24, (27, 8, 2)>, <24, (26, 8, 2)>
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <25, (10, 19, 9)>
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <28, (17, 6, 21)>
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <29, (22, 27, 23)>

Adding up all the unique 3-stars, we have a total of 27 3-stars formed by the given graph.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].
