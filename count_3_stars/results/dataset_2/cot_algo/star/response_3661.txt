Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {9, 3, 2}
- Node 1: {6, 9, 8, 5}
- Node 2: {9, 0, 7, 3}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 0, 2}
- Node 4: {6, 8, 5, 3}
- Node 5: {4, 8, 1, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 2}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 4, 5, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 2, 1, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 1, 6, 9 form a 3-star. <1, 6, 9>
Node 1, 8, 9 form a 3-star. <1, 8, 9>
Node 1, 5, 8 form a 3-star. <1, 5, 8>
Node 8, 6, 9 form a 3-star. <8, 6, 9>
Node 8, 5, 6 form a 3-star. <8, 5, 6>
Node 8, 5, 4 form a 3-star. <8, 5, 4>
Node 8, 4, 6 form a 3-star. <8, 4, 6>
Node 4, 6, 9 form a 3-star. <4, 6, 9>
Node 5, 4, 8 form a 3-star. <5, 4, 8>
Node 0, 9, 2 form a 3-star. <0, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
