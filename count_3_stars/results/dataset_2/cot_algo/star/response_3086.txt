Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 4) (16, 13) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 9) (10, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 19) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 15) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 6) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 5) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 0) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 15) (12, 10) (12, 14) (6, 11) (6, 17) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 9) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 7) (7, 2) (7, 14) (5, 10) (5, 15) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 3, 2, 9
Node 1: 17, 15, 8
Node 2: 13, 7, 0
Node 3: 17, 4, 0
Node 4: 11, 3, 18
Node 5: 10, 15
Node 6: 11, 17
Node 7: 2, 14
Node 8: 1, 13, 9, 19
Node 9: 10, 8, 18, 0
Node 10: 11, 12, 9, 5
Node 11: 10, 19, 6, 4
Node 12: 10, 14
Node 13: 16, 8, 2, 14
Node 14: 13, 12, 7
Node 15: 1, 18, 19, 5
Node 16: 13
Node 17: 1, 3, 6
Node 18: 4, 9, 15
Node 19: 11, 8, 15

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 12, 16

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

Node 5: 0 3-stars (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 6: 1 3-star
Node 12: 1 3-star
Node 16: 0 3-stars (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 = 2

Therefore, the final answer is [2] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (11, 17, 1)>
<12, (10, 14, 13)>
