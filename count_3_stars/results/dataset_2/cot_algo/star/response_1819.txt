Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 6) (14, 0) (14, 19) (17, 11) (17, 18) (17, 7) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 3) (13, 8) (2, 16) (2, 4) (2, 19) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 19) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 15) (12, 15) (12, 9) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 19) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 6) (5, 3) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 7) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {14, 10}
Node 1: {3, 15, 6, 10}
Node 2: {16, 4, 19}
Node 3: {1, 13, 9, 5, 8}
Node 4: {16, 2, 15}
Node 5: {3}
Node 6: {16, 1, 18, 19}
Node 7: {17, 10, 9}
Node 8: {16, 3, 13}
Node 9: {3, 12, 7}
Node 10: {1, 0, 7, 19}
Node 11: {17}
Node 12: {15, 9}
Node 13: {3, 8}
Node 14: {0, 19}
Node 15: {1, 12, 4}
Node 16: {8, 2, 4, 6}
Node 17: {11, 18, 7}
Node 18: {17, 19, 6}
Node 19: {14, 2, 18, 10, 6}

Nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and can form a 3-star:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 49

Thus, the final answer is [49].

The unique 3-stars found are:
