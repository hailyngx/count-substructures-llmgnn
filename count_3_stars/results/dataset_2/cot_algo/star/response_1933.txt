Response:
Given the edges provided in the graph, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph.

First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4, 16, 18, 22, 24}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 25}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {4, 8, 11, 17}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {1, 17, 21}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 18}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {1, 7, 9, 25}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {7, 23, 29}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {5, 6, 13}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {2, 9}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 10, 14}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {9, 26}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {2, 11, 26, 27}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {19}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {7, 13, 17}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {9, 14, 15, 26}
16. Node 15: Neighbors {14, 16, 17, 21}
17. Node 16: Neighbors {0, 15, 18}
18. Node 17: Neighbors {2, 3, 13, 15, 27}
19. Node 18: Neighbors {0, 4, 13, 16, 22}
20. Node 19: Neighbors {12, 23, 24, 27}
21. Node 20: Neighbors {24, 25}
22. Node 21: Neighbors {3, 15, 21, 28}
23. Node 23: Neighbors {6, 19, 23, 25}
24. Node 24: Neighbors {19, 20, 24, 29}
25. Node 25: Neighbors {1, 5, 20, 23}
26. Node 26: Neighbors {10, 11, 14, 26}
27. Node 27: Neighbors {11, 17, 19}
28. Node 28: Neighbors {21}
29. Node 29: Neighbors {6, 22, 24}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (3-star with node 1 as the center) <1, (3, 5), (1, 25)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (3-star with node 3 as the center) <3, (1, 21), (3, 17)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (3-star with node 5 as the center) <5, (1, 25), (5, 7)>, <5, (1, 25), (5, 9)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (3-star with node 7 as the center) <7, (5, 13), (7, 6)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (3-star with node 9 as the center) <9, (5, 25), (9, 8)>, <9, (5, 25), (9, 14)>
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: (3-star with node 13 as the center) <13, (7, 17), (13, 18)>, <13, (7, 17), (13, 13)>
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (3-star with node 14 as the center) <14, (9, 26), (14, 15)>, <14, (9, 26), (14, 14)>
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: (3-star with node 15 as the center) <15, (13, 17), (15, 16)>, <15, (13, 17), (15, 21)>
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors: (3-star with node 17 as the center) <17, (3, 27), (17, 15)>, <17, (3, 27), (17, 17)>, <17, (13, 27), (17, 15)>
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors: (3-star with node 18 as the center) <18, (4, 22), (18, 16)>, <18, (4, 22), (18, 18)>, <18, (4, 22), (18, 13)>
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: (3-star with node 19 as the center) <19, (12, 27), (19, 23), (19, 24)>
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors: (3-star with node 21 as the center) <21,  (3, 15), (21, 28)>, <21, (3, 15), (21, 21)>
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: (3-star with node 22 as the center) <22, (4, 29), (22, 18)>
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors: (3-star with node 23 as the center) <23, (6, 19), (23, 25)>
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: (3-star with node 24 as the center) <24, (19, 29), (24, 20)>, <24, (19, 29), (24, 23)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
