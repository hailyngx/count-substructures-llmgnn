Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 13) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (5, 6) (5, 18) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 17) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 15) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 18) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 12) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 14) (12, 19) (12, 14) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 13) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 12) (1, 2) (1, 19) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 13) (17, 2) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 18) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {3, 10, 16}
Node 1 neighbors: {2, 19}
Node 2 neighbors: {1, 8, 17}
Node 3 neighbors: {0, 4, 14, 18}
Node 4 neighbors: {3, 7, 11}
Node 5 neighbors: {6, 18}
Node 6 neighbors: {5, 8}
Node 7 neighbors: {4, 10, 11}
Node 8 neighbors: {2, 6, 15, 19}
Node 9 neighbors: {13}
Node 10 neighbors: {0, 7, 11, 13, 14}
Node 11 neighbors: {4, 7, 10}
Node 12 neighbors: {14, 19}
Node 13 neighbors: {9, 10, 15, 18}
Node 14 neighbors: {3, 10, 12, 16, 19}
Node 15 neighbors: {8, 13, 19}
Node 16 neighbors: {0, 14}
Node 17 neighbors: {2}
Node 18 neighbors: {3, 5, 13}
Node 19 neighbors: {1, 8, 12, 14, 15}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars present in this graph:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
Node 19 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 9, which we represent as [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 14>
<3, 4, 11>
<8, 2, 19>
<10, 7, 11>
<11, 4, 7>
<13, 10, 15>
<14, 3, 10>
<15, 8, 19>
<19, 12, 14>
