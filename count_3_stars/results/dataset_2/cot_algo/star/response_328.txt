Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 14) (0, 4) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 2) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 12) 

Response:
There are a total of [22] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 10, 6)>
<2, (8, 13, 12)>
<3, (4, 13, 14)>
<4, (6, 1, 10)>
<7, (7, 12, 14)>
<8, (8, 5, 10)>
<9, (9, 12, 7)>
<14, (13, 4, 3)>
<15, (11, 0, 2)>
<17, (1, 5, 6)>
<19, (12, 2, 8)>
<20, (14, 13, 3)>
<21, (10, 9, 3)>
<22, (12, 14, 7)>
<28, (2, 1, 11)>
