Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 16) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 14) (14, 7) (14, 17) (14, 3) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 0) (10, 17) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 8) (11, 15) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (19, 11) (19, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (1, 9) (1, 19) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (15, 11) (15, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 16) (0, 4) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph by following the steps as described earlier. 

First, let's determine the neighborhood set for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 6, 17, 18}
- Node 1: {6, 9, 19}
- Node 2: {12, 15, 16}
- Node 3: {10, 12, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {4, 16}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 14}
- Node 8: {6, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 13}
- Node 10: {3, 8, 11, 17}
- Node 11: {8, 10, 15, 19}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {9, 12, 16}
- Node 14: {3, 7, 17}
- Node 15: {2, 11}
- Node 16: {2, 5, 13, 18}
- Node 17: {0, 10, 14}
- Node 18: {0, 16}
- Node 19: {1, 11}

Next, we identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars: 1
- Node 4 forms 3-stars: 1
- Node 8 forms 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10 forms 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11 forms 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12 forms 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13 forms 3-stars: 1
- Node 14 forms 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16 forms 3-stars: 1

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 17, 18>, <4, 5, 7>, <6, 8, 10>, <6, 8, 11>, <6, 8, 12>, <6, 8, 13>, <13, 16, 18>, <14, 17, 3>, <16, 5, 13>
