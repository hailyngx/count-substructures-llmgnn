Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 26) (15, 0) (27, 10) (27, 2) (27, 5) (3, 28) (3, 7) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 29) (10, 27) (17, 1) (17, 4) (0, 15) (0, 20) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 9) (9, 22) (9, 20) (9, 28) (26, 15) (26, 20) (26, 8) (26, 12) (28, 3) (28, 9) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 7) (6, 21) (6, 29) (6, 12) (6, 19) (21, 6) (21, 16) (21, 2) (21, 24) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (16, 21) (16, 4) (16, 5) (2, 27) (2, 21) (2, 7) (2, 5) (5, 27) (5, 16) (5, 2) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 25) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 24) (19, 13) (14, 12) (25, 22) (25, 11) (18, 23) (18, 13) (18, 8) (29, 23) (29, 6) (29, 4) (12, 26) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 18) (13, 12) (4, 23) (4, 17) (4, 16) (4, 29) (4, 24) (24, 21) (24, 19) (24, 4) (8, 26) (8, 18) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {15, 20}
Node 1: {15, 17, 7}
Node 2: {27, 21, 5, 7}
Node 3: {28, 7}
Node 4: {23, 17, 16, 29, 24}
Node 5: {27, 16, 2}
Node 6: {21, 29, 12, 19}
Node 7: {3, 1, 2}
Node 8: {26, 18}
Node 9: {22, 20, 28}
Node 10: {27}
Node 11: {19, 13, 25}
Node 12: {26, 6, 14, 13}
Node 13: {11, 19, 18, 12}
Node 14: {12}
Node 15: {1, 26, 0}
Node 16: {21, 5, 4}
Node 17: {1, 4}
Node 18: {23, 13, 8}
Node 19: {6, 11, 24, 13}
Node 20: {0, 26, 9}
Node 21: {6, 16, 2, 24}
Node 22: {23, 25, 9}
Node 23: {22, 18, 4, 29}
Node 24: {21, 19, 4}
Node 25: {22, 11}
Node 26: {15, 20, 8, 12}
Node 27: {10, 2, 5}
Node 28: {3, 9}
Node 29: {23, 6, 4}

Now, we will identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Nodes forming 3-stars:
- Node 1: <1, (15, 17, 7)>
- Node 4: <4, (23, 17, 16)>
- Node 6: <6, (21, 29, 12)>
- Node 12: <12, (26, 6, 14)>
- Node 13: <13, (11, 19, 18)>

Only the above nodes have 3 or more neighbors, and thus, 3-stars are formed with them.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
