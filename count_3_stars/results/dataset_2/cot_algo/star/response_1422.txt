Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 10) (13, 7) (22, 11) (22, 17) (22, 1) (7, 13) (7, 15) (7, 17) (21, 23) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 10) (23, 21) (23, 15) (23, 29) (23, 28) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 20) (2, 25) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 11) (4, 2) (4, 18) (1, 22) (1, 2) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 12) (15, 7) (15, 23) (15, 1) (15, 5) (16, 24) (16, 17) (16, 19) (19, 8) (19, 16) (19, 11) (19, 25) (19, 6) (3, 26) (28, 23) (28, 5) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 28) (5, 26) (26, 3) (26, 5) (26, 10) (26, 11) (10, 13) (10, 8) (10, 26) (0, 1) (24, 16) (6, 19) (6, 17) (6, 20) (17, 22) (17, 7) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 12) (11, 22) (11, 18) (11, 19) (11, 26) (11, 9) (14, 27) (14, 9) (14, 25) (27, 14) (27, 29) (29, 23) (29, 27) (20, 2) (20, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 25) (12, 1) (12, 17) (25, 2) (25, 19) (25, 14) (25, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 12, 15, 22
- Node 2: 1, 4, 18, 20, 25
- Node 3: 26
- Node 4: 2, 18
- Node 5: 8, 15, 26, 28
- Node 6: 17, 19, 20
- Node 7: 13, 15, 17
- Node 8: 5, 10, 15, 19
- Node 9: 11, 14, 25
- Node 10: 8, 13, 26
- Node 11: 9, 18, 19, 22, 26
- Node 12: 1, 17
- Node 13: 7, 10
- Node 14: 9, 25, 27
- Node 15: 1, 5, 7, 23
- Node 16: 17, 19, 24
- Node 17: 6, 7, 12, 16, 22
- Node 18: 2, 4, 11
- Node 19: 6, 8, 11, 16, 19, 25
- Node 20: 2, 6
- Node 21: 23
- Node 22: 1, 11, 17, 23
- Node 23: 15, 21, 22, 28, 29
- Node 24: 16
- Node 25: 2, 9, 14, 19
- Node 26: 3, 5, 10, 11
- Node 27: 14, 29
- Node 28: 5, 23
- Node 29: 23, 27

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 2, 11, 15, 17, 19, and 25 have 5 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) for each of them.
- Node 11 and 19 have 6 neighbors, so there are additional \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) for each of them.

The total number of 3-stars is:
10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 90

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [90].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 15, 22)>
<2, (4, 18, 25)>
<11, (9, 18, 26)>
<15, (1, 5, 7)>
<17, (6, 12, 22)>
<19, (8, 16, 25)>
<25, (9, 14, 19)>
