Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 11) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 6) (7, 14) (7, 6) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 19) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 1) (1, 15) (1, 8) (1, 13) (19, 12) (19, 8) (16, 14) (16, 12) (16, 18) (0, 15) (0, 13) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 13) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 16) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {15, 13}
- Node 1: {15, 8, 13}
- Node 2: {15, 8, 13}
- Node 3: {15}
- Node 4: {9, 6, 13}
- Node 5: {9, 18, 10}
- Node 6: {10, 11, 7, 12, 4}
- Node 7: {14, 6}
- Node 8: {10, 2, 19, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 4}
- Node 10: {5, 11, 6, 8}
- Node 11: {17, 10, 6}
- Node 12: {16, 6, 19}
- Node 13: {15, 2, 1, 0, 4}
- Node 14: {17, 7, 16}
- Node 15: {3, 1, 0, 18, 2}
- Node 16: {14, 12, 18}
- Node 17: {14, 11}
- Node 18: {5, 15, 16}
- Node 19: {12, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is therefore \( 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \), so the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (10, 11, 7)>
<6, (10, 11, 4)>
<6, (10, 7, 12)>
<6, (10, 12, 4)>
<6, (11, 7, 12)>
<6, (11, 12, 4)>
<15, (1, 0, 18)>
<15, (1, 18, 2)>
<15, (0, 18, 2)>
<13, (1, 0, 4)>
