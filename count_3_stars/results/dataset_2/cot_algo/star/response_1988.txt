Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 20) (11, 10) (11, 26) (8, 4) (8, 24) (23, 7) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 5) (4, 3) (28, 0) (28, 25) (28, 20) (29, 14) (29, 3) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 27) (2, 19) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 12) (6, 17) (6, 15) (21, 10) (21, 19) (15, 6) (15, 5) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 12) (26, 11) (26, 14) (26, 7) (1, 10) (1, 20) (1, 9) (1, 0) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 25) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 24) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 7) (19, 2) (19, 21) (19, 27) (20, 10) (20, 28) (20, 1) (20, 27) (0, 28) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 25) (0, 12) (24, 8) (24, 4) (24, 13) (27, 17) (27, 19) (27, 20) (27, 7) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 12) (12, 18) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 22) (25, 28) (25, 16) (25, 0) (7, 23) (7, 26) (7, 9) (7, 27) (22, 12) (3, 4) (3, 29) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {28, 2, 1, 25, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {10, 20, 9, 0}
- Node 2: Neighbors {19, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 29}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8, 24, 5, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 18, 15, 12}
- Node 6: Neighbors {17, 15}
- Node 7: Neighbors {23, 26, 9, 27}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 24}
- Node 9: Neighbors {18, 1, 7}
- Node 10: Neighbors {11, 21, 1, 20}
- Node 11: Neighbors {10, 26}
- Node 12: Neighbors {18, 14, 0, 5, 22}
- Node 13: Neighbors {17, 16, 24}
- Node 14: Neighbors {29, 26, 12}
- Node 15: Neighbors {6, 5}
- Node 16: Neighbors {17, 13, 25}
- Node 17: Neighbors {13, 6, 16, 27}
- Node 18: Neighbors {9, 5, 12}
- Node 19: Neighbors {2, 21, 27}
- Node 20: Neighbors {10, 28, 1, 27}
- Node 21: Neighbors {10, 19}
- Node 22: Neighbors {12}
- Node 23: Neighbors {7}
- Node 24: Neighbors {8, 4, 13}
- Node 25: Neighbors {28, 16, 0}
- Node 26: Neighbors {11, 14, 7}
- Node 27: Neighbors {17, 19, 20, 7}
- Node 28: Neighbors {0, 25, 20}
- Node 29: Neighbors {14, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, and count how many 3-stars are formed:

- Node 0: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 12: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 13: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 16: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 17: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 18: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 20: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 24: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 27: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 28: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 20>
- <0, 1, 25>
- <0, 1, 28>
- <0, 1, 12>
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 20, 28>
- <0, 20, 27>
- <0, 28, 25>
- <0, 25, 16>
- <1, 10, 20>
- <4, 5, 12>
- <4, 5, 18>
- <4, 12, 18>
- <7, 9, 27>
- <10, 11, 21>
- <10, 21, 19>
- <12, 14, 29>
- <13, 16, 17>
- <17, 19, 27>
- <19, 2, 21>
- <12, 0, 14>
- <15, 5, 6>
- <24, 4, 8>
- <24, 13, 17>
- <26, 11, 14>
- <26, 7, 9>
- <28, 0, 25>
- <3, 4, 29>
