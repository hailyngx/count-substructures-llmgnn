Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 7) (14, 3) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 8) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 19) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 3) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 3) (19, 13) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 0) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 18) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 4) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 10) (0, 8) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 13) (4, 16) (4, 15) (4, 2) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 19) (18, 1) (18, 10) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edge connections:

1: {6, 15, 18}
2: {6, 10, 12, 4}
3: {14, 5, 19}
4: {16, 15, 2}
5: {11, 6, 14, 19, 3}
6: {5, 1, 2}
7: {16, 9, 12, 15}
8: {17, 10, 0}
9: {7}
10: {8, 2, 18, 13}
11: {16, 13, 5}
12: {7, 2, 19}
13: {11, 19, 10}
14: {3, 5}
15: {7, 1, 4}
16: {11, 7, 17, 4}
17: {16, 8}
18: {1, 10}
19: {12, 5, 3, 13}

Now, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see how many unique 3-stars can be formed around it:

Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 6: No 3-star
Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 10: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 11: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 12: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 13: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 15: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 16: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 19: No 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
