Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 10) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 13) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {2, 3, 11, 12}
Node 1: {7, 10, 14, 8}
Node 2: {0, 4, 8, 10, 13}
Node 3: {0, 6, 9, 14}
Node 4: {2, 5, 11}
Node 5: {4, 8, 11, 14}
Node 6: {3, 7, 10, 12}
Node 7: {1, 6, 9, 10}
Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 9}
Node 9: {3, 7, 8, 10, 13}
Node 10: {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
Node 11: {0, 4, 5, 13}
Node 12: {0, 6, 14}
Node 13: {2, 9, 11}
Node 14: {1, 3, 5, 12}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes {8, 10, 13} <2, (8, 10, 13)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes {4, 8, 11} <5, (4, 8, 11)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 7, 9} <8, (1, 7, 9)>
Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 6, 7} <10, (1, 6, 7)>
There are total of 4 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
