Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 14) (5, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (3, 7) (3, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 13) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {9, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {7, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 3: {6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 7, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 11: {8, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {1, 7, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 9, 12, 13}

Calculating the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 1: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 2: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 4: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 6: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 7: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 8: 7 choose 3 = 35
- Node 9: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 12: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 13: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 14: 4 choose 3 = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 35 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 86

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [86].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 13>, <1, 9, 10>, <1, 9, 12>, <1, 9, 13>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 14>, <2, 8, 12>, <2, 9, 12>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <7, 8, 10>, <7, 8, 12>, <7, 9, 12>, <7, 9, 14>, <8, 10, 11>, <8, 10, 12>, <8, 11, 12>, <8, 11, 13>, <8, 12, 14>, <9, 11, 13>, <9, 12, 14>, <9, 13, 14>, <12, 13, 14>
