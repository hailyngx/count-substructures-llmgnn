Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 18) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 10) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (7, 15) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 4) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 17) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 17) (14, 9) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 10) (16, 1) (16, 6) (2, 4) (2, 19) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 6) (17, 3) (17, 18) (17, 0) (1, 9) (1, 16) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {15, 8, 17}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 16}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 19}
- Node 3: Neighbors {15, 17, 10, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8, 18, 12, 2, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors {19, 18}
- Node 6: Neighbors {16, 11, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {15, 11, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 4, 11, 0, 10}
- Node 9: Neighbors {14, 1, 10}
- Node 10: Neighbors {9, 3, 4, 18, 19}
- Node 11: Neighbors {8, 7, 19, 6}
- Node 12: Neighbors {4}
- Node 13: Neighbors {7, 6}
- Node 14: Neighbors {9}
- Node 15: Neighbors {3, 7, 0}
- Node 16: Neighbors {6, 1}
- Node 17: Neighbors {3, 18, 0}
- Node 18: Neighbors {5, 4, 10, 17}
- Node 19: Neighbors {5, 11, 2, 10}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [1]
  <0, (8, 15, 17)>
- Node 3: [1]
  <3, (15, 8, 17)>
- Node 4: [1]
  <4, (8, 10, 18)>
- Node 10: [1]
  <10, (4, 9, 19)>
  
Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
