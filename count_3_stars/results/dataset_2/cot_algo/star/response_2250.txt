Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 28) (9, 14) (2, 6) (29, 8) (29, 12) (29, 10) (3, 25) (3, 7) (25, 3) (25, 13) (25, 4) (21, 28) (21, 27) (21, 18) (21, 14) (28, 9) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 20) (11, 0) (11, 8) (1, 16) (1, 7) (1, 4) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 7) (0, 11) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 17) (22, 9) (22, 27) (22, 16) (22, 6) (22, 10) (10, 29) (10, 22) (15, 9) (15, 19) (23, 26) (23, 4) (23, 13) (18, 21) (18, 19) (18, 20) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 13) (26, 23) (26, 20) (8, 29) (8, 28) (8, 11) (6, 2) (6, 22) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 21) (14, 6) (14, 20) (24, 17) (24, 12) (20, 28) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 14) (20, 16) (4, 25) (4, 1) (4, 23) (27, 21) (27, 17) (27, 22) (13, 25) (13, 23) (13, 19) (13, 16) (16, 1) (16, 22) (16, 20) (16, 13) (12, 5) (12, 29) (12, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 11
- Node 1: 4, 7, 16
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 4, 7, 13, 25
- Node 4: 1, 23, 25
- Node 5: 7, 12
- Node 6: 2, 14, 22
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5, 17
- Node 8: 11, 28, 29
- Node 9: 14, 15, 21, 22, 28
- Node 10: 22, 29
- Node 11: 0, 8
- Node 12: 5, 24, 29
- Node 13: 16, 19, 23, 25
- Node 14: 6, 9, 20, 21
- Node 15: 9, 19
- Node 16: 1, 13, 20, 22
- Node 17: 1, 7, 24, 27
- Node 18: 19, 20, 21
- Node 19: 13, 15, 18
- Node 20: 14, 16, 18, 26, 28
- Node 21: 14, 18, 19, 28
- Node 22: 6, 9, 10, 16, 27
- Node 23: 4, 13, 26
- Node 24: 12, 17
- Node 25: 3, 4, 13
- Node 26: 20, 23
- Node 27: 17, 21, 22
- Node 28: 8, 9, 20, 21
- Node 29: 8, 10, 12

Based on the neighbor sets, the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28, 29.

For each of these nodes, we need to calculate the number of unique 3-stars they participate in. Since they have at least 3 neighbors, they can potentially form 3-stars.

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of unique 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 50 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [50] unique 3-stars in the graph.
