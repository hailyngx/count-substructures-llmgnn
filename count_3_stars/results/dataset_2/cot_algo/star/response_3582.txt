Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 11) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 8) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 14) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 8) (3, 10) (13, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {2, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 3: {10}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 11}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 4}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 3, 5, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 5, 6, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 7, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {11}
- Node 14: {1, 8, 10}

Based on the number of neighbors, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 15 3-stars: <1, (2, 10, 14)>, <1, (7, 10, 14)>, <1, (2, 11, 14)>, <1, (7, 11, 14)>, <1, (2, 10, 11)>, <1, (2, 10, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 14)>, <1, (7, 10, 11)>, <1, (2, 7, 11)>, <1, (7, 11, 10)>, <1, (2, 10, 11)>, <1, (1, 10, 11)>, <1, (1, 10, 14)>, <1, (1, 11, 14)>, <1, (1, 7, 14)>
- Node 2 forms 10 3-stars: <2, (1, 7, 11)>, <2, (1, 7, 10)>, <2, (4, 7, 1)>, <2, (4, 7, 11)>, <2, (4, 7, 2)>, <2, (1, 7, 14)>, <2, (1, 11, 14)>, <2, (4, 7, 14)>, <2, (11, 5, 6)>, <2, (11, 5, 1)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (6, 8, 11)>
- Node 7 forms 5 3-stars: <7, (1, 10, 14)>, <7, (4, 2, 1)>, <7, (1, 2, 11)>, <7, (4, 2, 11)>, <7, (1, 2, 14)>
- Node 10 forms 3 3-stars: <10, (1, 12, 14)>, <10, (0, 12, 14)>, <10, (12, 0, 4)>
- Node 11 forms 5 3-stars: <11, (1, 13, 14)>, <11, (1, 6, 5)>, <11, (1, 2, 6)>, <11, (1, 2, 5)>, <11, (6, 5, 10)>
- Node 12 forms 5 3-stars: <12, (0, 8, 14)>, <12, (0, 10, 14)>, <12, (0, 8, 5)>, <12, (8, 14, 10)>, <12, (0, 10, 5)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star: <14, (1, 8, 10)>

The total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [40].
