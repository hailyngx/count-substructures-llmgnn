Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 22) (16, 14) (16, 5) (5, 16) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 19) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 29) (13, 15) (20, 21) (20, 3) (20, 14) (25, 7) (25, 18) (28, 10) (28, 2) (29, 13) (22, 16) (22, 27) (22, 10) (22, 24) (26, 24) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 7) (3, 20) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (24, 22) (24, 26) (7, 25) (7, 26) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 18) (15, 13) (4, 6) (4, 2) (12, 23) (27, 22) (27, 19) (17, 8) (17, 26) (17, 1) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 23) (21, 20) (21, 26) (21, 14) (23, 12) (23, 0) (23, 6) (14, 16) (14, 20) (14, 21) (10, 28) (10, 22) (10, 18) (18, 25) (18, 3) (18, 1) (18, 10) (18, 6) (2, 28) (2, 7) (2, 4) (6, 4) (6, 23) (6, 18) (6, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 27) (19, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 8, 11, 23
- Node 1: 8, 11, 17, 18
- Node 2: 4, 7, 28
- Node 3: 7, 18, 19, 20
- Node 4: 2, 6
- Node 5: 8, 11, 16
- Node 6: 2, 4, 18, 19, 23
- Node 7: 2, 3, 25, 26
- Node 8: 0, 5, 9, 11, 13, 17
- Node 9: 8, 13, 19
- Node 10: 18, 22, 28
- Node 11: 0, 1, 5, 8, 16
- Node 12: 23
- Node 13: 8, 9, 15, 19, 29
- Node 14: 16, 20, 21
- Node 15: 13
- Node 16: 5, 11, 14, 22
- Node 17: 1, 8, 17, 26
- Node 18: 1, 3, 6, 10, 18, 25
- Node 19: 3, 6, 9, 13, 27
- Node 20: 14, 21
- Node 21: 14, 20, 26
- Node 22: 10, 16, 24, 27
- Node 23: 0, 6, 12
- Node 24: 22, 26
- Node 25: 7, 18
- Node 26: 7, 17, 21, 24
- Node 27: 19, 22
- Node 28: 2, 10

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [4]
- Node 2: [0]
- Node 3: [0]
- Node 4: [0]
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: [0]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 10: [0]
- Node 11: [1]
- Node 12: [0]
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 14: [1]
- Node 15: [0]
- Node 16: [1]
- Node 17: [1]
- Node 18: [2]
- Node 19: [1]
- Node 20: [1]
- Node 21: [1]
- Node 22: [1]
- Node 23: [0]
- Node 24: [1]
- Node 25: [0]
- Node 26: [1]
- Node 27: [0]
- Node 28: [0]

The total number of 3-stars is [18].
