Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 13) (12, 10) (12, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 13) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 1: {6, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 9, 10}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 10: {8, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 3, 5, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {1, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 14: {3, 4, 6}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors, so we can form \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, so we can't form any 3-stars.
- Node 2: 2 neighbors, so we can't form any 3-stars.
- Node 3: 4 neighbors, so we can form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, so we can form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, so we can form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 6: 6 neighbors, so we can form \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars.
- Node 7: 4 neighbors, so we can form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 8: 3 neighbors, so we can't form any 3-stars.
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, so we can form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 10: 4 neighbors, so we can form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 11: 6 neighbors, so we can form \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars.
- Node 12: 2 neighbors, so we can't form any 3-stars.
- Node 13: 5 neighbors, so we can form \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 14: 3 neighbors, so we can't form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 76

Therefore, the final answer is [76].

Unique 3-stars found: 
- <0, (3, 11, 13)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (5, 6, 14)>
- <5, (4, 7, 11)>
- <6, (4, 9, 13)>
- <11, (0, 5, 13)>
