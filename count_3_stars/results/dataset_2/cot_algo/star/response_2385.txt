Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 13) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 11) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (12, 5) (11, 7) (11, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 9, 14}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 13}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 8, 11}
- Node 10: {4, 5, 6, 13}
- Node 11: {7, 9}
- Node 12: {5}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 4, 5, 6, 13}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 (three neighbors)
- Node 1: 0 (less than three neighbors)
- Node 2: 0 (less than three neighbors)
- Node 3: 0 (less than three neighbors)
- Node 4: 1 (three neighbors)
- Node 5: 1 (three neighbors)
- Node 6: 1 (three neighbors)
- Node 7: 4 (four neighbors)
- Node 8: 1 (three neighbors)
- Node 9: 0 (less than three neighbors)
- Node 10: 1 (three neighbors)
- Node 11: 0 (less than three neighbors)
- Node 12: 0 (less than three neighbors)
- Node 13: 2 (four neighbors)
- Node 14: 1 (three neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 12

Therefore, the final count is [12], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, 5, 14>
- <4, 6, 10>
- <4, 7, 13>
- <4, 7, 14>
- <7, 8, 13>
- <13, 14, 4>
- <14, 0, 5>
- <14, 0, 13>
- <14, 4, 5>
- <14, 4, 13>
- <14, 5, 13>
- <14, 6, 10>
