Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 6) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 25) (16, 10) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 5) (22, 18) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 7) (22, 1) (1, 22) (1, 14) (26, 29) (26, 0) (26, 12) (4, 18) (28, 0) (28, 24) (29, 26) (29, 7) (29, 13) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 25) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 17) (8, 27) (8, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 23) (23, 9) (23, 19) (12, 26) (12, 24) (12, 17) (6, 11) (6, 24) (24, 22) (24, 28) (24, 12) (24, 6) (24, 10) (19, 15) (19, 23) (19, 17) (19, 13) (0, 26) (0, 28) (0, 9) (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 2) (17, 8) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 3) (17, 5) (7, 22) (7, 29) (7, 8) (2, 3) (2, 14) (20, 22) (20, 21) (21, 20) (21, 5) (10, 16) (10, 24) (10, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (27, 18) (27, 8) (13, 29) (13, 19) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 21) (25, 11) (25, 16) (25, 15) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 26, 28, 9, 3
- Node 1: 22, 14
- Node 2: 3, 14
- Node 3: 0, 2, 17, 10
- Node 4: 18
- Node 5: 18, 17, 21
- Node 6: 11, 24
- Node 7: 22, 29, 8
- Node 8: 15, 9, 17, 27, 7
- Node 9: 8, 0, 23
- Node 10: 16, 24, 3
- Node 11: 16, 6, 25
- Node 12: 26, 24, 17
- Node 13: 29, 19
- Node 14: 1, 2
- Node 15: 8, 19, 25
- Node 16: 11, 25, 10
- Node 17: 8, 12, 19, 3, 5
- Node 18: 22, 4, 27, 5
- Node 19: 15, 23, 17, 13
- Node 20: 22, 21
- Node 21: 20, 5
- Node 22: 18, 20, 24, 7, 1
- Node 23: 9, 19
- Node 24: 22, 28, 12, 6, 10
- Node 25: 11, 16, 15
- Node 26: 29, 0, 12
- Node 27: 18, 8
- Node 28: 24, 0
- Node 29: 26, 7, 13

Next, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph. 

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 0, 3, 8, 17, 18, 22, 24, 25, 26, 29

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <0, 9, 3>
  - <0, 9, 26>
  - <0, 9, 28>
  - <0, 3, 26>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <3, 9, 0>
  - <3, 9, 17>
  - <3, 0, 26>
  - <3, 17, 5>

- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <8, 9, 0>
  - <8, 9, 23>
  - <8, 9, 27>
  - <8, 9, 7>
  - <8, 0, 26>
  - <8, 0, 28>
  - <8, 0, 3>
  - <8, 0, 17>
  - <8, 0, 22>
  - <8, 3, 17>

- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <17, 8, 9>
  - <17, 8, 12>
  - <17, 8, 19>
  - <17, 8, 3>
  - <17, 8, 5>
  - <17, 3, 0>
  - <17, 3, 5>
  - <17, 0, 26>
  - <17, 0, 3>
  - <17, 5, 18>

- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
  - <18, 22, 4>
  - <18, 22, 27>
  - <18, 22, 5>
  - <18, 4, 5>
  - <18, 4, 27>
  - <18, 5, 21>
  - <18, 5, 17>
  - <18, 27, 5>
  - <18, 27, 8>
  - <18, 5, 17>

- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <22, 18, 4>
  - <22, 18, 5>
  - <22, 18, 27>
  - <22, 4, 5>
  - <22, 4, 27>
  - <22, 5, 21>
  - <22, 5, 17>
  - <22, 5, 18>
  - <22, 27, 5>
  - <22, 20, 21>

- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <24, 22, 7>
  - <24, 22, 10>
  - <24, 22, 6>
  - <24, 22, 28>
  - <24, 7, 6>
  - <24, 7, 10>
  - <24, 7, 28>
  - <24, 10, 16>
  - <24, 10, 3>
  - <24, 6, 11>

- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <25, 11, 16>

- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <26, 0, 12>

- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <29, 26, 12>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [51].
