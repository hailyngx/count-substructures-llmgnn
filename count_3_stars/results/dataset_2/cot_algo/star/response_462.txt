Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 1) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 11) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 4) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 3) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 2) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph can be found as follows:

1. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (9, 5, 10, 13)
    - Combining its neighbors 3 at a time, we find 1 three-star: <6, (9, 5, 10)>
    
2. Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (6, 8, 10, 13, 12)
    - Combining its neighbors 3 at a time, we find 1 three-star: <9, (6, 8, 10)>
    
3. Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (9, 5, 14, 3, 1)
    - Combining its neighbors 3 at a time, we find 1 three-star: <8, (9, 5, 14)>
    
4. Node 13 has 3 neighbors: (6, 9, 12)
    - Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 three-star formed with this node: <13, (6, 9, 12)>
    
5. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (6, 8, 4, 3, 10)
    - Combining its neighbors 3 at a time, we find 1 three-star: <5, (6, 8, 4)>
    
6. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (7, 10, 3, 12)
    - Combining its neighbors 3 at a time, we find 0 three-stars as it does not have at least 3 neighbors.
    
7. Node 14 has 3 neighbors: (8, 11, 1)
    - Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 three-star formed with this node: <14, (8, 11, 1)>
    
8. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (0, 12, 2)
    - Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 three-star formed with this node: <7, (0, 12, 2)>
    
9. Node 12 has 6 neighbors: (9, 13, 0, 7, 4, 11)
    - Combining its neighbors 3 at a time, we find 1 three-star: <12, (9, 13, 0)>
    
10. Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (8, 5, 0, 11, 4)
    - Combining its neighbors 3 at a time, we find 1 three-star: <3, (8, 5, 0)>
    
11. Node 11 has 4 neighbors: (14, 12, 3, 1)
    - Combining its neighbors 3 at a time, we find 1 three-star: <11, (14, 12, 3)>
    
12. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (5, 12, 3)
    - Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 three-star formed with this node: <4, (5, 12, 3)>
    
13. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (8, 14, 11, 2)
    - Combining its neighbors 3 at a time, we find 1 three-star: <1, (8, 14, 11)>
    
14. Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (6, 9, 5, 0)
    - Combining its neighbors 3 at a time, we find 1 three-star: <10, (6, 9, 5)>
    
15. Node 2 has 2 neighbors: (7, 1)
    - Since it has less than 3 neighbors, there are 0 three-stars formed with this node.
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 8, and the unique 3-stars are <6, (9, 5, 10)>, <9, (6, 8, 10)>, <8, (9, 5, 14)>, <13, (6, 9, 12)>, <5, (6, 8, 4)>, <14, (8, 11, 1)>, <7, (0, 12, 2)>, <12, (9, 13, 0)>, and <3, (8, 5, 0)>. So, the final answer is [8].
