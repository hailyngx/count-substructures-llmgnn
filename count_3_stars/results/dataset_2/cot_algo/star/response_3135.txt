Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 18) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 19) (4, 14) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 10) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 15) (1, 13) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 15) (6, 3) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 14) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 18) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {9, 10}
Node 1: {13}
Node 2: {5, 15, 19}
Node 3: {5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 4: {14}
Node 5: {2, 3, 10, 16}
Node 6: {3, 7, 12, 15}
Node 7: {3, 6, 12, 16}
Node 8: {10, 13, 18}
Node 9: {0, 3, 11}
Node 10: {0, 5, 8, 13, 19}
Node 11: {9}
Node 12: {6, 7, 14}
Node 13: {1, 8, 10, 16, 19}
Node 14: {4, 12, 18, 19}
Node 15: {2, 6, 18}
Node 16: {5, 7, 13}
Node 18: {8, 14, 15}
Node 19: {2, 10, 13, 14}

Now, let's identify the potential 3-stars:

Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <2, (5, 15, 19)>
Node 6, 7, and 10 also have 3 neighbors each, so they form 3-stars: <6, (3, 7, 15)>, <7, (3, 6, 12)>, <10, (5, 13, 19)>
Node 3, 5, 8, 13, 14, 18, and 19 have more than 3 neighbors, so we'll calculate the 3-stars for each of them using \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 1 (from nodes with exactly 3 neighbors) + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].
