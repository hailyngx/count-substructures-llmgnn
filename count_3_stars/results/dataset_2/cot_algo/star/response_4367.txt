Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 7) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 7) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 19) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (15, 7) (15, 14) (19, 12) (0, 11) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 14) (14, 10) (14, 15) (14, 3) (16, 18) (16, 1) (17, 4) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 15) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 16}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 9, 11, 18}
- Node 3: {5, 14}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {5, 13, 15, 18}
- Node 8: {12}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 13}
- Node 10: {7, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 4, 10}
- Node 12: {4, 8, 13, 19}
- Node 13: {7, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 14: {3, 10, 15}
- Node 15: {7, 14}
- Node 16: {1, 18}
- Node 17: {4}
- Node 18: {2, 4, 7, 16}
- Node 19: {12}

Now we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 13, Node 14, Node 18

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 16, 6)>
- <2, (4, 18, 7)>
- <4, (6, 17, 11)>
- <5, (3, 9, 7)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <7, (10, 13, 15)>
- <9, (2, 5, 13)>
- <10, (7, 13, 14)>
- <11, (0, 2, 4)>
- <13, (7, 9, 12)>
- <14, (3, 10, 15)>
- <18, (2, 4, 7)>
