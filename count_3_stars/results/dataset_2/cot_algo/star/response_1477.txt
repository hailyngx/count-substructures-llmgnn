Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 17) (18, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 17) (13, 2) (13, 1) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 6) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (6, 16) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 12) (0, 19) (0, 10) (0, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 19) (9, 18) (9, 0) (12, 11) (12, 6) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 17) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {19, 10, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {13, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {11, 16, 3, 13, 17}
- Node 3: Neighbors {15, 4, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {11, 4, 1, 17}
- Node 6: Neighbors {16, 15, 8, 12}
- Node 7: Neighbors {19, 14, 17}
- Node 8: Neighbors {14, 10, 17, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {18, 0}
- Node 10: Neighbors {8, 0}
- Node 11: Neighbors {16, 5, 12, 2}
- Node 12: Neighbors {11, 6}
- Node 13: Neighbors {2, 1}
- Node 14: Neighbors {7, 8, 19}
- Node 15: Neighbors {16, 3, 6}
- Node 16: Neighbors {11, 15, 2, 6}
- Node 17: Neighbors {7, 5, 8, 2}
- Node 18: Neighbors {9}
- Node 19: Neighbors {7, 14, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 35.

Thus, the final answer is [35] and the unique 3-stars are:
<2, (11, 16, 3)>, <5, (11, 4, 1)>, <6, (16, 15, 8)>, <8, (14, 17, 6)>, <11, (16, 5, 12)>, <16, (11, 15, 2)>, <17, (7, 5, 8)>.
