Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3, 4, 6}
Node 1: {5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 2: {4, 9}
Node 3: {0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5}
Node 5: {1, 4, 7, 8}
Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 7, 8}
Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
Node 8: {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 8}

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 and Node 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)   (There's only 1 unique 3-star with Node 0)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from Node 0) + 10 (from Node 8) = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (6, 7, 8)>
