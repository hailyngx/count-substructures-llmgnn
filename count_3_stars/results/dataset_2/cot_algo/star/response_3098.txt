Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 6) (0, 12) (0, 19) (14, 6) (2, 12) (2, 19) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 1) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 10) (4, 1) (18, 4) (18, 3) (3, 11) (3, 18) (3, 17) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 4) (15, 8) (15, 10) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 15) (10, 7) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 6) (9, 16) (7, 10) (7, 13) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 19) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 5) (5, 8) (5, 17) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 13) (13, 16) (13, 7) (13, 19) 

Response:
There are no nodes with less than 3 neighbors. 
Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<11, (1, 3, 4)>
<16, (6, 9, 11)>
<4, (1, 10, 11)>
<12, (0, 2, 16)>
<6, (12, 16, 17)>
<10, (4, 8, 15)>
<1, (4, 8, 11)>
<15, (8, 10, 16)>
<8, (1, 10, 15)>
<18, (3, 4, 11)>
<3, (11, 17, 18)>
<17, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 8, 17)>
<19, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 12, 19)>
<0, (2, 12, 19)>
<7, (10, 13, 16)>
<13, (7, 16, 19)>
<9, (11, 16, 19)>
<14, (6, 16, 19)>

There are 20 unique 3-stars formed in total. So, the final answer is [20].
