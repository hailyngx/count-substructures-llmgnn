Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 28) (7, 27) (7, 1) (18, 22) (18, 14) (18, 6) (18, 29) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 29) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 20) (17, 15) (0, 10) (0, 20) (0, 15) (20, 11) (20, 0) (20, 27) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 27) (8, 28) (8, 21) (8, 3) (29, 18) (29, 22) (29, 13) (14, 18) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 5) (13, 11) (13, 29) (26, 2) (26, 28) (26, 3) (5, 14) (5, 21) (28, 7) (28, 8) (28, 26) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 24) (12, 1) (6, 18) (6, 14) (6, 24) (6, 25) (24, 12) (24, 6) (24, 25) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 16) (3, 8) (3, 26) (19, 2) (19, 25) (19, 16) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 17) (15, 0) (16, 22) (16, 1) (16, 19) (23, 4) (25, 6) (25, 24) (25, 19) (9, 10) (9, 11) (27, 7) (27, 20) (27, 2) (21, 8) (21, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
Node 0: {10, 20, 15}
Node 1: {7, 12, 16}
Node 2: {26, 19, 27}
Node 3: {8, 26}
Node 4: {7, 12, 23, 15}
Node 5: {14, 21}
Node 6: {18, 14, 24, 25}
Node 7: {4, 15, 28, 27, 1}
Node 8: {28, 21, 3}
Node 9: {10, 11}
Node 10: {0, 9}
Node 11: {9, 13, 12, 20}
Node 12: {4, 11, 14, 24, 1}
Node 13: {11, 29}
Node 14: {18, 6, 12, 5}
Node 15: {4, 7, 17, 0}
Node 16: {22, 1, 19}
Node 17: {15}
Node 18: {22, 14, 6, 29}
Node 19: {2, 25, 16}
Node 20: {11, 0, 27}
Node 21: {8, 5}
Node 22: {18, 16, 29}
Node 23: {4}
Node 24: {12, 6, 25}
Node 25: {6, 24, 19}
Node 26: {2, 28, 3}
Node 27: {7, 20, 2}
Node 28: {7, 8, 26}
Node 29: {18, 22, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 12, 14, 15, 18, 22, 26

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 38
So, the final answer is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, 7, 12>, <4, 7, 15>, <4, 12, 15>, <4, 12, 1>, <7, 12, 1>, <7, 15, 0>, <7, 15, 27>, <7, 15, 4>, <7, 15, 17>, <12, 11, 14>
<14, 18, 6>, <14, 18, 29>, <14, 6, 24>, <14, 6, 25>, <15, 0, 10>, <16, 22, 18>, <16, 22, 29>, <16, 1, 7>, <16, 1, 19>, <22, 29, 13>
<26, 2, 27>, <26, 28, 8>
