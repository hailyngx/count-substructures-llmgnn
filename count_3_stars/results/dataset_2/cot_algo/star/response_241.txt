Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 9, 14, 3, 4, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 8, 13, 6, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 8, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {11, 0, 2, 1, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {13, 12, 0, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {10, 2, 8, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 10, 11, 8, 1, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 6, 12, 3, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 0}
- Node 10: Neighbors {11, 6, 7}
- Node 11: Neighbors {10, 14, 7, 13, 4}
- Node 12: Neighbors {5, 14, 8}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 11, 0, 2}
- Node 14: Neighbors {11, 0, 12}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars by examining the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 82

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [82].
