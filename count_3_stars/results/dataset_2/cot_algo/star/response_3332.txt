Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 3) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 14) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 14) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. 

Let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 7, 12, 2
- Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 2, 10
- Node 2 has neighbors: 5, 1, 8, 14, 0
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 11, 7, 4, 13
- Node 4 has neighbors: 5, 3, 10, 14
- Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 11, 4, 14
- Node 6 has neighbors: 14, 12, 8
- Node 7 has neighbors: 3, 10, 12, 0, 8
- Node 8 has neighbors: 9, 6, 7, 2
- Node 9 has neighbors: 8, 10, 13, 12
- Node 10 has neighbors: 9, 1, 7, 4
- Node 11 has neighbors: 5, 3
- Node 12 has neighbors: 9, 6, 7, 13, 0
- Node 13 has neighbors: 9, 3, 12, 14
- Node 14 has neighbors: 5, 6, 2, 13, 4

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
In this case, nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 12 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the 3-stars involving these nodes.

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of unique 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 57

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [57].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 12, 2)>
<2, (5, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 11, 7)>
<4, (5, 3, 10)>
<5, (2, 11, 4)>
<7, (3, 10, 12)>
<8, (9, 6, 7)>
<9, (8, 10, 13)>
<12, (9, 6, 7)>
