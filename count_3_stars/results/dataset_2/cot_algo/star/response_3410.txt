Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {9, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: neighbors {6, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 0, 5, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {6, 1, 8, 0}
- Node 5: neighbors {6, 3, 8, 2, 0, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {9, 5, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {8, 5, 2}
- Node 8: neighbors {6, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {6, 0}

Now, let's check for nodes with three or more neighbors to find 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 20 = 67, so the answer is [67].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 3, 8>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <5, 6, 0>
- <5, 6, 3>
- <5, 8, 7>
- <5, 8, 0>
- <5, 8, 3>
- <5, 8, 4>
- <6, 8, 7>
- <6, 8, 0>
- <6, 8, 3>
- <6, 8, 4>
