Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 12) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 2) (13, 5) (13, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are as follows: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 10}
Node 1: {3, 6, 11, 13, 14}
Node 2: {0, 6, 7, 8, 14}
Node 3: {0, 1, 8, 11, 12}
Node 4: {8, 12, 14}
Node 5: {0, 6, 9, 13}
Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 11}
Node 7: {2, 7, 9, 10, 12}
Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 12, 14}
Node 9: {5, 7, 11}
Node 10: {0, 7, 14}
Node 11: {1, 3, 6, 9}
Node 12: {3, 4, 7, 8}
Node 13: {1, 5}
Node 14: {1, 2, 4, 8, 10}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes forming 3-stars:
Node 1: <1, (6, 11, 14)>
Node 2: <2, (6, 8, 14)>
Node 3: <3, (8, 11, 12)>
Node 4: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 5: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 6: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 7: <7, (9, 10, 12)>
Node 8: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 9: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 10: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 11: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 12: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 13: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 14: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (6, 11, 14)>
<2, (6, 8, 14)>
<3, (8, 11, 12)>
<7, (9, 10, 12)>
