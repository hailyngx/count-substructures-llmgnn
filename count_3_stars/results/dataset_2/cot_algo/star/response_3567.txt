Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 0) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 6) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 7) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {13, 10, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {8, 13, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {3, 11, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {8, 11, 14, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {10}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {12, 0, 14, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {11, 12, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {8, 1, 6, 14, 5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {13, 12, 3, 1, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {13, 3, 11, 0, 2, 7}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {4, 12, 0}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {3, 9, 6, 2}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {8, 13, 5, 10, 6}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {8, 12, 1, 9, 0}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {3, 7, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 85

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [85].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
