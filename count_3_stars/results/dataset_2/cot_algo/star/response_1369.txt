Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll first construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges. 

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <1, (2, 4, 7)>
2. <1, (2, 5, 7)>
3. <1, (2, 5, 9)>
4. <1, (3, 5, 7)>
5. <1, (4, 7, 9)>
6. <2, (0, 5, 9)>
7. <2, (1, 5, 9)>
8. <2, (5, 8, 9)>
9. <5, (0, 2, 8)>
10. <5, (2, 3, 6)>
11. <5, (2, 6, 8)>
12. <7, (1, 3, 9)>
13. <7, (1, 4, 9)>
14. <7, (3, 4, 9)>
15. <7, (4, 9, 6)>
16. <9, (1, 2, 4)>
17. <9, (1, 4, 7)>
18. <9, (2, 4, 7)>
19. <9, (4, 7, 6)>
