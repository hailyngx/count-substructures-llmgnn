Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 13) (8, 11) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 14) (0, 10) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 2) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {10}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 2: {1, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 9, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 12}
- Node 6: {5, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {1, 11}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 11, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 4, 7, 11}
- Node 11: {1, 7, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 12: {5, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 13: {3, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 6, 9, 13}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors can potentially form 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 9, 14)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <7, (1, 10, 12)>
- <9, (4, 11, 14)>
- <11, (1, 7, 8)>
- <12, (5, 6, 13)>
- <13, (3, 12, 14)>
- <14, (2, 6, 9)>
