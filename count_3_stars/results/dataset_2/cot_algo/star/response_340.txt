Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 9) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 8) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (0, 9) (4, 9) (4, 13) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 13) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 4) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 14) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {9}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 2: {8, 10, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {9, 13}
- Node 5: {1, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {3, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 7, 12}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 12: {1, 7, 9, 5}
- Node 13: {2, 4, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 6, 13}

Now we need to identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 6 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 60 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 5, 11)>
- <1, (3, 5, 12)>
- <1, (3, 6, 11)>
- <1, (3, 6, 12)>
- <1, (5, 11, 12)>
- <2, (3, 10, 14)>
- <2, (6, 10, 14)>
- <2, (11, 13, 14)>
- <3, (6, 10, 14)>
- <3, (7, 9, 12)>
- <3, (9, 12, 14)>
- <6, (8, 10, 14)>
- <9, (3, 7, 12)>
- <9, (4, 9, 13)>
