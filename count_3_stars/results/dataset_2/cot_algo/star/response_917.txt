Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 0) (6, 4) (6, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 2, 4, 10, 11 (4 neighbors)
Node 1: 3, 5, 8, 10, 14 (5 neighbors)
Node 2: 0, 8, 13, 14 (4 neighbors)
Node 3: 1, 13, 14 (3 neighbors)
Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 8, 9 (5 neighbors)
Node 5: 1, 7, 9, 14 (4 neighbors)
Node 6: 4, 10 (2 neighbors)
Node 7: 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 (5 neighbors)
Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 7 (4 neighbors)
Node 9: 4, 5, 7, 12 (4 neighbors)
Node 10: 0, 1, 6, 12, 13 (5 neighbors)
Node 11: 0, 7, 14 (3 neighbors)
Node 12: 9, 10 (2 neighbors)
Node 13: 2, 3, 10 (3 neighbors)
Node 14: 1, 2, 3, 5, 11 (5 neighbors)

Next, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 44 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (4, 10, 11)>
<1, (3, 8, 14)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 11)>
<10, (12, 13, 0)>
<14, (2, 3, 5)>
