Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 7) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 19) (4, 13) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 14) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 16) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (11, 14) (11, 18) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 2) (12, 14) (12, 8) (10, 13) (10, 7) (7, 17) (7, 5) (7, 10) (19, 13) (19, 0) (6, 17) (6, 4) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 16) (1, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 9, 16, 19
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 9, 15, 16
- Node 3: 15
- Node 4: 6, 13, 18
- Node 5: 1, 7, 13, 15, 17
- Node 6: 4, 17
- Node 7: 5, 10, 17
- Node 8: 9, 12, 13, 15
- Node 9: 0, 2, 8, 15
- Node 10: 7, 13
- Node 11: 14, 18
- Node 12: 8, 14
- Node 13: 4, 5, 8, 10, 19
- Node 14: 11, 12, 17, 18
- Node 15: 2, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 16: 0, 2, 18
- Node 17: 5, 6, 7, 14
- Node 18: 4, 11, 14, 16
- Node 19: 0, 13

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars.

Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final result to put inside brackets is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<5, 7, 13>, <5, 13, 17>, <5, 13, 8>, <5, 13, 10>, <5, 13, 19>,
<13, 4, 18>, <13, 8, 9>, <13, 8, 12>, <13, 8, 15>, <13, 10, 7>,
<14, 11, 18>, <14, 17, 18>, <14, 17, 11>, <14, 17, 6>,
<17, 5, 13>, <17, 6, 4>, <17, 7, 5>, <18, 4, 6>, <18, 4, 11>,
<18, 4, 16>, <18, 11, 14>, <18, 11, 16>, <18, 14, 17>,
<5, 1, 15>, <9, 2, 15>, <9, 2, 16>, <9, 8, 12>, <9, 8, 15>,
<0, 16, 18>, <13, 4, 6>, <17, 5, 7>
