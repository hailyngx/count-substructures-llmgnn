Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 6) (17, 4) (17, 14) (17, 9) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 18) (12, 7) (12, 10) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 15) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 0) (5, 8) (5, 1) (13, 3) (13, 15) (0, 18) (0, 16) (0, 6) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 6) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 9) (16, 19) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 1) (19, 16) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (9, 17) (9, 2) (9, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 16, 18
- Node 1: 5, 6, 11
- Node 2: 9, 11, 15, 18
- Node 3: 10, 13, 14
- Node 4: 7, 16, 17
- Node 5: 1, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 10, 14, 15
- Node 7: 4, 12
- Node 8: 5, 11, 16, 18
- Node 9: 2, 16, 17
- Node 10: 3, 6, 12
- Node 11: 1, 2, 8
- Node 12: 7, 10
- Node 13: 3, 15
- Node 14: 3, 6, 17
- Node 15: 2, 6, 13
- Node 16: 0, 4, 8, 9, 19
- Node 17: 4, 9, 14
- Node 18: 2, 8, 18
- Node 19: 16

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 10: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 11: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 15: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 16: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in the graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 16, 18>, <1, 5, 11>, <2, 9, 15>, <2, 9, 18>, <2, 11, 18>, <3, 10, 13>, <4, 7, 16>, <4, 9, 17>, <6, 10, 15>, <6, 14, 17>, <8, 11, 16>, <8, 18, 19>
