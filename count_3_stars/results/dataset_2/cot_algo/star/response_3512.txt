Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 10) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
Applying the given information to identify the 3-star graph structures:

For node 0: Neighbors = 9, 7. No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

For node 1: Neighbors = 5, 6, 14, 13. No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

For node 2: Neighbors = 9, 4, 12. Formed 1 3-star <2, (9, 4, 12)>.

For node 3: Neighbors = 7, 13, 12. No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

For node 4: Neighbors = 9, 7, 2. Formed 1 3-star <4, (9, 7, 2)>.

For node 5: Neighbors = 1, 11, 7. Formed 1 3-star <5, (1, 11, 7)>.

For node 6: Neighbors = 1, 10, 12, 13. No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

For node 7: Neighbors = 5, 4, 0, 3, 14, 13. Formed 2 3-stars <7, (5, 4, 0)> and <7, (5, 14, 13)>.

For node 8: Neighbors = 9, 11, 12. No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

For node 9: Neighbors = 8, 4, 2, 0. No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

For node 10: Neighbors = 6, 14, 13. No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

For node 11: Neighbors = 5, 8, 0, 12, 14. Formed 1 3-star <11, (5, 8, 0)>.

For node 12: Neighbors = 3, 2, 8, 6, 14, 11. Formed 1 3-star <12, (3, 2, 8)>.

For node 13: Neighbors = 7, 1, 3, 6, 10. No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

For node 14: Neighbors = 7, 1, 12, 11, 10. Formed 1 3-star <14, (7, 1, 12)>.

Therefore, a total of [4] unique 3-stars are formed in the given graph.
