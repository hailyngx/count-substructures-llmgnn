Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 13) (26, 9) (26, 23) (26, 11) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 27) (8, 23) (8, 11) (23, 26) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 24) (0, 28) (0, 24) (20, 21) (20, 22) (20, 5) (5, 20) (5, 4) (5, 27) (6, 15) (6, 12) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (18, 24) (18, 7) (21, 20) (21, 10) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 25) (22, 20) (22, 7) (22, 1) (10, 21) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 16) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 15) (19, 14) (19, 16) (19, 27) (7, 18) (7, 22) (7, 10) (11, 26) (11, 8) (1, 28) (1, 22) (1, 10) (1, 29) (1, 2) (29, 1) (29, 16) (29, 15) (3, 17) (3, 16) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 29) (16, 3) (16, 24) (24, 23) (24, 0) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 24) (2, 14) (2, 23) (2, 1) (15, 14) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 29) (25, 28) (27, 17) (27, 5) (27, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 neighbors: 28, 24
- Node 1 neighbors: 28, 22, 10, 2, 29
- Node 2 neighbors: 14, 23, 1
- Node 3 neighbors: 17, 16
- Node 4 neighbors: 5, 12, 13
- Node 5 neighbors: 20, 4, 27
- Node 6 neighbors: 15, 12
- Node 7 neighbors: 18, 22, 10
- Node 8 neighbors: 23, 11
- Node 9 neighbors: 26, 13
- Node 10 neighbors: 21, 7, 1, 16
- Node 11 neighbors: 26, 8
- Node 12 neighbors: 6, 4, 15
- Node 13 neighbors: 9, 4, 24
- Node 14 neighbors: 17, 19, 15, 2
- Node 15 neighbors: 14, 6, 12, 29
- Node 16 neighbors: 3, 19, 10, 29, 24
- Node 17 neighbors: 14, 3, 27
- Node 18 neighbors: 24, 7
- Node 19 neighbors: 14, 16, 27
- Node 20 neighbors: 21, 22, 5
- Node 21 neighbors: 20, 10
- Node 22 neighbors: 20, 7, 1
- Node 23 neighbors: 26, 8, 2, 24
- Node 24 neighbors: 0, 18, 16, 13, 23
- Node 25 neighbors: 28
- Node 26 neighbors: 9, 23, 11
- Node 27 neighbors: 14, 5, 19
- Node 28 neighbors: 0, 1, 25
- Node 29 neighbors: 1, 16, 15

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors will contribute 0 to the 3-star count.
Nodes with more than 3 neighbors will contribute \( \binom{n}{3} \) to the 3-star count.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 46\]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 46, which we represent as [46].

Some unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (28, 22, 29)>
<4, (5, 12, 13)>
<10, (21, 7, 16)>
<14, (17, 19, 15)>
<16, (3, 19, 24)>
