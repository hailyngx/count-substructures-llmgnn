Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 9
- Node 3: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3

Next, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 8, and Node 9

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- <4, (7, 8, 0)>
- <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
