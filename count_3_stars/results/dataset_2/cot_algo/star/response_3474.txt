Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 27) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 5) (2, 16) (2, 29) (2, 9) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 15) (29, 4) (7, 29) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 22) (21, 28) (21, 4) (21, 22) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 27) (13, 18) (0, 27) (27, 11) (27, 13) (27, 0) (27, 14) (27, 20) (28, 21) (28, 19) (28, 10) (28, 20) (22, 7) (22, 21) (22, 26) (22, 3) (26, 22) (26, 24) (24, 26) (24, 1) (24, 25) (1, 24) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 23) (1, 18) (15, 29) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 18) (25, 7) (25, 24) (25, 6) (10, 8) (10, 28) (10, 15) (19, 8) (19, 28) (19, 23) (14, 27) (14, 1) (14, 12) (5, 16) (5, 18) (17, 18) (12, 14) (20, 7) (20, 27) (20, 28) (20, 3) (20, 9) (9, 2) (9, 20) (3, 22) (3, 20) (3, 6) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 17) (4, 29) (4, 21) (6, 25) (6, 3) (23, 1) (23, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors [27]
- Node 1: Neighbors [24, 15, 14, 18, 23]
- Node 2: Neighbors [16, 29, 9]
- Node 3: Neighbors [22, 20, 6]
- Node 4: Neighbors [29, 21]
- Node 5: Neighbors [16, 18]
- Node 6: Neighbors [25, 3]
- Node 7: Neighbors [29, 25, 20, 22]
- Node 8: Neighbors [13, 19, 10]
- Node 9: Neighbors [2, 20]
- Node 10: Neighbors [8, 15, 28]
- Node 11: Neighbors [16, 27]
- Node 12: Neighbors [14]
- Node 13: Neighbors [8, 27, 18]
- Node 14: Neighbors [27, 1, 12]
- Node 15: Neighbors [29, 1, 10, 18]
- Node 16: Neighbors [11, 2, 5]
- Node 17: Neighbors [18]
- Node 18: Neighbors [13, 1, 15, 5, 17]
- Node 19: Neighbors [8, 28, 23]
- Node 20: Neighbors [7, 27, 28, 3, 9]
- Node 21: Neighbors [28, 4, 22]
- Node 22: Neighbors [7, 21, 26, 3]
- Node 23: Neighbors [1, 19]
- Node 24: Neighbors [26, 25, 1]
- Node 25: Neighbors [7, 24, 6]
- Node 26: Neighbors [22, 24]
- Node 27: Neighbors [11, 13, 0, 14, 20]
- Node 28: Neighbors [21, 19, 10, 20]
- Node 29: Neighbors [2, 7, 15, 4]

Now, let's find out how many 3-stars can be formed:

- No 3-star can be formed with nodes with less than 3 neighbors.
- Nodes which can form 3-stars: 1, 15, 18, 20, 27

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 15, 18>, <1, 15, 5>, <1, 15, 10>, <1, 15, 23>, <1, 18, 13>, <1, 18, 15>, <1, 18, 5>, <1, 18, 17>, <15, 1, 10>, <15, 1, 18>, <15, 1, 5>, <15, 1, 23>, <15, 18, 13>, <15, 18, 5>, <15, 18, 17>, <18, 13, 27>, <18, 13, 15>, <18, 13, 5>, <18, 13, 17>, <18, 15, 27>, <18, 15, 5>, <18, 15, 17>, <18, 5, 27>, <18, 5, 17>, <20, 7, 27>, <20, 7, 28>, <20, 7, 3>, <20, 7, 9>, <20, 27, 11>, <20, 27, 13>, <20, 27, 14>, <20, 28, 21>, <20, 28, 19>, <20, 28, 10>, <20, 28, 3>, <20, 28, 9>, <27, 11, 16>, <27, 11, 13>, <27, 11, 20>, <27, 13, 8>, <27, 13, 18>, <27, 13, 14>
