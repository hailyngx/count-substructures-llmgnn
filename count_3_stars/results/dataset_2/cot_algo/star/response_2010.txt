This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 20) (3, 13) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 10) (25, 2) (22, 6) (23, 18) (23, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 24) (12, 21) (27, 25) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 18) (27, 5) (4, 23) (4, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 29) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 19) (21, 12) (21, 27) (21, 28) (21, 9) (28, 21) (28, 17) (28, 7) (13, 3) (13, 16) (16, 13) (16, 29) (16, 20) (16, 15) (26, 5) (26, 15) (5, 27) (5, 26) (5, 29) (20, 3) (20, 16) (20, 29) (20, 9) (29, 0) (29, 16) (29, 5) (29, 20) (11, 7) (11, 15) (17, 28) (17, 24) (6, 22) (6, 14) (6, 19) (18, 23) (18, 27) (19, 14) (19, 6) (9, 21) (9, 20) (7, 8) (7, 28) (7, 11) (7, 10) (15, 16) (15, 26) (15, 11) (2, 25) (24, 12) (24, 17) (10, 25) (10, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 14, 16, 20, 21, 25, 27, 29.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (3-stars: <3, (1, 13, 25)>, <3, (1, 20, 25)>, <3, (1, 8, 25)>, <3, (13, 20, 25)>, <3, (13, 8, 25)>, <3, (20, 8, 25)>, <3, (1, 13, 8)>, <3, (1, 20, 13)>, <3, (1, 20, 8)>, <3, (13, 20, 8)>)
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars: <4, (0, 12, 23)>, <4, (0, 12, 8)>, <4, (0, 12, 27)>, <4, (8, 12, 23)>)
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars: <7, (10, 11, 28)>, <7, (11, 15, 28)>, <7, (7, 10, 28)>, <7, (7, 11, 28)>)
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars: <8, (1, 14, 3)>, <8, (1, 4, 14)>, <8, (14, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 14, 4)>)
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars: <12, (4, 21, 27)>, <12, (4, 21, 24)>, <12, (4, 21, 12)>, <12, (21, 24, 27)>)
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars: <14, (1, 6, 19)>, <14, (1, 8, 6)>, <14, (6, 8, 19)>, <14, (1, 19, 8)>)
For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars: <16, (13, 15, 20)>, <16, (13, 15, 29)>, <16, (20, 15, 29)>, <16, (13, 20, 29)>)
For node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars: <20, (9, 16, 20)>, <20, (9, 16, 29)>, <20, (16, 29, 20)>, <20, (9, 29, 16)>)
For node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars: <21, (9, 12, 27)>, <21, (9, 12, 21)>, <21, (9, 27, 21)>, <21, (12, 27, 21)>)
For node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars: <25, (2, 10, 27)>, <25, (2, 10, 25)>, <25, (2, 25, 27)>, <25, (10, 25, 27)>)
For node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (3-stars: <27, (5, 12, 18)>, <27, (5, 12, 27)>, <27, (5, 18, 21)>, <27, (5, 21, 12)>, <27, (12, 18, 21)>, <27, (12, 21, 27)>, <27, (18, 21, 24)>, <27, (18, 21, 5)>, <27, (18, 24, 27)>, <27, (21, 24, 5)>)
For node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars: <29, (5, 16, 20)>, <29, (5, 16, 29)>, <29, (5, 20, 29)>, <29, (16, 20, 29)>)

Total number of 3-stars: 49, so the final answer is [49].
