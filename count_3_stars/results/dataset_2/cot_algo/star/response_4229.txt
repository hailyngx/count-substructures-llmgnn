Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 56

Therefore, the final answer is [56], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
