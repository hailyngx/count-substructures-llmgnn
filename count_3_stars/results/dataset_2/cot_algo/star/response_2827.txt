Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 10) (1, 19) (21, 0) (21, 4) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 27) (9, 19) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 23) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 11) (20, 25) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 10) (8, 27) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 18) (27, 5) (27, 9) (27, 8) (27, 12) (27, 26) (6, 25) (6, 17) (6, 11) (16, 4) (16, 19) (7, 13) (7, 23) (7, 26) (4, 21) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 23) (26, 5) (26, 27) (26, 7) (26, 29) (2, 5) (2, 11) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 24) (24, 11) (24, 10) (17, 3) (17, 6) (0, 21) (0, 23) (29, 26) (29, 23) (29, 22) (10, 1) (10, 25) (10, 12) (10, 24) (23, 3) (23, 7) (23, 4) (23, 0) (23, 29) (22, 29) (18, 12) (14, 5) (14, 15) (14, 20) (14, 13) (14, 19) (19, 1) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 21, 23
Node 1: 10, 19
Node 2: 5, 11
Node 3: 15, 17, 19, 23
Node 4: 12, 16, 21, 23
Node 5: 2, 9, 14, 26, 27
Node 6: 11, 17, 25
Node 7: 13, 23, 26
Node 8: 27
Node 9: 5, 19, 27
Node 10: 1, 12, 24, 25
Node 11: 2, 6, 24
Node 12: 4, 10, 18, 27
Node 13: 7, 14, 15
Node 14: 5, 13, 19, 20
Node 15: 3, 13, 14
Node 16: 4, 19
Node 17: 3, 6
Node 18: 12
Node 19: 1, 3, 9, 14, 16
Node 20: 14, 25
Node 21: 0, 4
Node 22: 29
Node 23: 0, 3, 4, 7, 29
Node 24: 10, 11
Node 25: 6, 10, 20
Node 26: 5, 7, 27, 29
Node 27: 5, 8, 9, 12, 26
Node 29: 22, 23, 26

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 29
Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: None

The total number of 3-stars formed is [11].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (15, 17, 23)>
<4, (12, 16, 21)>
<11, (2, 6, 24)>
<12, (10, 18, 27)>
<13, (7, 14, 15)>
<14, (5, 19, 20)>
<15, (3, 13, 14)>
<16, (4, 19, 21)>
<17, (3, 6, 17)>
<20, (14, 20, 25)>
<29, (23, 26, 29)>
