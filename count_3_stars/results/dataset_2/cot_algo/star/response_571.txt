Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: node 4, node 6, and node 7.

For node 4:
Neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 8
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 6:
Neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 6)>

For node 7:
Neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 9
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 = 24
Therefore, the final answer is [24].
