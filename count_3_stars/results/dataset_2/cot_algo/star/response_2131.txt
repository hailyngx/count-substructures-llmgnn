Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {2, 8, 11}
- Node 5: {3, 11}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 9, 10}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {3, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 4, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {3, 7, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {6, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 14: {6, 10, 11, 13}

Now, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14

For each of these nodes, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 10: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 11: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 12: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 13: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 14: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 67

Therefore, the final answer is [67] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <1, 11, 14>
- <1, 6, 13>
- <1, 6, 14>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <3, 10, 12>
- <4, 8, 9>
- <6, 11, 14>
- <7, 12, 13>
- <9, 12, 13>
