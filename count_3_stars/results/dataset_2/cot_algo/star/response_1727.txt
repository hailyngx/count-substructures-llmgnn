Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the adjacency list for each node:

Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
Node 1: {0, 5, 8, 9}
Node 2: {0, 6, 9}
Node 3: {0, 4, 7, 8}
Node 4: {3, 5, 6, 7}
Node 5: {1, 4, 7}
Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 9}
Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
Node 8: {1, 3, 7}
Node 9: {1, 6, 7, 2}

Next, we identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Only the node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars are:
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
