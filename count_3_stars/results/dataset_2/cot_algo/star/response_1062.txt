Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 20) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 4) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 25) (5, 21) (9, 5) (9, 1) (22, 23) (22, 26) (23, 22) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 28) (18, 28) (18, 29) (8, 4) (8, 25) (8, 21) (4, 15) (4, 17) (4, 8) (28, 23) (28, 18) (28, 29) (28, 21) (29, 18) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 11) (21, 5) (21, 8) (21, 28) (21, 12) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 27) (1, 9) (1, 24) (0, 3) (0, 23) (0, 10) (0, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (10, 3) (10, 0) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 27) (24, 1) (25, 17) (25, 5) (25, 8) (25, 13) (11, 29) (27, 3) (27, 29) (27, 26) (27, 6) (16, 23) (16, 19) (20, 3) (20, 26) (20, 13) (2, 14) (2, 19) (19, 7) (19, 16) (19, 2) (19, 13) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 25) (13, 20) (13, 19) (12, 5) (12, 21) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {3, 6, 10, 23}
Node 1: {9, 24}
Node 2: {14, 19}
Node 3: {0, 10, 15, 20, 27}
Node 4: {8, 15, 17}
Node 5: {8, 9, 12, 21, 25}
Node 6: {0, 15, 27}
Node 7: {13, 19}
Node 8: {4, 5, 8, 21, 25}
Node 9: {1, 5}
Node 10: {0, 3}
Node 11: {29}
Node 12: {5, 21}
Node 13: {7, 13, 15, 19, 20, 25}
Node 14: {2, 17}
Node 15: {3, 4, 6, 13, 17}
Node 16: {19, 23}
Node 17: {4, 14, 15, 25}
Node 18: {28, 29}
Node 19: {2, 7, 13, 16}
Node 20: {3, 13, 26}
Node 21: {5, 8, 12, 21}
Node 22: {23, 26}
Node 23: {0, 16, 22, 28}
Node 24: {1}
Node 25: {5, 8, 13, 17}
Node 26: {20, 22, 27}
Node 27: {3, 6, 26, 29}
Node 28: {18, 23, 29}
Node 29: {11, 18, 27, 28}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Nodes forming 3-stars: {3, 15, 27, 19, 23, 25, 14}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
There are 4 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, so the total number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [4].

Unique 3-stars found:
<3, (0, 15, 27)>
<15, (3, 4, 6)>
<27, (3, 26, 29)>
<19, (7, 13, 25)>
