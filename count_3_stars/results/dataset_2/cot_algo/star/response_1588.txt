- Node 17 has degree 5
- Node 18 has degree 3
- Node 19 has degree 3
- Node 20 has degree 4
- Node 21 has degree 3
- Node 22 has degree 3
- Node 23 has degree 1
- Node 24 has degree 5
- Node 25 has degree 3

- Node 27 has degree 4
- Node 28 has degree 1
- Node 29 has degree 4

We will now identify the 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 15: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 17: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 18: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 19: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 20: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 21: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 22: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 24: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 25: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 26: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 27: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 29: inom{4}{3} = 4

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 76

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [76].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 27>, <1, 0, 7>, <1, 0, 20>, <1, 2, 20>, <1, 5, 24>, <1, 7, 26>, <1, 19, 29>, <1, 20, 27>, <2, 1, 22>, <2, 1, 20>, <2, 16, 15>, <2, 20, 26>, <5, 1, 24>, <5, 1, 28>, <5, 24, 13>, <5, 24, 23>, <5, 24, 25>, <7, 1, 10>, <10, 7, 26>, <10, 9, 27>, <10, 17, 6>, <15, 11, 29>, <15, 13, 24>, <15, 16, 2>, <15, 21, 26>, <18, 17, 29>, <20, 1, 27>, <20, 2, 26>, <20, 26, 21>, <24, 5, 13>, <24, 5, 23>, <24, 5, 25>, <25, 5, 19>, <26, 21, 12>
