Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, we have:
  - Node 0: 1 3-star
  - Node 3: 1 3-star
  - Node 4: 1 3-star
  - Node 7: 1 3-star
  - Node 9: 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 5, so the final answer is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
