Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 4, 9, 8, 2
- Node 1: 7, 6, 9
- Node 2: 9, 5, 3, 0
- Node 3: 4, 6, 9, 8, 2
- Node 4: 9, 0, 3, 5
- Node 5: 4, 7, 8, 2
- Node 6: 7, 1, 3
- Node 7: 6, 5, 1, 8
- Node 8: 7, 5, 0, 3
- Node 9: 4, 2, 3, 1, 0

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

There are no nodes with exactly 3 neighbors to form a 3-star.

Finally, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 4 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 8) = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
