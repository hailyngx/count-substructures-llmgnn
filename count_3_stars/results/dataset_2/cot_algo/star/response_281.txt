Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 9, 3}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 9, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7, 0, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 9, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 8, 2}
- Node 6: {9, 3, 2, 4, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {6, 1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 2, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 3: has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars involving node 3.
- Node 4: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars involving node 4.
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars involving node 5.
- Node 6: has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) possible 3-stars involving node 6.
- Node 8: has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars involving node 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 48 \), and the unique 3-stars found are:

<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 0)>
<3, (1, 7, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 8, 4)>
<3, (5, 7, 4)>
<3, (7, 4, 8)>
<4, (6, 9, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (9, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [48].
