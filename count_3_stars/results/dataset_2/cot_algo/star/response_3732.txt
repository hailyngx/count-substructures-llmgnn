Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors (since only they can form 3-stars):
- Node 0, 4, 5, 6, and 9 have 5 neighbors each.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
Total = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <0, 4, 6>
