Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 14) (16, 5) (14, 16) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 13) (12, 13) (12, 15) (12, 19) (5, 16) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 8) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 4) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 0) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 8) (18, 7) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 13) (3, 17) (1, 11) (1, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 2) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 15) (10, 2) 

Response:
The central idea here is to identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node and then check for any possible 3-stars that can be formed.

Let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 16, 8}
- Node 1: {11, 4}
- Node 2: {9, 5, 10, 4}
- Node 3: {17}
- Node 4: {17, 19, 1, 2}
- Node 5: {16, 19, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 15}
- Node 7: {6, 18, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 19}
- Node 9: {2, 6}
- Node 10: {2}
- Node 11: {16, 1, 13, 0}
- Node 12: {13, 15, 19}
- Node 13: {11, 7, 12, 15}
- Node 14: {16, 17}
- Node 15: {17, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 16: {11, 14, 5, 0}
- Node 17: {14, 3, 15, 4}
- Node 18: {7}
- Node 19: {12, 5, 8, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0: [1] 3-star
- Node 1: [1] 3-star
- Node 4: [1] 3-star
- Node 5: [1] 3-star
- Node 7: [1] 3-star
- Node 8: [1] 3-star
- Node 11: [1] 3-star
- Node 13: [1] 3-star
- Node 15: [1] 3-star
- Node 16: [1] 3-star
- Node 17: [1] 3-star
- Node 19: [1] 3-star

So, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 11, 16> 
- <1, 4, 17>
- <2, 5, 19>
- <3, 15, 17>
- <6, 7, 13>
- <8, 0, 19>
- <9, 2, 6>
- <10, 2, 5>
- <12, 13, 15>
- <14, 16, 17>
- <18, 7, 13>
- <11, 0, 16>
