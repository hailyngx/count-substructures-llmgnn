Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 18) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 19) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 16) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 10) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 0) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 12) (2, 12) (2, 11) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 8) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 19) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 2) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 7) (19, 17) (19, 7) (10, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {5, 12, 18}
Node 1: {8, 9, 16}
Node 2: {11, 12}
Node 3: {6, 9, 15, 17}
Node 4: {9, 10, 18}
Node 5: {0, 6, 8, 13, 18}
Node 6: {3, 5, 13, 16}
Node 7: {11, 14, 16, 19}
Node 8: {1, 5, 14}
Node 9: {1, 3, 4}
Node 10: {4}
Node 11: {2, 7, 13}
Node 12: {0, 2, 14}
Node 13: {5, 6, 11}
Node 14: {7, 8, 12}
Node 15: {3, 18}
Node 16: {1, 6, 7}
Node 17: {3, 19}
Node 18: {0, 4, 5, 15}
Node 19: {7, 17}

Now, for each node with 3 or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
Node 16: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
Node 18: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]

Adding these up: 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
