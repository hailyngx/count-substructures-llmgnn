Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 18) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 13) (16, 19) (6, 9) (6, 25) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 1) (22, 28) (22, 24) (23, 5) (23, 14) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 26) (27, 2) (27, 20) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (28, 11) (28, 22) (28, 10) (28, 2) (28, 20) (20, 27) (20, 28) (20, 29) (20, 18) (29, 20) (29, 0) (29, 14) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 3) (19, 16) (19, 8) (14, 23) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 21) (26, 12) (26, 14) (26, 21) (21, 14) (21, 26) (0, 29) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 18) (5, 23) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (24, 16) (24, 22) (24, 25) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (2, 27) (2, 28) (2, 25) (15, 0) (15, 17) (13, 16) (13, 12) (25, 6) (25, 24) (25, 2) (18, 11) (18, 20) (18, 3) (10, 28) (10, 3) (17, 15) (17, 4) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 17) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: {9, 7, 5}
2: {27, 28, 25}
3: {8, 0, 18, 10}
4: {11, 0, 17}
5: {23, 7, 0, 1}
6: {9, 25, 8}
7: {12, 5, 1}
8: {6, 19, 3}
9: {6, 1}
10: {28, 3}
11: {16, 28, 18, 4}
12: {7, 13, 26}
13: {16, 12}
14: {23, 29, 26, 21}
15: {0, 17}
16: {11, 24, 13, 19}
17: {15, 4}
18: {11, 20, 3}
19: {16, 8}
20: {27, 28, 29, 18}
21: {14, 26}
22: {28, 24}
23: {5, 14}
24: {16, 22, 25}
25: {6, 24, 2}
26: {12, 14, 21}
27: {2, 20}
28: {11, 22, 10, 2, 20}
29: {20, 0, 14}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: <1, (9, 7, 5)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: <2, (27, 28, 25)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1 3-star with this node
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: <4, (11, 0, 17)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: <5, (23, 7, 0)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: <6, (9, 25, 8)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: <7, (12, 5, 1)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: <8, (6, 19, 3)>
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: <11, (16, 28, 18)>
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: <12, (7, 13, 26)>
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: <14, (23, 29, 26)>
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 1 3-star with this node
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 1 3-star with this node
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: <20, (27, 28, 29)>
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: <21, (14, 26)>
- Node 23 has 2 neighbors, not forming a 3-star
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors: <24, (16, 22, 25)>
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: <25, (6, 24, 2)>
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: <26, (12, 14, 21)>
- Node 27 has 2 neighbors, not forming a 3-star
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors: 1 3-star with this node
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: <29, (20, 0, 14)>

Total number of 3-stars = 12, so the answer is [12].
