Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's first identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 6, 8}

Based on the neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 4, 8, and 9 have 5, 5, and 5 neighbors respectively, which means they can form 3-stars. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up gives us a total of \( 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- <9, (2, 5, 6)>
