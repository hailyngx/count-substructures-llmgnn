Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 5) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) 

Response:
The central idea here is to first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 7, 10, 11, 13, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 13, 14, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 7, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 10, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 7, 0, 11}
- Node 5: Neighbors {13, 11, 2, 3, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 10, 12, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9, 4, 0, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 2, 3, 1, 7, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {6, 11, 0, 3, 12}
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 10, 0, 5}
- Node 12: Neighbors {6, 9, 10, 0, 14, 1}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 1, 0}
- Node 14: Neighbors {5, 1, 12}

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we have a total of 80 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [80]. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 4, 7, 10>, <0, 4, 7, 11>, <0, 4, 10, 11>, <0, 7, 10, 11>, <9, 6, 10, 12>, <9, 6, 12, 13>, <9, 6, 12, 14>, <9, 10, 12, 14>, <9, 12, 13, 14>, <12, 14, 1, 13>.
