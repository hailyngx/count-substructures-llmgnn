Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5, 7, 2}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 47

Therefore, the final answer is [47], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>
