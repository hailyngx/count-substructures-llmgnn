Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 18) (21, 3) (21, 9) (21, 12) (15, 0) (15, 4) (27, 14) (3, 21) (3, 25) (3, 16) (3, 19) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 23) (4, 15) (8, 9) (8, 26) (17, 25) (17, 29) (17, 6) (17, 2) (29, 17) (29, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 26) (28, 11) (28, 23) (22, 26) (22, 0) (22, 24) (26, 8) (26, 6) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 7) (11, 28) (11, 2) (5, 29) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 20) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 0) (20, 5) (20, 10) (18, 1) (18, 26) (18, 5) (19, 1) (19, 3) (9, 21) (9, 25) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 16) (12, 21) (12, 14) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 7) (24, 23) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 24) (16, 2) (14, 27) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 2) (7, 26) (7, 24) (0, 15) (0, 22) (0, 13) (0, 9) (23, 25) (23, 28) (23, 24) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 20) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 14) 

Response:
The 3-star graph in this network can be found by determining the neighbor sets for each node and then identifying the 3-stars.

- Node 0 neighbors: {15, 22, 13, 9}
- Node 1 neighbors: {10, 19}
- Node 2 neighbors: {17, 11, 16, 14}
- Node 3 neighbors: {21, 25, 19, 16, 9}
- Node 4 neighbors: {15}
- Node 5 neighbors: {29, 13, 18, 20}
- Node 6 neighbors: {17, 14, 26}
- Node 7 neighbors: {26, 24}
- Node 8 neighbors: {9, 26}
- Node 9 neighbors: {21, 25, 8, 0, 16}
- Node 10 neighbors: {1, 13, 20}
- Node 11 neighbors: {28, 2}
- Node 12 neighbors: {21, 14}
- Node 13 neighbors: {5, 10, 0}
- Node 14 neighbors: {27, 6, 12, 2}
- Node 15 neighbors: {0, 4}
- Node 16 neighbors: {3, 9, 24, 2}
- Node 17 neighbors: {25, 29, 6, 2}
- Node 18 neighbors: {1, 5, 26}
- Node 19 neighbors: {1, 3}
- Node 20 neighbors: {5, 10}
- Node 21 neighbors: {3, 9, 12}
- Node 22 neighbors: {26, 0, 24}
- Node 23 neighbors: {25, 28, 24}
- Node 24 neighbors: {22, 26, 7, 16, 23}
- Node 25 neighbors: {3, 17, 9, 23}
- Node 26 neighbors: {8, 6, 22, 18, 7}
- Node 27 neighbors: {14}
- Node 28 neighbors: {11, 23}
- Node 29 neighbors: {17, 5}

Only three nodes have neighbor sets with three or more elements: Node 3, Node 9, and Node 16. We can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \). 

Thus, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <3, (21, 25, 9)>
- <9, (21, 25, 3)>
- <16, (3, 9, 24)>
