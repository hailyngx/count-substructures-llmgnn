Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 8, 7, 5}
- Node 1: {7, 5}
- Node 2: {6, 4, 7, 3, 5}
- Node 3: {2, 5}
- Node 4: {6, 9, 8, 0, 5, 2}
- Node 5: {4, 0, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 6: {9, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {9, 0, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 0}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 4, 7, 0}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars from each node: 
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 0, 5)>
- <0, (4, 1, 5)>
- <0, (4, 2, 5)>
- <0, (4, 3, 5)>
- <0, (4, 2, 5)>
- <0, (5, 1, 3)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 3)>
- <4, (6, 5, 9)>
- <4, (6, 5, 9)>
- <4, (6, 0, 5)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 3)>
- <5, (0, 1, 3)>
