Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 18) (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 1) (17, 23) (17, 2) (3, 6) (25, 6) (25, 19) (22, 23) (22, 18) (22, 20) (23, 17) (23, 22) (23, 16) (23, 20) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 29) (21, 20) (21, 15) (12, 7) (12, 27) (12, 0) (12, 29) (27, 12) (27, 0) (18, 14) (18, 22) (18, 8) (8, 18) (8, 5) (8, 24) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 20) (0, 12) (0, 27) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 20) (26, 10) (26, 15) (26, 4) (10, 26) (10, 15) (10, 16) (15, 21) (15, 26) (15, 10) (15, 5) (2, 17) (2, 9) (2, 28) (6, 3) (6, 25) (6, 24) (6, 4) (24, 8) (24, 6) (24, 16) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 19) (29, 7) (29, 12) (29, 5) (29, 4) (19, 25) (19, 11) (19, 16) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 29) (28, 2) (20, 22) (20, 23) (20, 21) (20, 13) (20, 1) (16, 23) (16, 10) (16, 24) (16, 19) (9, 2) (4, 14) (4, 13) (4, 26) (4, 6) (4, 29) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {12, 27}
- Node 1: {11, 17, 20}
- Node 2: {9, 17, 28}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 4: {6, 13, 14, 26, 29}
- Node 5: {8, 15, 29}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 24, 25}
- Node 7: {11, 12, 29}
- Node 8: {5, 18, 24}
- Node 9: {2}
- Node 10: {15, 16, 26}
- Node 11: {1, 7, 19}
- Node 12: {0, 7, 27, 29}
- Node 13: {4, 14, 20}
- Node 14: {4, 13, 18}
- Node 15: {1, 5, 10, 21, 26}
- Node 16: {10, 16, 19, 23, 24}
- Node 17: {1, 2, 23}
- Node 18: {8, 14, 22}
- Node 19: {11, 16, 19, 25}
- Node 20: {1, 13, 20, 21, 22}
- Node 21: {15, 20}
- Node 22: {18, 20, 23}
- Node 23: {16, 17, 20, 22}
- Node 24: {6, 8, 16}
- Node 25: {6, 19}
- Node 26: {4, 10, 15}
- Node 27: {0, 12}
- Node 28: {2}
- Node 29: {4, 5, 7, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, 13, 20>, <5, 15, 21>, <6, 4, 25>, <6, 4, 29>, <6, 24, 16>, <12, 0, 27>, <15, 1, 26>, <15, 10, 26>, <15, 21, 20>, <15, 21, 26>, <16, 19, 25>, <16, 19, 23>, <16, 19, 10>, <16, 23, 20>, <16, 24, 8>, <16, 24, 9>, <16, 24, 19>, <16, 24, 14>, <16, 24, 4>, <16, 24, 29>, <24, 6, 25>, <24, 8, 18>, <24, 8, 5>, <24, 8, 20>, <24, 8, 22>, <24, 8, 14>, <29, 4, 5>, <29, 4, 12>, <29, 4, 7>, <29, 4, 11>, <29, 4, 1>
