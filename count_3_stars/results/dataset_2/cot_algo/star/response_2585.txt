Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 8, 2
- Node 1: 3, 8
- Node 2: 5, 9, 6, 0
- Node 3: 9, 7, 1, 8
- Node 4: 5, 7, 8, 6
- Node 5: 9, 2, 4, 0, 7
- Node 6: 4, 7, 2, 0
- Node 7: 5, 9, 4, 3, 6
- Node 8: 4, 1, 3, 0
- Node 9: 5, 2, 3, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 each have three or more neighbors.

Next, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, there's 1 3-star each.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node:
    - Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 2)>
- <0, (5, 8, 2)>
- <0, (6, 8, 2)>
- <2, (5, 9, 6)>
- <2, (5, 6, 0)>
- <2, (9, 6, 0)>
- <3, (9, 7, 1)>
- <3, (9, 1, 8)>
- <3, (7, 1, 8)>
- <3, (7, 3, 8)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (7, 4, 8)>
- <4, (7, 3, 8)>
- <4, (7, 6, 8)>
- <5, (9, 2, 6)>
- <5, (9, 2, 0)>
- <5, (9, 6, 0)>
- <5, (2, 6, 0)>
- <7, (5, 9, 4)>
- <7, (5, 4, 6)>
- <7, (5, 4, 8)>
- <7, (5, 4, 3)>
- <7, (9, 4, 6)>
- <7, (9, 4, 3)>
- <7, (4, 8, 3)>
- <7, (4, 6, 3)>
- <9, (5, 2, 3)>
- <9, (5, 7, 3)>
- <9, (2, 3, 7)>
- <9, (7, 3, 6)>
