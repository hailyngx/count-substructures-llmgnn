Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Nodes 0, 5, and 9 have 5, 5, and 6 neighbors respectively, so they can form \(  inom{n}{3} \) 3-stars. 
Finding the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of 40 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
Thus, the final answer is [40].
