Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 14) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 13) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 13}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 6}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 8: {2, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {7, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 8, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 6: <6, (2, 9, 10)>, <6, (2, 9, 13)>, <6, (2, 10, 13)>, <6, (9, 10, 13)>, <6, (3, 4, 14)>
- Node 14: <14, (2, 8, 11)>, <14, (2, 8, 4)>, <14, (2, 11, 4)>, <14, (8, 11, 4)>

Total number of 3-stars formed: [13]
