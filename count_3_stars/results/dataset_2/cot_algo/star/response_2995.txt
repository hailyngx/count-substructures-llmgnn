Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a visualization of the given graph:

Node 5: 0, 3, 6
Node 6: 1, 5, 9
Node 9: 1, 2, 6, 7
Node 2: 3, 4, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 7
Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
Node 8: 1, 2, 7
Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7
Node 1: 0, 6, 8, 9
Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 49.

Therefore, the final answer, represented inside brackets [], is [49].
