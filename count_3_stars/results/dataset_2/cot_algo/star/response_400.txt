Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and the total number of edges is 40 in this graph. Let's first list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 6, 8, 7}
- Node 1: {6, 2, 8, 9, 4}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 9, 2}
- Node 4: {6, 2, 1}
- Node 5: {2, 0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 8, 0, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 0, 7, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {7, 3, 1}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, and calculate how many 3-stars can be formed with each of them:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding all the 3-stars formed by nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 47

Therefore, the final answer is [47].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 5, 7>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <1, 3, 8>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <2, 4, 1>
- <2, 8, 7>
- <3, 5, 8>
- <7, 5, 8>
