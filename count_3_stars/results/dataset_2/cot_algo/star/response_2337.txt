Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 10) (16, 15) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 18) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 14) (17, 19) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 19) (3, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 15) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 19) (18, 13) (18, 12) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 3) (19, 1) (4, 13) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 12) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 18) (12, 15) 

Response:
The first step is to build the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {9, 14, 7, 12, 2}
Node 1 neighbors: {5, 2, 19}
Node 2 neighbors: {8, 0, 1, 7}
Node 3 neighbors: {11, 5, 19, 12}
Node 4 neighbors: {13}
Node 5 neighbors: {6, 1, 3}
Node 6 neighbors: {9, 5}
Node 7 neighbors: {0, 2, 15}
Node 8 neighbors: {9, 13, 2}
Node 9 neighbors: {6, 8, 10, 0}
Node 10 neighbors: {16, 9, 14}
Node 11 neighbors: {16, 3, 19}
Node 12 neighbors: {0, 3, 18, 15}
Node 13 neighbors: {8, 4, 18}
Node 14 neighbors: {10, 0}
Node 15 neighbors: {16, 7, 12}
Node 16 neighbors: {11, 10, 15}
Node 17 neighbors: {19}
Node 18 neighbors: {13, 12}
Node 19 neighbors: {11, 17, 3, 1}

Next, we identify the nodes that can form 3-star graphs:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 17
Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19

For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star formed:
- Node 17: <17, (19, 1, 11)>

For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node:

- Node 0: 10 3-stars
- Node 2: 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 3 3-stars
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 4 3-stars
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 4 3-stars
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 38

Therefore, the final answer is [38].
