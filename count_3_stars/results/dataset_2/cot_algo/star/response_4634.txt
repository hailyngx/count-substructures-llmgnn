Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 14) (15, 1) (15, 8) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (16, 1) (2, 5) (2, 3) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 2) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 19) (11, 6) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 13) (3, 2) (3, 6) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 19) (18, 6) (13, 0) (13, 19) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 18) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<8, (7, 15, 17)>
<9, (7, 12, 19)>
<14, (1, 7, 19)>
<19, (7, 11, 13)>
<8, (9, 15, 17)>
<11, (6, 12, 19)>
<19, (11, 13, 14)>
<6, (3, 11, 18)>
