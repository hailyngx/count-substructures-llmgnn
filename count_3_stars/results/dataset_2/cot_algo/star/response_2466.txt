Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 4, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 7, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 4, 1, 0, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 9, 0, 6, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 8, 4, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 7, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9, 1, 6, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 2, 7, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 53

So, the final answer is [53], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>
