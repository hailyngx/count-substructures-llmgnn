This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 23) (21, 27) (21, 8) (21, 17) (0, 27) (0, 12) (0, 26) (27, 21) (27, 0) (27, 4) (20, 28) (28, 20) (28, 29) (28, 14) (28, 13) (29, 28) (29, 9) (29, 13) (29, 15) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 25) (5, 17) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 26) (6, 8) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 22) (3, 12) (4, 27) (17, 1) (17, 21) (17, 5) (17, 16) (9, 29) (9, 3) (9, 25) (9, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 22) (2, 10) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 7) (15, 29) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 18) (15, 16) (19, 15) (19, 10) (19, 13) (7, 22) (7, 14) (25, 5) (25, 9) (25, 23) (8, 21) (8, 5) (8, 6) (14, 28) (14, 22) (14, 7) (14, 24) (26, 0) (26, 6) (16, 17) (16, 15) (24, 14) (23, 1) (23, 15) (23, 25) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 19) (18, 15) (18, 12) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 18) (13, 28) (13, 29) (13, 3) (13, 19)

- Node 1: {17, 2, 23}
- Node 2: {1, 9, 22, 10}
- Node 3: {13, 9, 22, 12}
- Node 4: {27}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 17, 25, 10}
- Node 6: {5, 26, 8}
- Node 7: {22, 14}
- Node 8: {21, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 25, 29}
- Node 10: {5, 2, 19}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 18}
- Node 13: {28, 29, 3, 19}

- Node 24: {14}
- Node 25: {5, 9, 23}
- Node 26: {0, 6}
- Node 27: {21, 0, 4}

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star: <1, 2, 23>)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars: <2, 9, 22>, <2, 9, 10>, <2, 22, 14>, <2, 22, 7>)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars: <3, 13, 9>, <3, 13, 22>, <3, 9, 25>, <3, 22, 7>)

- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star: <10, 19, 13>)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star: <12, 18, 3>)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars: <13, 28, 29>, <13, 28, 3>, <13, 28, 19>, <13, 19, 10>)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars: <14, 24, 7>, <14, 24, 28>, <14, 24, 22>, <14, 28, 22>)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars: <15, 18, 12>, <15, 18, 23>, <15, 18, 16>, <15, 18, 15>, <15, 23, 1>, <15, 23, 25>, <15, 23, 19>, <15, 23, 15>, <15, 16, 17>, <15, 16, 21>)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (not enough neighbors)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars: <17, 21, 16>, <17, 21, 5>, <17, 21, 1>, <17, 21, 8>)
- Node 18: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (not enough neighbors)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star: <19, 15, 29>)
- Node 20: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (not enough neighbors)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star: <21, 27, 8>)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars: <22, 14, 7>, <22, 14, 28>, <22, 14, 24>, <22, 7, 2>)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star: <23, 15, 1>)
- Node 24: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (not enough neighbors)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star: <25, 23, 5>)
- Node 26: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (not enough neighbors)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star: <27, 21, 0>)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars: <28, 13, 29>, <28, 13, 19>, <28, 13, 3>, <28, 19, 10>)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars: <29, 15, 19>, <29, 15, 23>, <29, 15, 16>, <29, 15, 18>)

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is obtained by summing up these individual counts: 

\( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 61 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [61].
