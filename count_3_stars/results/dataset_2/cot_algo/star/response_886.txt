Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 17) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 19) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 17) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 16) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 18) (17, 11) (17, 2) (17, 1) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 19) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 9) (7, 13) (7, 16) (16, 14) (16, 7) (16, 3) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 18) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 19) (12, 11) (12, 8) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) 

Response:
First, let's create a table to represent the adjacency list of the provided graph:

| Node | Neighbors      |
|------|----------------|
| 0    | 3, 8, 19       |
| 1    | 9, 15, 17, 18 |
| 2    | 9, 10, 17      |
| 3    | 0, 4, 16, 18   |
| 4    | 3, 8, 14, 16   |
| 5    | 13             |
| 6    | 11, 13         |
| 7    | 13, 16         |
| 8    | 0, 4, 12, 19   |
| 9    | 1, 2, 19       |
| 10   | 2, 14          |
| 11   | 6, 12, 17      |
| 12   | 8, 11          |
| 13   | 5, 6, 7, 15, 18|
| 14   | 4, 10, 16      |
| 15   | 1, 13, 19      |
| 16   | 3, 4, 7, 14    |
| 17   | 1, 2, 11       |
| 18   | 1, 3, 13       |
| 19   | 0, 8, 9, 15    |

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 34.

Therefore, the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (9, 15, 17)>
<1, (9, 15, 18)>
<1, (9, 17, 18)>
<1, (15, 17, 18)>
<3, (4, 16, 18)>
<4, (8, 12, 19)>
<13, (7, 15, 18)>
<19, (0, 8, 9)>
