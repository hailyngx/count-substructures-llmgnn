Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 3) (11, 26) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 22) (16, 19) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 17) (29, 11) (29, 13) (29, 5) (7, 21) (7, 18) (7, 8) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 3) (21, 18) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 4) (18, 2) (18, 7) (18, 21) (18, 4) (28, 11) (28, 5) (28, 23) (3, 11) (3, 21) (3, 4) (3, 20) (17, 2) (17, 20) (17, 5) (20, 3) (20, 17) (20, 13) (20, 27) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 0) (5, 29) (5, 28) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 22) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 14) (0, 15) (0, 25) (10, 2) (10, 21) (10, 13) (10, 23) (14, 19) (26, 11) (26, 25) (25, 0) (25, 26) (27, 20) (27, 24) (27, 9) (6, 23) (12, 24) (12, 22) (12, 9) (23, 28) (23, 10) (23, 6) (23, 9) (9, 27) (9, 12) (9, 23) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 12) (24, 27) (24, 12) (13, 29) (13, 20) (13, 10) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 11: {16, 28, 3, 26, 29}
- Node 16: {11, 22, 19}
- Node 2: {18, 8, 10, 17}
- Node 29: {11, 13, 5}
- Node 7: {21, 18, 8}
- Node 21: {7, 10, 3, 18}
- Node 4: {8, 18, 3}
- Node 8: {2, 7, 4}
- Node 18: {2, 7, 21, 4}
- Node 28: {11, 5, 23}
- Node 3: {11, 21, 4, 20}
- Node 17: {2, 20, 5}
- Node 20: {3, 17, 13, 27}
- Node 1: {15}
- Node 15: {1, 0}
- Node 5: {29, 28, 17, 19, 22}
- Node 19: {16, 5, 14}
- Node 0: {15, 25}
- Node 10: {2, 21, 13, 23}
- Node 14: {19}
- Node 26: {11, 25}
- Node 25: {0, 26}
- Node 27: {20, 24, 9}
- Node 6: {23}
- Node 12: {24, 22, 9}
- Node 9: {27, 12, 23}
- Node 22: {16, 5, 12}
- Node 24: {27, 12}
- Node 13: {29, 20, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed by Node 11
- Only 1 3-star is formed by Node 29
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed by Node 21
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed by Node 18
- Only 1 3-star is formed by Node 28
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed by Node 3
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed by Node 20
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed by Node 5
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed by Node 10

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 38 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <11, (16, 3, 26)>
- <11, (16, 28, 29)>
- <11, (3, 4, 21)>
- <11, (3, 20, 29)>
- <11, (4, 20, 29)>
- <11, (3, 21, 29)>
- <11, (20, 21, 29)>
- <11, (3, 20, 21)>
- <11, (3, 4, 21)>
- <11, (4, 18, 21)>
- <29, (5, 13, 20)>
- <21, (3, 4, 18)>
- <18, (2, 4, 8)>
- <3, (4, 20, 21)>
- <20, (13, 17, 27)>
- <5, (17, 19, 22)>
- <10, (13, 21, 23)>
- <10, (13, 20, 23)>
