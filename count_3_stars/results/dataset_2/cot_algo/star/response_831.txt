Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 12) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 10) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 13) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 10) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 7, 11}
- Node 1: {12, 11, 10}
- Node 2: {9, 6, 8, 4, 12}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 6, 13}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 13, 14, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 4, 3, 10}
- Node 6: {3, 2, 4, 13}
- Node 7: {9, 0, 11}
- Node 8: {2, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 2, 11, 3, 7}
- Node 10: {5, 14, 12, 1}
- Node 11: {9, 13, 0, 14, 7, 1}
- Node 12: {13, 2, 10, 1}
- Node 13: {6, 4, 11, 3, 12}
- Node 14: {4, 11, 10}

Next, we identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 68

Therefore, the final answer is [68], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <2, (4, 12, 13)>
- <4, (2, 5, 13)>
- <5, (3, 9, 4)>
- <9, (2, 5, 11)>
- <11, (9, 13, 14)>
- <12, (1, 10, 13)>
- <13, (6, 11, 3)>
