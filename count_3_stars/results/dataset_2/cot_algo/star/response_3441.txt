Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {8, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {5, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 8, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 7, 11}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 10}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 3, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {2, 8}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 5, 6, 10}
- Node 14: {4, 7, 12}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 1: \( \text{{inom}}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \text{{inom}}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \text{{inom}}{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \text{{inom}}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \text{{inom}}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \text{{inom}}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \text{{inom}}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors is:

10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 68

Hence, the final answer is [68].

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 3, 10>
- <1, 4, 13>
- <1, 6, 13>
- <1, 10, 13>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 4, 10>
- <3, 4, 12>
- <3, 6, 12>
- <4, 7, 12>
- <6, 7, 12>
- <6, 12, 14>
- <7, 12, 14>
