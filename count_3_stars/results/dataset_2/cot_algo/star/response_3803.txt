Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 14) (26, 22) (26, 4) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 5) (2, 13) (2, 27) (2, 4) (8, 15) (8, 25) (22, 9) (22, 26) (22, 11) (17, 0) (17, 20) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 12) (20, 17) (20, 18) (20, 16) (20, 10) (18, 20) (18, 10) (18, 12) (29, 13) (10, 20) (10, 18) (10, 15) (10, 23) (15, 8) (15, 10) (15, 6) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (16, 17) (16, 20) (16, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (6, 15) (6, 24) (6, 12) (6, 4) (11, 14) (11, 22) (11, 19) (11, 21) (24, 6) (24, 19) (24, 25) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 7) (19, 11) (19, 24) (19, 28) (19, 13) (25, 8) (25, 24) (25, 28) (25, 21) (27, 2) (13, 2) (13, 29) (13, 19) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 6) (28, 19) (28, 25) (21, 11) (21, 25) (21, 23) (23, 10) (23, 21) (5, 14) (5, 7) (4, 26) (4, 2) (4, 6) 

Response:
The 3-star graph in this case has one central node linked to three other nodes. Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {1, 3, 17}
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {4, 13, 27}
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {2, 6, 26}
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {4, 12, 15, 24}
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {1, 5, 14}
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {15, 18, 20, 23}
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: {14, 19, 22}
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: {2, 19, 29, 13}
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {5, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: {6, 8, 10}
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: {7, 17, 20}
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors: {0, 3, 12, 16, 20}
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: {11, 13, 24, 28}
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: {10, 16, 17, 18}
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: {11, 23, 25}
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors: {6, 19, 25}
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors: {8, 21, 24, 28}
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: {4, 22, 26}
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors: {19, 25, 28}

Now let's calculate the 3-stars based on the above information:

- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 10 (Node 10)
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 8 (Nodes 6, 13, 14, 20)
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 1 (Node 17)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 17)>
- <2, (4, 13, 27)>
- <4, (2, 6, 26)>
- <6, (4, 12, 15)>
- <7, (1, 5, 14)>
- <10, (15, 18, 20)>
- <13, (2, 19, 29)>
- <14, (5, 7, 9)>
- <15, (6, 8, 10)>
- <17, (0, 3, 12)>
- <19, (11, 13, 24)>
- <20, (10, 16, 18)>
- <21, (11, 23, 25)>
- <24, (6, 19, 25)>
- <25, (8, 21, 24)>
- <26, (4, 22, 26)>
- <27, (2, 27, 28)>
- <28, (19, 25, 28)>
- <17, (0, 16, 20)>
