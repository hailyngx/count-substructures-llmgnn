Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in terms of its adjacent nodes:

Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 8  
Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 9  
Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8  
Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 8, 9  
Node 4: 8, 9  
Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 7  
Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 7  
Node 7: 2, 5, 6  
Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 4  
Node 9: 1, 3, 4

Now, let's check each node to see if it forms a 3-star and count the total number of unique 3-stars:

\[ \text{Node 0}: \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Node 1}: \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Node 2}: \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Node 3}: \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Node 4}: \text{No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors} \]
\[ \text{Node 5}: \text{No 3-star as it has 3 neighbors but all of them are connected} \]
\[ \text{Node 6}: \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Node 7}: \text{No 3-star as it has 3 neighbors but all of them are connected} \]
\[ \text{Node 8}: \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Node 9}: \text{No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors} \]

The total number of unique 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 32, so the answer is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 6 ,7>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <0, 2, 8>.
