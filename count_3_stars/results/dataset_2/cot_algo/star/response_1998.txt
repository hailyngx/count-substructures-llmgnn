Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 14) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 11) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 1) (4, 5) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (11, 2) (11, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighborhood set for each node:

Node 0: {9, 3, 13}
Node 1: {9, 2, 14, 10}
Node 2: {7, 12, 1, 11}
Node 3: {6, 9, 0, 14, 10, 13}
Node 4: {5, 13}
Node 5: {7, 12, 8, 4, 11}
Node 6: {9, 3, 13}
Node 7: {12, 10, 2, 5, 13}
Node 8: {9, 5, 14}
Node 9: {6, 8, 10, 3, 1, 0}
Node 10: {9, 7, 3, 1}
Node 11: {2, 5}
Node 12: {7, 2, 14, 5}
Node 13: {6, 7, 0, 3, 4}
Node 14: {12, 8, 3, 1}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors: Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 82 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [82].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 3, 13)>
<1, (9, 2, 14)>
<1, (9, 10, 3)>
<1, (2, 11, 5)>
<2, (7, 12, 5)>
<7, (12, 14, 5)>
<7, (10, 3, 1)>
<3, (6, 9, 13)>
<3, (10, 9, 1)>
<3, (14, 12, 1)>
<5, (7, 12, 8)>
<8, (9, 5, 14)>
<9, (6, 3, 13)>
<9, (10, 7, 1)>
<9, (8, 5, 14)>
<10, (9, 7, 3)>
<12, (7, 2, 5)>
<13, (6, 7, 0)>
<13, (10, 1, 3)>
<13, (4, 5, 13)>
<14, (12, 8, 3)>
<14, (1, 9, 2)>
