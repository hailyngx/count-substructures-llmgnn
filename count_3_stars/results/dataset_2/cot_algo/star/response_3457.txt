Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 9) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 14) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {4, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 2: {5, 10, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 8, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 6: {5, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 8, 12}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 11: {6, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 11}
- Node 14: {3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12}

Now, let's determine how many 3-stars can be formed with each node:

- Node 1: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 4: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 5: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 7: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 8: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 9: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 10: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 12: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 14: 6 choose 3 = 20

The total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes is 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 66.

Therefore, the final answer is [66], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 5, 13)>, <4, (8, 9, 14)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 12)>, <8, (4, 7, 14)>, <9, (1, 4, 12)>, <10, (2, 6, 11)>, <12, (2, 3, 14)>, <14, (8, 9, 12)>.
