Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edge list for each node:

Node 0: {9, 7, 8, 6, 3, 1}
Node 1: {7, 2, 0}
Node 2: {5, 4, 8, 1}
Node 3: {5, 8, 0}
Node 4: {9, 7, 8, 2}
Node 5: {9, 2, 3}
Node 6: {7, 8, 0}
Node 7: {4, 0, 6, 1}
Node 8: {9, 4, 2, 0, 6, 3}
Node 9: {5, 8, 4, 0}

Now we can see that nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

Node 0: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 2: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( inom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 8: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 20 = 48 \).

So, the final answer is [48] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (9, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<8, (9, 4, 2)>
<8, (9, 0, 6)>
