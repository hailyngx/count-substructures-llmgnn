Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 26) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 2) (27, 3) (27, 5) (18, 4) (18, 5) (22, 5) (22, 29) (12, 27) (12, 8) (12, 26) (7, 24) (7, 1) (4, 18) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 25) (17, 6) (17, 23) (29, 22) (29, 16) (29, 26) (11, 21) (28, 3) (28, 25) (5, 27) (5, 18) (5, 22) (5, 13) (5, 15) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 6) (1, 7) (1, 16) (1, 24) (1, 8) (15, 5) (15, 16) (8, 12) (8, 1) (19, 25) (19, 10) (2, 27) (2, 9) (2, 6) (3, 27) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 10) (14, 9) (6, 0) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 2) (24, 7) (24, 1) (24, 3) (24, 23) (20, 26) (26, 0) (26, 12) (26, 29) (26, 20) (21, 0) (21, 11) (21, 23) (9, 2) (9, 14) (25, 4) (25, 28) (25, 13) (25, 19) (16, 4) (16, 29) (16, 1) (16, 15) (16, 10) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 3) (10, 16) (23, 17) (23, 24) (23, 21) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 27, 21, 26, 6
- Node 1: 7, 16, 24, 8
- Node 2: 27, 9, 6
- Node 3: 27, 28, 24, 10
- Node 4: 18, 10, 16, 25
- Node 5: 27, 18, 22, 13, 15
- Node 6: 0, 17, 13, 2
- Node 7: 24, 1
- Node 8: 12, 1
- Node 9: 2, 14
- Node 10: 4, 19, 3, 16
- Node 11: 21
- Node 12: 27, 8, 26
- Node 13: 5, 25, 6
- Node 14: 9
- Node 15: 5, 16
- Node 16: 4, 29, 1, 15, 10
- Node 17: 6, 23
- Node 18: 4, 5
- Node 19: 25, 10
- Node 20: 26
- Node 21: 0, 11, 23
- Node 22: 5, 29
- Node 23: 17, 24, 21
- Node 24: 7, 1, 3, 23
- Node 25: 4, 28, 13, 19
- Node 26: 0, 12, 29, 20
- Node 27: 0, 12, 2, 3, 5
- Node 28: 3, 25
- Node 29: 22, 16, 26

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 27 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 = 24

Thus, the final answer is [24].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (27, 21, 26)>
- <0, (27, 21, 6)>
- <0, (27, 26, 6)>
- <5, (27, 18, 22)>
- <5, (27, 18, 13)>
- <5, (27, 22, 13)>
- <5, (18, 22, 13)>
- <5, (22, 29, 16)>
- <5, (22, 26, 20)>
- <27, (5, 18, 22)>
- <27, (5, 18, 13)>
- <27, (18, 22, 13)>
- <27, (12, 8, 1)>
- <27, (12, 26, 29)>
- <27, (8, 1, 24)>
- <27, (26, 29, 20)>
