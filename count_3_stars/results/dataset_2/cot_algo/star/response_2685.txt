Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 12) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 19) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 0) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 16) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 5) (13, 5) (13, 17) (15, 1) (15, 4) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 16) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 19) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 17) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 10) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 14) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Applying the rules mentioned above, we start by listing the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 11}
- Node 1: {11, 12, 15}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 16}
- Node 3: {10, 16, 19}
- Node 4: {0, 14, 15, 18}
- Node 5: {0, 8, 13, 17}
- Node 6: {8, 9}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {5, 6}
- Node 9: {6, 12, 19}
- Node 10: {3, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 10, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {5, 17}
- Node 14: {4, 10, 11, 19}
- Node 15: {1, 4}
- Node 16: {2, 3, 17, 18}
- Node 17: {5, 13, 16}
- Node 18: {4, 16}
- Node 19: {3, 9, 14}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 61 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 61, which we denote as [61].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 15>, <0, 4, 18>, <0, 5, 13>, <0, 5, 17>, <0, 11, 14>, <1, 10, 12>, <1, 10, 11>, <1, 11, 14>, <2, 16, 17>, <3, 10, 14>, <3, 10, 16>, <3, 14, 19>, <4, 10, 14>, <4, 14, 19>, <5, 13, 17>, <9, 12, 19>, <10, 11, 14>, <16, 17, 18>, <16, 17, 3>, <17, 13, 5>, <19, 9, 14>
