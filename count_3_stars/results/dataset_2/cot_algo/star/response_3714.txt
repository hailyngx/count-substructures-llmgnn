Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 4) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 17) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 5) (8, 16) (8, 19) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 18) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 17) (2, 4) (18, 10) (18, 13) (18, 2) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 19) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 0) (12, 16) (5, 3) (5, 10) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 0) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (9, 16) (9, 4) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 17, 19}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 17, 18, 19}
- Node 3: {5, 15}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {3, 10}
- Node 6: {4, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 13}
- Node 8: {6, 16, 19}
- Node 9: {4, 16}
- Node 10: {4, 5, 11, 18, 19}
- Node 11: {4, 10, 15, 16}
- Node 12: {16}
- Node 13: {7, 18}
- Node 15: {3, 11, 17}
- Node 16: {8, 9, 11, 12, 17}
- Node 17: {0, 2, 15, 16}
- Node 18: {2, 10, 13}
- Node 19: {0, 2, 8, 10}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 5 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 16: 5 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 48 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (4, 10, 19)>
- <4, (2, 10, 19)>
- <10, (2, 4, 19)>
- <16, (8, 9, 17)>
- <17, (0, 15, 16)>
- <19, (0, 2, 10)>
