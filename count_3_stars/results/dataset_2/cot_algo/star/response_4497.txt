Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 3) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 4) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 4) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 12}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 9, 11}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {10, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 10: {1, 4, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 12: {0, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 7, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 10)> 
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (8, 13, 14)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (5, 6, 11)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (10, 11, 13)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (6, 9, 13)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (9, 10, 0)>

Since we found 6 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
