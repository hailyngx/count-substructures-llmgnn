Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 9, 4}
- Node 1: {6, 8, 2, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 2, 7}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 4, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 1, 7, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {6, 8, 2, 1, 3}
- Node 8: {1, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 0}

We can see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 53

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 9, 4)>, <1, (6, 8, 2)>, <1, (6, 8, 7)>, <1, (6, 2, 7)>, <1, (8, 2, 7)>, <2, (5, 1, 3)>, <2, (5, 1, 7)>, <2, (5, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (9, 6, 4)>, <5, (9, 6, 0)>, <5, (9, 4, 0)>, <5, (6, 4, 0)>, <5, (2, 6, 3)>, <6, (9, 1, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (7, 2, 3)>
