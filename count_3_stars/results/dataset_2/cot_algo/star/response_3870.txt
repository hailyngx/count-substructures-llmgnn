Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (9, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (18, 14) (18, 7) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 19) (11, 2) (11, 1) (0, 16) (0, 12) (7, 18) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 11) (15, 8) (15, 17) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 12) (17, 15) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 8) (4, 6) (4, 5) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 5) (16, 3) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 17) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 8) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 10) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 14) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 19) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 10) 

Response:
The center node and its neighbors are as follows:
- Center node 0 is connected to neighbors {16, 12}.
- Center node 1 is connected to neighbors {2, 11, 6}.
- Center node 2 is connected to neighbors {1, 13, 11}.
- Center node 3 is connected to neighbors {16, 13, 19}.
- Center node 4 is connected to neighbors {6, 5}.
- Center node 5 is connected to neighbors {4, 12, 10}.
- Center node 6 is connected to neighbors {9, 1, 10, 4}.
- Center node 7 is connected to neighbors {18, 16, 19, 14}.
- Center node 8 is connected to neighbors {15, 17, 14}.
- Center node 9 is connected to neighbors {6}.
- Center node 10 is connected to neighbors {6, 5, 19}.
- Center node 11 is connected to neighbors {2, 1}.
- Center node 12 is connected to neighbors {0, 13, 17, 5}.
- Center node 13 is connected to neighbors {2, 3, 17, 12}.
- Center node 14 is connected to neighbors {18, 7, 8}.
- Center node 15 is connected to neighbors {8, 17}.
- Center node 16 is connected to neighbors {3, 0, 7, 17}.
- Center node 17 is connected to neighbors {15, 13, 16, 12, 8}.
- Center node 18 is connected to neighbors {14, 7}.
- Center node 19 is connected to neighbors {3, 7, 10}.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
- Center node 1, 2, 3, 7, 12, 13, and 17 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes.

For each node with 3 or more neighbors, the number of 3-stars formed is given by the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- For center node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For center node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For center node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For center node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For center node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For center node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For center node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 25, and we can represent them as:
<[1, (2, 11, 6)], [2, (1, 11, 6)], [3, (16, 13, 19)], [7, (18, 16, 19)], [12, (0, 17, 5)], [13, (2, 17, 12)], [17, (15, 16, 8)>
