Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 27) (11, 13) (22, 23) (22, 20) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 1) (23, 6) (23, 27) (17, 10) (17, 24) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 16) (20, 22) (20, 15) (20, 7) (21, 0) (28, 14) (28, 13) (26, 25) (8, 10) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 1) (19, 8) (19, 16) (4, 5) (4, 12) (12, 4) (18, 15) (18, 25) (18, 1) (3, 22) (3, 27) (7, 10) (7, 20) (7, 27) (7, 1) (1, 23) (1, 8) (1, 18) (1, 7) (1, 29) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 25) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 14) (2, 25) (0, 21) (0, 6) (6, 23) (6, 15) (6, 29) (6, 0) (24, 17) (24, 13) (25, 26) (25, 18) (25, 29) (25, 2) (25, 14) (27, 11) (27, 23) (27, 3) (27, 7) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 2) (13, 11) (13, 28) (13, 24) (13, 14) (14, 28) (14, 2) (14, 25) (14, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {21, 6}
- Node 1: {23, 8, 18, 7, 29}
- Node 2: {5, 16, 14, 25}
- Node 3: {22, 27}
- Node 4: {5, 12}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 4}
- Node 6: {23, 15, 29, 0}
- Node 7: {10, 20, 27, 1}
- Node 8: {10, 19, 16, 1}
- Node 9: {5}
- Node 10: {11, 17, 8, 7}
- Node 11: {10, 27, 13}
- Node 12: {4}
- Node 13: {11, 28, 24, 14}
- Node 14: {28, 2, 25, 13}
- Node 15: {20, 18, 6}
- Node 16: {8, 19, 2, 15}
- Node 17: {10, 24}
- Node 18: {15, 25, 1}
- Node 19: {8, 16}
- Node 20: {22, 15, 7}
- Node 21: {0}
- Node 22: {23, 20, 3}
- Node 23: {22, 1, 6, 27}
- Node 24: {17, 13}
- Node 25: {26, 18, 29, 2, 14}
- Node 26: {25}
- Node 27: {11, 3, 7, 23}
- Node 28: {14, 13}
- Node 29: {1, 6, 25}

Nodes 5, 10, 11, 15, 16, 23, 25, and 29 have at least 3 neighbors, so we will count the number of 3-stars formed around these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <5, 2, 4>
- <10, 8, 19>
- <10, 8, 16>
- <10, 17, 8>
- <10, 7, 27>
- <11, 10, 27>
- <15, 18, 25>
- <15, 16, 18>
- <15, 20, 7>
- <15, 6, 23>
- <16, 15, 18>
- <16, 8, 19>
- <16, 2, 14>
- <16, 19, 8>
- <23, 1, 6>
- <23, 6, 29>
- <23, 27, 3>
- <23, 22, 20>
- <25, 2, 14>
- <25, 2, 16>
- <25, 2, 25>
- <25, 2, 18>
- <25, 13, 14>
- <25, 13, 28>
- <25, 14, 28>
- <25, 14, 13>
- <29, 1, 6>
