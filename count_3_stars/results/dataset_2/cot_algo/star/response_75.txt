Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 12) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 10) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 9) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 9) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 9, 12}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 5: {1, 8, 10}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {2, 10, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 11: {9, 12}
- Node 12: {2, 7, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 14: {6, 7, 9}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1: <1, (3, 5, 10)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 12, 14)>
- Node 9: <9, (10, 11, 14)>

Since each 3-star is unique, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
