Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 3, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7

Calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing these up, we have a total of 58 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer is [58].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (0, 2, 7)>
