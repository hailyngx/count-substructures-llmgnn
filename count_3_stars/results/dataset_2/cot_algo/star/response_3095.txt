Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 6}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 7, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 8, 0, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 4}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 0, 6, 2}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 2, 7, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with this node.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 54, so the final answer is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (6, 1, 3)>
- <4, (6, 3, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
