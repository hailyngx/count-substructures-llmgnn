Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {10, 2, 14}
- Node 1: {5, 7}
- Node 2: {8, 13, 3, 0}
- Node 3: {9, 2, 6}
- Node 4: {7, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 8, 12, 1, 14}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 14, 3}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 11, 6, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 13, 2}
- Node 9: {5, 11, 3, 7, 13}
- Node 10: {11, 0, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {9, 7, 10, 14, 12}
- Node 12: {5, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {9, 10, 8, 2}
- Node 14: {5, 11, 0, 6, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: Node 0, Node 3, Node 6, Node 13
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: None
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: Node 1, Node 4, Node 8, Node 9, Node 12, Node 14
- Nodes with 7 neighbors: Node 2, Node 7, Node 10, Node 11

For the nodes with 4 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 35 + 35 + 4 + 35 = 195

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [195].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 10, 12>
<0, 10, 13>
<0, 12, 14>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 8, 13>
<3, 6, 14>
<4, 6, 7>
<7, 8, 13>
<7, 9, 13>
<7, 9, 5>
<7, 11, 14>
<11, 9, 13>
<11, 12, 14>
