Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (27, 15) (27, 29) (3, 19) (3, 9) (25, 7) (25, 8) (25, 10) (8, 25) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 23) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 29) (1, 8) (1, 14) (26, 16) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 7) (6, 17) (6, 2) (11, 28) (11, 7) (11, 29) (11, 20) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 18) (17, 6) (17, 20) (17, 22) (20, 11) (20, 17) (20, 16) (7, 25) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 18) (10, 25) (10, 21) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 29) (21, 5) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 18) (21, 2) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 14) (22, 17) (12, 5) (12, 28) (12, 10) (12, 16) (16, 26) (16, 20) (16, 12) (29, 27) (29, 4) (29, 11) (29, 10) (0, 21) (0, 24) (23, 15) (23, 13) (23, 2) (24, 0) (24, 18) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 19) (9, 3) (9, 13) (2, 6) (2, 21) (2, 23) (18, 28) (18, 7) (18, 21) (18, 24) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighborhood of each node:

- Node 0: {21, 24}
- Node 1: {8, 14}
- Node 2: {6, 21, 23}
- Node 3: {9, 19}
- Node 4: {8, 13, 14, 29}
- Node 5: {7, 12, 21}
- Node 6: {2, 17}
- Node 7: {5, 8, 11, 18, 25}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 7, 25}
- Node 9: {3, 13}
- Node 10: {7, 10, 12, 19, 21, 29}
- Node 11: {7, 11, 20, 28, 29}
- Node 12: {5, 10, 16, 28}
- Node 13: {4, 9, 23}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 19}
- Node 15: {23, 27}
- Node 16: {12, 16, 20, 26}
- Node 17: {6, 17, 20, 22}
- Node 18: {7, 18, 21, 24, 28}
- Node 19: {3, 10, 14}
- Node 20: {11, 16, 17}
- Node 21: {2, 5, 10, 18}
- Node 22: {17}
- Node 23: {2, 13, 15}
- Node 24: {0, 18}
- Node 25: {7, 8, 10}
- Node 26: {16}
- Node 27: {15, 27, 29}
- Node 28: {11, 16, 18, 28}
- Node 29: {4, 10, 11, 27}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 72 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [72]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (8, 13, 14)>
- <7, (8, 10, 25)>
- <10, (7, 11, 29)>
- <11, (7, 20, 28)>
- <18, (7, 18, 21)>
- <21, (5, 10, 18)>
- <25, (7, 8, 10)>
- <27, (15, 29, 27)>
- <28, (11, 16, 18)>
- <29, (4, 10, 11)>
