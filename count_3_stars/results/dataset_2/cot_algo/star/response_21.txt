Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 27) (3, 5) (25, 3) (25, 5) (25, 15) (25, 28) (25, 14) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 8) (7, 24) (7, 19) (12, 15) (12, 23) (12, 9) (2, 9) (8, 1) (22, 0) (22, 29) (26, 15) (26, 27) (26, 4) (9, 12) (9, 2) (13, 21) (13, 6) (17, 23) (17, 4) (20, 23) (20, 10) (15, 25) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 26) (15, 11) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 27) (16, 24) (16, 10) (24, 7) (24, 16) (24, 28) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 5) (0, 22) (0, 21) (0, 28) (0, 4) (28, 25) (28, 24) (28, 0) (28, 18) (14, 25) (14, 29) (14, 5) (19, 7) (5, 3) (5, 25) (5, 21) (5, 14) (29, 22) (29, 14) (10, 20) (10, 16) (10, 27) (10, 4) (27, 3) (27, 26) (27, 6) (27, 10) (27, 11) (11, 15) (11, 27) (11, 18) (23, 12) (23, 17) (23, 20) (4, 26) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 10) (18, 28) (18, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 22, 21, 28, 4
Node 1 neighbors: 3, 15, 6, 8
Node 2 neighbors: 9
Node 3 neighbors: 25, 1, 6, 27, 5
Node 4 neighbors: 26, 17, 0, 10
Node 5 neighbors: 3, 25, 21, 14
Node 6 neighbors: 3, 1, 13, 27
Node 7 neighbors: 24, 19
Node 8 neighbors: 1
Node 9 neighbors: 12, 2
Node 10 neighbors: 20, 16, 27, 4
Node 11 neighbors: 15, 27, 18
Node 12 neighbors: 15, 23, 9
Node 13 neighbors: 21, 6
Node 14 neighbors: 25, 29, 5
Node 15 neighbors: 25, 1, 12, 26, 11
Node 16 neighbors: 24, 10
Node 17 neighbors: 23, 4
Node 18 neighbors: 28, 11
Node 19 neighbors: 7
Node 20 neighbors: 23, 10
Node 21 neighbors: 13, 0, 5
Node 22 neighbors: 0, 29
Node 23 neighbors: 12, 17, 20
Node 24 neighbors: 7, 16, 28
Node 25 neighbors: 3, 5, 15, 28, 14
Node 26 neighbors: 15, 27, 4
Node 27 neighbors: 3, 6, 10, 11
Node 28 neighbors: 25, 24, 0, 18
Node 29 neighbors: 22, 14

Now, let's identify the 3-star formations:

Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 unique 3-stars:
<3, (25, 6, 27)>, <3, (25, 1, 5)>, <3, (25, 1, 6)>, <3, (25, 1, 27)>, <3, (25, 5, 27)>, 
<3, (6, 1, 5)>, <3, (6, 1, 27)>, <3, (6, 5, 27)>, <3, (1, 5, 27)>, and <3, (25, 1, 27)>

Node 25 has 5 neighbors, forming 10 unique 3-stars:
<25, (3, 6, 27)>, <25, (3, 1, 5)>, <25, (3, 1, 6)>, <25, (3, 1, 27)>, <25, (3, 5, 27)>, 
<25, (6, 1, 5)>, <25, (6, 1, 27)>, <25, (6, 5, 27)>, <25, (1, 5, 27)>, and <25, (3, 1, 27)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 = 20

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
