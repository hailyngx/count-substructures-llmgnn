Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 17) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 7) (10, 13) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 1) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 0) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 7) (6, 4) (6, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 16) (16, 13) (16, 7) (16, 14) (14, 6) (14, 16) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 12) (9, 2) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 19) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 18) (17, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 5, 19}
- Node 1: {15, 18, 7, 12}
- Node 2: {11, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 4: {9, 6, 2}
- Node 5: {0, 19}
- Node 6: {4, 14}
- Node 7: {13, 1, 16}
- Node 8: {13, 0}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 18, 12, 2}
- Node 10: {13, 11}
- Node 11: {10, 12, 17, 2}
- Node 12: {11, 1, 17, 9}
- Node 13: {8, 16, 10, 7, 13}
- Node 14: {6, 16}
- Node 15: {1, 19, 17}
- Node 16: {13, 7, 14}
- Node 17: {15, 11, 18, 12}
- Node 18: {9, 17, 1}
- Node 19: {15, 5, 0}

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 33 \)

Thus, the final number inside brackets is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (15, 1, 18)>
- <9, (9, 12, 18)>
- <12, (1, 12, 17)>
- <13, (7, 13, 16)>
- <15, (15, 1, 17)>
- <17, (11, 12, 17)>
