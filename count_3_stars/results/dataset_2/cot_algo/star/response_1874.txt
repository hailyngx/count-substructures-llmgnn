Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 12) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (0, 11) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 16) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 16) (4, 17) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 1) (13, 14) (13, 15) (8, 5) (8, 16) (9, 4) (9, 15) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 19) (1, 7) (1, 18) (1, 16) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 16) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 9) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 19) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {11}
- Node 1: {7, 18, 16}
- Node 2: {7, 3}
- Node 3: {10, 14, 2}
- Node 4: {18, 9, 16, 17}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 17}
- Node 6: {5, 16, 15}
- Node 7: {10, 12, 1, 2}
- Node 8: {5, 16}
- Node 9: {4, 15}
- Node 10: {11, 3, 7, 14}
- Node 11: {10, 19, 0, 18, 12}
- Node 12: {11, 7}
- Node 13: {14, 15}
- Node 14: {10, 3, 13}
- Node 15: {6, 13, 9}
- Node 16: {6, 4, 8, 1, 19}
- Node 17: {5, 4, 19}
- Node 18: {11, 4, 1}
- Node 19: {11, 17, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1 can form a 3-star with its neighbors: <1, (7, 18, 16)>
- Node 4 can form a 3-star with its neighbors: <4, (18, 9, 16)>, <4, (16, 17, 19)>
- Node 5 can form a 3-star with its neighbors: <5, (6, 8, 17)>
- Node 6 can form a 3-star with its neighbors: <6, (5, 16, 15)>
- Node 7 can form a 3-star with its neighbors: <7, (10, 12, 1)>
- Node 10 can form a 3-star with its neighbors: <10, (11, 3, 14)>
- Node 11 can form a 3-star with its neighbors: <11, (10, 19, 0)>, <11, (18, 12, 7)>, <11, (18, 4, 1)>, <11, (19, 17, 16)>
- Node 16 can form a 3-star with its neighbors: <16, (6, 4, 8)>, <16, (4, 8, 16)>, <16, (8, 1, 19)>, <16, (1, 19, 16)>
- Node 17 can form a 3-star with its neighbors: <17, (5, 4, 19)>
- Node 18 can form a 3-star with its neighbors: <18, (11, 4, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14]. The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (7, 18, 16)>, <4, (18, 9, 16)>, <4, (16, 17, 19)>, <5, (6, 8, 17)>, <6, (5, 16, 15)>, <7, (10, 12, 1)>, <10, (11, 3, 14)>, <11, (10, 19, 0)>, <11, (18, 12, 7)>, <11, (18, 4, 1)>, <11, (19, 17, 16)>, <16, (6, 4, 8)>, <16, (8, 1, 19)>, <17, (5, 4, 19)>.
