Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 6) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 11) (10, 4) (10, 12) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 11) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 12, 11}
- Node 1: {3, 14, 12, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 13, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 2, 4}
- Node 6: {9, 14, 2, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {4, 12, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 1, 2, 11}
- Node 9: {5, 13, 6, 4, 0}
- Node 10: {4, 12}
- Node 11: {4, 12, 8, 14, 0}
- Node 12: {7, 1, 6, 10, 0, 11}
- Node 13: {5, 9, 3, 6}
- Node 14: {1, 6, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 10, 14
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 2
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 4, 6, 13
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: 5, 9, 12
- Nodes with 7 neighbors: 11

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors, there are 7 3-stars (1 for each node).
- For nodes with 4 neighbors, there are 4 3-stars.
- For nodes with 5 neighbors, there are 10 3-stars.
- For nodes with 6 neighbors, there are 20 3-stars.
- For nodes with 7 neighbors, there are 35 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 7 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 35 = 76.

Therefore, the final answer (inside brackets) is [76], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 12, 11)>
<1, (3, 14, 8)>
<3, (1, 13, 2)>
<7, (4, 12, 8)>
<8, (7, 1, 2)>
<10, (4, 12, 0)>
<14, (1, 11, 6)>
<2, (5, 3, 6)>
<4, (9, 7, 10)>
<6, (9, 14, 13)>
<13, (5, 9, 3)>
<5, (9, 13, 6)>
<9, (5, 13, 4)>
<12, (7, 1, 0)>
