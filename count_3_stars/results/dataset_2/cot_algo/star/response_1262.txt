Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (7, 29) (7, 14) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 20) (3, 16) (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 18) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 21) (9, 17) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 18) (27, 12) (27, 11) (27, 28) (28, 27) (28, 29) (28, 18) (29, 7) (29, 28) (21, 9) (21, 16) (21, 22) (11, 3) (11, 27) (11, 19) (17, 9) (20, 3) (20, 6) (20, 2) (20, 23) (18, 13) (18, 12) (18, 28) (18, 14) (16, 3) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 15) (24, 6) (24, 16) (24, 0) (24, 10) (24, 23) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 23) (25, 2) (5, 4) (5, 25) (15, 8) (15, 16) (15, 19) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 0) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 22) (14, 10) (22, 21) (22, 14) (22, 0) (2, 13) (2, 20) (2, 25) (2, 10) (0, 24) (0, 19) (0, 22) (10, 24) (10, 14) (10, 2) (23, 20) (23, 24) (23, 25) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {24, 19, 22}
- Node 1: {3, 3}
- Node 2: {13, 20, 25, 10}
- Node 3: {1, 11, 20, 16}
- Node 4: {5}
- Node 5: {4, 25}
- Node 6: {9, 24, 20}
- Node 7: {29, 14}
- Node 8: {13, 15, 12}
- Node 9: {6, 25, 21, 17}
- Node 10: {24, 14, 2}
- Node 11: {3, 27, 19}
- Node 12: {8, 13, 27, 18}
- Node 13: {8, 12, 2, 18}
- Node 14: {7, 18, 22, 10}
- Node 15: {8, 16, 19}
- Node 16: {3, 21, 24, 15}
- Node 17: {9}
- Node 18: {13, 12, 28, 14}
- Node 19: {11, 15, 0}
- Node 20: {3, 6, 2, 23}
- Node 21: {9, 16, 22}
- Node 22: {21, 14, 0}
- Node 23: {20, 24, 25}
- Node 24: {6, 16, 0, 10, 23}
- Node 25: {9, 2, 23, 5}
- Node 27: {12, 28, 11}
- Node 28: {27, 29, 18}
- Node 29: {7, 28}

Now, for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: 3-stars = 0
- Node 2: 3-stars = 1
- Node 3: 3-stars = 1
- Node 6: 3-stars = 1
- Node 8: 3-stars = 1
- Node 9: 3-stars = 3
- Node 10: 3-stars = 1
- Node 11: 3-stars = 1
- Node 12: 3-stars = 3
- Node 13: 3-stars = 3
- Node 14: 3-stars = 1
- Node 15: 3-stars = 1
- Node 16: 3-stars = 1
- Node 18: 3-stars = 3
- Node 20: 3-stars = 1
- Node 21: 3-stars = 1
- Node 22: 3-stars = 1
- Node 24: 3-stars = 3
- Node 25: 3-stars = 1
- Node 27: 3-stars = 1
- Node 28: 3-stars = 3
- Node 29: 3-stars = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 24

Therefore, the final result is [24], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <2, 13, 18>
- <3, 1, 16>
- <6, 9, 24>
- <8, 12, 13>
- <9, 21, 25>
- <10, 14, 24>
- <11, 19, 27>
- <12, 13, 18>
- <13, 2, 18>
- <16, 15, 24>
- <18, 12, 28>
- <20, 2, 23>
- <24, 16, 0>
- <25, 2, 23>
- <27, 11, 28>
- <28, 18, 29>
