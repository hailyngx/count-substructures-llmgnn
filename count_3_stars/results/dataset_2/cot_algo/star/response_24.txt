Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 7) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {6, 3, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {6, 7, 11, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 9, 12}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 8, 11}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 10}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 6, 13, 12}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 13}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {5, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 4, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 9, 10, 13}

Next, we will identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (3, 4, 10)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (3, 6, 12)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (5, 11, 14)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (4, 10, 12)>

There are no other nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
