Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 14) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 11) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 1) (5, 11) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 12) (8, 4) (8, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (3, 4) (3, 11) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 15) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 12) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 9) (19, 2) (19, 13) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 19) (9, 17) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 14) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 9) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: {10, 8, 17, 13}
- Node 1: {10, 18, 15}
- Node 2: {18, 19, 11}
- Node 3: {4, 11}
- Node 4: {8, 3}
- Node 5: {11}
- Node 6: {17, 15, 12}
- Node 7: {16, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {4, 0}
- Node 9: {17, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 14}
- Node 11: {17, 2, 5, 3}
- Node 12: {6, 15, 9}
- Node 13: {7, 16, 0, 19}
- Node 14: {10, 7, 9}
- Node 15: {6, 1, 12}
- Node 16: {18, 7, 13}
- Node 17: {6, 0, 9, 11}
- Node 18: {2, 1, 16}
- Node 19: {2, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars: <0, (8, 13, 17)>, <0, (10, 13, 17)>
- Node 1 forms 3-stars: <1, (10, 15, 18)>
- Node 2 forms 3-stars: <2, (11, 18, 19)>
- Node 7 forms 3-stars: <7, (13, 14, 16)>
- Node 9 forms 3-stars: <9, (12, 14, 17)>
- Node 10 forms 3-stars: <10, (14, 17, 0)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [6] 3-stars formed in the given graph.
