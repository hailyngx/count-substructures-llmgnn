Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 12) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes with more than 3 neighbors: node 2 has 5 neighbors, node 4 has 4 neighbors, and node 14 has 6 neighbors.

For node 2:
- Neighbors: 10, 4, 0, 14, 1
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (10, 4, 0)>, <2, (10, 4, 14)>, <2, (10, 4, 1)>, <2, (10, 0, 14)>, <2, (10, 0, 1)>, <2, (10, 14, 1)>, <2, (4, 0, 14)>, <2, (4, 0, 1)>, <2, (4, 14, 1)>, <2, (0, 14, 1)>

For node 4:
- Neighbors: 8, 5, 2, 3
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (8, 5, 2)>, <4, (8, 5, 3)>, <4, (8, 2, 3)>, <4, (5, 2, 3)>

For node 14:
- Neighbors: 10, 6, 0, 3, 7, 2
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <14, (10, 6, 0)>, <14, (10, 6, 3)>, <14, (10, 6, 7)>, <14, (10, 6, 2)>, <14, (10, 0, 3)>, <14, (10, 0, 7)>, <14, (10, 0, 2)>, <14, (10, 3, 7)>, <14, (10, 3, 2)>, <14, (10, 7, 2)>, <14, (6, 0, 3)>, <14, (6, 0, 7)>, <14, (6, 0, 2)>, <14, (6, 3, 7)>, <14, (6, 3, 2)>, <14, (6, 7, 2)>, <14, (0, 3, 7)>, <14, (0, 3, 2)>, <14, (0, 7, 2)>, <14, (3, 7, 2)>

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 20 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is [34].
