Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 14) (11, 8) (11, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 1: {2, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 8, 10}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6, 8, 10}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 12}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 10, 14, 0}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 9: {8, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 8}
- Node 12: {1, 4, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 14: {1, 5, 7, 10}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 11)>, <0, (3, 7, 11)>, <0, (5, 7, 11)>

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<1, (2, 12, 13)>, <1, (2, 12, 14)>, <1, (2, 13, 14)>, <1, (12, 13, 14)>

Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<2, (5, 8, 10)>, <2, (5, 8, 14)>, <2, (5, 10, 14)>, <2, (8, 10, 14)>, <2, (1, 10, 14)>, <2, (1, 8, 10)>, <2, (1, 8, 14)>, <2, (1, 10, 14)>, <2, (10, 12, 14)>, <2, (8, 10, 12)>

Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<3, (0, 6, 12)>, <3, (0, 6, 10)>, <3, (0, 10, 14)>, <3, (0, 5, 14)>, <3, (4, 8, 10)>, <3, (4, 7, 10)>, <3, (7, 10, 14)>, <3, (7, 5, 14)>, <3, (5, 8, 14)>, <3, (5, 8, 10)>

Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<5, (0, 7, 14)>, <5, (2, 7, 10)>, <5, (7, 10, 14)>, <5, (7, 8, 14)>, <5, (7, 8, 10)>, <5, (2, 8, 10)>, <5, (2, 8, 14)>, <5, (2, 10, 14)>, <5, (0, 8, 14)>, <5, (0, 7, 14)>

Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<7, (0, 10, 14)>, <7, (0, 5, 14)>, <7, (5, 8, 14)>, <7, (5, 8, 10)>, <7, (2, 10, 14)>, <7, (2, 8, 14)>, <7, (2, 10, 10)>, <7, (0, 8, 14)>, <7, (0, 5, 14)>, <7, (0, 8, 5)>

Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so we have inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
<8, (9, 11, 13)>, <8, (9, 5, 11)>, <8, (9, 5, 13)>, <8, (9, 5, 14)>, <8, (11, 5, 13)>, <8, (11, 5, 14)>, <8, (11, 13, 14)>, <8, (5, 13, 14)>, <8, (5, 11, 13)>, <8, (5, 11, 14)>, <8, (3, 5, 10)>, <8, (3, 5, 2)>, <8, (3, 10, 14)>, <8, (3, 7, 10)>, <8, (3, 7, 14)>, <8, (3, 7, 5)>, <8, (3, 10, 14)>, <8, (3, 10, 14)>, <8, (3, 14, 5)>, <8, (3, 14, 10)>

Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so we don't have any 3-star

Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<10, (12, 14, 1)>, <10, (12, 14, 2)>, <10, (12, 14, 5)>, <10, (12, 14, 3)>, <10, (2, 5, 14)>, <10, (2, 5, 3)>, <10, (2, 14, 3)>, <10, (5, 14, 3)>, <10, (5, 14, 1)>, <10, (5, 14, 2)>

Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<12, (1, 10, 14)>, <12, (1, 9, 10)>, <12, (1, 6, 9)>, <12, (1, 6, 10)>, <12, (10, 14, 1)>, <12, (10, 14, 5)>, <12, (10, 14, 1)>, <12, (10, 14, 5)>, <12, (14, 6, 9)>, <12, (14, 6, 10)>

Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so we don't have any 3-star

Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<14, (1, 7, 10)>, <14, (1, 7, 5)>, <14, (1, 5, 10)>, <14, (7, 5, 10)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 4 = 92

Therefore, the final answer is [92].
