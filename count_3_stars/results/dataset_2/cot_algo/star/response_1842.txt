Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 5) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 7) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 4) (2, 18) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 12) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 6) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 11) (3, 2) (11, 2) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 19) (1, 10) (1, 15) (15, 13) (15, 1) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 19) (12, 18) (12, 16) (12, 0) (16, 14) (16, 12) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 19) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {6, 9, 12}
- Node 1: {10, 15}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 11, 18}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {10, 11, 18}
- Node 5: {6, 13, 17}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {2, 13, 19}
- Node 8: {9, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 8, 19}
- Node 10: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 6, 19}
- Node 12: {0, 16, 18}
- Node 13: {5, 7, 8, 15}
- Node 14: {8, 16, 17, 19}
- Node 15: {1, 13}
- Node 16: {12, 14}
- Node 17: {5, 14}
- Node 18: {2, 4, 12}
- Node 19: {7, 9, 11, 14}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get a total of 35 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final result is [35] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 6, 11>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 9, 19>, <0, 12, 16>, <1, 10, 4>, <2, 7, 11>, <4, 10, 6>, <7, 2, 13>, <8, 9, 19>, <11, 19, 14>, <12, 16, 14>, <13, 5, 17>, <14, 17, 5>, <15, 1, 13>
