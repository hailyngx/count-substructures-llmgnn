Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 0) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 13}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 10, 11}
- Node 6: {1, 9, 12}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 4, 5, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 7, 13}

Now, let's identify nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0, 4, 5, 10, 12, 13

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each:
1. Node 0: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)
2. Node 4: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3. Node 5: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 10: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
5. Node 12: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
6. Node 13: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \(20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 64\)

Therefore, the final answer is [64], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 10, 12)>, <4, (8, 10, 13)>, <5, (0, 10, 11)>, <10, (0, 1, 12)>, <12, (0, 6, 9)>, <13, (1, 8, 14)>
