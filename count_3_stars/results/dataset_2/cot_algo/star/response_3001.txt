Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 17) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 11) (2, 13) (2, 0) (18, 19) (18, 5) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 15) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 9) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 8) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 12) (5, 18) (5, 15) (8, 16) (8, 11) (9, 16) (9, 15) (9, 12) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 6) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 12) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 10, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7, 17}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 13}
- Node 3: Neighbors {12, 19}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors {15, 18}
- Node 6: Neighbors {10, 12, 16}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 11, 13, 16}
- Node 8: Neighbors {11, 16}
- Node 9: Neighbors {12, 15, 16}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 17}
- Node 11: Neighbors {7, 8, 14, 17}
- Node 12: Neighbors {3, 6, 9, 13, 15}
- Node 13: Neighbors {2, 7, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 11}
- Node 15: Neighbors {5, 9, 12, 19}
- Node 16: Neighbors {6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 17: Neighbors {1, 10, 11}
- Node 18: Neighbors {5, 19}
- Node 19: Neighbors {3, 15, 18}

Now, let's look for nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 10: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 11: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 12: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 15: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 16: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 31

Therefore, the final answer is [31], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 7, 17)>, <7, (1, 11, 16)>, <10, (0, 4, 17)>, <11, (7, 8, 17)>, <12, (6, 9, 15)>, <15, (5, 9, 19)>, <16, (6, 8, 9)>
