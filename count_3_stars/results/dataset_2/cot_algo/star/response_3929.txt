Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 9) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 10) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: neighbors {2, 13, 14}
- Node 1: neighbors {6, 9, 11}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 5, 7, 12}
- Node 3: neighbors {5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {7, 9, 12}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 3, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 3, 10, 12}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 8: neighbors {7, 10, 11}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 10: neighbors {6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 11: neighbors {1, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 12: neighbors {2, 4, 5, 6, 11}
- Node 13: neighbors {0, 5, 9, 14}
- Node 14: neighbors {0, 9, 13}

Next, we check the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9, Node 12, and Node 13 each have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 76

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [76].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 13, 14>
- <1, 11, 9>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <4, 12, 7>
- <5, 12, 2>
- <6, 1, 12>
- <7, 8, 10>
- <9, 13, 14>
- <12, 11, 7>
