Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 2) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 14) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 11, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 6, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {6, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 13}
- Node 5: {9, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 8, 14}
- Node 7: {3, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 5}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 12: {2, 10, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 4, 8, 12}
- Node 14: {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 8, 13>
- <1, 8, 6>
- <1, 8, 14>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <1, 10, 13>
- <1, 10, 2>
- <3, 8, 13>
- <3, 8, 14>
- <3, 13, 8>
- <3, 13, 4>
- <8, 13, 4>
- <8, 13, 12>
- <8, 14, 7>
- <13, 12, 10>
- <13, 12, 2>
- <13, 12, 4>
- <14, 8, 7>
- <14, 8, 6>
- <14, 8, 7>
- <14, 8, 6>
