Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3
- Node 6: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 4 + 20 = 44, which we represent as [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- <0, 2, 5>
