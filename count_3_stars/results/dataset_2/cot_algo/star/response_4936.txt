Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 7}

Now, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 48

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in this graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <2, 1, 5>
- <3, 0, 7>
- <3, 1, 6>
- <3, 1, 9>
- <3, 5, 8>
- <7, 1, 9>
- <7, 2, 1>
- <7, 2, 9>
- <7, 6, 8>
