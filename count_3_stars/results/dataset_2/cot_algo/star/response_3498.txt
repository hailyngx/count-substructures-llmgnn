Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 21) (26, 28) (26, 7) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 20) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 11) (2, 14) (2, 29) (2, 18) (29, 2) (29, 20) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 5) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 15) (22, 9) (22, 23) (22, 27) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 4) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 24) (3, 1) (3, 18) (0, 17) (0, 20) (0, 7) (20, 14) (20, 29) (20, 1) (20, 0) (18, 2) (18, 3) (18, 4) (4, 23) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 8) (7, 26) (7, 0) (7, 16) (21, 9) (21, 4) (28, 26) (28, 8) (28, 15) (5, 10) (5, 24) (13, 11) (13, 27) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 28) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 25) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 24) (12, 8) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 12) (8, 27) (6, 14) (6, 11) (25, 22) (25, 16) (25, 19) (27, 22) (27, 13) (27, 8) (24, 1) (24, 5) (24, 12) (19, 25) 

Response:
The nodes that have at least three neighbors are: 
- Node 9 has neighbors {22, 15, 21}
- Node 14 has neighbors {17, 6, 20, 2}
- Node 17 has neighbors {14, 0, 12, 11}
- Node 2 has neighbors {14, 29, 18}
- Node 11 has neighbors {17, 10, 13, 6, 15}
- Node 22 has neighbors {9, 23, 27, 25}
- Node 1 has neighbors {3, 20, 24}
- Node 3 has neighbors {1, 18}
- Node 0 has neighbors {17, 20, 7}
- Node 20 has neighbors {14, 29, 1, 0}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 14: [4]
- Node 17: [4]
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 11: [10]
- Node 22: [4]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 3: [0]
- Node 0: [1]
- Node 20: [1]

Total number of 3-stars: [27]

Unique 3-stars:
<9, (22, 15, 21)>
<14, (17, 6, 20)>
<17, (14, 0, 12)>
<2, (14, 29, 18)>
<11, (17, 10, 13)>
<22, (9, 23, 27)>
<1, (3, 24, 20)>
<0, (17, 7, 20)>
<20, (14, 29, 1)>
