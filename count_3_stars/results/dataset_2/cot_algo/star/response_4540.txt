Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 24) (9, 23) (9, 0) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 14) (3, 18) (12, 27) (12, 14) (12, 18) (27, 12) (27, 28) (27, 13) (5, 24) (5, 20) (13, 1) (13, 27) (13, 11) (13, 7) (11, 13) (11, 20) (11, 15) (11, 25) (18, 3) (18, 12) (18, 24) (26, 16) (26, 0) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 22) (17, 4) (17, 21) (20, 6) (20, 5) (20, 11) (20, 17) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 21) (21, 17) (21, 10) (21, 22) (21, 15) (8, 22) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 29) (23, 9) (28, 27) (7, 13) (7, 29) (29, 19) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 15) (29, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 29) (14, 2) (16, 26) (16, 17) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 24) (4, 17) (25, 11) (0, 9) (0, 26) (0, 29) (24, 9) (24, 5) (24, 18) (24, 2) (15, 11) (15, 21) (15, 29) (15, 22) (22, 17) (22, 21) (22, 8) (22, 15) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 26, 29}
- Node 1: {10, 13}
- Node 2: {14, 19, 24}
- Node 3: {12, 14, 18}
- Node 4: {17}
- Node 5: {24, 20}
- Node 6: {9, 10, 14, 19, 20}
- Node 7: {13, 15, 29}
- Node 8: {22}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 24, 23}
- Node 10: {1, 6, 21}
- Node 11: {13, 15, 20, 25}
- Node 12: {3, 14, 18, 27}
- Node 13: {1, 7, 11, 27}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 6, 12, 29}
- Node 15: {11, 21, 22, 29}
- Node 16: {17, 26}
- Node 17: {4, 16, 20, 21, 22}
- Node 18: {3, 12, 24}
- Node 19: {2, 6, 29}
- Node 20: {5, 6, 11, 17}
- Node 21: {10, 15, 17, 22}
- Node 22: {8, 15, 17, 21}
- Node 23: {9}
- Node 24: {0, 5, 9, 18, 2}
- Node 25: {11}
- Node 26: {0, 16}
- Node 27: {12, 13, 28}
- Node 28: {27}
- Node 29: {2, 7, 14, 19, 0, 15}

Now, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star:

- Node 0: [1 3-star]
- Node 9: [1 3-star]
- Node 6: [1 3-star]
- Node 27: [1 3-star]
- Node 14: [1 3-star]
- Node 29: [4 3-stars]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (9, 26, 29)>
<6, (9, 10, 19)>
<27, (13, 12, 28)>
<14, (2, 3, 29)>
<29, (7, 15, 19)>
<29, (2, 14, 19)>
<29, (0, 14, 15)>
<29, (0, 7, 14)>
