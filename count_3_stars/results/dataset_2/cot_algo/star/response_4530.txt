Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {6, 5}
Node 1: {5, 8, 2}
Node 2: {9, 3, 1, 4}
Node 3: {6, 9, 7, 8, 2}
Node 4: {9, 5, 2}
Node 5: {6, 1, 4, 0, 7}
Node 6: {9, 5, 3, 8, 0}
Node 7: {9, 5, 3}
Node 8: {6, 9, 3, 1}
Node 9: {6, 8, 4, 2, 7, 3}

Now, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:

Node 1: Ineligible (2 neighbors)
Node 4: Ineligible (2 neighbors)

Node 0: <0, (6, 5)>
Node 2: <2, (9, 3, 1)>, <2, (9, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 1, 4)>
Node 3: <3, (6, 9, 7)>, <3, (6, 9, 8)>, <3, (6, 8, 3)>, <3, (6, 3, 7)>, <3, (9, 7, 8)>, <3, (9, 8, 3)>, <3, (7, 8, 3)>, <3, (9, 7, 3)>
Node 5: <5, (6, 1, 4)>, <5, (6, 4, 0)>, <5, (6, 0, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 0)>, <5, (4, 0, 7)>, <5, (1, 0, 7)>
Node 6: <6, (9, 5, 0)>, <6, (9, 5, 3)>, <6, (9, 5, 8)>, <6, (9, 0, 8)>, <6, (5, 0, 8)>, <6, (9, 0, 3)>, <6, (5, 0, 3)>, <6, (9, 3, 8)>, <6, (5, 3, 8)>
Node 7: <7, (9, 5, 3)>, <7, (5, 3, 8)>, <7, (9, 3, 8)>
Node 8: <8, (6, 9, 3)>, <8, (6, 9, 1)>, <8, (6, 1, 8)>, <8, (9, 1, 3)>, <8, (6, 9, 2)>, <8, (6, 2, 8)>, <8, (9, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (9, 2, 1)>
Node 9: <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <9, (6, 8, 2)>, <9, (8, 4, 2)>, <9, (6, 4, 7)>, <9, (8, 2, 7)>, <9, (4, 2, 7)>, <9, (6, 4, 3)>, <9, (8, 2, 3)>, <9, (4, 2, 3)>, <9, (8, 7, 3)>, <9, (2, 7, 3)>

The total number of unique 3-stars is [25].
