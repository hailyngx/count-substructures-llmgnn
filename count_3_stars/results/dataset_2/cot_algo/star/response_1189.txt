Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (1, 12) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:

Node 0: {4, 6, 8, 11, 14}
Node 1: {12}
Node 2: {7, 8, 10}
Node 3: {10, 12, 13}
Node 4: {0, 7, 9, 12}
Node 5: {6, 9, 11, 14}
Node 6: {0, 5, 7, 9}
Node 7: {2, 4, 6, 13}
Node 8: {0, 2, 10, 12}
Node 9: {4, 5, 6, 10}
Node 10: {2, 3, 8, 9, 11}
Node 11: {5, 10, 13, 14}
Node 12: {0, 3, 4, 8, 14}
Node 13: {3, 7, 11, 14}
Node 14: {0, 5, 11, 12, 13}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0 forms a 3-star with (4, 8, 14)
Node 4 forms a 3-star with (0, 9, 12)
Node 5 forms a 3-star with (9, 11, 14)
Node 6 forms a 3-star with (5, 7, 9)
Node 7 forms a 3-star with (2, 8, 13)
Node 8 forms a 3-star with (2, 10, 12)
Node 9 forms a 3-star with (4, 6, 10)
Node 10 forms a 3-star with (3, 11, 14)
Node 11 forms a 3-star with (3, 13, 14)
Node 12 forms a 3-star with (1, 8, 14)
Node 13 forms a 3-star with (7, 11, 14)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 8, 14)>, <4, (0, 9, 12)>, <5, (9, 11, 14)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 13)>, <8, (2, 10, 12)>, <9, (4, 6, 10)>, <10, (3, 11, 14)>, <11, (3, 13, 14)>, <12, (1, 8, 14)>, <13, (7, 11, 14)>.
