Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 9) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 8) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 16) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 18) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 19) (11, 3) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 1) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 10) (17, 3) (17, 0) (8, 15) (8, 16) (8, 18) (16, 9) (16, 8) (14, 5) (14, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 14) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 8) (18, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 10, 12, 17, 18}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {12}
- Node 3: {9, 11, 13, 17}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 5: {1, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {4, 15, 19}
- Node 7: {4, 18}
- Node 8: {15, 16, 18}
- Node 9: {3, 16}
- Node 10: {0, 18, 19}
- Node 11: {3}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 2, 5}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 18}
- Node 14: {1, 5}
- Node 15: {6, 8, 19}
- Node 16: {8, 9}
- Node 17: {0, 3}
- Node 18: {0, 7, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 19: {6, 10, 15}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with {1, 12, 18} <0, (1, 12, 18)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with {9, 11, 13} <3, (9, 11, 13)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with {1, 6, 13} <4, (1, 6, 13)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with {1, 12, 14} <5, (1, 12, 14)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with {4, 15, 19} <6, (4, 15, 19)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with {6, 10, 19} <15, (6, 10, 19)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with {0, 8, 13} <18, (0, 8, 13)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with {6, 10, 15} <19, (6, 10, 15)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 7, so the answer is [7].
