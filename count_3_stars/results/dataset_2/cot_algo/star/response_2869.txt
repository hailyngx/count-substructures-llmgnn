Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 11) (4, 14) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (10, 11) (10, 1) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 13) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 19) (3, 14) (3, 1) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 12) (18, 4) (18, 0) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 0) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 1) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 3) (8, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) (15, 9) (15, 6) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 2) (6, 8) (6, 15) (16, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 12, 18}
- Node 1: {3, 10, 13, 19}
- Node 2: {13, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 8, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 12, 14, 16, 18}
- Node 5: {8, 9, 12}
- Node 6: {8, 15}
- Node 7: {0, 4}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 17, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 15, 17}
- Node 10: {1, 11}
- Node 11: {10, 13, 17, 19}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 11}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 4, 17}
- Node 15: {6, 9}
- Node 16: {4}
- Node 17: {8, 11, 14, 19}
- Node 18: {0, 4}
- Node 19: {1, 11, 17}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, and 19.

Now, we'll count the number of 3-stars in each of the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 0 3-stars (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 0 3-stars (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 0 3-stars (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 19: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, 10, 13>
<3, 1, 19>
<4, 14, 17>
<5, 9, 12>
<8, 5, 17>
<11, 13, 17>
