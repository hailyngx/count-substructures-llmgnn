Calculating the number of unique 3-stars: 

Nodes with 3 neighbors: {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28, 29} (Total of 14 nodes)

In this case, the total number of 3-stars is [35].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (4, 8, 18)>
<4, (2, 8, 12)>
<6, (1, 11, 14)>
<8, (2, 6, 28)>
<10, (7, 11, 14)>
<11, (6, 10, 13)>
<13, (5, 11, 28)>
<14, (6, 10, 16)>
<18, (4, 10, 27)>
<19, (7, 18, 26)>
<23, (9, 17, 29)>
<24, (0, 8, 16)>
<28, (8, 13, 14)>
<29, (17, 23, 24)>
