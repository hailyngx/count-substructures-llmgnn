Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 18) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 6) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 16) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 3) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 3) (2, 6) (2, 15) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 18) (3, 9) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 10) (8, 5) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 9) (16, 10) (16, 5) (16, 1) (4, 17) (4, 11) (4, 1) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 1) (15, 5) (15, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph by finding nodes that have at least three neighbors. 

First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {11, 6, 19}
- Node 1: {12, 4, 9, 16}
- Node 2: {6, 15}
- Node 3: {17, 9, 18, 19}
- Node 4: {17, 1, 11}
- Node 5: {8, 15, 16}
- Node 6: {14, 17, 0, 2}
- Node 7: {11, 12, 18}
- Node 8: {10, 5}
- Node 9: {17, 1, 3}
- Node 10: {11, 12, 16, 8}
- Node 11: {10, 7, 0, 4}
- Node 12: {10, 7, 1}
- Node 15: {5, 2}
- Node 16: {10, 5, 1}
- Node 17: {14, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 18: {7, 19, 3}
- Node 19: {0, 18, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [1]
  <0, 11, 19>
- Node 1: [1]
  <1, 12, 16>
- Node 3: [1]
  <3, 9, 17>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
