Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 15) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 14) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 18) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (18, 3) (18, 19) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 16) (12, 7) (12, 0) (0, 1) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 15) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 7) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 13) 

Response:
After analyzing the given graph, we find that node 11 has 4 neighbors, nodes 16, 5, and 19 each have 4 neighbors, nodes 9, 10, 3, and 7 each have 5 neighbors, nodes 6, 4, and 15 each have 4 neighbors, nodes 1, 0, 14, 13, 2, and 18 each have 2 neighbors, and node 12 has 3 neighbors. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph.

For node 11, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars, giving us the 3-stars: <11, (16, 19, 3)>, <11, (16, 19, 2)>, <11, (16, 3, 2)>, <11, (19, 3, 2)>.

For nodes 16, 5, and 19, there are 4 3-stars each, resulting in 12 additional 3-stars.

For nodes 9, 10, 3, and 7, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each, giving us 40 additional 3-stars.

For nodes 6, 4, and 15, there are 4 3-stars each, resulting in 12 additional 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4 (from node 11) + 12 (from nodes 16, 5, and 19) + 40 (from nodes 9, 10, 3, and 7) + 12 (from nodes 6, 4, and 15) = 68. 

Thus, the final answer is [68].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<11, (16, 19, 3)>, <11, (16, 19, 2)>, <11, (16, 3, 2)>, <11, (19, 3, 2)>,
<16, (11, 12, 15)>, <16, (11, 15, 6)>, <16, (5, 9, 15)>, <16, (5, 15, 10)>,
<5, (9, 6, 15)>, <5, (9, 15, 14)>, <5, (10, 6, 15)>, <5, (10, 15, 7)>,
<9, (5, 6, 15)>, <9, (5, 15, 14)>, <9, (6, 16, 1)>, <9, (6, 1, 0)>,
<10, (5, 7, 15)>, <10, (7, 12, 16)>, <10, (7, 16, 6)>, <10, (4, 13, 15)>,
<3, (11, 7, 18)>, <3, (7, 10, 15)>, <3, (7, 15, 19)>, <3, (18, 19, 11)>,
<7, (5, 3, 10)>, <7, (5, 10, 12)>, <7, (5, 12, 16)>, <7, (5, 16, 19)>,
<6, (16, 1, 9)>, <6, (1, 0, 12)>, <6, (9, 15, 4)>, <6, (9, 4, 14)>,
<4, (10, 13, 15)>, <4, (13, 5, 15)>, <4, (13, 15, 14)>, <4, (14, 9, 5)>,
<15, (16, 5, 13)>, <15, (5, 9, 13)>, <15, (5, 13, 4)>, <15, (13, 4, 14)>.
