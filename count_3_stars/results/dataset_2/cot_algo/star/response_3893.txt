Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 8) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 5) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (2, 12) (2, 17) (2, 7) (2, 11) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 15) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 19) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 7) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 0) (15, 5) (15, 16) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (16, 15) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 19) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (12, 2) (12, 18) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 3, 10, 11
- Node 1: 3, 10, 11, 17
- Node 2: 7, 11, 12, 17
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 17
- Node 4: 3, 6, 8, 10, 11
- Node 5: 3, 6, 15, 17, 19
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 2, 13, 19
- Node 8: 4, 9, 13, 14
- Node 9: 8
- Node 10: 0, 1, 4
- Node 11: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 12: 2, 18
- Node 13: 7, 8, 14
- Node 14: 8, 13
- Node 15: 5, 16
- Node 16: 15
- Node 17: 1, 2, 3, 19
- Node 18: 12
- Node 19: 5, 7, 17

Now, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 17, 19

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), 3-stars: <1, (3, 10, 11)>, <1, (3, 17, 10)>, <1, (4, 10, 11)>, <1, (4, 11, 17)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), 3-stars: <2, (7, 11, 12)>, <2, (7, 11, 17)>, <2, (11, 12, 17)>, <2, (2, 12, 17)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \), 3-stars: <3, (1, 4, 10)>, <3, (1, 4, 11)>, <3, (1, 11, 17)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 17)>, <3, (4, 10, 11)>, <3, (4, 11, 6)>, <3, (4, 11, 17)>, <3, (4, 17, 10)>, <3, (5, 17, 19)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \), 3-stars: <4, (3, 8, 13)>, <4, (3, 8, 14)>, <4, (3, 13, 14)>, <4, (8, 13, 14)>, <4, (4, 10, 11)>, <4, (4, 10, 11)>, <4, (4, 10, 11)>, <4, (4, 11, 17)>, <4, (4, 11, 17)>, <4, (4, 17, 3)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \), 3-stars: <5, (3, 6, 15)>, <5, (3, 17, 19)>, <5, (4, 19, 7)>, <5, (5, 17, 19)>, <5, (5, 17, 3)>, <5, (5, 17, 3)>, <5, (5, 17, 3)>, <5, (5, 17, 3)>, <5, (5, 17, 3)>, <5, (6, 17, 3)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), 3-stars: <8, (4, 13, 14)>, <8, (4, 13, 8)>, <8, (13, 14, 7)>, <8, (13, 14, 7)>
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), 3-stars: <11, (0, 2, 12)>, <11, (0, 2, 18)>, <11, (1, 2, 12)>, <11, (1, 2, 18)>
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), 3-stars: <17, (3, 19, 7)>, <17, (5, 19, 7)>, <17, (5, 19, 7)>, <17, (17, 19, 7)>
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 36

So, the final answer is [36]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 10, 11)>, <1, (3, 17, 10)>, <1, (4, 10, 11)>, <1, (4, 11, 17)>, <2, (7, 11, 12)>, <2, (7, 11, 17)>, <2, (11, 12, 17)>, <2, (2, 12, 17)>, <3, (1, 4, 10)>, <3, (1, 4, 11)>, <3, (1, 11, 17)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 17)>, <3, (4, 10, 11)>, <3, (4, 11, 6)>, <3,...
