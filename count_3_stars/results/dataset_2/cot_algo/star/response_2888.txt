Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 7) (11, 6) (11, 1) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 7, 9}
Node 1: {0, 3, 11, 12}
Node 2: {5, 7, 8, 12, 13}
Node 3: {1, 7, 10}
Node 4: {8, 9, 13, 14}
Node 5: {2, 6, 8, 10, 13}
Node 6: {5, 9, 10, 11}
Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 12, 14}
Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 9, 14}
Node 9: {0, 4, 6, 8, 12}
Node 10: {3, 5, 6, 12}
Node 11: {1, 6}
Node 12: {1, 2, 7, 9, 10}
Node 13: {2, 4, 5}
Node 14: {4, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 1 3-star
Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 2: 1 3-star
Node 3: 0 3-star
Node 4: 0 3-star
Node 5: 0 3-star
Node 6: 1 3-star
Node 7: 1 3-star
Node 8: 1 3-star
Node 9: 1 3-star
Node 10: 0 3-star
Node 11: 0 3-star
Node 12: 1 3-star
Node 13: 0 3-star
Node 14: 0 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 1, 12>
<1, 3, 11>
<2, 5, 8>
<6, 9, 10>
<7, 12, 14>
<8, 9, 4>
