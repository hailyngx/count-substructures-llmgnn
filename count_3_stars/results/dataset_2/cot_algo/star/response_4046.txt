Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 13) (12, 10) (12, 14) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 10, 14.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, 11.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 10, 11.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 7, 11.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 14.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 12, 13.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, 13.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 10, 14.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 10, 11, 14.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 9, 12, 13.

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors

Calculating \(\binom{n}{3}\):
- For nodes 0, 3, 7, and 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars each
- For nodes 10, 11, and 13: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars each

Total 3-stars: \(10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \([52]\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <3, (1, 7, 5)>
- <7, (0, 1, 8)>
- <8, (5, 0, 11)>
- <10, (6, 3, 13)>
- <11, (4, 6, 13)>
- <13, (0, 11, 14)>
