Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 24) (27, 16) (27, 5) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 24) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 22) (17, 26) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 16) (2, 18) (2, 23) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 12) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 23) (29, 7) (29, 0) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 21) (22, 17) (22, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 26) (12, 14) (12, 18) (19, 7) (19, 21) (19, 10) (10, 19) (26, 17) (26, 20) (26, 6) (11, 6) (11, 24) (24, 27) (24, 14) (24, 11) (24, 25) (0, 29) (0, 9) (0, 23) (7, 29) (7, 22) (7, 19) (7, 28) (7, 5) (21, 13) (21, 9) (21, 19) (23, 2) (23, 18) (23, 20) (23, 0) (16, 27) (16, 13) (16, 4) (28, 7) (28, 4) (28, 5) (28, 25) (25, 24) (25, 28) (4, 16) (4, 28) (5, 27) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 28) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 23, 29}
- Node 1: {3, 6}
- Node 2: {18, 23}
- Node 3: {1, 9, 18}
- Node 4: {16, 28}
- Node 5: {7, 14, 27, 28}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 11, 26}
- Node 7: {5, 19, 22, 28, 29}
- Node 8: {6, 13}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 21}
- Node 10: {19}
- Node 11: {6, 24}
- Node 12: {14, 18}
- Node 13: {8, 14, 16, 21}
- Node 14: {5, 12, 13, 17, 24}
- Node 15: {27}
- Node 16: {4, 13, 27}
- Node 17: {14, 20, 22, 26}
- Node 18: {2, 3, 12, 23}
- Node 19: {7, 10, 21}
- Node 20: {17, 23, 26}
- Node 21: {9, 13, 19}
- Node 22: {7, 17}
- Node 23: {0, 18, 20}
- Node 24: {11, 14, 25, 27}
- Node 25: {24, 28}
- Node 26: {6, 17, 20}
- Node 27: {5, 15, 16, 24}
- Node 28: {4, 5, 7, 25}
- Node 29: {0, 7}

Now we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 4 neighbors
- Node 24: 4 neighbors
- Node 26: 3 neighbors
- Node 28: 4 neighbors

Calculating \( \text{inom}(n, 3) \) for the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 5: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \text{inom}(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \text{inom}(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
\[ 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <5, 7, 14, 28>
- <7, 5, 28, 25>
- <14, 5, 24, 27>
- <16, 13, 27, 4>
- <17, 20, 26, 7>
- <18, 2, 23, 12>
- <24, 27, 11, 25>
- <26, 6, 17, 20>
