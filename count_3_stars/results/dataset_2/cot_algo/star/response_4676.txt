Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. 

The number of neighbors for each node is as follows:
0: 6 neighbors {4, 1, 3, 6, 9, 5}
1: 4 neighbors {4, 6, 8, 0}
2: 3 neighbors {7, 3, 6}
3: 5 neighbors {5, 9, 4, 0, 2}
4: 3 neighbors {0, 3, 1}
5: 4 neighbors {9, 0, 3, 7}
6: 5 neighbors {7, 1, 2, 8, 0}
7: 4 neighbors {5, 9, 6, 2}
8: 2 neighbors {1, 6}
9: 4 neighbors {5, 3, 7, 0}

The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}.
Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes

For node 0, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-star configurations.
For node 1, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations.
For node 3, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star configurations.
For node 5, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations.
For node 6, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star configurations.
For node 7, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations.
For node 9, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations.

Adding all the configurations up we get a total of 56 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [56].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
