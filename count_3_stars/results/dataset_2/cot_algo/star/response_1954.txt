Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 8) (14, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 11) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 11) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 1) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 10) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 13) (4, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) 

Response:
Given the provided information, let's first list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {10, 11, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {7, 5, 11}
- Node 2: {7, 12, 5, 13, 11}
- Node 3: {6, 9, 12, 5, 4}
- Node 4: {9, 14, 13, 3}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 1, 11, 3}
- Node 6: {7, 10, 3, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {6, 12, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {12, 0, 14, 10}
- Node 9: {4, 3, 13}
- Node 10: {6, 0, 8}
- Node 11: {6, 0, 2, 5, 1}
- Node 12: {7, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 13: {6, 9, 2, 4}
- Node 14: {8, 4}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0: In this case, we have \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center. These 3-stars are <0, (10, 11, 5)>, <0, (10, 11, 8)>, <0, (10, 5, 8)>, and <0, (11, 5, 8)>.
- Node 2: Also, \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center. These 3-stars are <2, (7, 12, 5)>, <2, (7, 12, 13)>, <2, (7, 5, 13)>, <2, (12, 5, 13)>, <2, (7, 5, 11)>, <2, (7, 13, 11)>, <2, (12, 5, 11)>, <2, (12, 13, 11)>, <2, (5, 13, 11)>, and <2, (7, 5, 13)>.
- Node 3: \(	inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center. These are <3, (6, 9, 5)>, <3, (6, 12, 5)>, <3, (6, 5, 4)>, <3, (9, 12, 5)>, <3, (9, 5, 4)>, <3, (12, 5, 4)>, <3, (6, 9, 13)>, <3, (6, 9, 4)>, <3, (9, 13, 4)>, and <3, (6, 13, 4)>.
- Node 5: Again, \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center. These 3-stars are <5, (0, 2, 1)>, <5, (0, 2, 11)>, <5, (0, 1, 11)>, <5, (2, 1, 11)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (2, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 11, 3)>, <5, (2, 11, 3)>, and <5, (1, 11, 3)>.
- Node 6: Similarly, \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center. These are <6, (7, 10, 3)>, <6, (7, 3, 11)>, <6, (7, 10, 13)>, <6, (7, 3, 13)>, <6, (10, 3, 11)>, <6, (10, 3, 13)>, <6, (3, 11, 13)>, <6, (7, 9, 13)>, <6, (9, 3, 13)>, and <6, (10, 13, 3)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: \([4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [44]\).
