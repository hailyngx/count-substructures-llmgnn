Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 12) (2, 23) (2, 14) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 13) (4, 18) (4, 28) (7, 15) (7, 24) (7, 14) (7, 22) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 27) (3, 12) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 17) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 23) (11, 10) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 13) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 27) (27, 3) (27, 12) (27, 24) (17, 29) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 19) (21, 13) (21, 19) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 25) (26, 16) (5, 22) (5, 15) (16, 26) (16, 20) (19, 17) (19, 21) (19, 22) (19, 20) (22, 7) (22, 5) (22, 19) (22, 0) (23, 2) (23, 10) (23, 24) (13, 29) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 21) (0, 17) (0, 22) (0, 28) (0, 24) (0, 25) (28, 4) (28, 0) (28, 25) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 5) (24, 7) (24, 27) (24, 23) (24, 0) (20, 16) (20, 19) (8, 3) (8, 6) (25, 14) (25, 0) (25, 28) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {17, 22, 24, 25}
Node 1: {3, 6, 14}
Node 2: {12, 14, 23, 29}
Node 3: {1, 8, 12, 27}
Node 4: {18, 28}
Node 5: {15, 22}
Node 6: {1, 8}
Node 7: {14, 15, 22, 24}
Node 8: {3, 6}
Node 9: {17}
Node 10: {11, 12, 13, 23}
Node 11: {10}
Node 12: {2, 3, 10, 27}
Node 13: {10, 18, 21, 29}
Node 14: {1, 2, 7, 25}
Node 15: {5, 7, 18}
Node 16: {20, 26}
Node 17: {0, 19, 29}
Node 18: {4, 13, 15}
Node 19: {17, 20, 21, 22}
Node 20: {16, 19}
Node 21: {13, 19}
Node 22: {5, 7, 19, 0}
Node 23: {2, 10, 24}
Node 24: {7, 23, 27, 0}
Node 25: {14, 0, 28}
Node 26: {16}
Node 27: {3, 12, 24}
Node 28: {4, 0, 25}
Node 29: {2, 13, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 19: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 22: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 24: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].
