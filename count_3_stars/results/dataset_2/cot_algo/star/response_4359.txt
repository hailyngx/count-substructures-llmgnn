Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 3) (13, 15) (22, 0) (22, 24) (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 23) (21, 25) (0, 22) (0, 11) (0, 2) (27, 4) (27, 25) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 11) (18, 26) (18, 12) (18, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 8) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 20) (6, 28) (6, 10) (28, 6) (17, 29) (17, 26) (29, 17) (29, 26) (29, 25) (29, 24) (9, 19) (9, 16) (20, 12) (20, 8) (20, 5) (15, 13) (15, 1) (4, 27) (4, 25) (26, 18) (26, 17) (26, 29) (26, 3) (10, 6) (10, 23) (10, 14) (25, 21) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 4) (25, 11) (3, 13) (3, 26) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 5) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 25) (19, 2) (19, 9) (19, 16) (19, 23) (8, 1) (8, 18) (8, 7) (8, 20) (8, 24) (24, 22) (24, 29) (24, 8) (24, 14) (14, 10) (14, 24) (14, 5) (5, 20) (5, 16) (5, 14) (23, 21) (23, 10) (23, 19) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

1. Node 1: (8, 21, 15)
2. Node 2: (0, 11, 2)
3. Node 4: (25, 27, 4)
4. Node 5: (20, 16, 14)
5. Node 8: (1, 18, 24)
6. Node 10: (23, 19, 14)
7. Node 12: (18, 7, 20)
8. Node 16: (5, 19, 16)
9. Node 24: (8, 22, 14)
10. Node 25: (21, 27, 29)
11. Node 26: (3, 17, 29)

Since all nodes have less than 3 neighbors, there are no additional 3-stars formed. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
