Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 10) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

1: {2, 6, 12, 13}
2: {1, 5, 6, 9}
3: {0, 4, 8}
4: {0, 3, 8, 11, 12, 14}
5: {2, 10, 11, 12}
6: {1, 2, 11, 12}
7: {8, 9, 10}
8: {3, 4, 7, 10}
9: {2, 7, 10, 11, 14}
10: {5, 7, 8, 9, 13}
11: {4, 5, 6, 9}
12: {1, 4, 5, 6, 14}
13: {1, 10}
14: {0, 4, 9, 12}

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of them:

1: (4 choose 3) = 4
2: (4 choose 3) = 4
4: (6 choose 3) = 20
5: (4 choose 3) = 4
6: (4 choose 3) = 4
9: (5 choose 3) = 10
10: (5 choose 3) = 10
11: (4 choose 3) = 4
12: (5 choose 3) = 10
14: (4 choose 3) = 4

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 74

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [74].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, 12, 13> 
<2, 5, 6> 
<4, 11, 12> 
<9, 10, 13>
