Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 8) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 14) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 7, 2, 8}
- Node 1: {9, 11, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 3, 0, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 11, 13, 2}
- Node 4: {9, 12, 6, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 4, 10, 2, 13}
- Node 7: {9, 0}
- Node 8: {10, 11, 0, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 1, 7}
- Node 10: {6, 11, 8, 13, 2}
- Node 11: {10, 3, 1, 8}
- Node 12: {4, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {6, 10, 12, 3, 14}
- Node 14: {12, 2, 13}

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 7, 5, 8, 12, 14
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 9, 2, 4, 6, 13, 10
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 3, 11

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: Each forms 1 3-star <center, neighbor1, neighbor2, neighbor3>
  - Node 0: <0, 5, 7, 2>
  - Node 1: <1, 9, 11, 8>
  - Node 7: <7, 9, 0, *>
  - Node 5: <5, 9, 0, *>
  - Node 8: <8, 10, 11, 0>
  - Node 12: <12, 4, 13, *>  
  - Node 14: <14, 12, 13, *>  
Total 3-stars with nodes having 3 neighbors: 7

- Nodes with 5 neighbors: Each forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 9: 10 3-stars
  - Node 2: 10 3-stars
  - Node 4: 10 3-stars
  - Node 6: 10 3-stars
  - Node 13: 10 3-stars
  - Node 10: 10 3-stars
Total 3-stars with nodes having 5 neighbors: 60

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 7 + 60 = 67
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [67].
