Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 8) (5, 8) (5, 4) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 4) (0, 15) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 1) (16, 14) (16, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 8) (18, 15) (19, 13) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 12) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 7) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 10) (2, 3) (2, 15) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 13) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 8) (13, 19) (13, 4) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node. 
Here are the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 15, 16}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 2: {3, 15}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6, 13}
- Node 5: {4, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 17}
- Node 7: {3, 9, 10}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 12, 17}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 11}
- Node 10: {3, 7, 13}
- Node 11: {1, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {8, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {4, 10, 19}
- Node 14: {11, 12, 16, 17}
- Node 15: {0, 2, 18}
- Node 16: {0, 14}
- Node 17: {6, 8, 14}
- Node 18: {15}
- Node 19: {13}

Now we will check for each node that has three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars it forms:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: <3, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 10> = 2
- Node 4: <4, 6, 13> = 1
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 11: <11, 12, 14> = 1

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 16, represented as [16]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 10>, <4, 6, 13>, <11, 12, 14>
