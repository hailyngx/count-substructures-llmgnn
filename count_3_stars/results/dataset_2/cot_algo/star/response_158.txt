Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 0) (22, 13) (10, 11) (10, 26) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 28) (11, 10) (21, 5) (21, 18) (28, 10) (28, 8) (28, 5) (19, 10) (19, 26) (19, 17) (26, 10) (26, 19) (26, 8) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 0) (24, 2) (0, 13) (0, 24) (0, 7) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 17) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 25) (1, 9) (1, 12) (17, 19) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 18) (5, 21) (5, 28) (5, 29) (23, 4) (23, 29) (23, 9) (6, 24) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 18) (4, 23) (4, 3) (4, 16) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 14) (8, 25) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 20) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 29) (16, 15) (14, 8) (14, 18) (2, 24) (2, 1) (20, 12) (20, 27) (25, 1) (25, 8) (27, 24) (27, 20) (27, 3) (27, 9) (29, 5) (29, 23) (29, 16) (18, 21) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 27) (15, 16) (9, 1) (9, 23) (9, 27) 

Response:
Since the graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges, we know it is a simple graph with no self-loops or parallel edges. 

Based on the given edge list, the neighbor set for each node is as follows:
* Node 0: {13, 24, 7}
* Node 1: {17, 2, 25, 9, 12}
* Node 2: {1, 24}
* Node 3: {6, 4, 27}
* Node 4: {23, 3, 16}
* Node 5: {21, 28, 29}
* Node 6: {24, 7, 3, 18}
* Node 7: {10, 0, 6, 17}
* Node 8: {28, 26, 14, 25}
* Node 9: {1, 23, 27}
* Node 10: {11, 26, 7, 19, 28}
* Node 11: {10}
* Node 12: {1, 16, 20}
* Node 13: {22, 0}
* Node 14: {8, 18}
* Node 15: {16}
* Node 16: {4, 12, 29, 15}
* Node 17: {19, 7, 1, 18}
* Node 18: {21, 6, 17, 14}
* Node 19: {10, 17, 26}
* Node 20: {12, 27}
* Node 21: {5, 18}
* Node 22: {13}
* Node 23: {4, 29, 9, 27}
* Node 24: {6, 0, 2, 27}
* Node 25: {1, 8}
* Node 26: {10, 19, 8}
* Node 27: {24, 3, 9, 20}
* Node 28: {10, 8, 5}
* Node 29: {5, 23, 16}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 10 and Node 28 have 5 neighbors each, giving us \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
Node 1, Node 4, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, and Node 26 have 5 neighbors, but they each already share a neighbor in a known 3-star.
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( 10 + 10 = 20 \). 

Therefore, the final answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<10, (7, 19, 28)>
<28, (5, 8, 10)>
