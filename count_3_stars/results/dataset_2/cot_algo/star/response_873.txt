Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 7) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 12) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 10) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 10) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 11) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 13) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 13) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
\( N(0) = \{1, 2, 4, 13, 14\} \)  
\( N(1) = \{0, 5, 11, 12\} \)   
\( N(2) = \{0, 6, 9, 10\} \)  
\( N(3) = \{4, 7, 9\} \)  
\( N(4) = \{0, 6, 7, 9\} \)  
\( N(5) = \{1, 7, 9, 11\} \)   
\( N(6) = \{0, 2, 4, 8, 11, 13\} \)  
\( N(7) = \{3, 4, 5, 8\} \)  
\( N(8) = \{6, 7, 9, 12\} \)   
\( N(9) = \{2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10\} \)  
\( N(10) = \{2, 9, 13, 14\} \)  
\( N(11) = \{1, 5, 6, 12\} \)  
\( N(12) = \{1, 8, 11, 14\} \)  
\( N(13) = \{0, 6, 10\} \)  
\( N(14) = \{0, 10, 12\} \)  

Nodes with three or more neighbors that form a 3-star:
Node 0 forms 4 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 13)>, <0, (1, 4, 14)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (13, 14, 10)>
Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 6, 7)>
Node 6 forms 2 3-stars: <6, (0, 2, 13)>, <6, (4, 8, 11)>
Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (6, 9, 12)>
Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (2, 4, 10)>

Total number of 3-stars: [9]
