Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for the given graph:

Node 0: 5, 3, 9, 2
Node 1: 6, 9, 7, 3, 2, 8
Node 2: 6, 1, 0
Node 3: 5, 4, 1, 0
Node 4: 5, 9, 7, 3
Node 5: 6, 4, 0, 3
Node 6: 5, 1, 2, 8
Node 7: 9, 4, 1, 8
Node 8: 6, 7, 1
Node 9: 4, 1, 7, 0

Now, we'll check each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. 
Node 0 forms the 3-stars <0, (5, 9, 3)>, <0, (5, 9, 2)>, <0, (9, 3, 2)>, <0, (5, 3, 2)>.

Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars. 

Node 2 has 3 neighbors, but it can't form a 3-star as it needs at least 3 neighbors. 

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. 
Node 3 forms the 3-stars <3, (5, 4, 1)>, <3, (5, 4, 0)>, <3, (5, 1, 0)>, <3, (4, 1, 0)>.

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. 
Node 4 forms the 3-stars <4, (5, 9, 7)>, <4, (5, 9, 3)>, <4, (5, 7, 3)>, <4, (9, 7, 3)>.

Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. 
Node 5 forms the 3-stars <5, (6, 4, 0)>, <5, (6, 4, 3)>, <5, (6, 0, 3)>, <5, (4, 0, 3)>.

Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. 
Node 6 forms the 3-stars <6, (5, 1, 2)>, <6, (5, 1, 8)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>.

Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. 
Node 7 forms the 3-stars <7, (9, 4, 1)>, <7, (9, 4, 8)>, <7, (9, 1, 8)>, <7, (4, 1, 8)>.

Node 8 has 3 neighbors, but it can't form a 3-star as it needs at least 3 neighbors. 

Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. 
Node 9 forms the 3-stars <9, (4, 1, 7)>, <9, (4, 1, 0)>, <9, (4, 7, 0)>, <9, (1, 7, 0)>.

Finally, we add up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 9, 3)>, <0, (5, 9, 2)>, <0, (9, 3, 2)>, <0, (5, 3, 2)>, <3, (5, 4, 1)>, <3, (5, 4, 0)>, <3, (5, 1, 0)>, <3, (4, 1, 0)>, <4, (5, 9, 7)>, <4, (5, 9, 3)>, <4, (5, 7, 3)>, <4, (9, 7, 3)>, <5, (6, 4, 0)>, <5, (6, 4, 3)>, <5, (6, 0, 3)>, <5, (4, 0, 3)>, <6, (5, 1, 2)>, <6, (5, 1, 8)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (9, 4, 1)>, <7, (9, 4, 8)>, <7, (9, 1, 8)>, <7, (4, 1, 8)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>, <9, (4, 1, 0)>, <9, (4, 7, 0)>, <9, (1, 7, 0)>
