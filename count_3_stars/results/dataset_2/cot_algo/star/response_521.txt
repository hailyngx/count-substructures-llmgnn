Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 15) (5, 16) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 19) (4, 1) (7, 3) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (2, 5) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 0) (18, 13) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 19) (14, 10) (14, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 18) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 4) (1, 0) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 16) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 12) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 0) (19, 17) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 17) (6, 17) (6, 12) (17, 19) (17, 16) (17, 6) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {1, 2, 14, 18, 19}
Node 1: {0, 4}
Node 2: {0, 5, 18}
Node 3: {7, 12}
Node 4: {1, 19}
Node 5: {2, 13, 15, 16}
Node 6: {12, 17}
Node 7: {3}
Node 8: {9, 12, 15}
Node 9: {8, 11, 12}
Node 10: {11, 14}
Node 11: {9, 10, 13}
Node 12: {3, 6, 8, 9, 15}
Node 13: {5, 11, 18}
Node 14: {0, 10}
Node 15: {5, 8, 12, 16}
Node 16: {5, 15, 17}
Node 17: {6, 16, 19}
Node 18: {0, 2, 13, 19}
Node 19: {4, 17, 18, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].
