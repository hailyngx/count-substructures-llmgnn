Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 22) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 22) (3, 25) (3, 2) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 26) (25, 16) (25, 15) (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 5) (10, 29) (11, 10) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 28) (27, 29) (27, 14) (0, 23) (14, 7) (14, 27) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 23) (2, 13) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 18) (13, 2) (26, 25) (26, 21) (1, 17) (1, 24) (1, 23) (17, 12) (17, 1) (17, 20) (17, 5) (16, 25) (16, 28) (16, 9) (16, 19) (28, 12) (28, 16) (28, 19) (28, 5) (20, 17) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 29) (9, 21) (9, 19) (29, 10) (29, 27) (29, 9) (21, 10) (21, 26) (21, 9) (21, 22) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 23) (6, 22) (24, 8) (24, 1) (22, 4) (22, 7) (22, 21) (22, 6) (15, 25) (15, 19) (19, 16) (19, 28) (19, 9) (19, 15) (23, 0) (23, 2) (23, 1) (23, 18) (5, 10) (5, 12) (5, 17) (5, 28) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {23}
- Node 1: {17, 23, 24}
- Node 2: {3, 12, 13, 23}
- Node 3: {2, 8, 25}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 22}
- Node 5: {10, 12, 17, 28}
- Node 6: {22}
- Node 7: {4, 14, 18, 22, 27}
- Node 8: {3, 18, 24}
- Node 9: {4, 9, 16, 19, 21, 29}
- Node 10: {5, 11, 21, 29}
- Node 11: {10}
- Node 12: {2, 5, 17, 28}
- Node 13: {2}
- Node 14: {7, 27}
- Node 15: {19, 25}
- Node 16: {9, 19, 25, 28}
- Node 17: {1, 5, 12, 20}
- Node 18: {7, 8, 23}
- Node 19: {9, 15, 16, 28}
- Node 20: {17}
- Node 21: {10, 21, 22, 26}
- Node 22: {4, 6, 7, 21}
- Node 23: {0, 1, 2, 18}
- Node 24: {1, 8}
- Node 25: {3, 15, 16, 25}
- Node 26: {21, 25}
- Node 27: {7, 14, 29}
- Node 28: {5, 12, 16, 19}
- Node 29: {9, 10, 27}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with nodes {7, 9, 22}
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with nodes {4, 14, 18}
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with nodes {4, 16, 19}, {4, 21, 29}, {9, 16, 19}, {9, 21, 29}
- Node 16: Forms a 3-star with nodes {9, 19, 28}, {9, 19, 15}, {9, 16, 25}, {16, 19, 28}, {16, 19, 15}, {16, 25, 28}
- Node 19: Forms a 3-star with nodes {9, 16, 28}, {9, 16, 25}, {9, 15, 19}, {16, 19, 28}, {16, 19, 25}, {15, 19, 25}
- Node 21: Forms a 3-star with nodes {9, 22, 21}

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 9, 22)>
<7, (4, 14, 18)>
<9, (4, 16, 19)>
<9, (4, 21, 29)>
<9, (16, 19, 28)>
<9, (16, 19, 15)>
<9, (16, 25, 28)>
<16, (9, 19, 28)>
<16, (9, 19, 15)>
<16, (9, 16, 25)>
<16, (16, 19, 28)>
<16, (16, 19, 15)>
<16, (16, 25, 28)>
<19, (9, 16, 28)>
<19, (9, 16, 25)>
<19, (9, 15, 19)>
<19, (16, 19, 28)>
<19, (16, 19, 25)>
<19, (15, 19, 25)>
<21, (9, 22, 21)>
