Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 10) (14, 7) (14, 11) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 5) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 10) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 8, 10}
- Node 1: {4, 2}
- Node 2: {7, 12, 5, 1, 10}
- Node 3: {9, 8, 12, 5}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 1}
- Node 5: {6, 2, 11, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 10, 11, 4, 13}
- Node 7: {4, 12, 11, 14, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 0, 3, 10, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 13, 0}
- Node 10: {6, 12, 0, 2, 8, 13}
- Node 11: {6, 7, 12, 14, 5}
- Node 12: {7, 2, 10, 11, 3}
- Node 13: {6, 9, 10}
- Node 14: {7, 11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: 0 3-stars (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 10 3-stars
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 15 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 0 3-stars (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: 10 3-stars
- Node 11: 10 3-stars
- Node 12: 10 3-stars
- Node 13: 0 3-stars (has 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 15 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (7, 11, 14)>
<3, (8, 10, 12)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 11)>
<7, (2, 11, 12)>
<8, (0, 3, 10)>
<10, (2, 6, 10)>
<11, (2, 7, 12)>
<12, (2, 10, 11)>
<13, (6, 10, 13)>
<14, (7, 11, 12)>
