Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are several nodes with 3 or more neighbors where 3-stars can be formed. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 7, 1, 5, 2
Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 4, 6, 9, 0, 8
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 7, 8, 0
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 7, 9, 8
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 7, 8, 1, 6, 9

For nodes with 5 neighbors (like node 1 and node 4), we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) unique 3-stars.

For nodes with 4 neighbors (like node 0), we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 10 + 4 = 24 \), which can be written as [24].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 1)>
<0, (7, 5, 1)>
<0, (7, 2, 1)>
<0, (5, 1, 8)>

<1, (4, 0, 8)>
<1, (4, 9, 6)>
