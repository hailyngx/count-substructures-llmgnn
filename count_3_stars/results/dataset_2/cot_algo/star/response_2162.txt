Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 13) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 11}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 14}
- Node 5: {8, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 10: {5, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 5, 6, 12}
- Node 12: {3, 5, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 14: {3, 4, 10, 12}

Now, let's find the 3-stars based on the node neighborhoods:
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with (6, 7, 8) and (1, 7, 8).
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with (8, 9, 13).
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with (10, 12, 13).
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with (11, 12, 13).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, and they are:
<1, 6, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <3, 8, 9, 13>, <5, 10, 12, 13> 

Putting this final number inside brackets, we get [4].
