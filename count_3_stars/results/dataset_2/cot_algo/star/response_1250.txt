- Node 28: {21, 5, 10}
- Node 29: {23, 4, 25}

The nodes with 3 neighbors or more are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For nodes with 3 neighbors:
    - Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
    - Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
    - Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
    - Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
    - Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
    - Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
    - Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
    - Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
    - Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 10 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 13 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 14 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 15 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 19 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 20 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 21 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 22 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 23 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 24 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 25 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 26 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 27 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 28 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 29 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding all the 3-stars formed by each node, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 53.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, 16, 17>, <2, 4, 25>, <3, 8, 13>, <3, 8, 19>, <3, 13, 27>, <3, 14, 26>, <4, 8, 29>, <5, 11, 25>, <5, 25, 28>, <5, 11, 28>, <6, 10, 26>, <7, 24, 25>, <10, 20, 28>, <13, 3, 27>, <14, 3, 26>, <15, 20, 22>, <15, 20, 24>, <15, 22, 24>, <20, 21, 22>, <20, 21, 28>, <20, 21, 26>, <20, 22, 21>, <21, 17, 22>, <21, 17, 28>, <21, 22, 28>, <21, 26, 28>, <22, 15, 20>, <22, 21, 28>, <22, 21, 26>, <23, 8, 29>, <24, 7, 19>, <25, 2, 29>, <25, 5, 29>, <25, 7, 24>, <26, 1, 9>, <26, 5, 25>, <26, 5, 28>, <26, 6, 10>
