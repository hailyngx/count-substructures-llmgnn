Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (1, 7, 4)>
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <4, (7, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 9, 2)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 6)>
