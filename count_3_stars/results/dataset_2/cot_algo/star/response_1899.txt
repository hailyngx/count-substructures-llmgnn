Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 2) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 13) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 10) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 11, 13, 14
- Node 1: 3, 8
- Node 2: 3, 5, 9, 10, 14
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 8, 14
- Node 4: 3, 8, 9, 13
- Node 5: 2, 11, 13
- Node 6: 0, 7, 14
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 10, 12
- Node 9: 2, 4, 10, 13
- Node 10: 2, 8, 9, 12
- Node 11: 0, 5, 13, 14
- Node 12: 8, 10, 13
- Node 13: 0, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12
- Node 14: 0, 2, 3, 6, 11

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star (having at least 3 neighbors):
- Node 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 73

Therefore, the final answer is [73] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (7, 11, 14)>
- <2, (5, 9, 14)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 10, 12)>
- <9, (2, 4, 10)>
- <10, (2, 8, 9)>
- <12, (8, 10, 13)>
- <13, (0, 5, 11)>
