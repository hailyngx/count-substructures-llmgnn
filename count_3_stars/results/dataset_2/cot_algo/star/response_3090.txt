Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 14) (16, 10) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 12) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 18) (7, 8) (7, 15) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 12) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 1) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 8) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 17) (3, 10) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (10, 16) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 1) (18, 6) (18, 17) (18, 15) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
The 3-star graph from the given data is as follows:

The nodes that have at least 3 neighbors are:
- Node 2 with neighbors {11, 5, 4, 12}
- Node 3 with neighbors {9, 6, 4, 17, 10}
- Node 8 with neighbors {4, 14, 0, 7}
- Node 10 with neighbors {16, 14, 3, 1}
- Node 12 with neighbors {6, 17, 2, 1}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (11, 5, 4)>
- <2, (11, 5, 12)>
- <2, (11, 4, 12)>
- <2, (5, 4, 12)>
- <3, (9, 6, 4)>

- <3, (9, 4, 17)>
- <3, (6, 4, 17)>
- <3, (6, 4, 10)>
- <3, (17, 4, 10)>
- <8, (4, 14, 7)>
- <8, (4, 14, 0)>
- <8, (4, 0, 7)>
- <8, (14, 0, 7)>
- <10, (16, 14, 1)>
- <10, (16, 14, 3)>
- <10, (16, 3, 1)>
- <10, (14, 3, 1)>
- <12, (6, 17, 1)>

- <12, (17, 2, 1)>
