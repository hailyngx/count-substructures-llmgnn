Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 15) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 18) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 18) (7, 6) (7, 19) (12, 16) (12, 17) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 8) (18, 13) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 19) (17, 12) (17, 15) (13, 3) (13, 18) (0, 10) (0, 8) (15, 16) (15, 17) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 8) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 10}
- Node 1: {2, 3}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 13, 18}
- Node 4: {9, 18, 19}
- Node 5: {6}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 7, 19}
- Node 7: {6, 19}
- Node 8: {0, 9, 18, 19}
- Node 9: {4, 8, 10, 16}
- Node 10: {0, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {10, 16, 19}
- Node 12: {16, 17}
- Node 13: {3, 18}
- Node 14: {2, 10}
- Node 15: {16, 17}
- Node 16: {9, 11, 12, 15}
- Node 17: {12, 15}
- Node 18: {3, 4, 8, 13}
- Node 19: {4, 6, 7, 8, 11}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 16, Node 18, Node 19

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 47

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [47]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 6, 14)>, <3, (1, 6, 13)>, <3, (1, 6, 18)>, <3, (3, 6, 13)>, <3, (3, 6, 18)>, 
<4, (9, 18, 19)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 19)>, <6, (2, 5, 19)>, 
<6, (2, 7, 19)>, <6, (3, 5, 19)>, <6, (3, 7, 19)>, <6, (5, 6, 19)>, <6, (6, 7, 19)>, 
<8, (0, 9, 18)>, <8, (0, 9, 19)>, <8, (0, 18, 19)>, <8, (8, 9, 18)>, 
<9, (4, 8, 19)>, <9, (9, 10, 16)>, <9, (9, 10, 19)>, <9, (9, 16, 19)>, 
<10, (0, 9, 10)>, <10, (0, 9, 14)>, <10, (9, 10, 14)>, <16, (9, 12, 15)>, <18, (3, 4, 8)>, 
<18, (3, 4, 13)>, <18, (3, 4, 18)>, <18, (3, 8, 13)>, <18, (3, 8, 18)>, <18, (4, 8, 13)>, 
<18, (8, 13, 18)>, <19, (6, 7, 19)>, <19, (6, 8, 19)>, <19, (6, 11, 19)>, <19, (6, 18, 19)>, 
<19, (7, 8, 19)>, <19, (8, 11, 19)>, <19, (8, 18, 19)>, <19, (9, 11, 19)>, <19, (9, 16, 19)>
