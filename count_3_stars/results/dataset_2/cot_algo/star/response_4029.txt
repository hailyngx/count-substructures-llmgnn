Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (21, 10) (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 17) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 11) (18, 22) (18, 27) (18, 0) (18, 8) (22, 2) (22, 18) (26, 1) (26, 16) (15, 20) (15, 24) (15, 28) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 5) (28, 15) (28, 14) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (9, 7) (9, 4) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 3) (24, 15) (25, 7) (25, 13) (25, 23) (25, 11) (13, 17) (13, 25) (13, 0) (10, 21) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 16) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 11) (3, 12) (3, 17) (3, 23) (16, 26) (16, 10) (16, 4) (16, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (27, 18) (27, 20) (27, 8) (5, 20) (5, 16) (5, 14) (14, 28) (14, 5) (19, 10) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 23) (11, 29) (11, 25) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 8) (23, 25) (23, 3) (23, 0) (8, 18) (8, 7) (8, 27) (8, 11) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 18, 13, 11, 23  
Node 1: 26  
Node 2: 29, 22, 17, 0  
Node 3: 12, 17, 23  
Node 4: 12, 9, 10, 16, 11  
Node 5: 20, 16, 14  
Node 6: 7, 10  
Node 7: 12, 25, 6, 9, 8  
Node 8: 18, 27, 7, 11  
Node 9: 7, 4  
Node 10: 21, 6, 4, 19, 16  
Node 11: 29, 25, 4, 0, 8  
Node 12: 7, 4, 3  
Node 13: 17, 25, 0  
Node 14: 28, 5  
Node 15: 20, 24, 28  
Node 16: 26, 10, 4, 5  
Node 17: 2, 13, 3  
Node 18: 22, 27, 0, 8  
Node 19: 10  
Node 20: 15, 27, 5  
Node 21: 10  
Node 22: 2, 18  
Node 23: 25, 3, 0  
Node 24: 15  
Node 25: 7, 13, 23, 11  
Node 26: 1, 16  
Node 27: 18, 20, 8  
Node 28: 15, 14  
Node 29: 2, 11

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed. Only nodes with three or more neighbors can potentially form 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 26, 3, 5, 6, 13, 14, 19, 24
Number of 3-stars formed by each node: 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4

Therefore, the final answer is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<26, 1, 16>
<3, 12, 17>
<5, 14, 28>
<13, 0, 25>
