Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {9, 7, 8, 6}
Node 1: Neighbors {5, 9, 3, 8}
Node 2: Neighbors {9, 4, 7, 3}
Node 3: Neighbors {4, 7, 1, 2}
Node 4: Neighbors {5, 8, 6, 3}
Node 5: Neighbors {9, 1, 4, 7}
Node 6: Neighbors {4, 0}
Node 7: Neighbors {5, 0, 3, 2}
Node 8: Neighbors {9, 4, 1, 0}
Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 2, 1}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from the nodes with 4 neighbors gives a total of \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<6, 0, 4>
<8, 1, 9>
