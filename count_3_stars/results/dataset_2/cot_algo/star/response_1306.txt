Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 11) (2, 5) (8, 5) (8, 7) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 13) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 14) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 11}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 6: {0, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 8: {5, 7}
- Node 9: {7, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {6, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {1, 5, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 4, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 6, 7, 10, 13}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 11: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 14: [inom{6}{3}] = 20

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 80

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [80]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 5, 12>, <0, 5, 14>, <0, 7, 14>, <0, 13, 14>, <1, 3, 12>, <1, 4, 12>, <1, 4, 14>, <1, 12, 14>, <3, 7, 11>, <3, 11, 13>, <5, 7, 12>, <5, 7, 14>, <5, 8, 12>, <5, 8, 7>, <7, 9, 10>, <7, 9, 12>, <7, 10, 14>, <7, 11, 14>, <10, 11, 14>, <11, 9, 12>, <11, 10, 14>, <12, 9, 11>, <12, 9, 5>, <12, 11, 5>, <13, 0, 14>, <13, 4, 14>, <14, 6, 10>, <14, 6, 7>, <14, 6, 13>, <14, 7, 13>
