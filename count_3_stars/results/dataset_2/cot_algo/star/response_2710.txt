Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
