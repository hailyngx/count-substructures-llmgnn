Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 8}

Next, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and calculate how many 3-stars can be formed around those nodes:

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 50 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].

Unique 3-stars in the graph are: 
<1, (0, 8, 9)>, 
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<1, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<1, (4, 7, 9)>, 
<1, (5, 7, 2)>, 
<2, (4, 5, 7)>, 
<4, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 3, 6)>, 
<7, (1, 4, 5)>, 
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
