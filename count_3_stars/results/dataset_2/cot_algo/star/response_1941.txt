Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 6}

Applying the formula \( \text{inom}(n, 3) \) to nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <3, 5, 7>
