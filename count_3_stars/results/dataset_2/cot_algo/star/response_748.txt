Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 1: 8, 9
Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 9
Node 3: 0, 5, 8
Node 4: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9
Node 6: 0, 2, 4
Node 7: 0, 4, 9
Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4
Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 9

Next, we will calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 54 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [54]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (7, 0, 9)>
<4, (8, 0, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 0)>
<9, (4, 8, 0)>
<9, (5, 7, 0)>
