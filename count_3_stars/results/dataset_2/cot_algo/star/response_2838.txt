Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 16) (13, 29) (13, 10) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 10) (15, 27) (15, 10) (27, 15) (27, 14) (27, 17) (8, 23) (8, 29) (8, 11) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 29) (0, 20) (0, 28) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 3) (20, 24) (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 16) (12, 2) (26, 22) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 29) (26, 4) (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 18) (17, 27) (17, 20) (17, 1) (21, 13) (10, 13) (10, 22) (10, 15) (10, 19) (11, 8) (11, 23) (11, 24) (16, 13) (16, 6) (16, 28) (28, 0) (28, 16) (28, 9) (14, 27) (14, 5) (14, 26) (14, 2) (3, 20) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 22) (4, 26) (4, 9) (4, 24) (25, 18) (24, 20) (24, 11) (24, 4) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 14) (2, 7) (7, 3) (7, 2) (29, 13) (29, 8) (29, 23) (29, 26) (9, 1) (9, 28) (9, 4) (9, 18) (18, 1) (18, 25) (18, 9) (19, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {20, 28}
- Node 1: {9, 17, 18}
- Node 2: {7, 12, 14, 26}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 20}
- Node 4: {9, 22, 24, 26}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 14, 22}
- Node 6: {5, 16}
- Node 7: {2, 3}
- Node 8: {11, 23, 29}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 9, 18, 28}
- Node 10: {13, 15, 19, 22}
- Node 11: {8, 23, 24}
- Node 12: {2}
- Node 13: {10, 16, 21, 29}
- Node 14: {2, 5, 14, 26}
- Node 15: {10, 27}
- Node 16: {6, 13, 28}
- Node 17: {1, 20, 27}
- Node 18: {1, 9, 25}
- Node 19: {10}
- Node 20: {0, 3, 17, 24}
- Node 21: {13}
- Node 22: {4, 5, 10, 26}
- Node 23: {8, 11, 29}
- Node 24: {4, 11, 20}
- Node 25: {18}
- Node 26: {2, 4, 14, 22, 29}
- Node 27: {15, 17, 27}
- Node 28: {0, 9, 16}
- Node 29: {8, 13, 26, 29}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 15, 19, 21
Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars for nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
\[ inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{5}{3} = 120 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [120].

List of unique 3-stars:

<8, (11, 23, 29)>
<9, (1, 4, 18)>
<10, (13, 15, 19)>
<13, (16, 21, 29)>
<14, (5, 14, 26)>
<17, (1, 20, 27)>
<20, (3, 17, 24)>
<22, (4, 5, 26)>
