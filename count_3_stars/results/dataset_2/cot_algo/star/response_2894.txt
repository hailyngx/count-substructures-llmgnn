Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (7, 1) (7, 12) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 9, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 8, 10}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 12}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 12}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 9: {3, 8}
- Node 10: {0, 4, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 11: {3, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {5, 7, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 10}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 5: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 6: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 7: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 12: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 13: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 14: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors

Total number of 3-stars: 60

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 1, 10>
- <0, 1, 13>
- <0, 1, 14>
- <0, 4, 10>
- <0, 4, 13>
- <0, 6, 10>
- <0, 6, 13>
- <1, 3, 14>
- <1, 5, 14>
- <4, 8, 10>
