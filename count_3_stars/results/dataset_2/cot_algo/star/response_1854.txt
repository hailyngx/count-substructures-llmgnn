Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 1) (16, 4) (9, 29) (9, 3) (9, 1) (26, 24) (26, 8) (2, 7) (29, 9) (29, 18) (3, 9) (3, 25) (3, 28) (25, 3) (25, 19) (25, 14) (25, 10) (8, 26) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 14) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 14) (23, 27) (12, 22) (12, 27) (12, 1) (27, 23) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 5) (5, 27) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 20) (24, 11) (24, 26) (24, 7) (21, 16) (21, 6) (21, 20) (21, 18) (10, 25) (10, 7) (15, 22) (15, 23) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 19) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 6) (19, 25) (19, 28) (19, 7) (18, 29) (18, 27) (18, 21) (18, 0) (14, 25) (14, 13) (14, 23) (20, 6) (20, 21) (0, 5) (0, 18) (17, 11) (17, 28) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 24) (7, 10) (7, 19) (4, 16) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 18}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 8, 12, 16}
- Node 2: Neighbor {7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 25, 28}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 16}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 27}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 20, 21}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 8, 10, 19, 24}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 7, 26}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 18, 29}
- Node 10: Neighbors {7, 25}
- Node 11: Neighbors {16, 17, 24}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 22, 27}
- Node 13: Neighbor {14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {13, 23, 25}
- Node 15: Neighbors {22, 23}
- Node 16: Neighbors {1, 4, 11, 21, 24}
- Node 17: Neighbors {11, 28}
- Node 18: Neighbors {0, 9, 27, 29}
- Node 19: Neighbors {7, 25, 28}
- Node 20: Neighbors {6, 21}
- Node 21: Neighbors {6, 16, 18, 20}
- Node 22: Neighbors {12, 15, 23}
- Node 23: Neighbors {14, 15, 22, 27}
- Node 24: Neighbors {7, 11, 16, 26}
- Node 25: Neighbors {3, 10, 14, 19}
- Node 26: Neighbors {8, 24}
- Node 27: Neighbors {5, 12, 18, 23}
- Node 28: Neighbors {3, 17, 19}
- Node 29: Neighbors {9, 18}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors where 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 1, 16, and 24 have 4 neighbors each, therefore potential 3-stars can be formed: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, and 27 have 3 neighbors each, therefore each can form 1 3-star
- Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 12 = 16

Therefore, the final solution is [16] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (6, 8, 12)>, <16, (1, 4, 21)>, <16, (1, 11, 24)>, <16, (4, 11, 24)>
