Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 1) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 3}
- Node 1: {11, 14, 12}
- Node 2: {11, 14, 3}
- Node 3: {4, 10, 11, 0, 2}
- Node 4: {9, 6, 7, 13, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 8, 12, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 14, 10, 4}
- Node 7: {4, 11, 10}
- Node 8: {5, 0, 12}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 13}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 11, 0, 3}
- Node 11: {7, 10, 3, 1, 0, 2}
- Node 12: {5, 8, 1}
- Node 13: {9, 4}
- Node 14: {6, 0, 1, 2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 13 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 76

Therefore, the final result is [76], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (9, 3, 5)>
- <3, (4, 10, 11)>
- <4, (9, 6, 7)>
- <5, (9, 8, 0)>
- <6, (9, 10, 4)>
- <9, (5, 6, 4)>
- <10, (6, 11, 3)>
- <11, (7, 10, 0)>
- <14, (0, 1, 6)>
