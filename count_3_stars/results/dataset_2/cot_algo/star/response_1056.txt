Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) 

Response:
First, we'll identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 6, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 9
Node 2: 1, 6, 7, 9
Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 5: 3, 4, 9
Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
Node 7: 2, 4, 6
Node 8: 3, 6
Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: [\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)] 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: [\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)] 3-stars
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: [\( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)] 3-stars
- Node 6 has 7 neighbors: [\( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)] 3-stars
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: [\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)] 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 20 + 35 + 10 = 73

Therefore, the final answer is [73], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (6, 4, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (3, 5, 4)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (3, 5, 4)>.
