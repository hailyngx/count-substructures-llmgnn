Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 23) (15, 5) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 11) (25, 26) (25, 23) (25, 28) (1, 28) (1, 23) (1, 0) (21, 0) (21, 26) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 22) (8, 18) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 18) (4, 15) (4, 22) (4, 24) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 14) (12, 7) (19, 17) (26, 25) (26, 21) (16, 7) (16, 28) (16, 9) (16, 10) (28, 25) (28, 1) (28, 16) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 2) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 6) (2, 9) (2, 22) (2, 20) (2, 11) (22, 8) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 5) (22, 24) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 9) (0, 29) (0, 5) (6, 18) (6, 27) (29, 0) (29, 5) (29, 10) (20, 2) (20, 24) (20, 10) (10, 16) (10, 29) (10, 20) (27, 6) (24, 4) (24, 22) (24, 20) (5, 15) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 29) (23, 3) (23, 14) (23, 25) (23, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 9, 21, 29, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 23, 28}
- Node 2: {9, 11, 20, 22}
- Node 3: {23}
- Node 4: {15, 22, 24}
- Node 5: {0, 15, 22, 29}
- Node 6: {18, 27}
- Node 7: {12, 16}
- Node 8: {9, 13, 18, 22}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 8, 16}
- Node 10: {16, 20, 29}
- Node 11: {2, 13, 17}
- Node 12: {7, 14}
- Node 13: {8, 11, 14, 18}
- Node 14: {12, 13, 17, 23}
- Node 15: {4, 5}
- Node 16: {7, 9, 10, 28}
- Node 17: {11, 14, 19}
- Node 18: {6, 8, 13}
- Node 19: {17}
- Node 20: {2, 10, 24}
- Node 21: {0, 26}
- Node 22: {2, 4, 5, 8, 24}
- Node 23: {1, 3, 14, 25}
- Node 24: {4, 20, 22}
- Node 25: {23, 26, 28}
- Node 26: {21, 25}
- Node 27: {6}
- Node 28: {1, 16, 25}
- Node 29: {0, 5, 10}

Nodes with three or more neighbors that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 10: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 13: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 14: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 16: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 22: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 23: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 24: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 28: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 29: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42].
