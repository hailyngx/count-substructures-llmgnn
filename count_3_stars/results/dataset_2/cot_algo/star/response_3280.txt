Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 13) (7, 8) (6, 16) (6, 19) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 1) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 18) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 11) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 12) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 15) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 12) (1, 9) (2, 9) (2, 3) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 18) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 3) (13, 7) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 19) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 11, 14
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 18, 19
- Node 4: 3, 7, 8, 10, 14
- Node 5: 15, 18
- Node 6: 13, 16, 19
- Node 7: 4, 8, 13
- Node 8: 4, 7, 12
- Node 9: 1, 2
- Node 10: 4, 16, 17
- Node 11: 0, 12, 14
- Node 12: 8, 11, 15, 16
- Node 13: 6, 7
- Node 14: 0, 4, 11
- Node 15: 5, 12, 18
- Node 16: 6, 10, 12, 17
- Node 17: 10, 16, 18, 19
- Node 18: 3, 5, 15, 17
- Node 19: 3, 6, 17

Now, we can identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 3: 4, 18, 19
- Node 4: 3, 7, 8, 10, 14
- Node 8: 4, 7, 12
- Node 12: 8, 11, 15, 16
- Node 16: 6, 10, 12, 17
- Node 17: 10, 16, 18, 19
- Node 18: 3, 5, 15, 17
- Node 19: 3, 6, 17

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars. Let's go through each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding them up, we have a total of 29 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [29], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (3, 7, 8, 10, 14)>
- <12, (8, 11, 15, 16)>
- <16, (6, 10, 12, 17)>
- <17, (10, 16, 18, 19)>
- <18, (3, 5, 15, 17)>
