Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 2) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 13) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 13) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {9, 10, 3, 13}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {2, 14}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {6, 11, 1, 13}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {6, 12, 0, 13}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {6, 13, 14}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {9, 6, 8, 7}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {5, 3, 2, 12, 4}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {5, 8, 12}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9, 11, 7}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 14, 0}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {11, 0, 12, 13}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {10, 8, 2}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {6, 10, 7, 14, 3}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {10, 4, 3, 0, 2, 14}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {9, 4, 12, 1, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 70

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 13>, <0, 9, 13>, <0, 10, 13>, <0, 13, 14>, <2, 6, 12>, <2, 6, 13>, <2, 11, 13>, <3, 6, 13>, <4, 6, 13>, <4, 13, 14>, <5, 6, 12>, <5, 6, 13>, <5, 6, 14>, <5, 6, 4>, <6, 12, 14>, <6, 12, 7>, <6, 4, 14>, <7, 12, 14>, <8, 9, 14>, <10, 11, 13>
