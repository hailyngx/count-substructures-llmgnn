Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 5) (17, 7) (4, 3) (4, 19) (8, 12) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 16) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 14) (18, 2) (5, 1) (5, 17) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 15) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 2) (15, 9) (15, 19) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 2) (16, 14) (16, 2) 

Response:
There are 45 nodes with multiple neighbors (having 3 or more neighbors), which we need to consider for 3-star formations. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For each of the 45 nodes with three or more neighbors, we need to calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) where \( n \) is the number of its neighbors.

1. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form any 3-stars.
4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
5. Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
6. Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form any 3-stars.
8. Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
11. Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
12. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
13. Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
14. Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form any 3-stars.
15. Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
16. Node 15 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 30.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, 9, 15>, <6, 9, 13>, <6, 9, 0>, <6, 9, 1>, <9, 6, 0>, <9, 6, 15>, <9, 6, 13>, <9, 6, 14>, <1, 6, 5>, <3, 10, 17>, <17, 3, 10>, <17, 3, 4>, <17, 3, 7>, <7, 3, 17>, <7, 3, 12>, <7, 3, 11>, <7, 3, 13>, <12, 7, 17>, <12, 7, 0>, <12, 7, 13>, <0, 9, 12>, <0, 9, 13>, <0, 12, 13>, <14, 6, 16>, <2, 18, 16>, <18, 2, 16>, <11, 6, 2>, <11, 2, 16>, <19, 10, 15>, <19, 10, 4>.
