Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 6
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 4

Let's analyze the neighbor sets for each node:
- For Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- For Node 1: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- For Node 2: {0, 3, 8}
- For Node 3: {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- For Node 4: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- For Node 5: {4, 7, 9}
- For Node 6: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- For Node 7: {1, 5, 6, 8}
- For Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- For Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars based on the neighbor sets:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 38 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [38], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>.
