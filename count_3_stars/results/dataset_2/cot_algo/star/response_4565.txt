Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (12, 5) (12, 15) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 10) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 17) (9, 1) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 19) (4, 17) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 14) (18, 16) (18, 11) (19, 3) (19, 10) (14, 13) (14, 16) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 11) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 2) (11, 18) (11, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 10, 13, 17}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 9, 13, 15}
- Node 2: {1, 11, 16, 17}
- Node 3: {1, 8, 13, 19}
- Node 4: {17}
- Node 5: {6, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 17}
- Node 9: {1}
- Node 10: {0, 5, 15, 19}
- Node 11: {2, 18}
- Node 12: {5, 15}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 3, 5, 14}
- Node 14: {13, 16}
- Node 15: {1, 10, 12}
- Node 16: {2, 14, 18}
- Node 17: {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 18: {11, 16}
- Node 19: {3, 10}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 50\)

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 10, 13)>
<1, (3, 9, 13)>
<1, (3, 13, 15)>
<1, (9, 13, 15)>
<2, (1, 11, 16)>
<3, (1, 13, 15)>
<5, (6, 10, 13)>
<10, (0, 15, 19)>
<13, (0, 5, 14)>
<13, (1, 3, 5)>
<13, (1, 3, 14)>
<13, (1, 5, 14)>
<13, (3, 5, 14)>
<13, (5, 14, 16)>
<17, (2, 4, 8)>
<17, (2, 8, 17)>
