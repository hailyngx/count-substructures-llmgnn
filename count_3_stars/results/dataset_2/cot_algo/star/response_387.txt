Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 10) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 1, 3}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 3, 13, 0, 7}
- Node 2: {13, 12, 11}
- Node 3: {1, 0, 10, 13}
- Node 4: {9, 12, 10, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 1, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 4}
- Node 7: {5, 1, 8, 14, 10}
- Node 8: {13, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 1, 13, 0}
- Node 10: {3, 13, 4, 14, 7}
- Node 11: {12, 2, 14}
- Node 12: {4, 2, 14, 11}
- Node 13: {9, 1, 3, 8, 2, 10}
- Node 14: {12, 11, 7, 10}

Next, let's identify how many 3-stars can be formed with each node:
- Node 1, 7, and 13 have 6 neighbors each, so they can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars each.
- Node 0 and 3 have 3 neighbors each, but they can't form a 3-star.
- Node 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 14 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars each.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, thus it can't form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = (20 * 3) + (4 * 8) = 60 + 32 = 92

Therefore, the final answer is [92], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 7, 13>
- <1, 7, 14>
- <1, 13, 14>
- <7, 13, 14>
- <2, 11, 12>
- <2, 11, 14>
- <2, 12, 14>
- <4, 10, 13>
