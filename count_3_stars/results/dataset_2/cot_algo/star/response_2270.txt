Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 22) (16, 8) (16, 9) (4, 11) (4, 5) (7, 16) (7, 21) (7, 10) (7, 27) (21, 7) (21, 13) (21, 9) (21, 12) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 3) (13, 21) (13, 8) (13, 29) (20, 25) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 14) (18, 15) (22, 16) (22, 28) (3, 8) (3, 26) (26, 3) (26, 28) (26, 10) (28, 8) (28, 22) (28, 26) (28, 0) (27, 7) (27, 25) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 6) (2, 12) (12, 21) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 17) (10, 7) (10, 26) (10, 27) (10, 12) (1, 11) (1, 29) (29, 13) (29, 1) (29, 0) (29, 14) (6, 27) (6, 14) (17, 11) (17, 12) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 24) (14, 25) (14, 29) (14, 6) (14, 15) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 24) (9, 16) (9, 21) (24, 27) (24, 0) (24, 15) (24, 5) (5, 4) (5, 25) (5, 24) (19, 20) (19, 25) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we first find the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {28, 29, 24}
- Node 1 neighbors: {11, 29}
- Node 2 neighbors: {12}
- Node 3 neighbors: {8, 26}
- Node 4 neighbors: {11, 5}
- Node 5 neighbors: {4, 25, 24}
- Node 6 neighbors: {27, 14}
- Node 7 neighbors: {16, 21, 10, 27}
- Node 8 neighbors: {16, 13, 28, 3}
- Node 9 neighbors: {16, 21}
- Node 10 neighbors: {7, 26, 27, 12}
- Node 11 neighbors: {16, 1, 4, 17}
- Node 12 neighbors: {21, 2, 17, 10}
- Node 13 neighbors: {21, 8, 29}
- Node 14 neighbors: {25, 29, 6, 15}
- Node 15 neighbors: {18, 14, 24}
- Node 16 neighbors: {11, 7, 9, 8}
- Node 17 neighbors: {11, 12}
- Node 18 neighbors: {15}
- Node 19 neighbors: {20, 25}
- Node 20 neighbors: {19, 25}
- Node 21 neighbors: {7, 13, 9, 12}
- Node 22 neighbors: {16, 28}
- Node 24 neighbors: {27, 0, 15, 5}
- Node 25 neighbors: {20, 27, 5, 19, 14}
- Node 26 neighbors: {3, 28, 10}
- Node 27 neighbors: {7, 25, 24, 10, 6}
- Node 28 neighbors: {8, 22, 26, 0}
- Node 29 neighbors: {1, 13, 14, 0}

We can see that nodes 0, 5, 14, 15, 24, and 25 have 3 or more neighbors, so we calculate the number of 3-stars centered at these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 24

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (28, 29, 24)>
- <5, (4, 25, 24)>
- <14, (25, 29, 6)>
- <15, (18, 14, 24)>
