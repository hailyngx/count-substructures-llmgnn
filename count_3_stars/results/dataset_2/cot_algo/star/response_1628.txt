Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 55

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (0, 3, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>
