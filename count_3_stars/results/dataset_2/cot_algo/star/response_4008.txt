Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 12) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 8) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars and list them, we will first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 14, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 14, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 7, 0, 8, 11}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 6, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 12, 13, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 13, 12, 10}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 14, 10, 3, 11, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 12, 3, 2, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 10, 11, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 2, 0}
- Node 10: Neighbors {5, 4, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors {6, 2, 8}
- Node 12: Neighbors {5, 4, 7, 3}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 4, 6, 10}
- Node 14: Neighbors {6, 0, 1}

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node gives us: 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 69. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [69].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 9, 14>, 
<1, 14, 8>, 
<2, 0, 9>, 
<2, 0, 14>, 
<2, 0, 2>, 
<2, 0, 11>, 
<2, 7, 11>, 
<2, 8, 11>, 
<3, 7, 12>, 
<6, 3, 12>, 
<6, 11, 2>, 
<7, 12, 4>, 
<7, 12, 3>, 
<8, 1, 7>, 
<9, 5, 12>, 
<10, 5, 4>, 
<10, 5, 13>, 
<10, 5, 10>, 
<10, 5, 6>, 
<10, 5, 3>,
