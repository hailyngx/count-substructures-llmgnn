Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 13) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (4, 18) (4, 3) (4, 15) (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 8) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 7) (0, 5) (7, 16) (7, 1) (7, 8) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 15) (19, 10) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 10) (2, 16) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 3) (15, 4) (15, 19) (15, 6) (3, 16) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (6, 14) (6, 15) (10, 5) (10, 19) (10, 13) (8, 18) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are four nodes with exactly three neighbors: nodes 5, 14, 16, and 18. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 5:
Neighbors: 0, 9, 10, 18, 19
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 9, 10)>, <5, (0, 9, 18)>, <5, (0, 9, 19)>, <5, (0, 10, 18)>, <5, (0, 10, 19)>, <5, (0, 18, 19)>, <5, (9, 10, 18)>, <5, (9, 10, 19)>, <5, (9, 18, 19)>, <5, (10, 18, 19)>

Node 14:
Neighbors: 6, 9, 11, 17
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <14, (6, 9, 11)>, <14, (6, 9, 17)>, <14, (6, 11, 17)>, <14, (9, 11, 17)>

Node 16:
Neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 18
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <16, (2, 3, 7)>, <16, (2, 3, 18)>, <16, (2, 7, 18)>, <16, (3, 7, 18)>

Node 18:
Neighbors: 4, 5, 8, 16
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <18, (4, 5, 8)>, <18, (4, 5, 16)>, <18, (4, 8, 16)>, <18, (5, 8, 16)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the given graph is [22].
