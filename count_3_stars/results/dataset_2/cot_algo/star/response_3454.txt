Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 22) (21, 9) (21, 12) (21, 15) (12, 21) (12, 27) (12, 10) (12, 22) (27, 12) (27, 8) (28, 29) (28, 5) (29, 28) (29, 9) (29, 22) (15, 21) (15, 20) (15, 7) (15, 16) (20, 1) (20, 15) (20, 23) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 25) (18, 3) (7, 15) (7, 25) (7, 23) (7, 14) (7, 5) (25, 18) (25, 7) (25, 8) (9, 21) (9, 29) (9, 11) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 8) (0, 13) (16, 15) (16, 22) (16, 8) (5, 28) (5, 7) (5, 26) (5, 22) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 8) (2, 6) (23, 20) (23, 7) (23, 26) (6, 2) (6, 24) (24, 6) (24, 3) (24, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 14) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 11) (10, 12) (10, 26) (10, 24) (3, 18) (3, 24) (3, 19) (19, 1) (19, 3) (22, 1) (22, 12) (22, 29) (22, 16) (22, 5) (8, 27) (8, 25) (8, 17) (8, 16) (8, 26) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 20, 19, 22
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 18, 24, 19
- Node 4: 18
- Node 5: 28, 7, 26, 22
- Node 6: 2, 24
- Node 7: 15, 25, 23, 14, 5
- Node 8: 27, 25, 17, 16, 26
- Node 9: 21, 29, 11
- Node 10: 12, 26, 24
- Node 11: 9, 13, 14
- Node 12: 21, 27, 10, 22
- Node 13: 17, 11, 14, 0
- Node 14: 7, 13, 11
- Node 15: 21, 20, 7, 16
- Node 16: 15, 22, 8
- Node 17: 13, 8
- Node 18: 4, 25, 3
- Node 19: 1, 3
- Node 20: 1, 15, 23
- Node 21: 9, 12, 15
- Node 22: 1, 12, 29, 16, 5
- Node 23: 20, 7, 26
- Node 24: 6, 3, 10
- Node 25: 18, 7, 8
- Node 26: 5, 23, 10, 8
- Node 27: 12, 8
- Node 28: 29, 5
- Node 29: 28, 9, 22

Now, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 10 3-stars
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 4 3-stars
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 4 3-stars
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 4 3-stars
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors: 10 3-stars
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: 4 3-stars
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star

Total number of unique 3-stars: 49
The answer is [49].
