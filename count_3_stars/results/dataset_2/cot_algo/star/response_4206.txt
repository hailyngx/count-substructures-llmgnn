Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 3) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented visually as follows:

```
                   6       13
                   |       |
                   1---7---14
                   |       |
                   9---4---0
                    \ /   /|
                     10--2 5
                      |  / |
                      11-3--8
                        |
                        12
```

Now, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {4, 10, 14}
- Node 1: neighbors {6, 7, 9, 10, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {8, 10, 3, 5, 11, 12}
- Node 3: neighbors {8, 11, 13, 5}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 10}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 5, 14}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 4, 10}
- Node 10: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 11: neighbors {8, 10, 2, 3}
- Node 12: neighbors {2, 4, 13}
- Node 13: neighbors {3, 12, 14}
- Node 14: neighbors {0, 7, 13}

Now, we can see that the nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13 have 3 or more neighbors and contribute to the formation of 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1

Summing these up: 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 78

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [78].

Unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 4, 14>, 
<1, 5, 8>, 
<2, 3, 11>, 
<2, 4, 12>, 
<2, 5, 7>, 
<2, 8, 10>, 
<3, 5, 13>, 
<4, 8, 11>, 
<8, 10, 11>, 
<11, 13, 14>.
