Response:
The 3-star graph from the given input will have the following structure and calculations:

Node 4: Neighbors {7, 14}, inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 7: Neighbors {4, 11, 2}, inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 18: Neighbors {15, 21, 3, 8}, inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 22: Neighbors {9, 11, 24, 21}, inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 14: Neighbors {4, 17, 3, 16}, inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 17: Neighbors {14, 25}, inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 21: Neighbors {18, 22, 19}, inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 15: Neighbors {18, 13}, inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 20: Neighbors {13, 28}, inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 6: Neighbors {11}, inom{1}{3} = 0
Node 28: Neighbors {20, 26, 0}, inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 13: Neighbors {15, 20, 16}, inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 26: Neighbors {28, 24, 29}, inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 24: Neighbors {22, 26, 9}, inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 9: Neighbors {22, 24, 29, 3}, inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 29: Neighbors {26, 9, 27, 12}, inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 5: Neighbors {19, 8, 12}, inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 19: Neighbors {21, 5, 2, 10}, inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 12: Neighbors {29, 5, 23}, inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 16: Neighbors {14, 13, 23, 10}, inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 25: Neighbors {17, 8, 11}, inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 0: Neighbors {28}, inom{1}{3} = 0
Node 10: Neighbors {19, 16}, inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 2: Neighbors {7, 19, 23}, inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 11: Neighbors {7, 22, 6, 25, 8}, inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 3: Neighbors {18, 14, 9, 23}, inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 27: Neighbors {29, 23}, inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 8: Neighbors {18, 5, 25, 11}, inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 23: Neighbors {12, 16, 2, 3, 27}, inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 61

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [61].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <7, (4, 11, 2)>
- <21, (18, 22, 19)>
- <28, (20, 26, 0)>
- <13, (15, 20, 16)>
- <26, (28, 24, 29)>
- <24, (22, 26, 9)>
- <9, (22, 24, 29)>
- <29, (26, 9, 27)>
- <19, (21, 5, 2, 10)>
- <16, (14, 13, 23, 10)>
- <11, (7, 22, 6, 25, 8)>
- <3, (18, 14, 9, 23)>
