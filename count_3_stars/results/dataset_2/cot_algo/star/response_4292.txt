Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 10) (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 13) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 7) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 1) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 6) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 17) (18, 19) (18, 8) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 13) (8, 16) (8, 18) (2, 9) (2, 13) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 4) (17, 11) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 4) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 14, 17}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 10}
- Node 2: {9, 13}
- Node 3: {4, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 17}
- Node 5: {7, 9}
- Node 6: {12, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 15}
- Node 8: {16, 18}
- Node 9: {2, 13, 17}
- Node 10: {1, 11, 16}
- Node 11: {10, 12, 14, 16, 17}
- Node 12: {3, 6, 11}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 6, 9, 19}
- Node 14: {0, 11}
- Node 15: {7}
- Node 16: {8, 10, 11, 19}
- Node 17: {0, 4, 9, 11}
- Node 18: {8, 19}
- Node 19: {13, 16, 18}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 27

So, the final answer is [27], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 17>
- <0, 4, 17>
- <0, 9, 17>
- <0, 11, 17>
- <4, 9, 17>
- <11, 13, 17>
- <11, 16, 19>
- <11, 9, 16>
- <11, 13, 16>
- <13, 16, 19>
