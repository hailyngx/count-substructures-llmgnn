Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 10) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 8, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 11}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {4, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 8, 12}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {5, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {3, 5, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 13: {9, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 10, 11, 13}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, which are potential centers of 3-stars. These nodes are: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these potential centers:

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 50 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 12)>, <5, (1, 3, 11)>, <5, (1, 10, 12)>, <6, (4, 8, 11)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 10, 12)>, <10, (5, 6, 14)>, <11, (3, 5, 14)>, <12, (4, 7, 9)>, <14, (10, 11, 13)>.
