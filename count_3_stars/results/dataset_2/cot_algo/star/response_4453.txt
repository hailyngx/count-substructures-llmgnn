Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 15) (22, 13) (22, 28) (22, 21) (1, 21) (1, 20) (1, 28) (21, 22) (21, 1) (21, 29) (21, 4) (2, 29) (2, 0) (29, 21) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 16) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 3) (27, 11) (27, 16) (27, 8) (8, 27) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 25) (23, 8) (23, 16) (23, 10) (23, 20) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 24) (17, 29) (17, 26) (17, 4) (11, 27) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 6) (28, 22) (28, 1) (28, 9) (28, 10) (18, 26) (18, 9) (26, 17) (26, 18) (26, 7) (7, 26) (25, 8) (15, 13) (15, 19) (5, 12) (5, 11) (19, 11) (19, 15) (16, 29) (16, 27) (16, 23) (9, 14) (9, 28) (9, 18) (9, 3) (3, 12) (3, 9) (3, 6) (20, 1) (20, 23) (20, 10) (24, 8) (24, 14) (10, 12) (10, 23) (10, 28) (10, 20) (4, 13) (4, 21) (4, 17) (4, 6) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to find the neighbors for each node:

1: {21, 20, 28}
2: {29, 0}
3: {12, 9, 6}
4: {13, 21, 17, 6}
5: {12, 11}
6: {11, 3, 4}
7: {26}
8: {27, 23, 24, 25}
9: {14, 28, 18, 3}
10: {12, 23, 28, 20}
11: {27, 19, 5, 6}
12: {5, 10, 0, 3}
13: {22, 4, 15}
14: {0, 24, 9}
15: {13, 19}
16: {29, 27, 23}
17: {29, 26, 4}
18: {26, 9}
19: {11, 15}
20: {1, 23, 10}
21: {22, 1, 29, 4}
22: {13, 28, 21}
23: {8, 16, 10, 20}
24: {8, 14}
25: {8}
26: {17, 18, 7}
27: {8, 16, 11}
28: {22, 1, 9, 10}
29: {2, 21, 17, 16}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 11: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 17: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 18: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars
Node 20: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 21: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 22: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 23: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 24: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars
Node 26: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 28: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 29: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 21, 28>
<4, 13, 21>
<4, 17, 21>
<4, 6, 11>
<9, 28, 10>
<10, 20, 23>
<16, 27, 23>
<16, 29, 27>
<21, 4, 17>
<22, 13, 28>
<26, 17, 18>
<28, 1, 9>
<28, 10, 20>
<29, 16, 27>
