Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a clearer way:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 9, 8, 5, and 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 5, 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 9, 1.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 0, 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 9, 5, 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 0, 6, 9, 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 2, 5, 0, 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 6, 1, 0.

Next, let's find the neighbors of each node: 
- Node 0: {7, 9, 8, 5, 3}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 8}
- Node 3: {8, 5, 0}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 9, 1}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {7, 9, 5, 2}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 6, 9, 1}
- Node 8: {4, 2, 5, 0, 3}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 6, 1, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph. We'll look at each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 44. 

Therefore, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <0, (7, 8, 5)>
- <0, (9, 8, 3)>
- <0, (9, 8, 5)>
- <0, (9, 5, 3)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (7, 9, 1)>
- <7, (9, 1, 4)>
- <8, (9, 0, 4)>
- <8, (9, 0, 7)>
- <8, (9, 4, 7)>
- <8, (9, 5, 0)>
- <8, (9, 5, 3)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>
- <9, (1, 4, 7)>
- <9, (1, 4, 0)>
- <9, (1, 7, 4)>
