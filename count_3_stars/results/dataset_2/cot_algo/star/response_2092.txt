Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (16, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 17) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 18) (9, 2) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 14) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 2) (4, 6) (8, 18) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 19) (14, 10) (14, 19) (14, 13) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 2) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 5) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 7) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 7) (18, 9) (18, 8) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 5) (2, 7) (7, 10) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 2) (12, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3, 6, 19}
Node 1: {7, 10, 17}
Node 2: {5, 7, 9, 16, 17}
Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13}
Node 4: {6}
Node 5: {2, 3, 11, 13, 19}
Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 11, 13}
Node 7: {1, 2, 10, 19}
Node 8: {18}
Node 9: {2, 18}
Node 10: {1, 7, 14, 17}
Node 11: {3, 5, 6, 13}
Node 12: {3}
Node 13: {5, 6, 11, 14}
Node 14: {10, 13, 19}
Node 15: {17}
Node 16: {2}
Node 17: {1, 2, 10, 15}
Node 18: {8, 9}
Node 19: {0, 5, 7, 14}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 9
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 7
Nodes with 6 neighbors: 5, 6, 13, 17, 19
Nodes with 7 neighbors: 3

Calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 3-stars
Nodes with 4 neighbors: \( inom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars
Nodes with 5 neighbors: \( inom{5}{3} \) = 10 3-stars
Nodes with 6 neighbors: \( inom{6}{3} \) = 20 3-stars
Nodes with 7 neighbors: \( inom{7}{3} \) = 35 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 6 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 35 = 75

Therefore, the final answer is [75].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 3, 19>, <1, 7, 10>, <1, 10, 17>, <1, 10, 14>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 17>, <2, 7, 10>, <2, 7, 17>, <2, 9, 18>, <3, 5, 11>, <3, 5, 13>, <3, 6, 11>, <5, 13, 14>, <6, 11, 13>, <7, 10, 17>, <7, 10, 19>, <11, 13, 14>, <13, 14, 19>, <17, 15, 10>
