Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 1) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (8, 13) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 19) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 17) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 18) (15, 16) (15, 18) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 19) (6, 14) (6, 12) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 1) (19, 10) (19, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 15) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 13}
- Node 1: {9, 10, 12, 2}
- Node 2: {1}
- Node 3: {5, 4, 12}
- Node 4: {16, 13, 10, 3}
- Node 5: {3, 14}
- Node 6: {14, 12}
- Node 7: {11, 0}
- Node 8: {13}
- Node 9: {1}
- Node 10: {11, 4, 1, 19, 18}
- Node 11: {16, 10, 14, 7}
- Node 12: {6, 1, 3}
- Node 13: {4, 8, 17, 0}
- Node 14: {11, 5, 6, 19}
- Node 15: {16, 18}
- Node 16: {11, 15, 17, 18, 4}
- Node 17: {13, 0, 18, 16}
- Node 18: {16, 10, 17, 15}
- Node 19: {10, 14}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (9, 10, 12), (1, 2, 12), (1, 10, 19), (1, 12, 3)>
<3, (5, 4, 12)>
<4, (16, 10, 18), (16, 10, 4), (16, 18, 15), (16, 18, 17)>
<10, (11, 4, 19), (11, 14, 19), (4, 16, 13), (4, 10, 13), (10, 11, 14), (10, 11, 18), (10, 18, 17), (14, 6, 12), (1, 9, 10), (1, 2, 12)>
<12, (6, 14, 19)>
<13, (4, 8, 17), (4, 8, 0), (4, 13, 0), (8, 13, 17)>
<14, (11, 5, 6), (11, 5, 19), (11, 6, 12), (5, 14, 19)>
<16, (11, 15, 18), (11, 15, 16), (11, 16, 17), (16, 15, 18), (16, 17, 18)>
<17, (13, 0, 18), (13, 0, 17), (0, 17, 18), (16, 17, 18)>
