Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
Since we have 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can already see that this is a complete graph \( K_{10} \) as it has the maximum number of edges for 10 nodes.

Using the edge list, we can determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 9, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 1, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 1, 7, 2}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 8, 2}
- Node 5: {1, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {9, 3, 4, 8, 2}
- Node 8: {9, 1, 4, 7, 0}
- Node 9: {6, 7, 8, 0}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
- Node 1: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4
- Node 2: [\( \binom{5}{3} \)] = 10
- Node 3: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4
- Node 4: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4
- Node 7: [\( \binom{5}{3} \)] = 10
- Node 8: [\( \binom{5}{3} \)] = 10
- Node 9: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is 37, so we put this inside brackets: [37].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (5, 8, 9)>, 
<1, (2, 3, 8)>, 
<1, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<1, (3, 5, 7)>, 
<1, (4, 6, 7)>, 
<2, (4, 6, 7)>, 
<3, (1, 5, 7)>, 
<4, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<7, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
