Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 9
Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5
Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 7
Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 9
Node 5: 1, 2, 3
Node 6: 0, 4, 7, 9
Node 7: 3, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 0, 7, 9
Node 9: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node. We will only consider nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding all the possible 3-stars together, we get a total of 40 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [40], with the unique 3-stars found being:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
