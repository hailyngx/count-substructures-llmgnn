Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in terms of its adjacency list:

Node 0: 4, 8
Node 1: 4, 2, 7, 5
Node 2: 9, 8, 1, 3
Node 3: 5, 2, 7
Node 4: 8, 0, 1, 6
Node 5: 9, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7
Node 6: 5, 4, 8, 7
Node 7: 5, 9, 6, 3, 1
Node 8: 5, 4, 2, 0, 6
Node 9: 5, 9, 2, 7

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 5: 
Neighbor set: {9, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7}
Number of 3-star: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Unique 3-stars for node 5: <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (9, 6, 3)>, <5, (9, 8, 1)>, <5, (9, 8, 3)>, <5, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (6, 8, 1)>, <5, (6, 8, 3)>, <5, (6, 1, 3)>, <5, (8, 1, 3)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 8, 7)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>, <5, (6, 8, 7)>, <5, (6, 1, 7)>, <5, (6, 3, 7)>, <5, (8, 1, 7)>, <5, (8, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
