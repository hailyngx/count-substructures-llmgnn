Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 1) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 12) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 10, 11}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 10, 11}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 10, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 3, 8, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 8, 9}
- Node 12: Neighbors {3, 10, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {2, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {4, 7, 9, 10, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 82 \)

So, the final number of 3-stars in the given graph is [82].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <7, (2, 3, 5)>
- <9, (2, 10, 13)>
- <10, (1, 8, 11)>
- <13, (9, 12, 14)>
- <14, (9, 10, 13)>
