Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 1, Node 4, Node 6, and Node 8 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 3 and Node 9 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 48 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>
