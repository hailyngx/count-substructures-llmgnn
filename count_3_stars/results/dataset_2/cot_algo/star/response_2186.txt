Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 3}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 4, 7}

Next, we identify nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these nodes can form 3-stars. These nodes are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9.

For each of these nodes, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to calculate how many unique 3-stars can be formed with that node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 68

Therefore, the final answer is [68].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (8, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (8, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 1)>, <7, (8, 9, 1)>.
