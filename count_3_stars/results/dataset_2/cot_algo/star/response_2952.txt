Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighborhood set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 3}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 0 as the center.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 3 as the center.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 4 as the center.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 5 as the center.
- Node 6 has 7 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars with Node 6 as the center.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 9 as the center.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 35 + 4] = [73]\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (3, 4, 6)>
