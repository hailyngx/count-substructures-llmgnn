Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more visual and organized way:

```
0 -- 6 -- 9 -- 8 -- 2
|    |    |    |    |
5    4    1    0    1
|    |    |    |    |
7 -- 3    9 -- 5 -- 2
```

Next, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 20 = 30 \), which we'll represent as [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <6, (0, 4, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (0, 1, 8)>
- <9, (0, 3, 8)>
- <9, (1, 3, 8)>
- <9, (3, 8, 5)>
- <9, (0, 6, 8)>
- <9, (1, 6, 8)>
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
- <9, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 4, 8)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>
- <9, (4, 5, 8)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (4, 6, 9)>
- <9, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (4, 9, 0)>
- <9, (4, 9, 8)>
- <9, (6, 7, 4)>
- <9, (6, 7, 5)>
- <9, (7, 5, 8)>
