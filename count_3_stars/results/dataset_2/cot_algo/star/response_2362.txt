Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (9, 18) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 23) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 24) (21, 7) (21, 19) (21, 29) (18, 9) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 17) (22, 18) (22, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (10, 28) (10, 29) (11, 7) (11, 23) (23, 4) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 1) (0, 9) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 17) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 6) (15, 20) (15, 24) (6, 7) (6, 20) (6, 28) (28, 10) (28, 6) (26, 14) (26, 27) (1, 23) (1, 25) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (13, 5) (13, 20) (13, 2) (29, 21) (29, 10) (29, 12) (25, 1) (25, 19) (27, 26) (27, 16) (19, 21) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 25) (19, 24) (14, 23) (14, 26) (14, 1) (12, 29) (12, 16) (12, 17) (16, 27) (16, 12) (8, 3) (8, 17) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 24) (24, 7) (24, 15) (24, 19) (24, 2) (17, 18) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 9, 22, 20, 17
- Node 1: 23, 25, 14
- Node 2: 10, 3, 13, 24
- Node 3: 4, 2, 8
- Node 4: 7, 23, 3
- Node 5: 13
- Node 6: 7, 20, 28
- Node 7: 4, 21, 11, 6, 24
- Node 8: 3, 17
- Node 9: 18, 0
- Node 10: 19, 2, 28, 29
- Node 11: 7, 23
- Node 12: 29, 16, 17
- Node 13: 5, 20, 2
- Node 14: 23, 26, 1
- Node 15: 20, 24
- Node 16: 27, 12
- Node 17: 18, 0, 12, 8
- Node 18: 9, 22, 19, 17
- Node 19: 21, 18, 10, 25, 24
- Node 20: 0, 15, 13, 6
- Node 21: 7, 19, 29
- Node 22: 18, 0
- Node 23: 4, 11, 14, 1
- Node 24: 7, 15, 19, 2
- Node 25: 1, 19
- Node 26: 14, 27
- Node 27: 26, 16
- Node 28: 10, 6, 2
- Node 29: 21, 10, 12

Now let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars based on the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 68 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
