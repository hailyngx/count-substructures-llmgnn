Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 7) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 14) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {10, 11}
- Node 1: {7, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 9, 12}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {8, 13}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 10}
- Node 10: {0, 4, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 14: {4, 7, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 14 have three or more neighbors.

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is: 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 78

Therefore, the final answer is [78], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (6, 13, 14)>
- <4, (3, 9, 11)>
- <7, (1, 12, 13)>
- <10, (0, 8, 11)>
- <11, (2, 4, 10)>
- <12, (3, 7, 14)>
- <14, (3, 4, 12)>
