Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, which are not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, which are not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, which are not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, which are not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, which are not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors, which are not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, which are not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, which are not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 20 has 2 neighbors, which are not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 2 neighbors, which are not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, which are not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, which are not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, which are not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 28 has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars formed by the nodes that have enough neighbors, we get a total of 36.
Therefore, the final answer is [36].
