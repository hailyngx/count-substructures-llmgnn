Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 19) (27, 11) (27, 20) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 13) (7, 0) (7, 19) (21, 26) (21, 14) (21, 24) (4, 9) (4, 16) (18, 22) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 25) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 16) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 11) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 28) (13, 9) (13, 18) (13, 0) (28, 23) (17, 29) (17, 24) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 3) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 16) (3, 29) (3, 12) (1, 9) (1, 10) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 20) (26, 21) (26, 23) (26, 2) (26, 25) (11, 27) (11, 22) (11, 8) (11, 25) (2, 26) (2, 10) (5, 12) (5, 24) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 29) (19, 25) (19, 10) (20, 27) (20, 16) (20, 14) (14, 21) (14, 8) (14, 20) (12, 18) (12, 3) (12, 5) (24, 21) (24, 17) (24, 5) (24, 10) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 19) (10, 24) (25, 18) (25, 26) (25, 11) (25, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 13, 16}
- Node 1: {9, 10}
- Node 2: {10, 26}
- Node 3: {12, 29}
- Node 4: {9, 16}
- Node 5: {12, 24}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {0, 19}
- Node 8: {11, 14, 23}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 13, 16}
- Node 10: {1, 10, 18, 19, 24}
- Node 11: {8, 22, 25, 27}
- Node 12: {3, 5, 18}
- Node 13: {0, 9, 18}
- Node 14: {8, 20, 21}
- Node 15: {19}
- Node 16: {0, 4, 9, 20}
- Node 17: {24, 29}
- Node 18: {10, 12, 13, 22, 25}
- Node 19: {7, 10, 15, 25, 29}
- Node 20: {16, 20, 27}
- Node 21: {14, 21, 24, 26}
- Node 22: {11, 16, 18}
- Node 23: {8, 26, 28}
- Node 24: {5, 10, 14, 17, 21}
- Node 25: {11, 18, 19, 26}
- Node 26: {2, 21, 23, 25}
- Node 27: {11, 20}
- Node 28: {23}
- Node 29: {3, 17, 19}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 9, Node 10, Node 18, Node 19, and Node 25 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8, Node 11, Node 16, and Node 21 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12, Node 14, and Node 24 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7, Node 20, and Node 26 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 3-star each.

Adding all the possibilities together: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 65 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [65].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 13, 16)>, <9, (1, 4, 13)>, <10, (1, 18, 19)>, <18, (10, 13, 25)>, <19, (10, 25, 29)>, <25, (11, 18, 26)>, <8, (11, 14, 23)>, <11, (16, 22, 25)>, <16, (0, 4, 9)>, <21, (14, 21, 24)>.
