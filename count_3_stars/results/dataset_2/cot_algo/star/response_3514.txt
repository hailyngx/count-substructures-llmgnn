Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 22) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 27) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 19) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 14) (26, 8) (28, 6) (28, 29) (28, 27) (28, 20) (29, 28) (3, 11) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 21) (17, 20) (17, 24) (17, 15) (17, 18) (20, 1) (20, 28) (20, 17) (20, 21) (21, 11) (21, 20) (18, 26) (18, 11) (18, 17) (14, 26) (14, 27) (14, 16) (14, 5) (2, 22) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 25) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 5) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 19) (12, 10) (12, 25) (12, 8) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 15) (15, 17) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 13) (8, 26) (8, 12) (24, 7) (24, 17) (27, 7) (27, 28) (27, 14) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 19) (25, 2) (25, 12) (5, 14) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {10, 5, 13}
- Node 1: {9, 26, 20, 19}
- Node 2: {22, 13, 10, 25}
- Node 3: {11}
- Node 4: {7, 22}
- Node 5: {14, 22, 0, 15}
- Node 6: {9, 28, 13}
- Node 7: {4, 24, 27}
- Node 8: {26, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 16}
- Node 10: {2, 0, 12, 19}
- Node 11: {3, 18, 21}
- Node 12: {10, 25, 8}
- Node 13: {6, 2, 0, 19}
- Node 14: {26, 27, 16, 5}
- Node 15: {17, 16, 19, 5}
- Node 16: {9, 14, 15}
- Node 17: {20, 24, 15, 18}
- Node 18: {26, 11, 17}
- Node 19: {1, 10, 15, 13}
- Node 20: {1, 28, 17, 21}
- Node 21: {11, 20}
- Node 22: {4, 2, 5}
- Node 25: {2, 12}
- Node 26: {1, 18, 14, 8}
- Node 27: {7, 28, 14}
- Node 28: {6, 29, 27, 20}
- Node 29: {28}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, Node 10, Node 19, Node 26, Node 5, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 20, Node 27, and Node 28.

For each of these nodes, we can form a 3-star. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+1+4+1+4+1+4 = 38 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the given graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (9, 20, 19)>
- <10, (2, 12, 19)>
- <19, (1, 15, 13)>
- <26, (1, 18, 8)>
- <5, (22, 15, 0)>
- <13, (6, 19, 0)>
- <14, (27, 16, 5)>
- <15, (17, 19, 5)>
- <16, (9, 14, 15)>
- <17, (20, 24, 15)>
- <18, (26, 11, 17)>
- <20, (1, 28, 21)>
- <27, (7, 14, 28)>
- <28, (6, 29, 20)>
