Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 6, 7, 8, 2
Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 2: 0, 5, 6
Node 3: 1, 6, 8
Node 4: 1, 9
Node 5: 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5
Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 9
Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 9
Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up gives a total of 30 3-stars, which we represent as [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 9, 8)>
<5, (8, 9, 0)>
<5, (8, 9, 3)>
<5, (9, 8, 3)>
<5, (9, 8, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 1, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (7, 5, 8)>
<9, (7, 5, 8)>
