Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8, 9, 2
- Node 1: 4, 5, 9, 0
- Node 2: 4, 7, 5, 0, 9
- Node 3: 4, 6, 5
- Node 4: 7, 1, 3, 2
- Node 5: 1, 3, 8, 2
- Node 6: 7, 3, 0
- Node 7: 4, 6, 9, 8, 2
- Node 8: 7, 5, 0
- Node 9: 7, 1, 0, 2

Next, we check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0: forms 3-stars with (0, 1, 9), (0, 2, 9)
- Node 1: forms 3-stars with (1, 4, 9)
- Node 2: forms 3-stars with (2, 4, 7), (2, 7, 9)
- Node 3: does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors
- Node 4: does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors
- Node 5: does not form a 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors
- Node 6: does not form a 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors
- Node 7: forms 3-stars with (7, 4, 2), (7, 4, 1), (7, 4, 2), (7, 2, 9)
- Node 8: does not form a 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors
- Node 9: forms 3-stars with (9, 1, 7), (9, 1, 0), (9, 1, 2), (9, 0, 2)

The total number of 3-stars is 8, so we put it inside brackets: [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <7, 4, 2>, <7, 4, 1>, <7, 2, 9>, <9, 1, 7>, <9, 1, 0>, <9, 1, 2>, <9, 0, 2>.
