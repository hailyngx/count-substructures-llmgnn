Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 15) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 8) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 1) (12, 19) (15, 10) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 8) (19, 16) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 16) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 1) (13, 6) (13, 0) (17, 9) 

Response:
Since this graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can start by organizing the information into a more structured format to analyze it more effectively. Let's create an adjacency list based on the given edges:

Node 0: 6, 9, 11, 13, 3
Node 1: 2, 12, 14, 5, 16
Node 2: 18, 1
Node 3: 7, 6, 0
Node 4: 7, 19
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 9, 10, 3, 0, 13
Node 7: 4, 12, 3, 8
Node 8: 7, 18, 19, 16
Node 9: 6, 17, 0
Node 10: 6, 11, 15
Node 11: 10, 0, 14
Node 12: 7, 18, 1, 19
Node 13: 6, 0
Node 14: 11, 1
Node 15: 10
Node 16: 8, 19, 1
Node 17: 9
Node 18: 2, 12, 8
Node 19: 4, 12, 8, 16

Now, we can determine the neighbors for each node and identify how many 3-star configurations exist in the graph. Let's calculate this by examining each node:

Node 0: 5 neighbors
Node 1: 5 neighbors
Node 2: 2 neighbors
Node 3: 3 neighbors
Node 4: 2 neighbors
Node 5: 1 neighbor
Node 6: 5 neighbors
Node 7: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 4 neighbors
Node 9: 3 neighbors
Node 10: 3 neighbors
Node 11: 3 neighbors
Node 12: 4 neighbors
Node 13: 2 neighbors
Node 14: 2 neighbors
Node 15: 1 neighbor
Node 16: 3 neighbors
Node 17: 1 neighbor
Node 18: 3 neighbors
Node 19: 4 neighbors

There are several nodes with 3 or more neighbors, so let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Sum of inom{n}{3} for nodes: (0, 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 18, 19) = 56

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
