Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 9, 3 <1, (4, 9, 3)>
- Node 2: forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, 9 <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 3: forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 8 <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 4: forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, 9 <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 5: forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, 6 <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 8: forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, 9 <6, (1, 3, 9)>

There are 6 unique 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [6].
