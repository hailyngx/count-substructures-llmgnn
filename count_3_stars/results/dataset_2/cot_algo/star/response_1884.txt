Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 6) (1, 10) (1, 9) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 13) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 8, 14, 3, 4, 5, 13
- Node 1: 10, 9
- Node 2: 8, 13, 3, 7, 11
- Node 3: 2, 0, 7, 10, 5
- Node 4: 0, 12
- Node 5: 8, 0, 3, 12, 7
- Node 6: 12, 10, 13
- Node 7: 2, 8, 14, 3, 5
- Node 8: 2, 5, 0, 7
- Node 9: 11, 1, 13
- Node 10: 14, 3, 1, 6
- Node 11: 2, 9, 13, 12
- Node 12: 4, 11, 5, 6
- Node 13: 2, 0, 11, 6, 9
- Node 14: 0, 7, 10

Now we can identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 78

So, the final answer is [78], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 4, 13)>, <0, (3, 5, 12)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 13)>, <0, (5, 12, 13)>, <2, (7, 11, 13)>, <2, (8, 11, 13)>, <2, (8, 11, 9)>, <2, (8, 13, 9)>, <2, (9, 11, 13)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 13)>, <3, (7, 11, 13)>, <5, (7, 12, 13)>, <7, (8, 10, 14)>, <7, (8, 13, 9)>, <10, (12, 13, 6)>, <13, (9, 11, 6)>
