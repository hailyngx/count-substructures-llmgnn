Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 28) (9, 19) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 26) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 14) (3, 25) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 20) (25, 6) (25, 3) (25, 21) (0, 3) (0, 19) (20, 3) (20, 27) (20, 18) (1, 28) (26, 4) (26, 22) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 1) (28, 12) (22, 26) (22, 2) (5, 12) (5, 29) (5, 17) (13, 11) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 29) (15, 10) (15, 23) (15, 8) (2, 22) (2, 27) (2, 21) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 28) (12, 5) (16, 7) (16, 27) (23, 15) (23, 24) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 27) (24, 3) (24, 23) (24, 17) (24, 18) (29, 5) (29, 10) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 15) (17, 5) (17, 24) (14, 7) (14, 18) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 10) (21, 25) (21, 2) (21, 27) (21, 18) (27, 20) (27, 2) (27, 16) (27, 11) (27, 21) (18, 20) (18, 24) (18, 14) (18, 21) 

Response:
The nodes and edges provided can be represented in the following form:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: {(6, 9), (6, 28), (6, 25), (6, 8), (9, 28), (9, 19), (9, 12), (4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 26), (7, 16), (7, 11), (7, 14), (3, 25), (3, 0), (3, 24), (3, 20), (25, 21), (0, 19), (20, 27), (20, 18), (1, 28), (26, 22), (22, 2), (5, 29), (5, 17), (13, 11), (10, 15), (10, 29), (15, 23), (2, 21), (16, 27), (23, 24), (24, 17), (14, 18), (21, 27)}

To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 19}
- Node 1: {28}
- Node 2: {21, 22, 27}
- Node 3: {0, 20, 24, 25}
- Node 4: {7, 12, 26}
- Node 5: {17, 12, 29}
- Node 6: {8, 9, 25, 28}
- Node 7: {4, 11, 14, 16}
- Node 8: {6, 10, 15}
- Node 9: {6, 12, 19, 28}
- Node 10: {8, 15, 19, 29}
- Node 11: {7, 13, 27}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 9, 28}
- Node 13: {11}
- Node 14: {7, 18}
- Node 15: {8, 10, 23}
- Node 16: {7, 27}
- Node 17: {5, 24}
- Node 18: {14, 20, 21, 24}
- Node 19: {0, 9, 10}
- Node 20: {3, 18, 27}
- Node 21: {2, 18, 27}
- Node 22: {2, 26}
- Node 23: {15, 24}
- Node 24: {3, 17, 18, 23}
- Node 25: {3, 6}
- Node 26: {4, 22}
- Node 27: {2, 11, 16, 21}
- Node 28: {1, 6, 9, 12}
- Node 29: {5, 10}

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20 \).

Thus, the answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, 8, 25>
<6, 9, 28>
<6, 9, 25>
<9, 12, 28>
<12, 5, 28>
<3, 0, 19>
<3, 0, 24>
<3, 0, 25>
<4, 7, 14>
<4, 7, 16>
<4, 12, 26>
<7, 11, 27>
<10, 15, 29>
<15, 8, 10>
<2, 21, 27>
<17, 5, 24>
<18, 14, 20>
<19, 9, 10>
<18, 21, 27>
<21, 18, 27>
