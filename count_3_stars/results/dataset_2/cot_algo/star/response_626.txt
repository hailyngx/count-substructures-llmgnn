Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {9, 1, 4, 2}
- Node 1: {6, 3, 4, 0, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 0}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {9, 1, 7, 0, 5}
- Node 5: {6, 3, 4, 7, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {5, 1, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 4, 8, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 7, 5, 2}
- Node 9: {4, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding them up, we get a total of 54 3-stars. 
Thus, the final answer is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 1, 4)>
<1, (6, 3, 4)>
<4, (9, 1, 7)>
<5, (6, 3, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
