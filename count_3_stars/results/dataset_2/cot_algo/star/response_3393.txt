Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (18, 14) (18, 0) (18, 8) (5, 11) (5, 2) (6, 11) (6, 2) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 15) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 0) (12, 4) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 9) (15, 17) (15, 19) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 13) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 16) (14, 4) (14, 18) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 19) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edge list:
- Node 0: {1, 13, 18}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 7, 10, 17}
- Node 2: {5, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 8, 11}
- Node 4: {9, 12, 14, 19}
- Node 5: {2, 11}
- Node 6: {2, 11}
- Node 7: {1, 17}
- Node 8: {3, 16, 18}
- Node 9: {4, 10, 16, 19}
- Node 10: {1, 9, 11, 19}
- Node 11: {3, 5, 6, 10}
- Node 12: {4}
- Node 13: {0, 16, 17}
- Node 14: {4, 18}
- Node 15: {17, 19}
- Node 16: {8, 9, 13}
- Node 17: {1, 7, 13, 15}
- Node 18: {0, 8, 14}
- Node 19: {4, 9, 10, 15}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 10: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 11: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 17: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 18: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 19: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us \(10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 32\).

Therefore, the final answer is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 10, 17)>, <1, (3, 10, 19)>, <1, (3, 11, 10)>, <1, (3, 11, 17)>, <1, (3, 11, 6)>, <1, (10, 11, 19)>, <1, (10, 11, 3)>, <1, (10, 11, 6)>, <1, (10, 11, 17)>, <1, (11, 3, 10)>, <1, (11, 3, 17)>, <1, (11, 3, 6)>, <1, (11, 10, 19)>, <1, (11, 10, 3)>, <1, (11, 10, 6)>, <1, (11, 10, 17)>, <3, (1, 10, 17)>, <4, (9, 10, 19)>, <4, (9, 10, 16)>, <4, (9, 16, 19)>, <4, (10, 9, 16)>, <9, (4, 10, 9)>, <9, (4, 16, 19)>, <9, (10, 16, 19)>, <10, (1, 11, 3)>, <10, (1, 11, 6)>, <10, (1, 11, 17)>, <10, (3, 1, 11)>, <10, (3, 11, 6)>, <10, (3, 11, 17)>, <10, (11, 1, 3)>, <10, (11, 1, 6)>, <10, (11, 1, 17)>
