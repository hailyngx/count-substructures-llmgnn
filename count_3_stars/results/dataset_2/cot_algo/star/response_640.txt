Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 3) (0, 7) (0, 17) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 8) (15, 19) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 17) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 12) (8, 7) (8, 12) (3, 9) (3, 18) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 12) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 19) (17, 4) (17, 18) (17, 0) (17, 2) 

Response:
First, we will list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 17}
- Node 1: {9, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {12, 14, 17}
- Node 3: {9, 18}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 17, 18, 19}
- Node 5: {4, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {4, 9, 16}
- Node 7: {0, 8, 14, 19}
- Node 8: {7, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 14}
- Node 12: {2, 5, 8, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 16, 19}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 15: {19}
- Node 16: {6, 11, 13}
- Node 17: {0, 2, 4, 18}
- Node 18: {3, 4, 17, 19}
- Node 19: {4, 7, 13, 15}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed with them:
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars:
Total 3-stars = 10 + 10 = 20

Therefore, the final answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (5, 17, 18)>
<14, (1, 2, 12)>
<14, (1, 7, 9)>
<14, (2, 7, 12)>
<14, (9, 12, 1)>
<4, (17, 18, 3)>
<4, (17, 18, 4)>
<4, (17, 18, 19)>
<14, (1, 9, 12)>
<4, (17, 4, 18)>
<4, (17, 4, 19)>
<4, (17, 18, 4)>
<14, (1, 2, 9)>
<14, (1, 2, 14)>
<14, (1, 7, 12)>
<14, (1, 9, 12)>
<14, (2, 7, 12)>
<14, (2, 9, 12)>
<14, (7, 9, 12)>
<4, (5, 17, 18)>
