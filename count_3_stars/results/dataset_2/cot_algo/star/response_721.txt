Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 6) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 7) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 7) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 9, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {8, 13}
- Node 7: {5, 8, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 10}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 11: {0, 4, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 14: {2, 7, 8, 11, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: 
\( 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 98 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [98].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (9, 11, 12)>
<2, (4, 11, 14)>
<3, (5, 9, 10)>
<4, (1, 10, 12)>
<7, (8, 11, 14)>
<8, (5, 7, 14)>
<11, (7, 12, 14)>
<13, (6, 7, 8)>
