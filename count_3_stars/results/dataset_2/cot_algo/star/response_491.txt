Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 1) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 3) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 11) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 14) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) 

Response:
There are 14 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (Node 2 and Node 1), we have 2 * 1 = 2 3-stars.

For the remaining nodes with 4 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 2 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 78

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [78].

Unique 3-stars in the graph are: 
<4, (2, 3, 10)>, <4, (2, 9, 14)>, <4, (2, 11, 13)>, <4, (3, 7, 11)>, <4, (3, 10, 13)>, <4, (5, 7, 10)>, <4, (5, 9, 12)>, <4, (7, 9, 11)>, <4, (9, 10, 13)>, <7, (5, 12, 14)>, <7, (5, 13, 14)>, <7, (12, 13, 14)>, <13, (0, 1, 9)>, <13, (0, 1, 10)>, <13, (0, 9, 10)>
