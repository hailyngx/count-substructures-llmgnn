Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the degree of each node:
   - Node 0: degree = 3
   - Node 1: degree = 3
   - Node 2: degree = 2
   - Node 3: degree = 1
   - Node 4: degree = 2
   - Node 5: degree = 3
   - Node 6: degree = 2
   - Node 7: degree = 1
   - Node 8: degree = 5
   - Node 9: degree = 4
   - Node 10: degree = 3
   - Node 11: degree = 5
   - Node 12: degree = 3
   - Node 13: degree = 5
   - Node 14: degree = 2
   - Node 15: degree = 3
   - Node 16: degree = 2
   - Node 17: degree = 4
   - Node 18: degree = 3
   - Node 19: degree = 3
   - Node 20: degree = 4
   - Node 21: degree = 2
   - Node 22: degree = 3
   - Node 23: degree = 5
   - Node 24: degree = 4
   - Node 25: degree = 5
   - Node 26: degree = 1
   - Node 27: degree = 2
   - Node 28: degree = 2
   - Node 29: degree = 5

2. Identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
   - Nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, and 29

3. Calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
   - For nodes with degree 3:
     - Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
     - Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
     - Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
     - Node 10: inom{3}{3} = 1
     - Node 15: inom{3}{3} = 1
     - Node 18: inom{3}{3} = 1
     - Node 19: inom{3}{3} = 1

   - For nodes with degree 4:
     - Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
     - Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4
     - Node 20: inom{4}{3} = 4
     - Node 24: inom{4}{3} = 4

   - For nodes with degree 5:
     - Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
     - Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10
     - Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10
     - Node 23: inom{5}{3} = 10
     - Node 25: inom{5}{3} = 10
     - Node 29: inom{5}{3} = 10

4. Sum up the total number of 3-stars:
   1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 71

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [71].

Below are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 10, 17>
<1, 9, 29>
<5, 17, 19>
<8, 11, 25>
<8, 13, 23>
<8, 15, 24>
<8, 18, 29>
<8, 22, 25>
<8, 23, 29>
<11, 16, 8>
<13, 20, 25>
<13, 21, 9>
<15, 23, 13>
<18, 10, 29>
<19, 4, 13>
<20, 13, 21>
<24, 15, 0>
<24, 15, 23>
<25, 27, 5>
<29, 10, 0>
