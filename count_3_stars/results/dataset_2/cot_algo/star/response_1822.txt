Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 2, 9, and 0 <6, (2, 9, 0)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 2, and 5 <8, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 5, and 6 <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 4, and 5 <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 2, and 8 <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 6, and 7 <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 6, 2, and 8 <9, (6, 2, 8)>

Since each node with at least 3 neighbors can form a 3-star, we count a total of 7 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
