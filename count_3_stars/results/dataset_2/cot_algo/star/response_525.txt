Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {5, 2}
- Node 1: neighbors {9, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {5, 9, 0, 1, 4}
- Node 3: neighbors {5, 9, 7, 4, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {5, 9, 6, 2, 3}
- Node 5: neighbors {9, 2, 8, 4, 0, 3}
- Node 6: neighbor {4}
- Node 7: neighbors {3, 1, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {5, 7, 1, 3}
- Node 9: neighbors {5, 4, 2, 3, 1}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 68\)

Therefore, the final answer is \([68]\) and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>
