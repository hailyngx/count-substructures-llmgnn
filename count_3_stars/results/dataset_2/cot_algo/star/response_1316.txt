Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 9, 4)>
- <0, (5, 9, 7)>
- <0, (5, 9, 1)>
- <0, (6, 2, 7)>
- <0, (6, 7, 4)>
- <0, (6, 7, 3)>
- <0, (6, 7, 2)>
- <0, (7, 2, 8)>
- <0, (9, 5, 4)>
- <0, (9, 5, 7)>
- <0, (9, 5, 1)>
- <1, (0, 3, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 8)>
- <5, (0, 9, 4)>
- <5, (0, 9, 7)>
- <5, (0, 9, 1)>
- <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- <7, (0, 5, 4)>
- <7, (0, 5, 6)>
- <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <7, (4, 5, 0)>
- <7, (6, 2, 8)>
- <9, (0, 5, 4)>
- <9, (0, 5, 7)>
- <9, (0, 5, 1)>
- <9, (4, 5, 7)>
