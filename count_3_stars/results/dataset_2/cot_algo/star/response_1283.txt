Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0, 3-stars: 1
- Node 3, 3-stars: 1
- Node 5, 3-stars: 1
- Node 7, 3-stars: 1
- Node 8, 3-stars: 1
- Node 9, 3-stars: 1

There is one 3-star for each of the nodes above, giving us a total of 6 3-stars. 

So, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
