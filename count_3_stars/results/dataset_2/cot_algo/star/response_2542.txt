Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 10) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {5, 2, 3, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {8, 12, 13, 0}
- Node 3: {8, 6, 7, 0, 14}
- Node 4: {8, 9, 10, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {8, 0, 10}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 3}
- Node 7: {6, 3, 10, 9, 1}
- Node 8: {4, 2, 5, 14, 3}
- Node 9: {4, 11, 7, 1, 10}
- Node 10: {4, 5, 12, 7, 9}
- Node 11: {0, 9}
- Node 12: {2, 13, 10, 0}
- Node 13: {2, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {8, 3, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and then count the number of unique 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: 0 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: 0 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0 3-stars (only 5 neighbors)
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 10: 0 3-stars (only 5 neighbors)
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 0 3-stars (only 3 neighbors)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 49

Therefore, the final answer is [49], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 11>
- <0, 2, 12>
- <0, 3, 12>
- <0, 5, 12>
- <0, 7, 12>
- <0, 9, 11>
- <0, 9, 12>
- <0, 9, 13>
- <0, 11, 12>
- <0, 12, 13>
- <2, 8, 14>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 8, 10>
- <4, 8, 14>
- <8, 9, 14>
- <9, 10, 12>
- <9, 10, 13>
