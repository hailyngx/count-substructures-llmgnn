Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 29) (13, 1) (13, 15) (22, 27) (22, 28) (22, 7) (6, 21) (6, 11) (6, 19) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 19) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 23) (21, 6) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 8) (21, 15) (8, 21) (8, 5) (8, 16) (23, 7) (23, 12) (23, 20) (1, 13) (1, 10) (26, 2) (0, 14) (0, 29) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 16) (14, 10) (4, 14) (4, 24) (4, 28) (18, 27) (18, 24) (18, 17) (28, 22) (28, 4) (17, 18) (20, 23) (20, 5) (10, 9) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 27) (2, 26) (2, 12) (2, 16) (12, 23) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 3) (5, 8) (5, 20) (5, 15) (29, 13) (29, 0) (29, 3) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 24) (16, 15) (24, 4) (24, 18) (24, 16) (11, 6) (11, 12) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 3) (27, 22) (27, 18) (27, 10) (27, 3) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 29) (3, 19) (3, 27) (15, 13) (15, 21) (15, 5) (15, 16) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {14, 29}
- Node 1: Neighbors {10, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {12, 16, 26}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 12, 19, 27, 29}
- Node 4: Neighbors {14, 16, 24, 28}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8, 15, 20}
- Node 6: Neighbors {11, 19, 21}
- Node 7: Neighbors {21, 22, 23}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 15, 16, 21}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 10, 19}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 9, 14, 21, 27}
- Node 11: Neighbors {6, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 3, 11, 23}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 15, 29}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 4, 10, 16}
- Node 15: Neighbors {5, 8, 13, 16, 21}
- Node 16: Neighbors {2, 8, 14, 15, 24}
- Node 17: Neighbors {18}
- Node 18: Neighbors {17, 24, 27}
- Node 19: Neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 20: Neighbors {5, 23}
- Node 21: Neighbors {6, 7, 8, 10, 15}
- Node 22: Neighbors {7, 27, 28}
- Node 23: Neighbors {7, 12, 20}
- Node 24: Neighbors {4, 16, 18}
- Node 26: Neighbors {2}
- Node 27: Neighbors {3, 10, 18, 22}
- Node 28: Neighbors {4, 22}
- Node 29: Neighbors {3, 13, 29}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 19, 27} (3, 9, 19), so there is 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 14, 27} (10, 1, 14), so there is 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors {8, 14, 24} (16, 8, 14), so there is 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with neighbors {8, 15, 16} (21, 8, 15) and {10, 14, 27} (21, 10, 14), so there are 2 unique 3-stars.
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with neighbors {18, 22, 28} (27, 18, 22), so there is 1 unique 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6. Therefore, the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, 9, 19>
- <10, 1, 14>
- <16, 8, 14>
- <21, 8, 15>
- <21, 10, 14>
- <27, 18, 22>
