Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 3, 2}
- Node 1: {5, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 8, 5, 0}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {9, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 8, 2, 1}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 7, 2}
- Node 7: {6, 9, 4, 8, 5}
- Node 8: {9, 1, 4, 7, 5, 2}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 4, 7, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 69

Therefore, the final answer is [69], and the unique 3-stars are:

- <0, (9, 3, 2)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (9, 7, 8)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <6, (9, 7, 5)>
- <7, (6, 8, 5)>
- <8, (9, 4, 7)>
- <9, (8, 4, 7)>
