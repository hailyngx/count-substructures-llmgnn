Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 10) (5, 8) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 14) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 0) 

Response:
Given that this graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first list out the neighbors for each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {10, 11, 8, 7, 4, 1}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {9, 11, 8, 0, 7}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {8, 12, 13, 7}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {9, 13, 14}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {6, 10, 13, 0}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {10, 8}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {4, 13}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {10, 11, 2, 0, 1, 14}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {2, 5, 0, 1}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {10, 3, 1}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {9, 11, 0, 7, 5, 4}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {10, 7, 1, 0, 12}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {2, 11, 13}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {6, 2, 12, 4, 3}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {7, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, 10, 11, and 13 have 3 or more neighbors.

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 10: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 94

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [94].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 10)> 
<0, (1, 8, 11)>
<0, (4, 6, 13)>
<0, (4, 10, 13)>
<1, (0, 7, 10)>
<1, (8, 0, 11)>
<2, (8, 12, 13)>
<7, (0, 1, 10)>
<7, (0, 11, 14)>
<7, (1, 0, 11)>
<10, (0, 4, 13)>
<10, (5, 8, 11)>
<11, (0, 1, 7)>
<11, (0, 12, 13)>
<13, (4, 3, 6)>
<13, (4, 12, 3)>.
