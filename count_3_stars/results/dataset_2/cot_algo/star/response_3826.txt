Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 16) (8, 22) (8, 3) (23, 29) (23, 0) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 24) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 20) (17, 3) (7, 16) (7, 28) (12, 4) (12, 3) (6, 28) (6, 20) (6, 0) (6, 27) (28, 7) (28, 6) (28, 3) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 29) (9, 22) (22, 8) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 29) (13, 26) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 0) (20, 17) (20, 6) (20, 2) (18, 26) (18, 15) (18, 16) (29, 23) (29, 10) (29, 26) (29, 22) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 14) (25, 27) (25, 1) (25, 24) (27, 6) (27, 25) (27, 2) (3, 8) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 28) (1, 25) (1, 5) (1, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 18) (16, 21) (2, 22) (2, 20) (2, 27) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 13) (14, 21) (14, 11) (0, 23) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 1) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 15) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 5) (24, 10) (24, 25) 

Response:
First, we will find the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 6, 13, 23
Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 5, 25
Node 2: Neighbors are 6, 20, 22, 27
Node 3: Neighbors are 8, 12, 17, 28
Node 4: Neighbors are 11, 12
Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 5, 11, 15
Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 2, 20, 27, 28
Node 7: Neighbors are 16, 28
Node 8: Neighbors are 3, 16, 22
Node 9: Neighbors are 22
Node 10: Neighbors are 17, 21, 24, 29
Node 11: Neighbors are 4, 5, 14
Node 12: Neighbors are 3, 4
Node 13: Neighbors are 0, 14, 15, 26
Node 14: Neighbors are 11, 13, 21
Node 15: Neighbors are 5, 13, 15, 18
Node 16: Neighbors are 7, 8, 18, 21
Node 17: Neighbors are 3, 10, 20
Node 18: Neighbors are 15, 16, 26
Node 19: Neighbors are 26
Node 20: Neighbors are 2, 6, 17
Node 21: Neighbors are 10, 14, 16
Node 22: Neighbors are 2, 8, 9, 29
Node 23: Neighbors are 0, 29
Node 24: Neighbors are 10, 25
Node 25: Neighbors are 1, 24, 27
Node 26: Neighbors are 13, 18, 19, 29
Node 27: Neighbors are 2, 6, 25
Node 28: Neighbors are 3, 6, 7
Node 29: Neighbors are 10, 22, 26, 23

Now, we will identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 8, 16, 17, 22, 25, 26, 29
Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 30 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 1, 23>, <0, 5, 11>, <0, 5, 15>, <0, 13, 15>, <0, 6, 20>, <0, 6, 27>, <0, 13, 26>, <1, 5, 11>, <1, 5, 25>, <3, 8, 16>, <3, 8, 28>, <3, 12, 28>, <3, 17, 28>, <6, 20, 27>, <8, 16, 18>, <8, 16, 21>, <8, 22, 29>, <10, 17, 20>, <10, 17, 21>, <10, 17, 24>, <10, 17, 29>, <16, 18, 26>, <16, 21, 14>, <17, 20, 6>, <18, 15, 5>, <18, 15, 13>, <18, 15, 26>, <26, 19, 29>
