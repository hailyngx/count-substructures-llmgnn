Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes: 

- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Calculate the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22 \]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 7, 8>
