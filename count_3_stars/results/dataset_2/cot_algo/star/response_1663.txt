Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 13) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 16) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 1) (16, 14) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 4) (11, 14) (11, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 17) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 18) (17, 16) (17, 2) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 13) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (9, 3) (9, 2) (6, 0) (6, 19) (10, 19) (10, 8) (18, 0) (18, 5) (18, 1) (8, 3) (8, 16) (8, 10) (13, 15) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 19) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {15, 7, 18, 6}
- Node 1: {7, 2, 18}
- Node 2: {5, 1, 9, 17}
- Node 3: {15, 9, 19, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {16, 5, 13}
- Node 5: {3, 2, 18, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 19}
- Node 7: {0, 16, 1}
- Node 8: {3, 16, 10}
- Node 9: {3, 2}
- Node 10: {19, 8}
- Node 11: {14, 13}
- Node 13: {15, 11, 4, 19}
- Node 14: {11, 16}
- Node 15: {3, 0, 13}
- Node 16: {14, 7, 17, 8, 4}
- Node 17: {16, 2}
- Node 18: {0, 5, 1}
- Node 19: {3, 10, 13, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get:

\( 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 40 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
