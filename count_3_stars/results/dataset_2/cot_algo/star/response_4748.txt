Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 3, 6, 1}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 6, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 0, 1, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 8, 1, 4, 3}
- Node 6: {7, 0, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {9, 1, 8, 6}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 0, 6}
- Node 9: {5, 3, 7}

Now, we can see that only node 5 has exactly 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star. 
There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 5 as the center. 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <5, (1, 3, 4)>.
