Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {4, 6, 8}
Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Node 2: {6, 7, 9}
Node 3: {1, 4, 5}
Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 7, 8}
Node 5: {1, 3, 7, 9}
Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 8}
Node 7: {2, 4, 5}
Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 6, 9}
Node 9: {1, 2, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 2
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 1
Nodes with 6 neighbors: 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

Adding them up: 4 + 10 + 20 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
