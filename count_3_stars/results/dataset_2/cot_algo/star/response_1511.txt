Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {4, 2, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {8, 6, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 6, 1, 3, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 4, 2, 0, 7}
- Node 4: {9, 8, 0, 3}
- Node 5: {2, 3}
- Node 6: {8, 1, 7, 2}
- Node 7: {6, 0, 3}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 6, 1, 2}
- Node 9: {8, 4, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, and Node 8 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are involved in:
- Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 2: 6 choose 3 = 20
- Node 3: 6 choose 3 = 20
- Node 4: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 6: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 8: 5 choose 3 = 10

Adding these up: 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [62].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 2, 3)>
<2, (5, 8, 6)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
<6, (8, 1, 7)>
<8, (9, 6, 1)>
<8, (9, 2, 1)>
