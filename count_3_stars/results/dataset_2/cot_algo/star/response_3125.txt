Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 11) (15, 16) (4, 8) (4, 17) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 13) (5, 17) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 11) (17, 4) (17, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (1, 10) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 1) (18, 7) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 12) (18, 13) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 0) (12, 18) (12, 16) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 12) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (13, 7) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 15, 8, 19}
- Node 1: Neighbors {10, 6, 18}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 11, 8, 19}
- Node 3: Neighbors {15, 0, 10}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8, 17}
- Node 5: Neighbors {17, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1}
- Node 7: Neighbors {19, 18, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 10, 2, 16, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors {3, 8, 1}
- Node 11: Neighbors {15, 9, 14, 2}
- Node 12: Neighbors {18, 16}
- Node 13: Neighbors {7, 18}
- Node 14: Neighbors {5, 11}
- Node 15: Neighbors {3, 0, 11, 16}
- Node 16: Neighbors {8, 15, 12}
- Node 17: Neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 18: Neighbors {7, 1, 19, 12, 13}
- Node 19: Neighbors {7, 2, 18, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, 3-stars: 3 (center, 15, 19), (center, 8, 16), (center, 19, 7)
- Node 8, 3-stars: 1 (center, 4, 10)
- Node 11, 3-stars: 2 (center, 9, 14), (center, 2, 15)
- Node 15, 3-stars: 1 (center, 0, 16)
- Node 18, 3-stars: 1 (center, 1, 12)

Total number of 3-stars = 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the final answer is [8] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, 15, 19>, <0, 8, 16>, <0, 19, 7>, <8, 4, 10>, <11, 9, 14>, <11, 2, 15>, <15, 0, 16>, <18, 1, 12>.
