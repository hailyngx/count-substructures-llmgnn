Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 24) (7, 23) (7, 9) (21, 0) (21, 27) (21, 22) (22, 21) (22, 23) (22, 14) (23, 7) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 19) (20, 27) (20, 0) (20, 12) (27, 21) (27, 20) (27, 18) (10, 16) (10, 29) (17, 6) (4, 23) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 29) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 3) (29, 10) (29, 4) (29, 0) (2, 26) (18, 27) (18, 16) (18, 28) (0, 21) (0, 20) (0, 29) (0, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (26, 2) (26, 28) (26, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (11, 13) (28, 18) (28, 26) (28, 24) (25, 15) (25, 24) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 9) (15, 25) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 23) (19, 8) (19, 15) (5, 0) (5, 26) (5, 15) (5, 16) (12, 20) (12, 6) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 24) (6, 17) (6, 12) (24, 7) (24, 28) (24, 25) (24, 1) (24, 16) (14, 22) (14, 13) (14, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:

- Node 0: 21, 20, 29, 5
- Node 1: 4, 15, 24, 9
- Node 2: 26
- Node 3: 8, 13
- Node 4: 23, 8, 1, 29
- Node 5: 0, 26, 15, 16
- Node 6: 17, 12
- Node 7: 24, 23, 9
- Node 8: 23, 4, 19, 3
- Node 9: 7, 1, 14
- Node 10: 16, 29
- Node 11: 13
- Node 12: 20, 6
- Node 13: 11, 3, 14
- Node 14: 22, 13, 9
- Node 15: 25, 1, 19, 5
- Node 16: 10, 18, 5, 24
- Node 17: 6
- Node 18: 27, 16, 28
- Node 19: 23, 8, 15
- Node 20: 27, 0, 12
- Node 21: 0, 27, 22
- Node 22: 21, 23, 14
- Node 23: 7, 22, 8, 4, 19
- Node 24: 7, 28, 25, 1, 16
- Node 25: 15, 24
- Node 26: 2, 28, 5
- Node 27: 21, 20, 18
- Node 28: 26, 18, 24
- Node 29: 10, 4, 0

Next, we will identify the number of 3-stars formed in this graph by counting the number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with (21, 29, 5)
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with (1, 29, 8)
- Node 15: Forms a 3-star with (1, 19, 5)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 3. 

So, the final answer is [3].
