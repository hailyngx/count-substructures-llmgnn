Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 4) (16, 19) (16, 14) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 3) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 14) (5, 7) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (17, 12) (17, 1) (17, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 0) (9, 17) (9, 8) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 3) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 19) (15, 18) (15, 13) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 15) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (14, 16) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 2, 5, 8, 11
Node 1: 2, 8, 13, 14, 17
Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 18
Node 3: 2, 4, 18, 19
Node 4: 3, 7, 11
Node 5: 0, 7
Node 6: 8, 10
Node 7: 4, 5
Node 8: 0, 1, 6, 9, 10
Node 9: 8, 17
Node 10: 6, 8, 14
Node 11: 0, 4
Node 12: 13, 14, 17
Node 13: 1, 12, 15
Node 14: 1, 10, 12, 16
Node 15: 13, 18
Node 16: 14, 19
Node 17: 1, 9, 12
Node 18: 2, 3, 15, 19
Node 19: 3, 16, 18

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 10: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 12: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 13: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 14: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 17: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 18: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 19: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [35].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 8, 2>
<1, 10, 14>
<1, 12, 17>
<1, 12, 13>
<1, 12, 14>
<1, 13, 15>
<2, 3, 18>
<2, 18, 19>
<3, 18, 19>
<8, 9, 17>
<10, 6, 8>
<13, 15, 18>
<14, 12, 17>
<14, 16, 19>
<16, 14, 12>
<17, 12, 13>
<18, 3, 19>
