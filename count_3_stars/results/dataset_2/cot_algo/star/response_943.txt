Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 2) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 2) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 19) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 2) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 8) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 19) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 6) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 14) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 1) (1, 18) (1, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 16) (4, 15) (4, 9) (4, 6) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 18) (14, 9) (14, 13) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (13, 11) (13, 14) (19, 10) (19, 16) (19, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 19) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {11, 5, 8}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {18, 8}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {3, 15, 17, 16}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {17, 6, 2}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {15, 9, 6}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {15, 0, 18}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {3, 12, 4, 8, 19}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {8}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {0, 7, 1, 6}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {16, 18, 4, 14}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {17, 12, 19}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {0, 13}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {10, 16, 6}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {11, 14}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {9, 13}
16. Node 15: Neighbors {5, 4, 2}
17. Node 16: Neighbors {12, 2, 9, 19}
18. Node 17: Neighbors {3, 10, 2}
19. Node 18: Neighbors {9, 5, 1}
20. Node 19: Neighbors {10, 16, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 6 and Node 8 do not have at least 3 neighbors, so they cannot form 3-stars.

Node 3, Node 15, and Node 17 have exactly 3 neighbors each, so they can each form 1 3-star.

Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 9, Node 10, Node 12, Node 16, Node 18, and Node 19 have more than 3 neighbors and can form multiple 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for these nodes:

- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 10: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 16: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 18: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 19: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding up the total 3-stars: 1 (from Node 3) + 1 (from Node 15) + 1 (from Node 17) + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph: 
<3, (17, 6, 2)>, <15, (5, 4, 2)>, <17, (3, 10, 2)>, <2, (3, 15, 16)>, <4, (15, 9, 6)>, <5, (15, 0, 18)>, <9, (16, 18, 4)>, <10, (17, 12, 19)>, <12, (10, 16, 6)>, <16, (12, 9, 19)>, <18, (9, 5, 1)>, <19, (10, 16, 6)>.
