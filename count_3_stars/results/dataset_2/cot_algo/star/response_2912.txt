Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 0) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 11) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 3) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 10) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 11) (17, 7) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 0) (15, 2) (15, 1) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 9) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 12) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 3) (10, 1) (16, 8) (16, 1) (7, 2) (7, 17) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 11) (13, 19) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, we will construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {9, 19, 11}
- Node 1: {6, 17, 15, 16, 10}
- Node 2: {18, 15, 7, 4}
- Node 3: {8, 13, 12}
- Node 4: {2, 8, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 19, 12}
- Node 6: {9, 1}
- Node 7: {2, 17}
- Node 8: {4, 16, 12, 3}
- Node 9: {6, 17, 14, 0}
- Node 10: {1}
- Node 11: {18, 17, 14, 0, 12}
- Node 12: {8, 5, 11, 3}
- Node 13: {19, 3}
- Node 14: {9, 11}
- Node 15: {2, 1}
- Node 16: {8, 1}
- Node 17: {9, 1, 11, 7}
- Node 18: {2, 11}
- Node 19: {5, 0, 13}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 9, 19, 11)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 6, 17, 15, 16, 10)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 18, 15, 7, 4)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 8, 13, 12)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 2, 8, 5)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 4, 19, 12)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 4, 16, 12, 3)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 6, 17, 14, 0)
- Node 11 (neighbors: 18, 17, 14, 0, 12)
- Node 12 (neighbors: 8, 5, 11, 3)
- Node 17 (neighbors: 9, 1, 11, 7)
- Node 19 (neighbors: 5, 0, 13)

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 19: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding these up, we have a total of 40 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 19, 11)>, <1, (6, 17, 15)>, <1, (6, 17, 16)>, <1, (6, 15, 16)>, <1, (17, 15, 16)>, <1, (6, 17, 10)>, <2, (18, 15, 7)>, <2, (18, 15, 4)>, <2, (18, 7, 4)>, <2, (15, 7, 4)>, <3, (8, 13, 12)>, <4, (2, 8, 5)>, <8, (4, 16, 12)>, <9, (6, 17, 14)>, <9, (6, 17, 0)>, <9, (6, 14, 0)>, <9, (17, 14, 0)>, <11, (18, 17, 14)>, <11, (18, 17, 0)>, <11, (18, 14, 0)>, <11, (17, 14, 0)>, <11, (17, 14, 12)>, <12, (8, 5, 11)>, <12, (8, 5, 3)>, <12, (8, 11, 3)>, <12, (5, 11, 3)>, <17, (9, 1, 11)>, <17, (9, 1, 7)>, <17, (9, 11, 7)>, <17, (1, 11, 7)>, <19, (5, 0, 13)>
