Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 4) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 17) (1, 14) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 18) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 14) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 19) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 4) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 16) (4, 15) (4, 16) (4, 9) (9, 19) (9, 4) (9, 12) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 9) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 5) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 7) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 18, 8, 6}
- Node 1: {14}
- Node 2: {5, 6}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {15, 16, 9}
- Node 5: {13, 2, 8, 12, 18}
- Node 6: {17, 0, 2}
- Node 7: {3, 0, 16, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 16}
- Node 9: {19, 4, 12}
- Node 10: {11}
- Node 11: {10, 19, 17}
- Node 12: {15, 5, 9}
- Node 13: {15, 17, 5, 19}
- Node 14: {15, 1, 7}
- Node 15: {13, 14, 12, 4}
- Node 16: {7, 8, 4}
- Node 17: {11, 13, 6, 18}
- Node 18: {17, 0, 5}
- Node 19: {11, 13, 9}

Next, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the 3-stars formed:

- Node 5: 5 neighbors, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the final number to be put inside brackets is [22], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<5, (13, 18, 12), (13, 18, 19), (13, 5, 12), (13, 5, 19), (18, 17, 5), (18, 17, 0), (18, 5, 0), (18, 13, 19), (15, 14, 12), (15, 14, 4), (15, 12, 4), (15, 4, 16), (17, 11, 13), (17, 11, 19), (17, 13, 19), (17, 13, 5), (11, 19, 13), (11, 19, 9), (11, 13, 19), (11, 17, 13), (17, 18, 5), (0, 7, 16) >
