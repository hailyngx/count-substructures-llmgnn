Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 18) (1, 0) (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 2) (13, 4) (13, 7) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 8) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 5) (2, 17) (2, 16) (2, 5) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 5) (8, 18) (8, 7) (6, 19) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 18) (9, 1) (9, 16) (9, 11) (9, 7) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 18) (10, 12) (10, 3) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 3) (18, 11) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (7, 9) (19, 6) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 4) 

Response:
The total number of nodes is 20, and the total number of edges is 60. 

Let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 8, 15}
- Node 1: {0, 9, 12, 17}
- Node 2: {5, 16, 17}
- Node 3: {10, 12, 18}
- Node 4: {11, 13}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 15, 16}
- Node 6: {19}
- Node 7: {8, 9, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 7, 12, 18}
- Node 9: {1, 7, 11, 16}
- Node 10: {3, 12}
- Node 11: {4, 9, 18}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 8, 10, 16}
- Node 13: {4, 7}
- Node 14: {18}
- Node 15: {0, 5, 18}
- Node 16: {2, 5, 9, 12}
- Node 17: {1, 2}
- Node 18: {3, 8, 11, 14, 15}
- Node 19: {6}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 12, and 18 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them.

Starting with Node 0:
Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 15. 
<0, (1, 8, 15)>

Moving on to Node 1:
Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 9, and 12. 
<1, (0, 9, 12)>

Node 8:
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 18. 
<8, (0, 5, 18)>

Node 12:
Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 16. 
<12, (1, 3, 16)>

Node 18:
Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 11, and 15. 
<18, (3, 11, 15)>

The total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [5].
