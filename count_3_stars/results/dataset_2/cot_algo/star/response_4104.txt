Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 7) (14, 11) (17, 10) (17, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 6) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 5) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 15) (4, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 15) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 15) (1, 12) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 15) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 19) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 19) (12, 4) (12, 1) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (16, 19) (19, 10) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 16) (5, 10) (5, 11) (3, 4) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

1. Node 0: {13, 7, 15, 3}
2. Node 1: {17, 2, 15, 12}
3. Node 2: {8, 1, 7}
4. Node 3: {4, 0}
5. Node 4: {18, 12, 15, 3}
6. Node 5: {10, 11}
7. Node 6: {9, 10, 11}
8. Node 7: {9, 2, 0, 19}
9. Node 8: {13, 2}
10. Node 9: {6, 18, 7}
11. Node 10: {6, 17, 19, 5}
12. Node 11: {6, 14, 13, 5}
13. Node 12: {4, 1}
14. Node 13: {8, 11, 0}
15. Node 15: {4, 18, 1, 0, 19}
16. Node 16: {19}
17. Node 17: {10, 1}
18. Node 19: {10, 7, 15, 16}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 6: <6, (9, 10, 11)>
2. Node 10: <10, (6, 17, 19)>
3. Node 11: <11, (6, 14, 13)>
4. Node 15: <15, (4, 18, 1)>
5. Node 19: <19, (10, 7, 15)>
6. Node 0: <0, (13, 7, 15)>
7. Node 2: <2, (8, 1, 7)>
8. Node 9: <9, (6, 18, 7)>

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars formed in this graph, so the final answer is [8].
