Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 7, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {7, 8, 2, 4}
- Node 2: {6, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {7, 2, 5, 4}
- Node 4: {6, 1, 3, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {9, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {9, 0, 7, 1}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors.

For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 = 24

Therefore, the final answer is [24], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>.
