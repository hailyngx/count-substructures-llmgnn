Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: {1, 3, 7, 9}
Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
Node 3: {0, 7, 8, 9}
Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 7}
Node 5: {2, 7, 8}
Node 6: {2, 4}
Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 5}
Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 8}

Next, identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 6
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 8
Node with 5 neighbors: 1, 9

Calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For nodes with 3 neighbors, there's 1 unique 3-star each. So, [3 * 1 = 3] 
For nodes with 4 neighbors, we need to calculate \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) for each node. So, [4 * 4 = 16]
For the node with 5 neighbors, we need to calculate \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). So, [1 * 10 = 10]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3 + 16 + 10 = 29.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (8, 9, 0)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
