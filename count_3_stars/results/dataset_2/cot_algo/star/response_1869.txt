Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 28) (26, 22) (26, 4) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 28) (21, 3) (21, 20) (6, 11) (2, 12) (2, 24) (29, 22) (29, 18) (10, 17) (10, 27) (10, 23) (10, 16) (0, 20) (0, 4) (0, 22) (20, 21) (20, 0) (20, 23) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 1) (28, 9) (28, 7) (28, 18) (22, 26) (22, 29) (22, 0) (22, 24) (5, 23) (5, 3) (13, 12) (13, 24) (3, 21) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 18) (18, 29) (18, 28) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 11) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 25) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 18) (11, 27) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 12) (15, 19) (15, 4) (23, 10) (23, 20) (23, 5) (23, 27) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 27) (25, 19) (25, 8) (8, 3) (8, 25) (27, 10) (27, 11) (27, 23) (27, 1) (4, 26) (4, 14) (4, 0) (4, 15) (24, 2) (24, 22) (24, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:  

- Node 0: {4, 20, 22}
- Node 1: {12, 14, 27}
- Node 2: {12, 24}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 18, 21}
- Node 4: {0, 14, 15, 26}
- Node 5: {3, 23}
- Node 6: {11}
- Node 7: {12, 19, 28}
- Node 8: {3, 25}
- Node 9: {28}
- Node 10: {16, 17, 23, 27}
- Node 11: {6, 14, 18, 27}
- Node 12: {1, 2, 7, 13, 16}
- Node 13: {12, 24}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 11, 17}
- Node 15: {4, 19}
- Node 16: {10, 12, 17}
- Node 17: {10, 14, 16}
- Node 18: {3, 11, 19, 28, 29}
- Node 19: {7, 15, 18, 25}
- Node 20: {0, 21, 23}
- Node 21: {3, 20}
- Node 22: {0, 24, 26, 29}
- Node 23: {5, 10, 20, 27}
- Node 24: {2, 13, 22}
- Node 25: {8, 19}
- Node 26: {4, 22}
- Node 27: {1, 11, 23, 27}
- Node 28: {7, 9, 18}
- Node 29: {18, 22}

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed is [12], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <18, (11, 19, 28)>
- <12, (1, 16, 27)>
- <1, (12, 14, 27)>
- <4, (0, 14, 15)>
- <13, (12, 24, 2)>
- <16, (10, 12, 17)>
- <14, (1, 4, 17)>
- <24, (2, 13, 22)>
- <18, (3, 19, 28)>
- <23, (10, 20, 27)>
- <11, (6, 14, 18)>
- <22, (0, 24, 26)>
