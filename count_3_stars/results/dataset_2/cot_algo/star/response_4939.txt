Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 9, 10}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 8, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 9, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 10, 11}
- Node 10: {0, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {4, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 12: {7, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 14: {1, 7, 11, 12}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- From node 1: <1, (3, 8, 14)>
- From node 4: <4, (2, 8, 11)>
- From node 7: <7, (12, 10, 14)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [3].
