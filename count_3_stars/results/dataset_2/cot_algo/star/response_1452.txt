Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following structure:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 1.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 4, 0, 8, and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 1, and 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 4, 8, and 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 0, 1, 3, and 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 1, and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 0, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 3, and 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 4.

We will now identify the unique 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars:
<1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 2)>, <1, (0, 1, 2)>, <1, (4, 1, 2)>, <1, (0, 1, 6)>, <1, (0, 1, 8)>, <1, (1, 6, 8)>

Since there are 20 3-stars formed by node 1, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20].
