Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (3, 9) (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 17) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 17) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 17) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 13) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 16) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 17) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (11, 5) (11, 9) (14, 15) (16, 12) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 10) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 13) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 7) (17, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 10, 17}
- Node 3: {2, 9, 12, 15}
- Node 4: {1, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {9, 10, 11, 19}
- Node 6: {1, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 13, 17}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 19}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 11}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 13}
- Node 11: {5, 9}
- Node 12: {3, 4, 16}
- Node 13: {7, 10, 19}
- Node 14: {15}
- Node 15: {3, 14, 17, 18}
- Node 16: {12}
- Node 17: {2, 7, 15, 18}
- Node 18: {15, 17, 19}
- Node 19: {5, 8, 13, 18}

Now, we see that the following nodes have 3 or more neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 9, 15, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 25 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 25, which we represent as [25].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (2, 9, 15)>, <4, (1, 8, 12)>, <5, (9, 10, 19)>, <9, (3, 5, 11)>, <15, (3, 17, 18)>, <17, (2, 7, 18)>, <18, (15, 17, 19)>, <19, (8, 13, 18)>.
