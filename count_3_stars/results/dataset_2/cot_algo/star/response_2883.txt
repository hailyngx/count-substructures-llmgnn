Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 3) (8, 12) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 14) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 0) 

Response:
To start, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {10, 3, 2, 13}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 4, 14, 0}
- Node 3: {9, 6, 10, 11, 0}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 12, 2, 13}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 1, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {4, 11, 10, 13, 1}
- Node 8: {12, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 3, 13}
- Node 10: {7, 0, 3, 13}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 3}
- Node 12: {4, 8, 14, 1}
- Node 13: {9, 4, 7, 10, 0}
- Node 14: {5, 12, 1, 2}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Total: 52 3-stars

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [52]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (5, 7, 12)>
<2, (5, 4, 14)>
<4, (9, 7, 13)>
<5, (9, 2, 14)>
<7, (9, 13, 0)>
<9, (5, 2, 14)>
<12, (4, 8, 1)>
<13, (9, 4, 7)>
