Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 5, 2
- Node 1: 9, 7, 5
- Node 2: 9, 7, 3, 0, 5
- Node 3: 9, 4, 2
- Node 4: 6, 9, 8, 3
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2
- Node 6: 9, 7, 4, 8, 0
- Node 7: 6, 0, 2, 1
- Node 8: 6, 9, 4
- Node 9: 6, 8, 4, 2, 3, 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 56.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [56], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (9, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (9, 4, 2)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>.
