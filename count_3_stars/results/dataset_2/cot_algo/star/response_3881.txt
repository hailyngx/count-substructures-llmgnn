Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 6) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (8, 9) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (6, 12) (6, 13) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 0) (0, 11) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: (4, 11)
- Node 1: (2, 4, 10, 11)
- Node 2: (1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 14)
- Node 3: (2, 4, 10, 11, 12)
- Node 4: (0, 1, 3, 5, 10)
- Node 5: (2, 4, 9, 13)
- Node 6: (2, 12, 13)
- Node 7: (2, 11, 14)
- Node 8: (9)
- Node 9: (5, 8, 12, 13)
- Node 10: (1, 3, 4, 12)
- Node 11: (0, 1, 3, 7, 13, 14)
- Node 12: (3, 6, 9, 10, 14)
- Node 13: (5, 6, 9, 11)
- Node 14: (2, 7, 11, 12)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 74 3-stars.

Therefore, the answer is [74]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (1, 14, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 10)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <11, (0, 7, 14)>, <12, (3, 6, 14)>, <13, (5, 9, 6)>.
