Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 1) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 8) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 3) (14, 3) (12, 0) (12, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 12) 

Response:
Let's first identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7, 10}
- Node 5: {6, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 7, 12}
- Node 9: {2, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 12: {0, 8}
- Node 13: {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 14: {3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) where n is the number of neighbors for that node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 64

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [64].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 11)>
- <1, (6, 3, 11)>
- <1, (6, 5, 11)>
- <3, (2, 10, 13)>
- <4, (1, 7, 11)>
- <4, (2, 7, 10)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
- <7, (1, 11, 13)>
- <7, (4, 1, 11)>
- <7, (4, 13, 9)>
- <10, (0, 2, 3)>
- <10, (2, 4, 10)>
- <10, (2, 9, 13)>
- <10, (3, 6, 11)>
