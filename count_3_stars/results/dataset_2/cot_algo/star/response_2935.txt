Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 38 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [38], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
