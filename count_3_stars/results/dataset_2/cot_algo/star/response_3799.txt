Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (14, 6) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 4) (2, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 0) (1, 17) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 12) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 3) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 18) (18, 7) (19, 15) (19, 3) (3, 16) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 4) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 10) (4, 3) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {8, 13, 3}
- Node 1: {17}
- Node 2: {11}
- Node 3: {16, 0, 19, 4}
- Node 4: {11, 9, 14, 10, 3}
- Node 5: {16, 15, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 14, 10}
- Node 7: {11, 16, 8, 5, 18}
- Node 8: {0, 7}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 13}
- Node 10: {6, 15, 4}
- Node 11: {16, 7, 4, 2}
- Node 12: {14, 17, 15}
- Node 13: {9, 0}
- Node 14: {6, 17, 4, 12}
- Node 15: {10, 5, 19, 12}
- Node 16: {11, 7, 3, 5}
- Node 17: {14, 1, 12}
- Node 18: {7}
- Node 19: {15, 3}

Let's now calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 14, 15

For these nodes, we will calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) where n is the number of neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (8, 13, 3)>
- <3, (16, 0, 19)>
- <4, (9, 14, 10)>
- <5, (16, 15, 7)>
- <6, (9, 14, 10)>
- <7, (11, 8, 5)>
- <11, (7, 4, 2)>
- <14, (17, 4, 12)>
- <15, (19, 12, 10)>
