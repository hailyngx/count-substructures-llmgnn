Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6, 2
- Node 2: 4, 6, 9, 1, 3
- Node 3: 4, 7, 8, 2
- Node 4: 7, 3, 5, 1, 2
- Node 5: 4, 1, 0
- Node 6: 1, 2, 0
- Node 7: 4, 3, 9, 8
- Node 8: 7, 0, 9, 3
- Node 9: 7, 0, 8, 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 3, and 1: <4, (7, 3, 1)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 9, and 8: <7, (4, 9, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 8: <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 9: <2, (4, 6, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, so the final answer is [4].
