Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 21) (16, 4) (16, 26) (16, 10) (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 29) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 0) (22, 7) (3, 14) (3, 24) (3, 18) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 1) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 10) (27, 7) (2, 13) (2, 23) (2, 24) (2, 4) (18, 3) (18, 5) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 7) (26, 16) (26, 13) (26, 22) (26, 24) (24, 3) (24, 2) (24, 26) (24, 20) (17, 20) (17, 28) (17, 8) (20, 24) (20, 17) (20, 1) (20, 28) (5, 18) (5, 19) (5, 25) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 21) (29, 13) (29, 9) (29, 23) (29, 14) (23, 11) (23, 2) (23, 29) (8, 17) (8, 28) (8, 7) (28, 17) (28, 20) (28, 8) (6, 0) (1, 12) (1, 20) (25, 5) (25, 9) (25, 0) (14, 3) (14, 29) (7, 22) (7, 27) (7, 19) (7, 8) (21, 11) (21, 9) (10, 16) (10, 27) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 0) (0, 22) (0, 6) (0, 25) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 22, 25, 4}
- Node 1: {12, 20}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 13, 23, 24}
- Node 3: {2, 14, 18, 24}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 16}
- Node 5: {18, 19, 25}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {8, 19, 22, 27}
- Node 8: {7, 17, 28}
- Node 9: {21, 25, 29}
- Node 10: {16, 27}
- Node 11: {21, 23}
- Node 12: {1, 13, 19, 27}
- Node 13: {2, 12, 22, 26, 29}
- Node 14: {3, 29}
- Node 16: {4, 10, 26}
- Node 17: {8, 20, 28}
- Node 18: {3, 5}
- Node 19: {1, 7, 12}
- Node 20: {1, 17, 24, 28}
- Node 21: {9, 11}
- Node 22: {0, 7, 13, 26}
- Node 23: {2, 11, 29}
- Node 24: {2, 20, 26}
- Node 25: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 26: {13, 16, 22, 24}
- Node 27: {7, 10, 12}
- Node 28: {8, 17, 20}
- Node 29: {9, 13, 14, 23}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

For each of these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 53

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [53], and the list of unique 3-stars is:
<0, 4, 2>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 22>, <0, 4, 25>, <2, 3, 24>, <2, 4, 24>, 
<2, 13, 26>, <2, 23, 29>, <3, 14, 29>, <7, 8, 17>, <9, 21, 11>, <12, 1, 20>, 
<12, 7, 27>, <12, 19, 27>, <12, 27, 10>, <13, 26, 24>, <13, 29, 23>, <16, 4, 10>, 
<16, 4, 26>, <19, 1, 20>, <19, 7, 27>, <19, 12, 27>, <20, 1, 17>, <20, 1, 28>, 
<20, 17, 28>, <22, 0, 25>, <22, 0, 7>, <22, 7, 27>, <22, 13, 26>, <23, 2, 29>, 
<24, 2, 20>, <24, 2, 26>, <24, 3, 18>, <25, 0, 5>, <25, 0, 9>, <25, 5, 18>, 
<25, 9, 29>, <26, 16, 24>, <26, 13, 22>, <26, 24, 20>, <27, 7, 8>, <27, 7, 19>, 
<27, 7, 12>, <28, 8, 17>, <28, 8, 20>, <28, 17, 20>, <29, 9, 23>
