Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 26) (15, 9) (15, 8) (1, 21) (1, 28) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 22) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 23) (21, 18) (21, 17) (8, 15) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 26) (22, 1) (22, 23) (23, 21) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 17) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 18) (2, 3) (2, 26) (2, 28) (19, 1) (19, 26) (19, 0) (26, 15) (26, 13) (26, 2) (26, 19) (9, 15) (9, 20) (9, 27) (29, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 4) (14, 25) (7, 10) (7, 11) (6, 14) (6, 4) (18, 21) (18, 23) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 20) (4, 14) (4, 6) (12, 21) (12, 25) (12, 0) (24, 27) (24, 17) (27, 9) (27, 24) (27, 17) (27, 5) (20, 9) (20, 18) (5, 27) (5, 25) (25, 14) (25, 12) (25, 5) (25, 28) (17, 21) (17, 23) (17, 24) (17, 27) (0, 19) (0, 29) (0, 12) (28, 1) (28, 2) (28, 25) (16, 10) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {19, 12, 29}
- Node 1: {21, 28, 10, 19, 22}
- Node 2: {3, 26, 28}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {14, 6}
- Node 5: {27, 25}
- Node 6: {14, 4}
- Node 7: {10, 11}
- Node 8: {15, 13}
- Node 9: {15, 20, 27}
- Node 10: {1, 11, 7, 16}
- Node 11: {10, 14, 7, 18}
- Node 12: {21, 25, 0}
- Node 13: {8, 26}
- Node 14: {11, 6, 18, 4, 25}
- Node 15: {8, 26, 9}
- Node 16: {10}
- Node 17: {21, 23, 24, 27}
- Node 18: {21, 23, 11, 14, 20}
- Node 19: {1, 26, 0}
- Node 20: {9, 18}
- Node 21: {1, 12, 23, 18, 17}
- Node 22: {1, 23}
- Node 23: {21, 22, 18, 17}
- Node 24: {27, 17}
- Node 25: {14, 5, 12, 28}
- Node 26: {15, 13, 2, 19}
- Node 27: {9, 24, 17, 5}
- Node 28: {1, 2, 25}
- Node 29: {0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1, 21, 10, 26, 18, and 23 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10 3-stars each.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8, 15, 9, 27, 12, 17, 25, and 28 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 3-star each.

Adding them up:
10(6) + 10(1) + 1(8) + 1 = 68

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 21, 28, 10>, <1, 21, 28, 19>, <1, 21, 28, 22>, <1, 21, 10, 19>, <1, 21, 10, 22>, <1, 21, 19, 22>, <1, 28, 10, 19>, <1, 28, 10, 22>, <1, 10, 19, 22>, <21, 28, 10, 19>, <14, 11, 18, 20>, <8, 15, 9, 27>, <12, 25, 0>, <17, 23, 24, 27>.
