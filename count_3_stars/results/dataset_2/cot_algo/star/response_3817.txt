Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 6) (1, 6) (1, 18) (3, 4) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 19) (2, 18) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 15) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 17) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 16) (16, 7) (16, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (17, 2) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 15) (19, 11) (19, 17) (8, 14) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 17) (0, 13) 

Response:
First, we need to find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {13}
- Node 1: {6, 18}
- Node 2: {14, 17, 18}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 10, 15}
- Node 5: {9, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 16, 17}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 12, 16}
- Node 8: {14}
- Node 9: {5, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {4, 13}
- Node 11: {5, 9, 14, 19}
- Node 12: {7, 9, 13, 17}
- Node 13: {0, 5, 10, 12, 15}
- Node 14: {2, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 15: {4, 13, 17, 18}
- Node 16: {6, 7}
- Node 17: {2, 6, 12, 15, 19}
- Node 18: {1, 2, 15}
- Node 19: {11, 17}

Now, we can list the 3-stars formed by nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 5: <5, 9, 11>, <5, 9, 13>
- Node 6: <6, 7, 16>
- Node 9: <9, 11, 14>, <9, 12, 13>
- Node 12: <12, 13, 17>
- Node 13: <13, 15, 17>
- Node 14: <14, 8, 9>, <14, 11, 19>
- Node 17: <17, 15, 19>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of 8 3-stars formed in this graph, so the final answer is [8].
