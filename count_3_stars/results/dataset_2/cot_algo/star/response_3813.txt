Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 2) (12, 4) (12, 13) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 3, 5, 11
- Node 1: 2, 3, 7, 9, 13
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 14
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 8, 13
- Node 4: 5, 6, 7, 12
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 11, 13
- Node 6: 4, 9, 11, 13
- Node 7: 1, 4, 9, 10, 11, 14
- Node 8: 3, 11, 13
- Node 9: 1, 6, 7
- Node 10: 7, 14
- Node 11: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 12: 4, 13
- Node 13: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 12
- Node 14: 2, 7, 10

Now, for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of 3-stars each can form:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us: 
\[10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 84\]

Therefore, the final answer, to be placed inside brackets, is [84]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 7, 9, 13>
- <1, 7, 9, 14>
- <1, 7, 13, 14>
- <1, 9, 13, 14>
- <3, 5, 11, 13>
- <7, 9, 11, 14>
- <7, 9, 13, 14>
