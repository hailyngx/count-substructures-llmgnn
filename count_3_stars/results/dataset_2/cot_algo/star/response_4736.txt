Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 4, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 6, 3, 4, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 9, 6, 1, 7, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 1, 0, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 8, 0, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 1, 3, 2, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 2, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, Node 9

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 0: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) (as it has 3 neighbors)
    - <0, (5, 4, 2)>
- Node 1: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) (as it has 4 neighbors)
    - <1, (6, 3, 4)>, <1, (6, 3, 7)>, <1, (6, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 2: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) (as it has 5 neighbors)
    - <2, (9, 6, 3)>, <2, (9, 6, 4)>, <2, (9, 6, 0)>, <2, (9, 3, 4)>, <2, (6, 3, 4)>, <2, (6, 3, 0)>, <2, (6, 4, 0)>, <2, (3, 4, 0)>, <2, (9, 6, 1)>, <2, (6, 3, 1)>
- Node 3: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \) (as it has 6 neighbors)
    - <3, (5, 9, 6)>, <3, (5, 9, 1)>, <3, (5, 6, 1)>, <3, (9, 6, 1)>, <3, (9, 1, 7)>, <3, (6, 1, 7)>, <3, (6, 1, 4)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 9, 2)>, <3, (5, 6, 2)>, <3, (5, 3, 2)>, <3, (9, 6, 2)>, <3, (9, 3, 7)>, <3, (6, 2, 4)>, <3, (6, 2, 0)>, <3, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 3, 7)>, <3, (6, 3, 7)>, <3, (6, 3, 4)>, <3, (4, 1, 7)>
- Node 6: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) (as it has 5 neighbors)
    - <6, (9, 1, 3)>, <6, (9, 1, 4)>, <6, (9, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (9, 1, 2)>, <6, (9, 3, 2)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (3, 4, 0)>
- Node 9: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) (as it has 4 neighbors)
    - <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 2)>, <9, (5, 3, 2)>, <9, (6, 3, 2)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 49
So, the final answer is [49].
