Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 9) (15, 19) (15, 0) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 12) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 10) (18, 9) (18, 4) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 1) (12, 17) (11, 3) (11, 19) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 10) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 13) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 16) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 8) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 14, 15}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 14}
- Node 3: {9, 11}
- Node 4: {5, 10, 18}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 8, 19}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 16}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 9, 18}
- Node 10: {4, 13, 16}
- Node 11: {3, 19}
- Node 12: {17}
- Node 13: {1, 10, 17}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 19}
- Node 15: {0, 19}
- Node 16: {8, 10, 17}
- Node 17: {12, 13, 16}
- Node 18: {4, 9}
- Node 19: {6, 11, 14, 15}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 43 \), so the answer is [43].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 14, 15)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 14)>
<5, (2, 6, 8), (4, 6, 9), (5, 8, 9), (5, 6, 8), (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 19), (2, 5, 6), (5, 8, 9), (5, 6, 8), (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 6), (1, 5, 13), (1, 6, 18), (5, 6, 8), (5, 6, 9)>
<14, (0, 2, 19)>
<16, (8, 10, 17)>
<17, (12, 13, 16)>
<19, (6, 11, 15), (6, 14, 15), (6, 15, 19), (11, 14, 15)>
