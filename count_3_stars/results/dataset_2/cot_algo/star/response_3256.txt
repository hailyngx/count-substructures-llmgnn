Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: (4, 8)
- Node 1: (2, 3, 6, 8)
- Node 2: (1, 4, 5, 7, 9)
- Node 3: (1, 4, 6, 7)
- Node 4: (0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9)
- Node 5: (2, 4, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 6: (1, 3, 5, 7)
- Node 7: (2, 3, 4, 6)
- Node 8: (0, 1, 5, 9)
- Node 9: (2, 4, 5, 8)

Now, let's count the 3-stars:
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: \(4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 52\)

Therefore, the final answer is [52], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (4, 5, 8)>
