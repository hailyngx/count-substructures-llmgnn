Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 21) (0, 27) (0, 15) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 3) (27, 20) (27, 5) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 12) (9, 0) (9, 6) (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 23) (22, 5) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 23) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 25) (12, 6) (12, 20) (12, 13) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 29) (28, 3) (28, 8) (13, 12) (26, 18) (26, 25) (26, 8) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 2) (29, 4) (29, 1) (29, 8) (29, 23) (3, 27) (3, 17) (3, 28) (3, 21) (21, 16) (21, 25) (21, 3) (21, 19) (8, 11) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 29) (23, 18) (23, 10) (23, 29) (23, 15) (24, 11) (24, 5) (24, 15) (1, 25) (1, 29) (1, 19) (2, 25) (20, 27) (20, 12) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 23) (15, 24) (5, 27) (5, 22) (5, 24) (19, 21) (19, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by identifying the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 15, 27}
- Node 1: {19, 25, 29}
- Node 2: {25}
- Node 3: {17, 21, 27, 28}
- Node 4: {14, 18, 29}
- Node 5: {22, 24, 27}
- Node 6: {9, 12, 15}
- Node 7: {10, 11, 25}
- Node 8: {11, 26, 28, 29}
- Node 9: {0, 6}
- Node 10: {7, 17, 23}
- Node 11: {7, 8, 16, 24}
- Node 12: {6, 13, 20}
- Node 13: {12}
- Node 14: {15, 17, 4}
- Node 15: {0, 14, 15, 23, 24}
- Node 16: {11, 21}
- Node 17: {10, 14, 3}
- Node 18: {4, 23, 26}
- Node 19: {1, 21}
- Node 20: {12, 27}
- Node 21: {19, 21, 25, 3}
- Node 22: {5}
- Node 23: {15, 18, 23, 29}
- Node 24: {5, 11, 15}
- Node 25: {1, 21, 2, 7, 25}
- Node 26: {18, 25, 8}
- Node 27: {0, 3, 5, 20}
- Node 28: {3, 8}
- Node 29: {1, 4, 8, 23}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: {0, 1, 5, 6, 10, 12, 16, 19, 22, 28}

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 5

Therefore, the final answer is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, 9, 15, 27>
<1, 19, 25, 29>
<5, 22, 24, 27>
<6, 9, 15, 12>
<10, 7, 25, 17>
