Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 0) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 3) (10, 13) (10, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 12, 11, 3}
- Node 1: {9, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {9, 8, 12}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 8, 14, 0}
- Node 4: {0, 10, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {4, 12, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {9, 13, 2, 11, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 13, 3, 1, 12, 2}
- Node 10: {13, 4}
- Node 11: {8, 1, 12, 0}
- Node 12: {9, 2, 6, 0, 11}
- Node 13: {5, 8, 10, 14, 7, 9}
- Node 14: {13, 1, 3, 7}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 84

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [84].

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 6, 12)>, <0, (3, 11, 12)>, <0, (3, 11, 0)>, <0, (3, 0, 11)>, <0, (3, 0, 6)>, <0, (3, 0, 12)>, <0, (6, 12, 0)>, <0, (6, 12, 11)>, <0, (6, 12, 0)>, <0, (11, 12, 0)>, <1, (8, 13, 14)>, <1, (8, 11, 14)>, <1, (8, 11, 0)>, <1, (8, 1, 14)>, <3, (5, 7, 13)>, <8, (9, 11, 1)>, <9, (5, 13, 7)>, <9, (5, 13, 10)>, <9, (5, 13, 14)>, <9, (5, 13, 8)>, <9, (5, 13, 3)>, <9, (13, 10, 4)>, <9, (13, 10, 14)>, <9, (13, 14, 7)>
