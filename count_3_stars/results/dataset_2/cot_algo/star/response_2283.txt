Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 5, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 9, 7, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 4, 7, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 7, 5, 0}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 7, 3, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 8, 0, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 1, 8, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 3, 1, 8, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 7, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 1, 0}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node (if applicable):

- Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 0 3-stars
- Node 3: 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 0 3-stars
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 0 3-stars
- Node 9: 0 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3 (1 + 1 + 1), represented as [3].

And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <1, 6, 5, 8>
- <4, 9, 7, 3>
- <5, 6, 1, 7>
