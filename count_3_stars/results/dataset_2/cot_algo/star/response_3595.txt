Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 18) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 16) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 15) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 16) (2, 6) (2, 12) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 9) (15, 1) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 11) (13, 1) (13, 7) (17, 18) (17, 9) (17, 8) (12, 2) (12, 19) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 10) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 15) (9, 17) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 7) (8, 18) (8, 17) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 13, 15}
- Node 2: {6, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 18}
- Node 4: {15, 16, 18}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 10, 11, 16}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {17, 18}
- Node 9: {14, 15, 17, 19}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 19}
- Node 11: {6, 15}
- Node 12: {2, 19}
- Node 13: {1, 7}
- Node 14: {0, 9, 16}
- Node 15: {1, 4, 9, 11}
- Node 16: {4, 6, 14}
- Node 17: {8, 9, 18}
- Node 18: {3, 4, 8, 17}
- Node 19: {9, 10, 12}

Now let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 5, 7, 9, 15, 18 have exactly 3 neighbors.

For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 0, the number of 3-stars = inom{2}{3} = 0
- For Node 2, the number of 3-stars = inom{2}{3} = 0
- For Node 3, the number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- For Node 4, the number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- For Node 6, the number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
- For Node 8, the number of 3-stars = inom{2}{3} = 0
- For Node 10, the number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- For Node 11, the number of 3-stars = inom{2}{3} = 0
- For Node 12, the number of 3-stars = inom{2}{3} = 0
- For Node 14, the number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- For Node 16, the number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- For Node 17, the number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- For Node 19, the number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1

Total 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (1, 7, 18)>, <4, (15, 16, 18)>, <6, (2, 10, 16)>, <10, (6, 7, 19)>, <14, (0, 9, 16)>, <16, (4, 6, 14)>, <17, (8, 9, 18)>, <19, (9, 10, 12)>
