Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 3) (5, 13) (6, 10) (6, 0) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (0, 6) (14, 7) (14, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 19) (1, 13) (1, 10) (17, 9) (17, 7) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 16) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 15) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 12) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 3) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 15) (11, 4) (3, 18) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 19) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated as follows:

1. For node 2: Neighbors = {4, 8, 12, 18}. Number of 3-stars = 4 choose 3 = 4.
2. For node 18: Neighbors = {2, 4, 16, 3}. Number of 3-stars = 4 choose 3 = 4.
3. For node 4: Neighbors = {2, 18, 16, 11}. Number of 3-stars = 4 choose 3 = 4.
4. For node 16: Neighbors = {18, 4, 15, 9, 12}. Number of 3-stars = 5 choose 3 = 10.
5. For node 10: Neighbors = {6, 13, 1, 15}. Number of 3-stars = 4 choose 3 = 4.
6. For node 9: Neighbors = {8, 17, 16, 3}. Number of 3-stars = 4 choose 3 = 4.
7. For node 12: Neighbors = {2, 14, 16, 3}. Number of 3-stars = 4 choose 3 = 4.
8. For node 15: Neighbors = {10, 19, 7, 16}. Number of 3-stars = 4 choose 3 = 4.
9. For node 13: Neighbors = {5, 1, 10, 19}. Number of 3-stars = 4 choose 3 = 4.
10. For node 3: Neighbors = {18, 9, 12, 19}. Number of 3-stars = 4 choose 3 = 4.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40.

Therefore, the final answer is [40], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (4, 8, 12)>
<18, (2, 4, 16)>
<4, (2, 18, 16)>
<16, (18, 4, 15)>
<10, (6, 13, 1)>
<9, (8, 17, 16)>
<12, (2, 14, 16)>
<15, (10, 19, 7)>
<13, (5, 1, 10)>
<3, (18, 9, 12)>
