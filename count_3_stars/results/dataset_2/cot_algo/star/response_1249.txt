Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 6) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 2) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 9) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 12) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: [14]
- Node 1: [3, 11, 5]
- Node 2: [4, 7, 9]
- Node 3: [1, 7, 14, 5]
- Node 4: [14, 12, 10, 6, 2]
- Node 5: [1, 3, 11, 13, 7]
- Node 6: [13, 4, 12]
- Node 7: [3, 5, 13, 2, 8]
- Node 8: [14, 11, 7]
- Node 9: [14, 13, 12, 10, 2]
- Node 10: [13, 4, 12, 9]
- Node 11: [1, 5, 8, 12]
- Node 12: [11, 4, 10, 6, 9]
- Node 13: [5, 7, 13, 6, 10, 9]
- Node 14: [0, 3, 4, 8, 9]

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: [3, 11, 5] (3 neighbors)
- Node 3: [1, 7, 14, 5] (4 neighbors)
- Node 4: [14, 12, 10, 6, 2] (5 neighbors)
- Node 5: [1, 3, 11, 13, 7] (5 neighbors)
- Node 7: [3, 5, 13, 2, 8] (5 neighbors)
- Node 9: [14, 13, 12, 10, 2] (5 neighbors)
- Node 12: [11, 4, 10, 6, 9] (5 neighbors)
- Node 13: [5, 7, 13, 6, 10, 9] (6 neighbors)
- Node 14: [0, 3, 4, 8, 9] (5 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 75

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [75].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 3, 5>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <4, 5, 13>
- <4, 7, 13>
- <4, 9, 14>
- <5, 7, 13>
- <5, 13, 9>
- <7, 9, 13>
- <9, 12, 13>
