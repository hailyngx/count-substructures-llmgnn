Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 8) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 1) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 14) (18, 2) (18, 12) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 19) (5, 17) (5, 16) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 3) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 4) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 15) (15, 7) (15, 4) (9, 13) (9, 19) (12, 18) (12, 6) (12, 8) (13, 9) (13, 3) (19, 0) (19, 9) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 15) (3, 8) (3, 13) 

Response:
Calculating the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

For node 14: (17, 8, 18)
For node 17: (14, 6, 16), (14, 8, 5)
For node 10: (11, 4, 2)
For node 11: (10, 1, 2)
For node 2: (10, 1, 4), (10, 7, 18)
For node 18: (14, 2, 12)
For node 1: (11, 6, 2), (11, 0, 1)
For node 6: (17, 1, 12)
For node 0: (1, 19, 0)
For node 5: (17, 16, 5)
For node 8: (14, 17, 12)
For node 16: (17, 5, 4)
For node 7: (2, 6, 15)
For node 15: (7, 4, 15)
For node 9: (13, 19, 9)
For node 12: (18, 6, 8)
For node 13: (9, 3, 13)
For node 19: (0, 9, 19)
For node 4: (10, 16, 4), (10, 15, 4)
For node 3: (8, 13, 3)

Total number of 3-stars = 19

Therefore, the final answer is [19]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
<14, (17, 8, 18)>, <17, (14, 6, 16)>, <17, (14, 8, 5)>, <10, (11, 4, 2)>, <11, (10, 1, 2)>, <2, (10, 1, 4)>, <2, (10, 7, 18)>, <18, (14, 2, 12)>, <1, (11, 6, 2)>, <1, (11, 0, 1)>, <6, (17, 1, 12)>, <0, (1, 19, 0)>, <5, (17, 16, 5)>, <8, (14, 17, 12)>, <16, (17, 5, 4)>, <7, (2, 6, 15)>, <15, (7, 4, 15)>, <9, (13, 19, 9)>, <12, (18, 6, 8)>, <13, (9, 3, 13)>
