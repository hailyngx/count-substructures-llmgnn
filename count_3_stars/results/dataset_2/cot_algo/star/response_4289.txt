Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 17) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 17) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 19) (7, 0) (7, 15) (5, 2) (5, 18) (19, 14) (19, 10) (19, 6) (1, 13) (1, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 7) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 6) (6, 4) (6, 19) (6, 12) (6, 3) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 12) (10, 19) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 1) (9, 14) (9, 1) (3, 8) (3, 6) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges for each node:

Node 0: {4, 8, 14, 7}
Node 1: {13, 9}
Node 2: {18, 5, 15}
Node 3: {8, 6}
Node 4: {8, 13, 0, 6}
Node 5: {2, 18}
Node 6: {4, 19, 12, 3}
Node 7: {0, 15}
Node 8: {4, 14, 0, 3}
Node 9: {14, 1}
Node 10: {19}
Node 11: {16, 13, 12}
Node 12: {11, 16, 17, 6}
Node 13: {11, 4, 1}
Node 14: {8, 0, 9, 19}
Node 15: {2, 18, 7}
Node 16: {11, 12, 17}
Node 17: {16, 18, 12}
Node 18: {2, 5, 15, 17}
Node 19: {14, 10, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: <6, (4, 12, 19)>, <6, (3, 6, 12)>  
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 14 has 4 neighbors: <14, (8, 9, 19)>, <14, (0, 9, 19)>
Node 15 has 3 neighbors: [1] = 1 3-star
Node 16 has 3 neighbors: [1] = 1 3-star
Node 18 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].
