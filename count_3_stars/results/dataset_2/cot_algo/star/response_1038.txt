Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 10) (9, 1) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 28) (26, 8) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 0) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 25) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 15) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 13) (4, 18) (4, 10) (4, 25) (22, 9) (22, 14) (22, 0) (24, 26) (24, 23) (24, 29) (11, 3) (11, 1) (28, 26) (28, 19) (6, 21) (21, 6) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 17) (17, 18) (17, 21) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 27) (20, 17) (20, 1) (20, 23) (20, 16) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 21) (10, 16) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 20) (23, 24) (23, 20) (12, 2) (12, 21) (12, 25) (16, 17) (16, 20) (16, 10) (0, 3) (0, 22) (19, 28) (19, 14) (14, 22) (14, 19) (14, 27) (27, 17) (27, 14) (27, 29) (27, 13) (29, 24) (29, 27) (29, 8) (13, 18) (13, 27) (5, 25) (25, 15) (25, 4) (25, 12) (25, 5) (25, 8) (8, 26) (8, 15) (8, 29) (8, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 22}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 11, 20}
- Node 2: Neighbors {12, 18}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 11, 15}
- Node 4: Neighbors {10, 18, 25}
- Node 5: Neighbors {25}
- Node 6: Neighbors {21}
- Node 8: Neighbors {15, 25, 26, 29}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 10, 22, 26}
- Node 10: Neighbors {4, 9, 16, 21}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 25}
- Node 13: Neighbors {18, 27}
- Node 14: Neighbors {19, 22, 27}
- Node 15: Neighbors {3, 8, 18, 25}
- Node 16: Neighbors {10, 17, 20}
- Node 17: Neighbors {16, 18, 20, 21, 27}
- Node 18: Neighbors {2, 4, 13, 15, 17}
- Node 19: Neighbors {14, 28}
- Node 20: Neighbors {1, 16, 17, 23}
- Node 21: Neighbors {6, 10, 12, 17}
- Node 22: Neighbors {9, 14}
- Node 23: Neighbors {20, 24}
- Node 24: Neighbors {23, 26, 29}
- Node 25: Neighbors {4, 5, 8, 12, 15}
- Node 26: Neighbors {9, 24, 28, 8}
- Node 27: Neighbors {13, 14, 17, 29}
- Node 28: Neighbors {19, 26}
- Node 29: Neighbors {8, 24, 27}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves (11, 20).
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves (15, 25).
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves (10, 22).
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with leaves (18, 25).
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with leaves (20, 16).
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with leaves (4, 13).
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with leaves (1, 23).
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with leaves (26, 29).
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with leaves (14, 17).

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of 9 3-stars. Therefore, the final number to be put inside brackets is [9].
