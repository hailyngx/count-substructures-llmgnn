Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 27) (3, 12) (3, 22) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 25) (15, 14) (2, 29) (2, 12) (2, 21) (29, 2) (29, 25) (29, 23) (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 16) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 4) (8, 6) (13, 26) (13, 6) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 22) (27, 3) (27, 12) (27, 4) (0, 21) (0, 17) (0, 26) (20, 23) (20, 10) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 26) (21, 2) (21, 0) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 19) (26, 13) (26, 0) (26, 7) (1, 17) (1, 6) (17, 0) (17, 1) (17, 18) (4, 9) (4, 27) (4, 22) (11, 14) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 1) (10, 20) (10, 23) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 18) (22, 3) (22, 12) (22, 4) (22, 16) (22, 24) (25, 15) (25, 29) (25, 5) (19, 28) (19, 16) (18, 17) (18, 14) (18, 24) (16, 5) (16, 22) (16, 19) (24, 22) (24, 18) (24, 23) (23, 29) (23, 20) (23, 10) (23, 24) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 21, 17, 26
- Node 1: 17, 6
- Node 2: 29, 12, 21
- Node 3: 27, 12, 22
- Node 4: 9, 27, 22
- Node 5: 9, 25, 16
- Node 6: 15, 8, 13, 7, 1
- Node 7: 12, 6, 14, 26
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 15, 5, 4
- Node 10: 20, 23
- Node 11: 14
- Node 12: 3, 2, 27, 7, 22
- Node 13: 26, 6
- Node 14: 15, 7, 11, 18
- Node 15: 9, 6, 25, 14
- Node 16: 5, 22, 19
- Node 17: 0, 1, 18
- Node 18: 17, 14, 24
- Node 19: 28, 16
- Node 20: 23, 10
- Node 21: 2, 0, 28
- Node 22: 3, 12, 4, 16, 24
- Node 23: 29, 20, 10, 24
- Node 24: 22, 18, 23
- Node 25: 15, 29, 5
- Node 26: 13, 0, 7
- Node 27: 3, 12, 4
- Node 28: 21, 19
- Node 29: 2, 25, 23

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with (12, 22, 27) <3, (12, 22, 27)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with (9, 22, 27) <4, (9, 22, 27)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with (7, 14, 15) <6, (7, 14, 15)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with (4, 5, 9) <9, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with (22, 27, 3) <12, (22, 27, 3)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with (7, 15, 18) <14, (7, 15, 18)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with (14, 25, 6) <15, (14, 25, 6)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with (19, 22, 16) <16, (19, 22, 16)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with (1, 18, 0) <17, (1, 18, 0)>
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with (28, 2, 21) <21, (28, 2, 21)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with (12, 24, 16) <22, (12, 24, 16)>
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with (29, 20, 23) <23, (29, 20, 23)>
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with (5, 29, 15) <25, (5, 29, 15)>
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with (7, 0, 13) <26, (7, 0, 13)>
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with (4, 12, 3) <27, (4, 12, 3)>

There are 14 unique 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [14].
