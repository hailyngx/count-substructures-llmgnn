Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 17) (1, 0) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 19) (10, 6) (10, 18) (11, 3) (11, 2) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 6) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 0) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 16) (12, 13) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 15) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 16) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 15) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 13) (14, 3) (14, 15) (4, 9) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 6) (13, 12) (13, 19) (13, 16) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 15) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 7, 15, 18
- Node 1: 0, 17
- Node 2: 6, 9, 11, 18
- Node 3: 11, 14, 19
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 7, 9, 16, 17
- Node 6: 2, 10, 15
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: 9, 15, 19
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 10: 6, 18
- Node 11: 2, 3
- Node 12: 13, 16
- Node 13: 12, 16, 19
- Node 14: 3, 15
- Node 15: 0, 6, 8, 14
- Node 16: 5, 12, 13, 17, 19
- Node 17: 1, 5, 16
- Node 18: 0, 2, 10
- Node 19: 3, 8, 13, 16

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: <5, 7, 9>, <5, 16, 17>, [inom{4}{3}] = 3
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 9: <9, 2, 4>, [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 15: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 16: <16, 5, 17>, [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 18: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 19: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 31

Therefore, the final answer is [31].
