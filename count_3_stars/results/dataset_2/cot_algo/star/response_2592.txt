Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5, 3, 4
- Node 2: 9, 6, 3, 8
- Node 3: 1, 7, 2, 8
- Node 4: 5, 6, 1, 7
- Node 5: 1, 4, 0, 7
- Node 6: 9, 7, 2, 4
- Node 7: 5, 6, 3, 4, 0
- Node 8: 9, 3, 2, 0
- Node 9: 6, 8, 2, 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 43 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in this graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, 5, 7>
- <1, 5, 4>
- <2, 9, 6>
- <3, 1, 4>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <7, 5, 0>
- <7, 5, 6>
- <7, 6, 2>
- <7, 6, 4>
- <7, 3, 2>
- <7, 3, 8>
- <8, 3, 2>
- <9, 6, 4>
- <9, 6, 7>
- <9, 6, 2>
- <9, 8, 3>
