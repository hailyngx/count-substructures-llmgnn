Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 15) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 14) (4, 13) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 1) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 0) (3, 17) (3, 19) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 7) (1, 2) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 2) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 14) (12, 16) (12, 15) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 7) (18, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (14, 16) (14, 10) (14, 19) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 6, 7, 16}
- Node 1: {2, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 9, 13, 17}
- Node 3: {17, 19}
- Node 4: {13}
- Node 5: {6, 18, 19}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 19}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 18}
- Node 8: {9, 10, 17}
- Node 9: {2, 8, 11}
- Node 10: {8, 14, 15, 17}
- Node 11: {9, 15}
- Node 12: {15, 16}
- Node 13: {2, 4}
- Node 14: {10, 16, 19}
- Node 15: {10, 11, 12}
- Node 16: {0, 12, 14, 19}
- Node 17: {2, 3, 8, 10}
- Node 18: {5, 7}
- Node 19: {3, 5, 6, 14, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed by each:

- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
    - <0, (2, 6, 7)>  
    - <0, (2, 6, 16)>
    - <0, (2, 7, 16)>
    - <0, (6, 7, 16)>
  
- Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
    - <2, (0, 1, 9)>
    - <2, (0, 1, 13)>
    - <2, (0, 9, 13)>
    - <2, (0, 1, 17)>
    - <2, (0, 13, 17)>
    - <2, (1, 9, 17)>
    - <2, (1, 13, 17)>
    - <2, (9, 13, 17)>
    - <2, (1, 13, 9)>
    - <2, (9, 13, 17)>
  
- Node 5: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
    - <5, (6, 18, 19)>

- Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
    - <6, (0, 5, 19)>

- Node 7: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
    - <7, (0, 1, 18)>
  
- Node 8: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
    - <8, (9, 10, 17)>
  
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
    - <9, (2, 8, 11)>
  
- Node 10: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
    - <10, (8, 14, 17)>
    - <10, (8, 15, 17)>
    - <10, (14, 15, 17)>
    - <10, (14, 15, 16)>
  
- Node 14: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
    - <14, (16, 19, 10)>
  
- Node 16: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
    - <16, (0, 12, 14)>
    - <16, (0, 14, 19)>
    - <16, (12, 14, 19)>
    - <16, (14, 19, 10)>
  
- Node 17: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
    - <17, (2, 8, 10)>
    - <17, (2, 10, 14)>
    - <17, (8, 10, 14)>
    - <17, (8, 10, 15)>
  
- Node 19: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
    - <19, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <19, (3, 5, 16)>
    - <19, (3, 6, 16)>
    - <19, (5, 6, 16)>
    - <19, (5, 6, 14)>
    - <19, (5, 14, 16)>
    - <19, (6, 14, 16)>
    - <19, (6, 14, 10)>
    - <19, (14, 16, 10)>
    - <19, (14, 16, 12)>
  
Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us: [40]
