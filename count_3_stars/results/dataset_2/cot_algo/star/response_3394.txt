Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 2, 5
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
Node 2 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7
Node 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 6
Node 6 neighbors: 3, 5, 8, 9
Node 7 neighbors: 2, 3
Node 8 neighbors: 3, 4, 6
Node 9 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6

Now we check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 2 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 3 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 4 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 5 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 6 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 8 has 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 9 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 53 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [53], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (1, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
