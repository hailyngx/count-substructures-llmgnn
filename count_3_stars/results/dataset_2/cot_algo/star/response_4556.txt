Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:

1. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 7: <5, (0, 6, 7)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 3: <9, (1, 2, 3)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 8: <6, (0, 1, 8)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 2: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 5: <7, (0, 2, 5)>
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6: <8, (2, 4, 6)>
7. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 7: <2, (1, 4, 7)>
8. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 6: <0, (1, 5, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
