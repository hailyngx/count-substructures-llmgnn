Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 9 have 4 or more neighbors.

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the final answer is [48] and the unique 3-star configurations are:
<2, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>
