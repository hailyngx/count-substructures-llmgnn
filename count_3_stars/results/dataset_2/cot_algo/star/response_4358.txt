Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 17) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 15) (18, 4) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (4, 18) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 11) (19, 5) (19, 4) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 16) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 10) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (0, 3) (0, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 17) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 9) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (10, 6) (10, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 3, 9
Node 1 neighbors: 12, 13
Node 2 neighbors: 9, 13
Node 3 neighbors: 0, 7, 9, 15
Node 4 neighbors: 6, 11, 18, 19
Node 5 neighbors: 6, 14, 16, 19
Node 6 neighbors: 4, 5, 10, 12, 14
Node 7 neighbors: 3, 11, 13, 14
Node 9 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 14
Node 10 neighbors: 6, 16
Node 11 neighbors: 4, 7, 17
Node 12 neighbors: 1, 6, 16
Node 13 neighbors: 1, 2, 7
Node 14 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 9, 15
Node 15 neighbors: 3, 14, 17, 18
Node 16 neighbors: 5, 10, 12
Node 17 neighbors: 11, 15
Node 18 neighbors: 4, 15
Node 19 neighbors: 4, 5

Now we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. One of them is <3, (0, 7, 9)>.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. One of them is <4, (6, 11, 19)>.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. One of them is <5, (6, 14, 19)>.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. One of them is <6, (4, 5, 14)>.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. One of them is <7, (3, 11, 13)>.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. One of them is <9, (0, 3, 14)>.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star: <12, (1, 6, 16)>.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star: <13, (1, 2, 7)>.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. One of them is <14, (5, 6, 7)>.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. One of them is <15, (3, 14, 17)>.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star: <16, (5, 10, 12)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 41 \).
Putting the final number inside brackets yields the answer: [41].
