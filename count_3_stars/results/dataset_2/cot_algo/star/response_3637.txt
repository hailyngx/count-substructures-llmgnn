Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 6, 3, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 2, 4, 0}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 8, 4}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 7, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {6, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 2, 0}

Next, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star:
- Node 5: Forms a 3-star with nodes {9, 6, 8} <5, (9, 6, 8)>
- Node 6: Forms two 3-stars with nodes {5, 9, 8} <6, (5, 9, 8)> and {2, 8, 7} <6, (2, 8, 7)>
- Node 8: Forms a 3-star with nodes {5, 6, 7} <8, (5, 6, 7)>
  
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
