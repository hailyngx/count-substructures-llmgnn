Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 7) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 9, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 7, 10}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 7, 11}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 8: {7, 9, 11}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 11: {6, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 4, 7, 11}
- Node 14: {4, 11, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: [1 3-star] -> <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 1: [1 3-star] -> <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 3: [1 3-star] -> <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 4: [1 3-star] -> <4, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 7: [1 3-star] -> <7, (0, 5, 13)>
- Node 11: [2 3-stars] -> <11, (6, 8, 13)>, <11, (11, 12, 14)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get [5].
