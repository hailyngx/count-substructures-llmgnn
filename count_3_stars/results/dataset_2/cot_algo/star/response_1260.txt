Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 7, 8, 1}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 2, 8, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 7, 3, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 6, 4, 3, 1, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9, 4, 7, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 8, 4}

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- From the neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 5, 8, and 7 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 20 = 50

So, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <5, 2, 1, 3>
- <8, 5, 9, 4>
- <7, 6, 9, 3>
