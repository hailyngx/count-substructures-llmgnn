Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these together, we have a total of 44 3-stars <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>. Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [44].
