Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 2, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 5, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 8, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 4, 5, 2, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 8, 0, 3, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 4, 1, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 5, 3, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9, 8, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 2, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 4, 1, 7}


Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 1: Forms 0 3-stars
- Node 2: Forms 0 3-stars
- Node 3: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 5: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 7: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 8: Forms 0 3-stars
- Node 9: Forms 0 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, and the unique 3-stars found are <0, 4, 3>, <3, 6, 5>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 9, 6>, <7, 9, 1>. 
So, the final answer is [5].
