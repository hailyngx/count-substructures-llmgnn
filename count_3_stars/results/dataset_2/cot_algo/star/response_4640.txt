Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 16) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 18) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 17) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (1, 0) (1, 19) (17, 13) (17, 11) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 16) (18, 15) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 16) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 2) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 2) 

Response:
Calculating the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 1
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 1
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 3

Next, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 19}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 12, 16}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 15}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 19}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 7, 15}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {9, 13}
- Node 9: {8, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {11}
- Node 11: {0, 10, 17, 5}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 13: {8, 9, 17, 18}
- Node 14: {9}
- Node 15: {3, 6, 16, 18}
- Node 16: {15, 2, 9, 19}
- Node 17: {11, 13}
- Node 18: {13, 15}
- Node 19: {1, 4, 16}

Now we see that none of the nodes have exactly 3 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars in this graph. 
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [0].
