Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (27, 18) (27, 17) (27, 23) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 25) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 23) (3, 5) (3, 22) (28, 29) (28, 19) (28, 18) (29, 28) (29, 5) (26, 1) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 16) (17, 27) (17, 26) (17, 13) (5, 3) (5, 29) (5, 18) (5, 20) (13, 17) (13, 10) (7, 18) (11, 24) (11, 9) (11, 4) (23, 27) (23, 3) (23, 21) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 20) (12, 4) (12, 24) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 19) (25, 1) (25, 6) (25, 22) (19, 28) (19, 12) (22, 3) (22, 25) (22, 16) (8, 18) (24, 11) (24, 12) (20, 1) (20, 5) (20, 4) (15, 12) (15, 2) (14, 12) (14, 10) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 16) (21, 26) (21, 23) (6, 3) (6, 25) (6, 10) (6, 2) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 2) (18, 27) (18, 28) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 8) (16, 26) (16, 22) (16, 9) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 10) 

Response:
Since we have 30 nodes in this graph, let's first calculate the number of neighbors each node has:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 1 neighbor
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 5 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 5 neighbors
- Node 13: 2 neighbors
- Node 14: 2 neighbors
- Node 15: 2 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 5 neighbors
- Node 19: 2 neighbors
- Node 20: 4 neighbors
- Node 21: 2 neighbors
- Node 22: 3 neighbors
- Node 23: 3 neighbors
- Node 24: 2 neighbors
- Node 25: 3 neighbors
- Node 26: 4 neighbors
- Node 27: 3 neighbors
- Node 28: 3 neighbors
- Node 29: 2 neighbors

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 9, 19, 25
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 10, 12, 18, 26

Next, we will calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: \( 14 inom 3 = 364 \)
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: \( 6 inom 3 = 20 \)
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: \( 6 inom 3 = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 364 + 20 + 20 = 404 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [404].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<2, (6, 10, 21)>, <7, (9, 11, 24)>, <13, (10, 14, 17)>, <14, (10, 12, 13)>, <15, (2, 12, 15)>, <16, (9, 22, 26)>, <17, (13, 17, 26)>, <21, (6, 21, 23)>, <22, (3, 16, 22)>, <23, (3, 21, 23)>, <24, (11, 12, 24)>, <27, (18, 28, 29)>, <28, (18, 19, 28)>, <29, (5, 18, 29)>.
