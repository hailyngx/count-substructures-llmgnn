Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 15) (17, 1) (17, 6) (4, 18) (4, 14) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 6) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 19) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 13) (1, 17) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 5) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 16) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 9) (16, 3) (16, 6) (2, 13) (2, 9) (9, 14) (9, 2) (5, 15) 

Response:
From the given information, we construct the following adjacency list for the graph:

1: (13, 17)

2: (13, 9)

3: (11, 14, 16, 19)

4: (14, 18)

5: (15)

6: (8, 17, 18, 16)

7: (0, 8)

8: (13, 19, 6, 12, 7)

9: (14, 2)

10: (11, 15)

11: (10, 3, 19, 18, 15)

12: (8, 14)

13: (8, 2, 1, 19)

14: (4, 3, 12, 9)

15: (10, 11, 18, 0, 5)

16: (3, 6)

17: (1, 6)

18: (11, 4, 15, 6)

19: (8, 13, 11, 3)

Now we identify the number of neighbors for each node:

1: 2 neighbors

2: 2 neighbors

3: 4 neighbors

4: 2 neighbors

5: 1 neighbor

6: 4 neighbors

7: 2 neighbors

8: 5 neighbors

9: 2 neighbors

10: 2 neighbors

11: 5 neighbors

12: 2 neighbors

13: 4 neighbors

14: 4 neighbors

15: 5 neighbors

16: 2 neighbors

17: 2 neighbors

18: 4 neighbors

19: 4 neighbors

We have identified nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 3, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19.

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 50 \)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<3, (11, 15, 19)>
<6, (8, 18, 16)>
<8, (6, 12, 13)>
<11, (3, 15, 19)>
<13, (8, 1, 19)>
<14, (3, 9, 12)>
<15, (0, 10, 18)> 
<18, (4, 6, 15)>
<19, (3, 8, 13)>
