Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are as follows:

Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 1, and 8. Thus, we have one 3-star <6, (1, 8, 9)>.

Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 1, and 4. Thus, we have one 3-star <9, (1, 4, 6)>.

Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 2, and 7. Thus, we have one 3-star <4, (2, 7, 9)>.

Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 3, and 2. Thus, we have one 3-star <7, (2, 3, 9)>.

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 0, and 9. Thus, we have one 3-star <1, (0, 6, 9)>.

Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 0, and 1. Thus, we have one 3-star <3, (0, 1, 7)>.

Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 1, and 3. Thus, we have one 3-star <0, (1, 3, 6)>.

Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 7. Thus, we have one 3-star <2, (4, 5, 7)>.

Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 3, and 5. Thus, we have one 3-star <8, (3, 5, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
