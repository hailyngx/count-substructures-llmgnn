Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 13) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 7) (9, 19) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 16) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 17) (3, 17) (3, 10) (0, 16) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 0) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 1) (19, 9) (19, 5) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 4) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 12) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 15) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 1) (4, 13) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {16, 2, 7, 12}
- Node 1: {5, 15, 10, 4}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 0}
- Node 3: {17, 10}
- Node 4: {13, 1}
- Node 5: {2, 19, 12, 1}
- Node 6: {9, 17, 13}
- Node 7: {9, 2, 18, 0}
- Node 8: {10, 12}
- Node 9: {6, 18, 7, 19}
- Node 10: {8, 3, 1}
- Node 11: {16, 15}
- Node 12: {8, 13, 0, 5, 15}
- Node 13: {16, 6, 12, 4}
- Node 15: {11, 1, 12}
- Node 16: {11, 0, 13}
- Node 17: {6, 18, 3}
- Node 18: {9, 7, 17}
- Node 19: {9, 5}

Now, we'll check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors, so there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, so there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: 3 neighbors, no 3-star
- Node 3: 2 neighbors, no 3-star
- Node 4: 2 neighbors, no 3-star
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, so there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: 3 neighbors, no 3-star
- Node 7: 4 neighbors, so there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 2 neighbors, no 3-star
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, so there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 10: 3 neighbors, no 3-star
- Node 11: 2 neighbors, no 3-star
- Node 12: 5 neighbors, so there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 13: 4 neighbors, so there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 15: 3 neighbors, no 3-star
- Node 16: 3 neighbors, no 3-star
- Node 17: 3 neighbors, no 3-star
- Node 18: 3 neighbors, no 3-star
- Node 19: 2 neighbors, no 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 26, so the final answer is [26].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 7, 12, 5>
- <1, 5, 12, 15>
- <9, 6, 17, 18>
