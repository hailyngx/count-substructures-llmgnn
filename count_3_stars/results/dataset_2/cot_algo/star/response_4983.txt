Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:

1: 9, 12, 4, 7, 0
2: 8, 0
3: 11, 4
4: 9, 13, 12, 3, 1
5: 6, 8, 13, 7
6: 9, 5, 13
7: 11, 5, 1
8: 9, 13, 2, 5, 14, 12
9: 6, 8, 4, 1, 12
10: 11, 14
11: 13, 10, 3, 14, 7
12: 9, 8, 4, 1
13: 6, 8, 5, 11
14: 8, 10, 11, 0, 1, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

The nodes that can form a 3-star are 1, 4, 8, 9, 11, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 64

Therefore, the final answer is [64], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (9, 12, 4)>
<4, (9, 13, 12)>
<8, (9, 13, 5)>
<9, (6, 8, 5)>
<11, (13, 10, 14)>
<14, (8, 10, 11)>
