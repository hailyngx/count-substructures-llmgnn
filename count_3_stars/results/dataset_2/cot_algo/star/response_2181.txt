Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 16) (2, 5) (2, 29) (2, 27) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 25) (29, 3) (3, 29) (3, 0) (3, 8) (25, 29) (25, 26) (25, 28) (10, 17) (10, 26) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 24) (17, 11) (17, 7) (15, 5) (15, 20) (15, 4) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 22) (20, 23) (0, 3) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 23) (13, 20) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 11) (26, 25) (26, 10) (26, 13) (6, 14) (6, 18) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 28) (16, 8) (28, 2) (28, 25) (28, 16) (28, 27) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 1) (4, 15) (4, 27) (4, 1) (27, 2) (27, 28) (27, 4) (7, 17) (1, 8) (1, 4) (19, 29) (22, 20) (22, 12) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 13) (18, 6) (18, 23) (18, 24) (23, 20) (23, 14) (23, 18) (23, 24) (12, 22) (24, 17) (24, 18) (24, 23) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 14}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 3, 27, 28, 29}
- Node 3: {2, 0, 8, 29}
- Node 4: {1, 15, 27}
- Node 5: {2, 9, 15, 17}
- Node 6: {14, 18}
- Node 7: {17}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 8, 9, 14, 16}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 16, 17}
- Node 10: {17, 26}
- Node 11: {13, 14, 17}
- Node 12: {22}
- Node 13: {11, 16, 20, 26}
- Node 14: {0, 6, 8, 11, 18, 23}
- Node 15: {4, 5, 20}
- Node 16: {8, 9, 13, 16, 28}
- Node 17: {5, 7, 10, 11, 24}
- Node 18: {6, 14, 23, 24}
- Node 19: {29}
- Node 20: {13, 15, 22, 23}
- Node 22: {20, 12}
- Node 23: {14, 18, 20, 24}
- Node 24: {17, 18, 23}
- Node 25: {26, 28, 29}
- Node 26: {10, 13, 25}
- Node 27: {2, 4, 27, 28}
- Node 28: {2, 16, 25, 27}
- Node 29: {2, 19, 25}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 91 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [91].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (5, 27, 28)>, <2, (3, 27, 29)>, <2, (3, 28, 29)>, <2, (8, 27, 28)>, <2, (8, 27, 29)>, <2, (8, 28, 29)>, <3, (2, 27, 28)>, <3, (2, 27, 29)>, <3, (2, 28, 29)>, <8, (2, 27, 28)>, <8, (2, 27, 29)>, <8, (2, 28, 29)>, <14, (8, 18, 23)>, <14, (8, 18, 24)>, <14, (8, 23, 24)>, <14, (11, 18, 23)>, <14, (11, 18, 24)>, <14, (11, 23, 24)>, <16, (8, 9, 28)>, <16, (8, 13, 28)>, <16, (9, 13, 28)>, <16, (13, 17, 28)>, <16, (13, 20, 28)>, <17, (11, 13, 17)>, <17, (11, 13, 24)>
