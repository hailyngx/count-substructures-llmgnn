Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 8) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 13) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 7) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {6, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 3}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 8, 12}
- Node 8: {7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 11, 12}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 7, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {2, 6, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 2, 13, 3}

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-star(s)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star(s)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star(s)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star(s)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star(s)

Adding these up, we have a total of 60 3-stars, so the final answer is [60].
