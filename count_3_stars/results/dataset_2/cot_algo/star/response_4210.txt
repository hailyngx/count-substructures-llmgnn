Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 14) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (10, 8) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 15) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 18) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 15) (1, 14) (15, 17) (15, 1) (5, 7) (5, 18) (5, 14) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 19) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 0) (3, 19) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 5) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 13) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 7, 13}
- Node 1: {9, 14, 15}
- Node 2: {0, 9, 10}
- Node 3: {19}
- Node 4: {8, 13, 16}
- Node 5: {7, 14, 18}
- Node 6: {9, 12, 18}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 10, 18}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 11}
- Node 10: {2, 8}
- Node 11: {9, 16, 17}
- Node 12: {6, 17, 19}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 18}
- Node 14: {1, 5, 16}
- Node 15: {1, 17}
- Node 16: {4, 11, 14, 19}
- Node 17: {11, 15, 12}
- Node 18: {5, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 19: {3, 12, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 4 neighbors
- Node 17: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 1 3-star each
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each

Total number of 3-stars:
1 x 7 (from nodes with exactly 3 neighbors) + 4 x 2 (from nodes with 4 neighbors) = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 2, 13>, <0, 7, 13>, <0, 7, 2>, <2, 0, 9>, <2, 8, 10>, <4, 8, 16>, <4, 13, 16>, <5, 7, 18>, <5, 14, 18>, <6, 9, 18>, <8, 10, 18>, <9, 11, 16>, <13, 4, 18>, <14, 1, 16>, <16, 4, 19>
