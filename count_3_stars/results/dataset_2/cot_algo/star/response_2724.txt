Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 12) (3, 13) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 19) (15, 13) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (2, 5) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 6) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 19) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 4) (1, 9) (18, 3) (18, 17) (18, 0) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 14) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can start by creating a node-edge incidence list to represent the graph. Here it is:

0: (7, 18), (6, 0)
1: (9, 1)
2: (5, 2)
3: (18, 3), (13, 3), (4, 3)
4: (17, 4), (12, 4), (6, 4)
5: (19, 5), (8, 5), (2, 5)
6: (14, 6), (10, 6), (0, 6), (4, 6)
7: (17, 7), (10, 7), (0, 7)
8: (5, 8), (19, 8), (9, 8)
9: (12, 9), (1, 9), (8, 9)
10: (11, 10), (6, 10), (12, 10), (7, 10)
11: (16, 11), (10, 11), (19, 11)
12: (16, 12), (10, 12), (9, 12), (4, 12)
13: (15, 13), (3, 13), (14, 13)
14: (17, 14), (13, 14), (6, 14)
15: (19, 15), (13, 15)
16: (12, 16), (11, 16)
17: (4, 17), (18, 17), (14, 17), (7, 17)
18: (0, 18), (17, 18), (3, 18)
19: (5, 19), (8, 19), (15, 19), (19, 19)

We need to find all 3-stars in this graph. First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} +\binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 23\]

Hence, there are a total of 23 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [23].
