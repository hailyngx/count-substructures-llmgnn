Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 19) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 18) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 9) (16, 12) (16, 14) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 1) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 15) (0, 2) (0, 11) (15, 14) (15, 9) (15, 18) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 15) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 19) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 18) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 7) (7, 18) (19, 6) (19, 13) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, we can first determine the neighbors of each node:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 11)
2. Node 1: (1, 6), (1, 10), (1, 12), (1, 14), (1, 17)
3. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 9)
4. Node 3: (3, 13), (3, 14)
5. Node 4: (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 8)
6. Node 5: (5, 4), (5, 6)
7. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 17), (6, 19)
8. Node 7: (7, 18)
9. Node 8: (8, 4), (8, 11)
10. Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 12), (9, 15)
11. Node 10: (10, 1), (10, 13)
12. Node 11: (11, 0), (11, 8), (11, 13), (11, 18)
13. Node 12: (12, 1), (12, 9), (12, 16), (12, 17)
14. Node 13: (13, 3), (13, 10), (13, 11), (13, 19)
15. Node 14: (14, 1), (14, 3), (14, 15), (14, 16)
16. Node 15: (15, 9), (15, 14), (15, 18)
17. Node 16: (16, 12), (16, 14)
18. Node 17: (17, 1), (17, 6), (17, 12), (17, 18)
19. Node 18: (18, 7), (18, 11), (18, 15), (18, 17)
20. Node 19: (19, 6), (19, 13)

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the total number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 1, 6, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
2. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
6. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7. Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

List of unique 3-stars found:
<1, 6, 17>, <1, 6, 19>, <1, 14, 16>, <1, 14, 18>, <6, 12, 17>, <6, 12, 19>, <13, 14, 15>, <13, 14, 19>, <13, 15, 18>, <14, 15, 18>
