Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 24) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (10, 17) (10, 3) (11, 6) (11, 20) (26, 13) (26, 15) (26, 16) (0, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 22) (13, 26) (13, 29) (13, 7) (4, 21) (27, 28) (27, 6) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (25, 15) (25, 18) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 22) (19, 21) (22, 8) (22, 19) (22, 6) (16, 14) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 5) (24, 1) (24, 16) (24, 23) (24, 20) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 29) (7, 6) (29, 13) (29, 7) (29, 12) (15, 26) (15, 0) (15, 25) (15, 28) (5, 8) (5, 16) (5, 18) (6, 11) (6, 27) (6, 22) (6, 7) (21, 4) (21, 19) (18, 25) (18, 5) (18, 12) (20, 11) (20, 24) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 29) (12, 18) (28, 27) (28, 15) (23, 24) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

- Node 0: {12, 14, 15}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 24}
- Node 2: {1, 8, 17, 19}
- Node 3: {1, 9, 10}
- Node 4: {21}
- Node 5: {8, 16, 18}
- Node 6: {7, 11, 22, 27}
- Node 7: {6, 9, 13, 29}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 9, 22}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 10: {3, 17}
- Node 11: {6, 20}
- Node 12: {0, 14, 17, 18, 29}
- Node 13: {7, 26, 29}
- Node 14: {0, 12, 16, 19}
- Node 15: {0, 15, 25, 26, 28}
- Node 16: {5, 14, 24, 26}
- Node 17: {2, 10, 12}
- Node 18: {5, 12, 15, 25}
- Node 19: {2, 14, 21, 22}
- Node 20: {11, 24}
- Node 21: {4, 19}
- Node 22: {6, 8, 19}
- Node 23: {24}
- Node 24: {1, 16, 20, 23}
- Node 25: {15, 18}
- Node 26: {13, 15, 16}
- Node 27: {6, 28}
- Node 28: {15, 27}
- Node 29: {7, 12, 13}

Calculating the number of 3-stars based on the neighbors:

- Node 0 does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 2 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 3 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 5 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 6 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 7 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 8 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 9 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 12 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 14 forms [2] 3-stars: <14, (0, 12, 16)>, <14, (0, 12, 19)>.
- Node 15 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 16 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 17 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 18 does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 19 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 22 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 24 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 26 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 29 forms [1] 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 17, so the answer is [17].
