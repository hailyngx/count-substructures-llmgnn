Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 10) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 9) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 11) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 9) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 9, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 11}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 10}
- Node 13: {0, 5, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 14: {1, 8, 11}

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars based on the neighbor sets:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [C(4,3) = 4]
- Node 2: [C(4,3) = 4]
- Node 3: [C(5,3) = 10]
- Node 4: [0]
- Node 5: [C(4,3) = 4]
- Node 6: [C(5,3) = 10]
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 8: [0]
- Node 9: [0]
- Node 10: [C(5,3) = 10]
- Node 11: [C(5,3) = 10]
- Node 12: [0]
- Node 13: [0]
- Node 14: [0]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [54]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (2, 3, 12)>
<1, (2, 3, 14)>
<1, (2, 12, 14)>
<1, (3, 12, 14)>
<2, (1, 3, 11)>
<2, (1, 6, 11)>
<2, (3, 6, 11)>
<2, (3, 11, 14)>
<3, (1, 2, 12)>
<3, (1, 12, 14)>
<3, (2, 12, 14)>
<5, (4, 7, 10)>
<6, (2, 7, 13)>
<6, (3, 10, 13)>
<6, (7, 10, 13)>
<7, (3, 5, 10)>
<10, (3, 5, 13)>
<10, (3, 6, 13)>
<10, (5, 6, 13)>
<11, (0, 6, 14)>
