Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 16) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 1) (6, 14) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 12) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 0) (18, 7) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (5, 0) (5, 10) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 4) (8, 14) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 7) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 16) (16, 15) (16, 0) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 2) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 10) (11, 19) (11, 4) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 18, 1, 5, 16.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 17, 10, 13, 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 15, 18, 12, 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 17, 13, 12.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 19, 11.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 10.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 14, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 15, 18, 10.
- Node 8 is connected to node 14.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 0, 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 19, 4.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 3, 14, 9, 2.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 1.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 12.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 2, 16.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 15, 0.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 3, 1.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 2, 19, 0, 7.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 18, 11, 4.

Now we will check each node that has 3 or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 0.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 1.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 2.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 3.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 4.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 7.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 9.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 10.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 12.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 14.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 15.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 17.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 18.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 19.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed from the above calculations:
\[ 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 39 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 10>, <0, 1, 16>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 10, 7>, <0, 16, 15>, <1, 13, 3>, <2, 12, 3>, <2, 12, 14>, <3, 12, 14>, <7, 10, 5>, <12, 14, 9>, <15, 16, 0>, <18, 11, 19>, <18, 2, 4>, <18, 7, 10>, <18, 7, 9>, <19, 11, 4>
