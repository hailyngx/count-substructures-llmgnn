Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 5) (7, 11) (7, 19) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 15) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 17) (5, 14) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 9) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 9) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 6) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 14) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 15) (15, 2) (15, 14) (18, 13) (18, 10) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 0) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 16) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {16, 19}
Node 1: {9, 10, 19}
Node 2: {3, 8, 15}
Node 3: {2, 9, 11, 12}
Node 4: {6, 12, 16}
Node 5: {10, 13, 14, 17}
Node 6: {4, 8, 14}
Node 7: {11, 19}
Node 8: {2, 6, 13}
Node 9: {1, 3, 12, 13, 16}
Node 10: {1, 5, 17, 18}
Node 11: {3, 7}
Node 12: {3, 4, 9}
Node 13: {5, 8, 9, 18}
Node 14: {5, 6, 15}
Node 15: {2, 14}
Node 16: {0, 4, 9}
Node 17: {5, 10}
Node 18: {10, 13}
Node 19: {0, 1, 7}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars formed by each such node. 

For Node 1, there is 1 unique 3-star: <1, 9, 19>.
For Node 3, there is 1 unique 3-star: <3, 9, 12>.
For Node 5, there is 1 unique 3-star: <5, 10, 17>.
For Node 9, there are 5 unique 3-stars: <9, 1, 3>, <9, 3, 12>, <9, 3, 13>, <9, 12, 13>, <9, 13, 16>.
For Node 10, there is 1 unique 3-star: <10, 5, 17>.
For Node 12, there is 1 unique 3-star: <12, 3, 9>.
For Node 13, there is 1 unique 3-star: <13, 9, 18>.
For Node 14, there is 1 unique 3-star: <14, 5, 15>.

Summing up the total number of unique 3-stars, we get [11].
