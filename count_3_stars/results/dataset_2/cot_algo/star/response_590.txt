Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (18, 10) (18, 15) (19, 13) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 18) (3, 0) (17, 4) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 16) (8, 5) (8, 11) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 6) (2, 17) (2, 13) (9, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 16) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 6) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 15) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 13) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 11) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 10, 3, 11
Node 1 neighbors: 4, 12, 5, 16
Node 2 neighbors: 17, 13
Node 3 neighbors: 0
Node 4 neighbors: 7, 10, 14, 1, 17
Node 5 neighbors: 7, 8, 1, 16
Node 6 neighbors: 12, 16, 11
Node 7 neighbors: 4, 12, 5
Node 8 neighbors: 5, 11
Node 9 neighbors: 13
Node 10 neighbors: 0, 18, 4
Node 11 neighbors: 0, 8, 6
Node 12 neighbors: 7, 17, 6, 1
Node 13 neighbors: 14, 19, 2, 9, 15
Node 14 neighbors: 4, 15, 13
Node 15 neighbors: 14, 18, 13
Node 16 neighbors: 17, 5, 6, 1
Node 17 neighbors: 4, 12, 16, 2
Node 18 neighbors: 10, 15
Node 19 neighbors: 13

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <4, (7, 10, 14)>, <4, (7, 10, 1)>, <4, (7, 10, 17)>, <4, (7, 14, 1)>, <4, (7, 14, 17)>, <4, (7, 1, 17)>, <4, (10, 14, 1)>, <4, (10, 14, 17)>, <4, (10, 1, 17)>, <4, (14, 1, 17)>.
Node 5 can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 can form 1 3-star.
Node 10 can form 1 3-star.
Node 12 can form 1 3-star.
Node 13 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <13, (14, 19, 2)>, <13, (14, 19, 9)>, <13, (14, 19, 15)>, <13, (14, 2, 9)>, <13, (14, 2, 15)>, <13, (14, 9, 15)>, <13, (19, 2, 9)>, <13, (19, 2, 15)>, <13, (19, 9, 15)>, <13, (2, 9, 15)>.
Node 15 can form 1 3-star.
Node 16 can form 1 3-star.
Node 17 can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 26

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [26].
