Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 25) (13, 12) (13, 29) (22, 27) (22, 0) (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 16) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 26) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (14, 4) (14, 10) (17, 20) (17, 11) (4, 14) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 16) (2, 0) (29, 13) (29, 23) (29, 18) (1, 16) (1, 28) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 27) (27, 22) (27, 12) (27, 18) (18, 4) (18, 29) (18, 27) (18, 19) (18, 23) (24, 6) (26, 6) (26, 11) (21, 3) (21, 8) (20, 17) (20, 5) (5, 20) (5, 19) (5, 23) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 25) (19, 0) (25, 13) (25, 7) (25, 19) (25, 0) (23, 29) (23, 18) (23, 5) (23, 28) (8, 7) (8, 21) (8, 11) (0, 22) (0, 2) (0, 19) (0, 25) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 1) (28, 1) (28, 23) (10, 14) (10, 4) (11, 15) (11, 17) (11, 26) (11, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 19, 22, 25}
- Node 1: {16, 28}
- Node 2: {0, 9, 16}
- Node 3: {12, 15, 21}
- Node 4: {7, 10, 14, 18}
- Node 5: {19, 20, 23}
- Node 6: {9, 15, 24, 26}
- Node 7: {4, 8, 9, 25}
- Node 8: {7, 11, 21}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 10: {4, 14}
- Node 11: {8, 15, 17, 26}
- Node 12: {3, 13, 27}
- Node 13: {12, 25, 29}
- Node 14: {4, 10}
- Node 15: {3, 6, 11, 16}
- Node 16: {1, 2, 15}
- Node 17: {11, 20}
- Node 18: {4, 19, 23, 27, 29}
- Node 19: {0, 5, 18, 25}
- Node 20: {5, 17}
- Node 21: {3, 8}
- Node 22: {0, 27}
- Node 23: {5, 18, 28, 29}
- Node 24: {6}
- Node 25: {0, 7, 13, 19}
- Node 26: {6, 11}
- Node 27: {12, 18, 22}
- Node 28: {1, 23}
- Node 29: {13, 18, 23}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 39 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [39], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (2, 19, 25)>
<5, (17, 20, 23)>
<6, (15, 11, 26)>
<7, (8, 9, 25)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
<11, (8, 15, 17)>
<12, (3, 13, 27)>
<18, (23, 5, 29)>
<19, (0, 18, 25)>
<23, (5, 18, 28)>
<25, (7, 13, 19)>
<27, (12, 18, 22)>
<29, (18, 23, 13)>
