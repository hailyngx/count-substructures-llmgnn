Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 12) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 11) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: [3, 5, 7, 10]
- Node 1: [3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13]
- Node 2: [9, 10, 13]
- Node 3: [0, 1, 6, 7, 8]
- Node 4: [1, 9, 12, 14]
- Node 5: [0, 7, 12, 14]
- Node 6: [1, 3, 10, 14]
- Node 7: [0, 1, 3, 5, 14]
- Node 8: [3, 9, 12]
- Node 9: [1, 2, 4, 8]
- Node 10: [0, 2, 6, 12]
- Node 11: [12, 13]
- Node 12: [4, 5, 8, 10, 11]
- Node 13: [1, 2, 11]
- Node 14: [4, 5, 6, 7]

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with Node 1 as the center.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 3 as the center.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 4 as the center.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 5 as the center.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 7 as the center.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 9 as the center.
Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 12 as the center.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with Node 13 as the center.
Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 14 as the center.

Summing these up, we have \([20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4] = [63]\).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <1, (3, 7, 4)>
- <1, (3, 7, 5)>
- <1, (3, 9, 4)>
- <1, (3, 9, 7)>
- <1, (3, 7, 14)>
- <1, (3, 6, 14)>
- <1, (3, 7, 0)>
- <1, (4, 9, 14)>
- <3, (0, 8, 1)>
- <3, (0, 5, 1)>
- <4, (9, 8, 12)>
- <5, (0, 12, 14)>
- <7, (0, 5, 14)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 12)>

- <14, (6, 7, 4)>
