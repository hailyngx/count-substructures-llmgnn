Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 10) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 1) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 3) (13, 4) (13, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edge list. Then we will identify the nodes that can form a 3-star and count the total number of unique 3-stars. 

Let's start by finding the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {7, 11}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 8, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {7, 10, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {4, 6, 10}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {5, 6, 10}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8, 10}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {2, 4}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {1, 2, 10, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 8}, total 1 3-star.
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {10, 12, 14}, total 1 3-star.
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {11, 12, 13}, total 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [3].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (10, 12, 14)>, <4, (11, 12, 13)>
