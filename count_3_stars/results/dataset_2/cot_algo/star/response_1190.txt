Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 9) (14, 12) (17, 1) (17, 8) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 13) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 7) (13, 8) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 1) (5, 19) (5, 3) (6, 16) (6, 11) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 11) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 9) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 11) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 12) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 18) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 19) (11, 18) (15, 4) (15, 12) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 15) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: 2, 3
- Node 1: 9, 10, 17
- Node 2: 0, 4, 11
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7
- Node 4: 2, 7, 15, 16
- Node 5: 3, 19
- Node 6: 11, 16
- Node 7: 3, 4, 13, 16, 19
- Node 8: 10, 13, 17
- Node 9: 1, 14, 18
- Node 10: 1, 8, 18
- Node 11: 2, 6, 18, 19
- Node 12: 14, 15, 18
- Node 13: 7, 8
- Node 15: 4, 12
- Node 16: 4, 6, 7
- Node 17: 1, 8
- Node 18: 9, 10, 11, 12, 19
- Node 19: 5, 7, 11, 18

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 does not form a 3-star
- Node 3 does not form a 3-star
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star
- Node 13 does not form a 3-star
- Node 15 does not form a 3-star
- Node 16 does not form a 3-star
- Node 17 does not form a 3-star
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars formed is 9. 

Therefore, the final answer is [9], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 9, 18>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 7, 15>
<7, 8, 17>
<9, 1, 14>
<10, 1, 8>
<11, 2, 6>
<12, 14, 15>
<18, 9, 19>
