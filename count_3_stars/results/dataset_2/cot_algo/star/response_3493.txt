Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 10) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 6) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 5) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 12) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 8, 11, 14, 7
- Node 1: 3, 6, 2, 0
- Node 2: 1, 13, 14, 6, 5
- Node 3: 1, 7, 6, 9
- Node 4: 8, 10
- Node 5: 10, 14, 7, 2, 12
- Node 6: 1, 3, 14, 7, 2
- Node 7: 3, 0, 14, 6, 5
- Node 8: 13, 4, 11, 0
- Node 9: 3, 10
- Node 10: 12, 4, 9, 5
- Node 11: 8, 0, 12
- Node 12: 13, 10, 11, 5
- Node 13: 8, 12, 2
- Node 14: 0, 6, 7, 2, 5

Node 0, 2, 5, 8, 13, and 14 have 5 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is **[45]**.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 11, 14)>
- <0, (1, 7, 14)>
- <0, (8, 11, 14)>
- <0, (8, 7, 14)>
- <0, (11, 7, 14)>
- <2, (1, 6, 14)>
- <2, (1, 7, 14)>
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <2, (6, 7, 14)>
- <2, (6, 7, 5)>
- <5, (10, 12, 14)>
- <5, (10, 7, 14)>
- <5, (10, 7, 5)>
- <5, (12, 7, 14)>
- <5, (12, 7, 5)>
- <8, (4, 11, 0)>
- <8, (4, 11, 12)>
- <8, (4, 0, 14)>
- <8, (11, 0, 14)>
- <13, (12, 2, 14)>
