Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 24) (2, 28) (29, 5) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 10) (25, 1) (25, 0) (25, 18) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 6) (0, 25) (0, 28) (20, 22) (20, 23) (28, 2) (28, 0) (28, 7) (19, 26) (19, 22) (19, 12) (26, 19) (22, 20) (22, 19) (22, 4) (6, 13) (6, 21) (6, 14) (21, 6) (21, 14) (21, 24) (4, 13) (4, 22) (4, 27) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 17) (27, 5) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 16) (17, 3) (17, 13) (17, 27) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 18) (7, 3) (7, 28) (7, 18) (7, 1) (5, 29) (5, 27) (5, 23) (5, 12) (23, 20) (23, 5) (23, 15) (14, 6) (14, 21) (14, 27) (1, 25) (1, 7) (1, 24) (15, 9) (15, 23) (15, 11) (15, 12) (15, 24) (10, 3) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 11) (24, 2) (24, 21) (24, 1) (24, 15) (11, 8) (11, 15) (11, 12) (18, 25) (18, 16) (18, 7) 

Response:
Since the graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges, we can start by looking at the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {25, 28}
- Node 1: {25, 7, 24}
- Node 2: {24, 28}
- Node 3: {7, 17, 10}
- Node 4: {13, 22, 27}
- Node 5: {29, 27, 23, 12}
- Node 6: {13, 21, 14}
- Node 7: {3, 28, 18, 1}
- Node 8: {13, 9, 16, 11}
- Node 9: {8, 15, 16}
- Node 10: {3}
- Node 11: {8, 15, 12}
- Node 12: {19, 5, 15, 11}
- Node 13: {8, 17, 4, 6}
- Node 14: {6, 21, 27}
- Node 15: {9, 23, 11, 12, 24}
- Node 16: {8, 9, 18}
- Node 17: {3, 13, 27}
- Node 18: {25, 16, 7}
- Node 19: {22, 26, 12}
- Node 20: {22, 23}
- Node 21: {6, 14, 24}
- Node 22: {20, 19, 4}
- Node 23: {20, 5, 15}
- Node 24: {2, 21, 1, 15}
- Node 25: {0, 1, 18}
- Node 26: {19}
- Node 27: {4, 14, 17, 5}
- Node 28: {2, 0, 7}

Nodes with three or more neighbors where 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 24: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<1, 25, 7>
<5, 12, 23>
<7, 1, 28>
<8, 11, 15>
<8, 13, 6>
<13, 17, 27>
<15, 11, 12>
<16, 9, 18>
<17, 3, 27>
