Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 14) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 20) (10, 19) (10, 24) (10, 5) (19, 10) (19, 29) (19, 1) (26, 13) (26, 17) (13, 16) (13, 26) (13, 21) (8, 16) (8, 17) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 28) (9, 12) (23, 11) (23, 7) (21, 13) (21, 4) (21, 22) (4, 9) (4, 21) (4, 25) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 6) (1, 19) (1, 6) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 20) (28, 9) (28, 3) (28, 15) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 24) (7, 23) (7, 3) (7, 27) (7, 17) (5, 10) (5, 22) (5, 15) (5, 0) (0, 5) (20, 16) (20, 3) (20, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 20) (2, 25) (2, 15) (29, 19) (15, 28) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 22) (22, 21) (22, 5) (22, 15) (27, 7) (25, 4) (25, 2) (25, 18) (17, 26) (17, 8) (17, 7) (17, 24) (17, 18) (24, 10) (24, 14) (24, 17) (18, 12) (18, 25) (18, 17) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {6, 19}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 9, 15, 20, 25}
- Node 3: {7, 20, 28}
- Node 4: {9, 21, 25}
- Node 5: {0, 10, 15, 22}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 12}
- Node 7: {3, 17, 23, 27}
- Node 8: {13, 16, 17}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 12, 28}
- Node 10: {5, 19, 24}
- Node 11: {14, 16, 23}
- Node 12: {6, 9, 18}
- Node 13: {8, 16, 21, 26}
- Node 14: {11, 16, 24}
- Node 15: {2, 5, 15, 22, 28}
- Node 16: {8, 11, 14, 20, 13}
- Node 17: {7, 8, 17, 18, 24}
- Node 18: {12, 17, 25}
- Node 19: {1, 10, 29}
- Node 20: {2, 3, 16}
- Node 21: {4, 13, 22}
- Node 22: {5, 15, 21}
- Node 23: {7, 11}
- Node 24: {10, 14, 17}
- Node 25: {2, 4, 18}
- Node 26: {13, 17}
- Node 27: {7}
- Node 28: {3, 9, 15}
- Node 29: {19}

Now, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, Node 7, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 19, Node 21, Node 24, Node 25, Node 28

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{2}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 85 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [85].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (6, 19, 29)>
- <2, (5, 15, 22)>
- <5, (0, 15, 22)>
- <7, (3, 17, 23)>
- <9, (2, 4, 28)>
- <10, (5, 15, 24)>
- <11, (16, 14, 23)>
- <12, (6, 9, 18)>
- <15, (2, 5, 28)>
- <16, (8, 14, 20)>
- <17, (8, 18, 24)>
- <19, (1, 10, 29)>
- <21, (4, 13, 22)>
- <24, (10, 14, 17)>
- <25, (2, 4, 18)>
- <28, (3, 9, 15)>
