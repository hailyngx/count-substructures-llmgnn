Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 13) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's build the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {9, 10, 4, 2, 14}
- Node 2: {6, 1}
- Node 3: {6, 11, 5}
- Node 4: {9, 10, 1, 5}
- Node 5: {7, 3, 8, 4, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 3, 2, 0, 13}
- Node 7: {9, 13, 5}
- Node 8: {10, 11, 5, 14}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 1, 7}
- Node 10: {11, 8, 1, 4}
- Node 11: {10, 3, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {11, 13, 0, 1}
- Node 13: {6, 7, 12, 0, 14}
- Node 14: {8, 5, 1, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 5 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the final answer is [52].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (9, 10, 4)>, <4, (9, 10, 1)>, <5, (3, 8, 14)>, <6, (3, 2, 0)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>, <10, (8, 11, 4)>, <13, (7, 12, 0)>, <14, (8, 5, 1)>
