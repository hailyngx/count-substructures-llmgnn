Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 13) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 11) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 1) (14, 4) (14, 9) (14, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 14) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's start by determining the neighbors of each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {12, 2, 8, 10, 1}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {9, 2, 10, 14, 0}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {7, 8, 0, 1, 10}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {7, 6, 11}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {12, 14, 6}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {7, 6, 13, 8, 11}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {4, 5, 3, 13, 7} 
8. Node 7: Neighbors {12, 3, 2, 5}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {9, 5, 2, 10, 0}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {8, 11, 14, 1}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {2, 8, 0, 1}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {9, 5, 3, 13}
13. Node 13: Neighbors {6, 5, 11}
14. Node 14: Neighbors {4, 9, 1}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

1. Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: Nodes 3 and 4
2. Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: Nodes 6 and 5

For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:

- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (7, 6, 11)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (12, 14, 6)>

For nodes with more than 3 neighbors:

- Node 6 can form  15 3-stars: 
  <6, (4, 5, 7)><6, (4, 5, 13)><6, (4, 7, 13)><6, (4, 3, 7)><6, (4, 3, 11)><6, (4, 11, 13)><6, (5, 7, 13)><6, (5, 8, 11)><6, (7, 5, 8)><6, (7, 8, 2)><6, (7, 2, 10)><6, (7, 10, 0)><6, (11, 3, 13)><6, (5, 13, 11)><6, (7, 13, 5)>
- Node 5 can form  23 3-stars: 
  <5, (7, 8, 9)><5, (7, 8, 2)><5, (7, 8, 10)><5, (7, 2, 8)><5, (7, 2, 10)><5, (7, 2, 0)><5, (7, 10, 0)><5, (6, 8, 9)><5, (6, 8, 2)><5, (6, 8, 10)><5, (6, 8, 0)><5, (6, 8, 11)><5, (6, 2, 8)><5, (6, 2, 10)><5, (6, 2, 0)><5, (6, 2, 1)><5, (6, 10, 0)><5, (6, 10, 1)><5, (6, 13, 11)><5, (8, 10, 0)><5, (8, 0, 10)><5, (8, 0, 1)><5, (11, 13, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 4) + 15 (from node 6) + 23 (from node 5) = 40

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [40].
