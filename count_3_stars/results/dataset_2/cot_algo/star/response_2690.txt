Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 8, and Node 9 have 6 neighbors each.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
- For Node 2: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
- For Node 8: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
- For Node 9: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 80 \).

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us the answer: [80].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 8, 9>
- <2, 3, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 7, 8>
- <0, 1, 6, 8>
