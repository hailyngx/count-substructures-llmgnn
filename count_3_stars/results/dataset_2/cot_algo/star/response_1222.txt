Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 26) (15, 25) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 12) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 24) (22, 1) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 29) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 7) (20, 23) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 29) (4, 18) (17, 20) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 24) (29, 0) (29, 6) (29, 17) (26, 15) (26, 14) (26, 21) (11, 3) (11, 28) (11, 25) (28, 22) (28, 11) (28, 9) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 20) (23, 20) (23, 2) (10, 8) (10, 21) (10, 2) (10, 9) (21, 26) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 14) (14, 5) (14, 26) (14, 21) (14, 1) (25, 15) (25, 17) (25, 11) (24, 22) (24, 17) (24, 2) (12, 18) (12, 21) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 12) (9, 0) (9, 28) (9, 19) (9, 10) (1, 22) (1, 14) (2, 3) (2, 23) (2, 10) (2, 24) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {20, 7, 9, 29}
- Node 1: {22, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 23, 10, 24}
- Node 3: {15, 11, 16, 2, 5}
- Node 4: {18}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 19, 14}
- Node 6: {5, 29}
- Node 7: {8, 0, 20}
- Node 8: {10, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 28, 19, 10}
- Node 10: {8, 21, 2, 9}
- Node 11: {3, 28, 25}
- Node 12: {18, 21, 16}
- Node 14: {5, 26, 21, 1}
- Node 15: {3, 19, 25, 26}
- Node 16: {3, 12}
- Node 17: {20, 29, 25, 24}
- Node 18: {22, 4, 12}
- Node 19: {15, 5, 9}
- Node 20: {0, 17, 7, 23}
- Node 21: {26, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 22: {18, 28, 24, 1}
- Node 23: {20, 2}
- Node 24: {22, 17, 2}
- Node 25: {15, 17, 11}
- Node 26: {15, 21, 14, 1}
- Node 28: {22, 11, 9}
- Node 29: {0, 6, 17}

Next, let's identify nodes that have at least 3 neighbors: Nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, and 26.

For these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars each one participates in.
Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (forming 1 3-star):
- Node 16: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)

Nodes with more than 3 neighbors (forming multiple 3-stars):
- Node 0: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 2: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 3: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 5: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 7: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 10: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 11: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 12: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 14: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 15: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 17: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 18: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 20: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 21: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 22: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 24: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 25: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 26: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from Node 16) + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 59

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [59].

The unique 3-stars found are:
