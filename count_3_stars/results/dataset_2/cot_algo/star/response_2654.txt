Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 21) (15, 2) (27, 4) (27, 11) (14, 17) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 21) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 10) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 10) (22, 23) (22, 29) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 6) (23, 12) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 6) (7, 6) (12, 14) (12, 23) (12, 16) (12, 1) (4, 27) (4, 19) (18, 5) (18, 8) (13, 26) (13, 21) (26, 13) (26, 2) (26, 11) (26, 8) (1, 15) (1, 12) (1, 29) (3, 21) (3, 16) (21, 15) (21, 17) (21, 13) (21, 3) (21, 24) (6, 23) (6, 0) (6, 7) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 3) (29, 22) (29, 0) (29, 1) (5, 23) (5, 18) (5, 11) (28, 0) (8, 20) (8, 22) (8, 18) (8, 26) (2, 15) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 11) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 9) (24, 21) (9, 17) (9, 25) (9, 19) (9, 11) (11, 27) (11, 26) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) (10, 20) (10, 25) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbor nodes for each of the 30 nodes based on the given edges. 

Node 0: {20, 28, 29, 6}
Node 1: {15, 12, 29}
Node 2: {15, 26, 19, 11}
Node 3: {21, 16}
Node 4: {27, 19}
Node 5: {23, 18, 11}
Node 6: {23, 0, 7}
Node 7: {6}
Node 8: {20, 22, 18, 26}
Node 9: {17, 25, 19, 11}
Node 10: {20, 25}
Node 11: {27, 26, 5, 2, 9}
Node 12: {14, 23, 16, 1}
Node 13: {26, 21}
Node 14: {17, 12}
Node 15: {1, 21, 2}
Node 16: {17, 12, 3}
Node 17: {14, 25, 16, 9, 21}
Node 18: {5, 8}
Node 19: {4, 2, 9}
Node 20: {0, 8, 10}
Node 21: {15, 17, 13, 3, 24}
Node 22: {23, 29, 8}
Node 23: {22, 5, 6, 12}
Node 24: {21}
Node 25: {17, 9, 10}
Node 26: {13, 2, 11, 8}
Node 27: {4, 11}
Node 28: {0}
Node 29: {22, 0, 1}

Based on these neighbor sets, we can see that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 17, 21, 23, 25, 26, and 29. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 59 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [59]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (20, 28, 29)>
<1, (15, 12, 29)>
<2, (15, 26, 19)>
<5, (23, 18, 11)>
<6, (23, 0, 7)>
<8, (20, 22, 18)>
<9, (17, 25, 19)>
<11, (27, 26, 5)>
<12, (14, 23, 16)>
<17, (14, 12, 16)>
<21, (15, 17, 13)>
<23, (22, 5, 6)>
<25, (17, 9, 10)>
<26, (13, 2, 11)>
<29, (22, 0, 1)>
