Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
