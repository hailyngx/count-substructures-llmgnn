Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 10) (21, 1) (21, 0) (21, 5) (14, 4) (14, 29) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 9) (7, 23) (7, 8) (0, 21) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 6) (27, 19) (27, 13) (2, 18) (2, 3) (2, 28) (18, 0) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 6) (26, 24) (26, 12) (26, 4) (4, 14) (4, 26) (15, 19) (15, 25) (15, 12) (20, 8) (20, 23) (22, 5) (22, 24) (22, 25) (24, 26) (24, 22) (24, 13) (24, 19) (11, 0) (23, 7) (23, 20) (23, 19) (10, 1) (10, 16) (13, 17) (13, 27) (13, 24) (25, 15) (25, 22) (25, 5) (25, 28) (8, 7) (8, 20) (8, 28) (8, 29) (28, 2) (28, 25) (28, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 12) (19, 27) (19, 15) (19, 24) (19, 23) (5, 21) (5, 18) (5, 22) (5, 25) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 29) (9, 17) (9, 12) (6, 0) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 12) (29, 14) (29, 8) (29, 16) (12, 26) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {1, 11, 18, 6, 21}
Node 1: {21, 10, 0}
Node 2: {18, 3, 28}
Node 3: {2, 6, 12}
Node 4: {14, 26}
Node 5: {21, 18, 22, 25}
Node 6: {0, 18, 3, 12}
Node 7: {23, 8}
Node 8: {7, 20, 28, 29}
Node 9: {17, 12}
Node 10: {1, 16}
Node 11: {0}
Node 12: {26, 15, 3, 9, 6}
Node 13: {17, 27, 24}
Node 14: {4, 29}
Node 15: {19, 25, 12}
Node 16: {17, 10, 29}
Node 17: {13, 16, 9}
Node 18: {0, 2, 5, 6}
Node 19: {27, 15, 24, 23}
Node 20: {8, 23}
Node 21: {1, 0, 5}
Node 22: {5, 24, 25}
Node 23: {7, 20, 19}
Node 24: {26, 22, 13, 19}
Node 25: {15, 22, 5, 28}
Node 26: {24, 12, 4}
Node 27: {19, 13}
Node 28: {2, 25, 8}
Node 29: {14, 8, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 27: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 45
Therefore, the final answer is [45].
