Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 10) (2, 19) (2, 9) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 18) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 9) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 19) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 3) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 18) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 15) (0, 12) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 13) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 15) (10, 7) (10, 19) 

Response:
The given graph consists of 20 nodes and 60 edges. 

Let's first identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 1 neighbors: {7}
- Node 2 neighbors: {19, 9}
- Node 3 neighbors: {14, 13, 5}
- Node 4 neighbors: {7, 9, 13, 11}
- Node 5 neighbors: {8, 3}
- Node 6 neighbors: {14}
- Node 7 neighbors: {4, 10, 14, 13, 1}
- Node 8 neighbors: {19, 5}
- Node 9 neighbors: {4, 2, 16, 15}
- Node 10 neighbors: {7, 19}
- Node 11 neighbors: {4, 17, 19}
- Node 12 neighbors: {16, 0, 18}
- Node 13 neighbors: {4, 7, 3, 15}
- Node 14 neighbors: {7, 19, 3, 6, 18}
- Node 15 neighbors: {17, 9, 13}
- Node 16 neighbors: {17, 12, 18, 9}
- Node 17 neighbors: {16, 15, 11}
- Node 18 neighbors: {12, 16, 14}
- Node 19 neighbors: {8, 11, 14, 10, 2}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (7, 9, 13)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (4, 10, 14)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (4, 2, 16)>
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star: <11, (4, 17, 19)>
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star: <13, (4, 7, 15)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star: <14, (7, 19, 3)>
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star: <19, (8, 11, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
