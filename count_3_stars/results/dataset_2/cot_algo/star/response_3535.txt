Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 19) (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 7) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 16) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 11) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 18) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 14) (15, 1) (15, 17) (15, 12) (10, 16) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 19) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 16) (12, 15) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 12) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 19) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {6}
- Node 1: {15, 18}
- Node 2: {3, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 7}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 19}
- Node 5: {7, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 11}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 11, 19}
- Node 8: {14, 16, 19}
- Node 9: {13, 14}
- Node 10: {16}
- Node 11: {6, 7, 18}
- Node 12: {14, 15}
- Node 13: {5, 9, 14, 17}
- Node 14: {8, 9, 12, 13, 18}
- Node 15: {1, 12, 17}
- Node 16: {8, 10, 17, 19}
- Node 17: {13, 15, 16, 19}
- Node 18: {1, 11, 14}
- Node 19: {4, 7, 8, 16, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors

Next, calculate the number of 3-stars for each of the above nodes:

- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 50

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<4, 6, 11>
<6, 4, 7>
<6, 4, 19>
<6, 11, 7>
<6, 11, 18>
<7, 4, 19>
<7, 11, 6>
<7, 11, 18>
<7, 11, 19>
<7, 19, 4>
<7, 19, 16>
<8, 14, 16>
<13, 5, 7>
<13, 5, 9>
<13, 5, 17>
<13, 14, 17>
<14, 9, 13>
<14, 9, 12>
<14, 12, 15>
<16, 8, 19>
