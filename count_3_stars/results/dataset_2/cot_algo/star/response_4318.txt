Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {9, 1}
- Node 1 neighbors: {5, 6, 3, 0, 8}
- Node 2 neighbors: {5, 6, 3}
- Node 3 neighbors: {9, 6, 1, 7, 2, 4}
- Node 4 neighbors: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 5 neighbors: {2, 8, 1, 7}
- Node 6 neighbors: {1, 7, 3, 2}
- Node 7 neighbors: {5, 6, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 8 neighbors: {5, 9, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 9 neighbors: {8, 3, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from the nodes above: 
\[ 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 58 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>
