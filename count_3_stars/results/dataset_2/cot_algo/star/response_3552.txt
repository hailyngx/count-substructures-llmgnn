Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 20) (3, 4) (25, 6) (25, 24) (12, 4) (12, 11) (27, 14) (27, 5) (2, 24) (2, 14) (2, 21) (18, 11) (26, 1) (26, 15) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 0) (6, 1) (6, 25) (6, 28) (28, 6) (28, 7) (28, 4) (28, 10) (17, 29) (17, 0) (17, 7) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 8) (29, 13) (0, 26) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 28) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 22) (5, 27) (5, 23) (5, 21) (5, 10) (19, 29) (19, 24) (10, 28) (10, 5) (10, 15) (10, 13) (15, 26) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 23) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 28) (4, 0) (23, 5) (23, 15) (20, 1) (20, 26) (20, 16) (8, 29) (8, 21) (24, 25) (24, 2) (24, 19) (16, 20) (16, 22) (16, 14) (22, 7) (22, 16) (14, 27) (14, 2) (14, 16) (14, 13) (14, 21) (13, 29) (13, 10) (13, 14) (11, 12) (11, 18) (11, 26) (21, 2) (21, 5) (21, 8) (21, 14) 

Response:
The given graph has the following neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4, 7, 17, 26
- Node 1: 6, 20, 26
- Node 2: 14, 21, 24
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 0, 12, 28, 3
- Node 5: 10, 21, 23, 27
- Node 6: 1, 25, 28
- Node 7: 0, 15, 17, 28, 22
- Node 8: 21, 29
- Node 10: 5, 13, 15, 28
- Node 11: 12, 18, 26
- Node 12: 4, 11
- Node 13: 10, 14, 29
- Node 14: 2, 13, 16, 21, 27
- Node 15: 7, 10, 23, 26
- Node 16: 14, 22, 20
- Node 17: 0, 7, 29
- Node 18: 11
- Node 19: 24, 29
- Node 20: 1, 16, 26
- Node 21: 2, 5, 8, 14
- Node 22: 7, 16
- Node 23: 5, 15
- Node 24: 2, 19, 25
- Node 25: 6, 24, 26
- Node 26: 0, 1, 11, 15, 20, 25
- Node 27: 5, 14
- Node 28: 4, 6, 7, 10
- Node 29: 8, 13, 17, 19

We can now count the number of 3-stars in the graph. We first identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 1: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 2: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 4: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 5: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 6: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 7: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 10: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 11: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 14: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 15: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 16: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 21: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 24: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 25: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 26: [6 choose 3] = 20
- Node 28: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 29: [4 choose 3] = 4

Summing up the counts for all nodes with 3 or more neighbors gives us a total of 77 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [77], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 7, 17>, <0, 4, 17, 26>, <0, 7, 17, 28>, <0, 7, 4, 28>, <1, 6, 20, 26>, 
<4, 0, 7, 28>, <5, 10, 21, 27>, <7, 0, 17, 28>, <7, 10, 15, 28>, <7, 17, 0, 28>, 
<7, 17, 29, 29>, <10, 13, 14, 29>, <14, 2, 13, 21>, <14, 2, 21, 5>, <14, 13, 29, 27>, 
<15, 7, 23, 26>, <21, 14, 16, 27>, <21, 2, 5, 8>, <24, 19, 25, 29>, <24, 2, 19, 25>, 
<24, 2, 19, 29>, <25, 24, 26, 29>, <26, 11, 15, 20>, <26, 11, 15, 7>, <26, 11, 20, 25>, 
<26, 15, 23, 7>, <26, 20, 1, 16>, <26, 20, 16, 22>, <26, 20, 24, 25>, <28, 4, 7, 10>, 
<28, 4, 6, 7>, <29, 13, 17, 29>
