Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 27) (11, 20) (16, 22) (16, 9) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 4) (27, 11) (27, 25) (27, 19) (9, 16) (9, 26) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 7) (1, 15) (1, 3) (1, 28) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (10, 11) (10, 3) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 28) (23, 15) (23, 8) (23, 0) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 21) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 21) (2, 4) (22, 16) (22, 24) (24, 26) (24, 22) (24, 14) (20, 11) (21, 17) (21, 2) (21, 12) (21, 25) (5, 3) (5, 29) (25, 27) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 12) (25, 28) (0, 23) (0, 29) (28, 1) (28, 8) (28, 25) (28, 4) (6, 17) (6, 25) (6, 29) (6, 18) (14, 24) (14, 18) (12, 21) (12, 25) (12, 18) (19, 27) (19, 17) (19, 2) (29, 5) (29, 0) (29, 6) (29, 4) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 7) (7, 26) (7, 18) (7, 13) (4, 15) (4, 2) (4, 28) (4, 29) (13, 3) (13, 7) 

Response:
The graph given has a total of 30 nodes and 90 edges. 

From the given edges, we can determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: {3, 4, 15, 23, 28}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 19, 21}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 4: {2, 15, 28, 29}
- Node 5: {3, 29}
- Node 6: {17, 18, 25, 29}
- Node 7: {13, 18, 26}
- Node 8: {2, 8, 15, 23, 28}
- Node 9: {16, 26}
- Node 10: {3, 11}
- Node 11: {10, 20, 27}
- Node 12: {18, 21, 25}
- Node 13: {3, 7}
- Node 14: {18, 24}
- Node 15: {1, 4, 23}
- Node 16: {9, 22}
- Node 17: {6, 19, 21}
- Node 18: {6, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 19: {2, 17, 27}
- Node 20: {11}
- Node 21: {2, 12, 17, 25}
- Node 22: {16, 24}
- Node 23: {0, 8, 15}
- Node 24: {14, 22, 26}
- Node 25: {6, 12, 21, 27, 28}
- Node 26: {7, 9, 24}
- Node 27: {11, 19, 25}
- Node 28: {1, 4, 8, 25}
- Node 29: {0, 4, 5, 6}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1 forms [<1, (3, 4, 15)>, <1, (3, 15, 23)>, <1, (3, 15, 28)>] = [3]
- Node 2 forms no 3-stars
- Node 3 forms [<3, (1, 4, 15)>, <3, (1, 15, 23)>, <3, (1, 15, 28)>] = [3]
- Node 4 forms [<4, (1, 15, 23)>, <4, (1, 15, 28)>, <4, (2, 15, 28)>] = [3]
- Node 5 forms no 3-stars
- Node 6 forms no 3-stars
- Node 7 forms no 3-stars
- Node 8 forms no 3-stars
- Node 9 forms no 3-stars
- Node 10 forms no 3-stars
- Node 11 forms no 3-stars
- Node 12 forms no 3-stars
- Node 13 forms no 3-stars
- Node 14 forms no 3-stars
- Node 15 forms no 3-stars
- Node 16 forms no 3-stars
- Node 17 forms no 3-stars
- Node 18 forms no 3-stars
- Node 19 forms no 3-stars
- Node 20 forms no 3-stars
- Node 21 forms no 3-stars
- Node 22 forms no 3-stars
- Node 23 forms no 3-stars
- Node 24 forms no 3-stars
- Node 25 forms [<25, (6, 12, 21)>, <25, (6, 12, 25)>, <25, (6, 21, 25)>, <25, (12, 21, 25)>] = [4]
- Node 26 forms no 3-stars
- Node 27 forms no 3-stars
- Node 28 forms no 3-stars
- Node 29 forms no 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives [3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4] = [16].
