Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 28) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 7) (8, 29) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 27) (13, 16) (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 18) (10, 11) (10, 29) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 27) (11, 5) (11, 4) (7, 26) (7, 12) (7, 20) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 18) (17, 29) (17, 6) (17, 0) (29, 8) (29, 10) (29, 17) (29, 23) (29, 14) (21, 13) (21, 28) (28, 9) (28, 21) (28, 25) (16, 13) (16, 22) (16, 27) (22, 26) (22, 16) (14, 29) (14, 20) (6, 17) (6, 24) (6, 19) (24, 6) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 25) (15, 23) (19, 6) (19, 3) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 3) (3, 19) (3, 0) (20, 26) (20, 7) (20, 14) (23, 10) (23, 29) (23, 15) (23, 2) (27, 8) (27, 11) (27, 16) (27, 2) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 1) (18, 13) (18, 12) (18, 5) (18, 1) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 18) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 23) (2, 27) (25, 28) (25, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {8, 17, 3}
- Node 1: {7, 4, 5, 18}
- Node 2: {13, 7, 23, 27}
- Node 3: {19, 0}
- Node 4: {11, 1, 25}
- Node 5: {11, 18, 1}
- Node 6: {17, 24, 19}
- Node 7: {26, 12, 20, 1, 2}
- Node 8: {29, 0, 12, 27}
- Node 9: {28}
- Node 10: {11, 29, 23}
- Node 11: {10, 27, 4, 5}
- Node 12: {8, 7, 18}
- Node 13: {16, 21, 2, 18}
- Node 14: {29, 20}
- Node 15: {23}
- Node 16: {13, 22, 27}
- Node 17: {29, 6, 0}
- Node 18: {13, 12, 5, 1}
- Node 19: {6, 3}
- Node 20: {26, 7, 14}
- Node 21: {13, 28}
- Node 22: {26, 16}
- Node 23: {10, 29, 15, 2}
- Node 24: {6}
- Node 25: {28, 4}
- Node 26: {22, 20, 7}
- Node 27: {8, 11, 16, 2}
- Node 28: {9, 21, 25}
- Node 29: {8, 10, 17, 23, 14}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 10: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 14: [inom{2}{3}] = [0]
- Node 16: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 17: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 18: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 20: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 23: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 25: [inom{2}{3}] = [0]
- Node 26: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 27: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 29: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1+4+4+1+1+1+10+4+1+4+1+4+0+1+1+4+1+0+1+4+10 = 47

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [47].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 17, 3)>, <1, (7, 4, 5)>, <1, (7, 4, 18)>, <1, (7, 5, 18)>, <1, (4, 5, 18)>, <2, (13, 7, 23)>, <2, (13, 7, 27)>, <2, (13, 23, 27)>, <2, (7, 23, 27)>, <4, (11, 1, 25)>, <5, (11, 18, 1)>, <6, (17, 6, 19)>, <7, (26, 12, 20)>, <7, (12, 18, 5)>, (10, (11, 27, 5)>, <13, (16, 21, 18)>, <29, (8, 10, 17)>, and <29, (8, 10, 23)>.
