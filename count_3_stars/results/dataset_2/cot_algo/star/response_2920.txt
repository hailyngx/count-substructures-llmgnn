Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 6) (27, 26) (27, 13) (14, 28) (14, 19) (14, 4) (17, 19) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 2) (20, 5) (9, 15) (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 13) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 8) (11, 24) (11, 21) (28, 14) (28, 24) (28, 10) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 20) (7, 0) (7, 26) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 23) (29, 9) (2, 20) (2, 12) (2, 6) (18, 3) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 24) (12, 2) (12, 21) (12, 26) (10, 28) (10, 26) (10, 8) (26, 27) (26, 7) (26, 12) (26, 10) (24, 11) (24, 28) (24, 19) (24, 13) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 23) (21, 11) (21, 12) (21, 5) (21, 4) (3, 0) (3, 18) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 14) (4, 22) (4, 21) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 20) (5, 21) (5, 8) (8, 22) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 5) (23, 1) (23, 16) (13, 27) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 24) (13, 16) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 3}
- Node 1: {15, 16, 13, 23}
- Node 2: {20, 12, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 18, 8, 4}
- Node 4: {14, 22, 21, 3, 6}
- Node 5: {20, 21, 8}
- Node 6: {15, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {20, 0, 26}
- Node 8: {22, 10, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {15, 22, 29, 13}
- Node 10: {28, 26, 8}
- Node 11: {24, 21}
- Node 12: {2, 21, 26}
- Node 13: {27, 9, 1, 24, 16}
- Node 14: {28, 19, 4}
- Node 15: {20, 1, 9, 6}
- Node 16: {1, 13, 23}
- Node 17: {19}
- Node 18: {3}
- Node 19: {14, 17, 24}
- Node 20: {15, 7, 2, 5}
- Node 21: {11, 12, 4, 5}
- Node 22: {9, 4, 8}
- Node 23: {1, 16}
- Node 24: {11, 28, 19, 13}
- Node 26: {27, 7, 12, 10}
- Node 27: {26, 13}
- Node 28: {14, 24, 10}
- Node 29: {9}

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 13, 16, and 23: <1, (13, 16, 23)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 6, 14, and 21: <4, (6, 14, 21)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 5, and 22: <8, (3, 5, 22)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 13, 15, and 22: <9, (13, 15, 22)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 16, and 24: <13, (1, 16, 24)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 6, 9, and 20: <15, (6, 9, 20)>
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 4, 11, and 12: <21, (4, 11, 12)>
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 13, 19, and 28: <24, (13, 19, 28)>
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 7, 10, and 12: <26, (7, 10, 12)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of 8. Therefore, the final answer is [8].
