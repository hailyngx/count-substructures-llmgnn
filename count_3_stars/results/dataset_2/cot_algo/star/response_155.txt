Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 0) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 9) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 10, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 12, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 9, 11}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 10}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 8, 13}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 3, 8, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 3, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbor 11

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
- From the neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 0, 6, 9, and 13 have 5 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes.
- Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 13: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 6>, 
<0, 1, 7>, 
<0, 1, 9>, 
<0, 2, 5>, 
<0, 2, 6>, 
<0, 2, 10>, 
<0, 2, 12>, 
<0, 5, 10>, 
<0, 6, 7>, 
<0, 6, 10>, 
<0, 6, 11>, 
<0, 8, 12>, 
<0, 8, 13>, 
<0, 9, 13>, 
<1, 5, 7>,

<1, 9, 13>, 
<2, 5, 11>,
