Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{inom}{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the numbers of 3-stars, we get \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 60 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <7, 8, 9>
- <9, 6, 7>
- <9, 6, 0>
- <9, 2, 4>
- <9, 2, 5>
