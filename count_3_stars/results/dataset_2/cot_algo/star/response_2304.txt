Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 6) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 19) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 9) (8, 19) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 17) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 12) (19, 6) (19, 15) (19, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 16) (16, 10) (16, 7) (16, 12) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 18) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 16) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 10, 2
- Node 1: 13, 0, 7
- Node 2: 14, 0
- Node 3: 17, 6, 12
- Node 4: 11, 9, 13
- Node 5: 6, 15, 7
- Node 6: 3, 18, 5, 7, 19
- Node 7: 1, 5, 6, 16
- Node 8: 19
- Node 9: 15, 4, 17
- Node 10: 11, 0, 16
- Node 11: 10, 14, 4
- Node 12: 3, 13, 17, 16
- Node 13: 1, 12, 4
- Node 14: 2, 11, 18
- Node 15: 5, 19, 9
- Node 16: 10, 7, 12
- Node 17: 3, 9, 12
- Node 18: 14, 6
- Node 19: 6, 15, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as they can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors

For nodes with three neighbors, there is exactly one 3-star formed with that node. 
For nodes with more than three neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they can form using \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 15 3-stars
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 
  - Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 15 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 1, 10>, <3, 6, 12>, <4, 9, 13>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 16>, <6, 12, 17>, <6, 15, 19>, <7, 16, 12>, <9, 15, 4>, <12, 16, 17>
