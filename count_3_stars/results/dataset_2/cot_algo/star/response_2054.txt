Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {5}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 45 \).

Thus, the final answer is [45], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 5, 7>
- <0, 1, 5, 9>
- <0, 1, 7, 9>
- <0, 2, 5, 7>
- <0, 2, 5, 9>
- <0, 2, 7, 9>
- <0, 5, 6, 7>
- <0, 5, 6, 9>
- <0, 7, 8, 5>
- <1, 4, 7, 9>
