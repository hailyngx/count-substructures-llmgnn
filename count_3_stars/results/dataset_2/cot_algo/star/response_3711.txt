Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 18) (4, 13) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 18) (3, 5) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 2) (8, 10) (8, 16) (13, 4) (13, 2) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 7) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 14) (17, 4) (17, 3) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 2) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 2) (6, 15) (6, 1) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 12) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 12) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 0) (19, 3) (19, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 18) (16, 5) (16, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 17, 19}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 14, 17}
- Node 2: {0, 13, 15, 17}
- Node 3: {5, 15, 17, 18, 19}
- Node 4: {13, 17}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 9, 16}
- Node 6: {1, 15}
- Node 7: {11, 18}
- Node 8: {10, 16}
- Node 9: {5, 18}
- Node 10: {8, 12}
- Node 11: {7}
- Node 12: {10, 14, 18}
- Node 13: {2, 4}
- Node 14: {1, 12, 15}
- Node 15: {2, 3, 6, 14, 18}
- Node 16: {5, 8}
- Node 17: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 18: {3, 7, 9, 12, 15}
- Node 19: {0, 3}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \), so we put [30] in brackets.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (5, 15, 18)>
<15, (2, 3, 14)>
<18, (3, 12, 15)>
