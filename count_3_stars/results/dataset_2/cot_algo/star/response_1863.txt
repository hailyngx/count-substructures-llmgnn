Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
In this graph, the neighbor sets for each node are:

Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
Node 1: {0, 2, 9}
Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
Node 3: {0, 5, 9}
Node 4: {2, 5, 9}
Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 7}
Node 6: {2, 7, 8}
Node 7: {5, 6, 8, 9}
Node 8: {2, 6, 7, 9}
Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0, Node 2, Node 8, and Node 9 have 5 neighbors each.

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of unique 3-stars they are a part of:

For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 54

So, the final answer is [54].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
