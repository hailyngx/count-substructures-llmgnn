Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 0) (4, 15) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 13) (10, 9) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 12) (8, 9) (8, 14) (1, 17) (1, 0) (1, 18) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 15) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 12) (9, 10) (9, 8) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 1) (0, 19) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 15) (3, 5) (3, 6) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 13) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 1) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 11, 16, 19}
- Node 1: {0, 17, 18}
- Node 2: {5, 12}
- Node 3: {5, 6}
- Node 4: {15, 17}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 19}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 13, 15, 18}
- Node 7: {10, 11, 13}
- Node 8: {9, 14}
- Node 9: {8, 10}
- Node 10: {7, 9, 11, 13, 18}
- Node 11: {0, 7, 10, 16}
- Node 12: {2, 15, 19}
- Node 13: {6, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {8, 13, 15}
- Node 15: {4, 6, 12, 14, 17}
- Node 16: {0, 11}
- Node 17: {1, 4, 15}
- Node 18: {6, 10}
- Node 19: {0, 5, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so we have [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so we have [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so we have [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so we have [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so we have [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so we have [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 11, 19)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (3, 5, 18)>, <10, (7, 9, 11)>, <13, (7, 10, 14)>, <15, (4, 12, 17)>
