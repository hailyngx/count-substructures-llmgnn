Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 1) (14, 5) (14, 11) (17, 9) (17, 4) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (2, 18) (2, 0) (2, 19) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 12) (15, 10) (15, 18) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 16) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 16) (12, 5) (12, 19) (12, 4) (12, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (6, 12) (16, 13) (16, 4) (16, 7) (7, 11) (7, 18) (7, 16) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: (5, 2, 3, 8)
- Node 1: (9, 8)
- Node 2: (5, 18, 19, 0)
- Node 3: (0, 11)
- Node 4: (17, 12, 16)
- Node 5: (9, 19, 12, 0, 14)
- Node 6: (12)
- Node 7: (11, 18, 16)
- Node 8: (11, 0, 1)
- Node 9: (5, 17, 1)
- Node 10: (11, 15, 13)
- Node 11: (14, 10, 3, 7, 8)
- Node 12: (5, 19, 4, 6)
- Node 13: (10, 19, 16)
- Node 14: (5, 11)
- Node 15: (10, 18)
- Node 16: (13, 4, 7)
- Node 17: (9, 4)
- Node 18: (2, 15, 7)
- Node 19: (5, 2, 13, 12)

Now, we will determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 5 forms 10 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star
- Node 11 forms 5 3-stars
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 27.

So, the final answer is [27], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 5, 19)>
<5, (0, 12, 14)>
<8, (0, 1, 11)>
<9, (1, 5, 17)>
<11, (3, 7, 8)>
<12, (4, 5, 19)>
<13, (10, 16, 19)>
<16, (4, 7, 13)>
<18, (2, 7, 15)>
<19, (2, 12, 13)>
