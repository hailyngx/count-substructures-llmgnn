Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 0) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 10}
- Node 4: {7, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 11, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 4, 10}

Now letâ€™s identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 8 have 6 or more neighbors.
- Node 1, Node 6, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14 have 5 neighbors each.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \times 5 = 100 \)
- For Nodes 1, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14: 0 (as they have less than 6 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [100].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 2, 11)>, <0, (1, 2, 14)>, <0, (1, 3, 11)>, <0, (1, 11, 13)>, <0, (2, 9, 14)>, <0, (2, 11, 14)>, <0, (3, 5, 11)>, <2, (0, 9, 14)>, <2, (0, 11, 14)>, <2, (8, 12, 5)>, <2, (8, 5, 12)>, <4, (10, 12, 14)>, <4, (10, 14, 12)>, <4, (12, 5, 14)>, <4, (12, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 11)>, <5, (1, 11, 13)>, <5, (3, 10, 11)>, <5, (3, 10, 12)>, <5, (3, 11, 12)>, <5, (11, 12, 13)>
