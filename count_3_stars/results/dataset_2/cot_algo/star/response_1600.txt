Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 6) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 9) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 3) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 2) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {6, 9, 2}
- Node 1: {8, 10, 7, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 3}
- Node 3: {11, 14, 5, 2}
- Node 4: {13, 9, 14}
- Node 5: {8, 11, 6, 3}
- Node 6: {13, 11, 0, 5, 1, 2}  
- Node 7: {10, 12, 9, 1}
- Node 8: {5, 14, 1}
- Node 9: {11, 4, 7, 12, 0}
- Node 10: {13, 11, 7, 1}
- Node 11: {13, 10, 7, 9, 5, 6, 3}
- Node 12: {7, 14, 9}
- Node 13: {4, 10, 11, 6}
- Node 14: {8, 4, 12, 3}

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 12, 5, 8, 14
Number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 6, 9>
- <2, 6, 3>
- <12, 7, 9>
- <5, 8, 11>
- <14, 4, 12>
- <14, 8, 3>
