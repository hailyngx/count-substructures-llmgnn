Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 2, 4}
- Node 1: {6, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 1, 6, 4, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 2, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 4, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 1, 7, 2}
- Node 7: {9, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 0, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 3, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as they can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 41

Thus, there are 41 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [41], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (8, 2, 4)>, 
<2, (5, 1, 6)>,
<3, (5, 9, 7)>,
<4, (5, 9, 2)>,
<5, (9, 6, 2)>,
<6, (5, 1, 7)>,
<7, (9, 3, 6)>,
<8, (1, 3, 0)>.
