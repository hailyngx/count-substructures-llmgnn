Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (10, 4) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 13) (8, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 0) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 13}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 9, 12}
- Node 6: {0, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 9, 11}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 10}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 10: {4, 8}
- Node 11: {0, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 4, 13, 14}
- Node 14: {9, 11, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 75 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [75], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 11, 13)>, <1, (3, 13, 14)>, <4, (2, 7, 10)>, <5, (2, 9, 12)>, <9, (6, 7, 14)>, <13, (0, 1, 14)>
