Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 5: 4, 8, 9 (1 3-star)
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5 (1 3-star)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
