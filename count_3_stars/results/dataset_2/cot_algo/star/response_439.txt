Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 10) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 4) (11, 14) (11, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 1) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 8, 10}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 11}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 8, 12}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 10}
- Node 7: {3, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12}
- Node 9: {0, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 4, 6, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {3, 14}
- Node 12: {5, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {2, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 10, 11}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0, 3-stars: 3 (with nodes 1, 8, 10)
- Node 1, 3-stars: 2 (with nodes 4, 10)
- Node 2, 3-stars: 1 (with nodes 6, 13, 14)
- Node 4, 3-stars: 1 (with nodes 1, 10, 14)
- Node 8, 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 10, 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 13, 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7, so the final answer is [7].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 8, 10>, <1, 4, 10>, <2, 6, 13, 14>, <4, 1, 10>
