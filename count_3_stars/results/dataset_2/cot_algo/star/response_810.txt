Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 4) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 8, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {2, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {4, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {3, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {5, 9, 12, 4}
- Node 12: {2, 5, 6, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 10, 14, 9}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 13}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {9, 11, 12}
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {5, 6, 11}
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {8, 12, 13}
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {1, 7, 14}
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {4, 12, 14}
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {1, 13, 4}
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {6, 10, 11}
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {3, 8, 14}
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {10, 13, 2}

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of 9 3-stars, so the final number inside brackets is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, 9, 11, 12>, <9, 5, 6, 11>, <2, 8, 12, 13>, <3, 1, 7, 14>, <6, 4, 12, 14>, <0, 1, 13, 4>, <4, 6, 10, 11>, <1, 3, 8, 14>, <14, 10, 13, 2>
