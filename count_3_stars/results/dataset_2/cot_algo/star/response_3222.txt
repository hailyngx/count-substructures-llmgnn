Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 14) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 12) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 9, 8, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {13, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 3, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 6, 2, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 13, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {10, 11, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 3, 11, 9, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 6, 14, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 7, 1, 0, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 2, 0}
- Node 10: Neighbors {13, 5}
- Node 11: Neighbors {13, 6, 12, 5}
- Node 12: Neighbors {3, 8, 0, 14, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors {4, 1, 10, 11, 5, 2}
- Node 14: Neighbors {7, 6, 12, 2}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 4: <4, (7, 13, 2)>
- Node 6: <6, (7, 3, 14)> <6, (3, 11, 12)> <6, (9, 2, 0)>
- Node 8: <8, (4, 7, 1)> <8, (4, 7, 12)>
- Node 12: <12, (3, 11, 14)> <12, (3, 8, 0)> <12, (11, 13, 5)>
- Total number of 3-stars: 10

Therefore, the final answer, in brackets, is [10].
