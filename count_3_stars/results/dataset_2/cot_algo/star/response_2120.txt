Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

1: 0, 3, 7, 14
2: 0, 7, 8, 9, 10
3: 1, 9, 12, 8
4: 5, 6, 10, 12
5: 0, 4, 9, 13, 14
6: 4, 13, 14
7: 1, 2, 11, 13
8: 2, 3, 10, 14
9: 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 14
10: 2, 4, 8, 9, 14
11: 7, 12, 14
12: 3, 4, 11
13: 5, 6, 7
14: 1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 6

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars centered at each node:
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 7: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 8: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 10: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 11: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 12: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 13: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 14: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)

Adding up the 3-stars centered at each node: \(4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 30\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 10)>
<5, (4, 9, 13)>
<7, (1, 11, 14)>
<8, (2, 10, 14)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<10, (2, 8, 14)>
<14, (6, 11, 13)>
