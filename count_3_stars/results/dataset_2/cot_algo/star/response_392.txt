Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 7, 2}
- Node 1: {4, 3, 2}
- Node 2: {7, 1, 8, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 4, 1, 6}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 1, 6, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {4, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 4, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 2, 6}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 3, 7, 0}

Next, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 1: Has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 2: Has 4 neighbors, so there can be 1 3-star formed.
- Node 3: Has 5 neighbors, so there can be \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.
- Node 4: Has 5 neighbors, so there can be \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.
- Node 5: Has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 6: Has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 7: Has 5 neighbors, so there can be \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.
- Node 8: Has 4 neighbors, so there can be 1 3-star formed.
- Node 9: Has 5 neighbors, so there can be \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 32

So, the final answer is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (4, 8, 6)>
- <3, (5, 4, 1)>
- <3, (5, 4, 6)>
- <3, (5, 4, 7)>
- <3, (5, 1, 6)>
- <3, (5, 1, 7)>
- <3, (4, 6, 3)>
- <3, (4, 7, 3)>
- <3, (1, 6, 3)>
- <3, (1, 7, 3)>
