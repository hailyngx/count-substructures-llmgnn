Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 7) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 5) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 4) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 6) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

1: {3, 14, 9}
2: {3, 0, 5, 7, 6}
3: {1, 2}
4: {10, 0, 5, 12, 6}
5: {14, 2, 4}
6: {10, 0, 4, 12, 2}
7: {8, 13, 0, 2}
8: {10, 11, 13, 9, 7, 12}
9: {1, 10, 8, 14}
10: {11, 6, 8, 4, 9}
11: {10, 0, 8}
12: {8, 4, 6}
13: {8, 7}
14: {1, 0, 9, 5}

Based on the neighbor sets, we can see that the nodes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 have three or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
