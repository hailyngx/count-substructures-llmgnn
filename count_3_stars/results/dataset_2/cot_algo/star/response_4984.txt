Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 15) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 19) (3, 12) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 2) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 18) (1, 8) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 19) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 9) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 7) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 10) (7, 4) (5, 15) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 18) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 4) (12, 3) (12, 14) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 0) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 13) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 18) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 11, 4, 18
- Node 1: 3, 5, 18, 8
- Node 2: 15, 13, 4
- Node 3: 1, 10, 19, 12
- Node 4: 8, 7, 0, 2
- Node 5: 15, 1, 13, 18
- Node 7: 10, 4
- Node 8: 1, 13, 4, 18 
- Node 9: 16, 17, 19
- Node 10: 16, 3, 13, 7
- Node 12: 3, 14
- Node 13: 8, 5, 2, 10, 19
- Node 14: 18, 12
- Node 15: 16, 5, 2
- Node 16: 9, 10, 15
- Node 17: 9
- Node 18: 1, 8, 14, 5, 0
- Node 19: 3, 9, 13

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 13, 18, 19

For each of these nodes, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: There are 3 choices of neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1: There are 4 choices of neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: There are 3 choices of neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3: There are 4 choices of neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: There are 4 choices of neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: There are 4 choices of neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: There are 4 choices of neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10: There are 4 choices of neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13: There are 5 choices of neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18: There are 5 choices of neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19: There are 3 choices of neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 47

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [47].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (4, 18, 0)>, <1, (8, 5, 1)>, <2, (13, 15, 2)>, <3, (10, 19, 3)>, <4, (8, 18, 4)>, <5, (13, 1, 5)>, <8, (5, 18, 8)>, <10, (16, 13, 10)>, <13, (5, 19, 13)>, <18, (8, 14, 18)>.
