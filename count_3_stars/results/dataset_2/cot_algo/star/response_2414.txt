Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 23) (26, 27) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 8) (15, 5) (27, 26) (27, 15) (27, 22) (27, 1) (4, 13) (4, 29) (7, 29) (7, 5) (1, 27) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 17) (3, 10) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 12) (25, 21) (25, 18) (25, 24) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 14) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 8) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 24) (18, 25) (18, 5) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 21) (28, 11) (28, 19) (12, 25) (12, 6) (12, 22) (23, 9) (23, 15) (23, 19) (19, 2) (19, 28) (19, 23) (19, 22) (19, 16) (22, 27) (22, 12) (22, 19) (29, 4) (29, 7) (29, 6) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 29) (6, 14) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 24) (14, 16) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 18) (13, 4) (13, 1) (16, 19) (16, 14) (16, 8) (8, 15) (8, 20) (8, 17) (8, 16) (0, 1) (0, 17) (24, 25) (24, 2) (24, 14) (21, 25) (21, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: (1, 17)
- Node 1: (0, 13, 17, 27)
- Node 2: (6, 19, 24)
- Node 3: (10, 17)
- Node 4: (13, 29)
- Node 5: (7, 15, 18)
- Node 6: (2, 14, 29)
- Node 7: (5, 29)
- Node 8: (15, 16, 17, 20)
- Node 9: (23)
- Node 10: (3, 14, 17)
- Node 11: (20, 21, 28)
- Node 12: (6, 22, 25)
- Node 13: (1, 4)
- Node 14: (6, 10, 16, 24)
- Node 15: (5, 8, 23, 27)
- Node 16: (8, 14, 19)
- Node 17: (0, 1, 3, 8, 10)
- Node 18: (5, 25)
- Node 19: (2, 16, 22, 23, 28)
- Node 20: (8, 11, 25)
- Node 21: (11, 25)
- Node 22: (12, 19, 27)
- Node 23: (9, 15, 19)
- Node 24: (2, 14, 25)
- Node 25: (12, 18, 20, 21, 24)
- Node 26: (27)
- Node 27: (1, 15, 22, 26)
- Node 28: (11, 19)
- Node 29: (4, 6, 7)

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1, Node 15, and Node 27 can form a 3-star.
- Node 3, Node 10, and Node 17 can form a 3-star.
- Node 6, Node 12, and Node 29 can form a 3-star.
- Node 14, Node 16, and Node 24 can form a 3-star.
- Node 19, Node 22, and Node 23 can form a 3-star.
- Node 20, Node 21, and Node 25 can form a 3-star.

So, we have a total of 6 unique 3-stars formed in this graph:
<1, 15, 27>, <3, 10, 17>, <6, 12, 29>, <14, 16, 24>, <19, 22, 23>, <20, 21, 25>

Thus the final answer is [6].
