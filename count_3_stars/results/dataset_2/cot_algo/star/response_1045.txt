Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 9) (16, 15) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 15) (6, 0) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 17) (10, 2) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 18) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 19) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 19) (12, 4) (12, 0) (4, 12) (4, 15) (18, 8) (18, 3) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 14) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 15) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 3) (19, 13) (19, 7) (1, 16) (1, 9) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

- Node 0: 11, 6, 12
- Node 1: 16, 9
- Node 2: 10, 5, 14
- Node 3: 18, 14
- Node 4: 12, 15
- Node 5: 8, 2, 15
- Node 6: 9, 14, 0, 15
- Node 7: 9, 17, 19
- Node 8: 11, 13, 5, 18
- Node 9: 16, 6, 1, 7, 13
- Node 10: 17, 2
- Node 11: 16, 0, 8
- Node 12: 0, 4
- Node 13: 9, 8, 17, 19
- Node 14: 6, 2, 3
- Node 15: 16, 6, 4, 5
- Node 16: 11, 1, 9, 15
- Node 17: 10, 13, 7
- Node 18: 8, 3
- Node 19: 13, 7

There are a total of 10 nodes with 3 or more neighbors. 

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 19

Therefore, the final answer is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (11, 6, 12)>, <6, (9, 14, 0)>, <8, (11, 13, 5)>, <9, (16, 1, 7, 13)>.
