Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 8) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 17) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 9) (14, 0) (1, 17) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 15) (17, 18) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 6) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 6) (10, 5) (10, 18) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 13) (3, 13) (8, 11) (8, 15) (2, 16) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 15) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 2) (6, 16) (6, 18) (6, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {14, 19}
Node 1: {17}
Node 2: {4, 7, 13, 15, 16}
Node 3: {13}
Node 4: {2, 5, 7}
Node 5: {4, 9, 10, 13, 15}
Node 6: {16, 18, 19}
Node 7: {2, 4, 17}
Node 8: {11, 15}
Node 9: {5, 12, 14}
Node 10: {5, 18}
Node 11: {8, 19}
Node 12: {9, 13, 16}
Node 13: {2, 3, 5, 12}
Node 14: {0, 9}
Node 15: {2, 5, 8, 17}
Node 16: {2, 6, 12}
Node 17: {1, 7, 15, 18}
Node 18: {6, 10, 17, 19}
Node 19: {0, 6, 11, 18}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 46

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (4, 13, 15)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 13, 15)>
<6, (16, 18, 19)>
<7, (2, 4, 17)>
<9, (5, 12, 14)>
<12, (9, 13, 16)>
<13, (2, 5, 12)>
<15, (2, 5, 17)>
<16, (2, 6, 12)>
<17, (1, 15, 18)>
<18, (6, 10, 19)>
<19, (11, 18, 6)>
