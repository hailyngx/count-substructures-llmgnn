Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 5) (15, 7) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 26) (4, 20) (7, 15) (7, 28) (7, 9) (7, 2) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 29) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 25) (1, 3) (1, 16) (10, 0) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 0) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 21) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 22) (5, 11) (6, 21) (6, 24) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 24) (21, 16) (21, 29) (24, 6) (24, 21) (24, 16) (24, 13) (26, 27) (26, 28) (26, 29) (28, 7) (28, 26) (28, 14) (20, 4) (20, 9) (29, 22) (29, 21) (29, 26) (18, 14) (18, 11) (19, 2) (19, 16) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 19) (2, 7) (2, 23) (2, 19) (2, 25) (14, 22) (14, 8) (14, 28) (14, 18) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 24) (13, 12) (25, 23) (25, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 20) (11, 5) (11, 18) 

Response:
The graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. We will first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {27, 10, 17, 12, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 16}
- Node 2: {7, 23, 19, 25}
- Node 3: {1, 5}
- Node 4: {20}
- Node 5: {3, 22, 11}
- Node 6: {21, 24}
- Node 7: {15, 28, 9, 2}
- Node 8: {23, 10, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 7, 17, 20}
- Node 10: {0, 17, 8}
- Node 11: {5, 18}
- Node 12: {0, 13}
- Node 13: {24, 12}
- Node 14: {22, 8, 28, 18}
- Node 15: {7}
- Node 16: {1, 17, 21, 24, 19}
- Node 17: {0, 10, 16, 9, 21}
- Node 18: {14, 11}
- Node 19: {2, 16}
- Node 20: {4, 9}
- Node 21: {17, 6, 24, 16, 29}
- Node 22: {23, 5, 14, 29}
- Node 23: {22, 8, 2, 25}
- Node 24: {6, 21, 16, 13}
- Node 25: {23, 2}
- Node 26: {27, 28, 29}
- Node 27: {0, 26}
- Node 28: {7, 26, 14}
- Node 29: {22, 21, 26}

Now we will identify and count the 3-stars:

- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 10: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 23

Therefore, the final answer is [23], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 9, 10>
- <0, 9, 17>
- <0, 10, 17>
- <0, 12, 13>
- <0, 17, 21>
- <0, 27, 26>
- <2, 7, 23>
- <7, 14, 28>
- <7, 21, 28>
- <7, 21, 29>
- <9, 20, 21>
- <9, 20, 29>
- <10, 17, 21>
- <14, 18, 22>
- <16, 19, 25>
- <16, 21, 24>
- <16, 23, 25>
- <21, 24, 29>
- <22, 23, 25>
- <22, 23, 29>
- <22, 25, 29>
- <23, 25, 29>
- <26, 28, 29>
