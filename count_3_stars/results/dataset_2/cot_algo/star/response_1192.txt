Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 46 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)> 

These are the unique 3-stars formed in the given graph.
