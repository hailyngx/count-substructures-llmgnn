Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 20) (16, 6) (18, 11) (18, 22) (18, 24) (18, 7) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 4) (7, 18) (7, 21) (7, 27) (21, 7) (21, 27) (21, 25) (21, 24) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 8) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 28) (8, 18) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 29) (13, 15) (2, 22) (2, 8) (2, 14) (29, 17) (29, 13) (29, 26) (29, 0) (19, 25) (26, 29) (26, 14) (26, 12) (15, 13) (28, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 26) (14, 20) (0, 29) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 24) (9, 4) (9, 27) (25, 21) (25, 19) (25, 6) (4, 23) (4, 5) (4, 9) (27, 7) (27, 21) (27, 9) (27, 6) (20, 16) (20, 14) (20, 6) (12, 22) (12, 26) (12, 24) (24, 18) (24, 21) (24, 5) (24, 12) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 25) (6, 27) (6, 20) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {29}
- Node 1: {3, 10, 14}
- Node 2: {8, 14, 22}
- Node 3: {1, 28}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 23}
- Node 5: {4, 10, 24}
- Node 6: {8, 16, 20, 25, 27}
- Node 7: {18, 21, 27}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 13, 17, 18}
- Node 9: {4, 27}
- Node 10: {1, 5, 17}
- Node 11: {17, 18}
- Node 12: {22, 24, 26}
- Node 13: {8, 15, 29}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 20, 26}
- Node 15: {13}
- Node 16: {6, 20}
- Node 17: {8, 10, 11, 29}
- Node 18: {7, 8, 11, 17, 22, 24}
- Node 19: {25}
- Node 20: {6, 14, 16}
- Node 21: {7, 24, 25, 27}
- Node 22: {12, 18, 2, 23}
- Node 23: {4, 22}
- Node 24: {18, 21, 5, 12}
- Node 25: {6, 19, 21}
- Node 26: {12, 14, 29}
- Node 27: {6, 7, 9, 21}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 6, Node 8, Node 17, Node 18, and Node 27 each have 5 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.
- The total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes is \( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 48 \).

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars is [48]. 

The list of unique 3-stars found is:
- <6, (8, 16, 27)>
- <8, (6, 17, 18)>
- <17, (8, 11, 29)>
- <18, (7, 22, 24)>
