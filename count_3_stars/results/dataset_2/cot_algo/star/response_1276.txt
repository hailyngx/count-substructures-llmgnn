Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) (17, 15) (17, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (11, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (7, 18) (7, 1) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 18) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 18) (19, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 5) (15, 9) (15, 17) (1, 7) (1, 19) (1, 12) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 8) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 1) (4, 17) (4, 3) (4, 14) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can first calculate the degree of each node to find potential 3-stars. 

Node 0: degree 4 (neighbors: 3, 5, 12)
Node 1: degree 3 (neighbors: 7, 12, 19)
Node 2: degree 4 (neighbors: 5, 9, 10)
Node 3: degree 4 (neighbors: 0, 4, 8)
Node 4: degree 4 (neighbors: 3, 14, 17)
Node 5: degree 4 (neighbors: 0, 2, 13, 18)
Node 6: degree 3 (neighbors: 9, 10, 16)
Node 7: degree 2 (neighbors: 1, 18)
Node 8: degree 4 (neighbors: 3, 8, 12, 13)
Node 9: degree 5 (neighbors: 2, 6, 10, 13, 16)
Node 10: degree 3 (neighbors: 2, 6, 9)
Node 11: degree 1 (neighbor: 14)
Node 12: degree 4 (neighbors: 0, 1, 8, 18)
Node 13: degree 3 (neighbors: 5, 8, 9)
Node 14: degree 3 (neighbors: 4, 8, 11)
Node 15: degree 2 (neighbors: 9, 17)
Node 16: degree 3 (neighbors: 6, 9, 8)
Node 17: degree 3 (neighbors: 4, 15, 17)
Node 18: degree 4 (neighbors: 5, 7, 12, 19)
Node 19: degree 2 (neighbors: 1, 18)

Now, we can identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, 3, 12>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, 5, 9>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, 4, 8>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, 14, 17>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, 0, 18>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, 12, 13>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, 10, 13>
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star: <12, 1, 18>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
