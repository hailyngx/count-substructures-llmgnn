Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 8, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 3, 5, 9, 8}
- Node 2: {7, 3, 8, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 1}
- Node 5: {7, 1, 3, 6, 2}
- Node 6: {7, 5, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {4, 1, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {1, 3}

Now, we check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 8 have 5 or more neighbors.

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes: 
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 48 3-stars.

Thus, the final answer is [48], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>.
