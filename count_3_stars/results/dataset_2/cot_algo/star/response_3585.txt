Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 13) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 19) (14, 18) (14, 12) (10, 1) (10, 18) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 4) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 7) (17, 3) (17, 13) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 11) (19, 0) (19, 2) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 2) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 11) (2, 4) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 4) (12, 9) (12, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 13) (8, 0) (8, 11) (4, 15) (4, 2) (4, 16) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8, 19}
- Node 1: {3, 10, 11, 16}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 11, 19}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 13, 17}
- Node 4: {2, 15, 16}
- Node 5: {7, 9, 15, 16}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 11}
- Node 9: {5, 7, 12}
- Node 10: {1, 18}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 8, 18}
- Node 12: {9, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 7, 16, 17}
- Node 14: {12, 18}
- Node 15: {4, 5, 18}
- Node 16: {1, 4, 5, 13}
- Node 17: {3, 13}
- Node 18: {10, 11, 14, 15}
- Node 19: {0, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars: nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, 16, and 18 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: None
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].

Unique 3-stars identified:
- <0, 3, 8>
- <1, 10, 16>
- <1, 11, 18>
- <1, 16, 13>
- <2, 4, 16>
- <5, 7, 13>
- <5, 9, 15>
- <11, 2, 18>
- <13, 3, 17>
- <15, 4, 16>
- <18, 10, 11>
- <18, 14, 15>
