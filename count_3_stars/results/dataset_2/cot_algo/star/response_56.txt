Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: {6, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Now, we'll calculate the 3-stars:

For Node 4:
- neighbors: {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 5, 9)> <4, (2, 5, 9)> <4, (1, 2, 9)> <4, (1, 8, 9)> <4, (2, 8, 9)>

For Node 9:
- neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 3)> <9, (0, 1, 4)> <9, (0, 1, 5)> <9, (0, 1, 6)> <9, (0, 4, 5)> <9, (0, 4, 6)> <9, (0, 5, 6)> <9, (1, 3, 4)> <9, (1, 3, 5)> <9, (1, 3, 6)> <9, (1, 4, 5)> <9, (1, 4, 6)> <9, (1, 5, 6)> <9, (3, 4, 5)> <9, (3, 4, 6)> <9, (3, 5, 6)> <9, (4, 5, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars formed is 10 + 20 = 30, so the final answer is [30].
