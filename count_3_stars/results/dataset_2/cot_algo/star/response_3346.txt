Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
After analyzing the given graph, we can determine the 3-stars formed within it:

Node 6 has 5 neighbors: {9, 1, 8, 4, 0}. By calculating \( \binom{5}{3} \), we find that there are 10 possible 3-stars with node 6 as the center. 
<6, (9, 1, 8)>, <6, (9, 1, 4)>, <6, (9, 1, 0)>, <6, (9, 8, 4)>, <6, (9, 8, 0)>, <6, (9, 4, 0)>, <6, (1, 8, 4)>, <6, (1, 8, 0)>, <6, (1, 4, 0)>, <6, (8, 4, 0)>

Node 9 has 6 neighbors: {6, 8, 2, 1, 7, 0}. By calculating \( \binom{6}{3} \), we find that there are 20 possible 3-stars with node 9 as the center. 
<9, (6, 8, 2)>, <9, (6, 8, 1)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>, <9, (6, 8, 0)>, <9, (6, 2, 1)>, <9, (6, 2, 7)>, <9, (6, 2, 0)>, <9, (6, 1, 7)>, <9, (6, 1, 0)>, <9, (6, 7, 0)>, <9, (8, 2, 1)>, <9, (8, 2, 7)>, <9, (8, 2, 0)>, <9, (8, 1, 7)>, <9, (8, 1, 0)>, <9, (8, 7, 0)>, <9, (2, 1, 7)>, <9, (2, 1, 0)>, <9, (2, 7, 0)>, <9, (1, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is the sum of 3-stars for nodes 6 and 9:
10 + 20 = 30 

Thus, the final answer is [30].
