Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 22) (25, 12) (25, 4) (25, 14) (25, 24) (22, 3) (22, 23) (22, 7) (23, 22) (23, 6) (12, 25) (12, 2) (12, 24) (27, 28) (27, 16) (28, 27) (28, 9) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 11) (17, 16) (17, 2) (26, 16) (13, 5) (13, 15) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 21) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 11) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 8) (16, 27) (16, 17) (16, 26) (16, 0) (16, 4) (2, 12) (2, 17) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 21) (9, 28) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 19) (18, 20) (18, 9) (18, 21) (7, 3) (7, 22) (7, 6) (7, 8) (15, 13) (15, 9) (19, 29) (19, 9) (19, 4) (21, 5) (21, 2) (21, 18) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 14) (1, 5) (1, 10) (14, 25) (14, 8) (6, 23) (6, 7) (6, 4) (4, 25) (4, 16) (4, 19) (4, 6) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 10) (11, 29) (11, 20) (11, 0) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 24) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-star configurations:

1. Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 8)>
2. Node 9: <9, (15, 18, 19)>
3. Node 12: <12, (2, 24, 25)>
4. Node 16: <16, (0, 4, 27)>
5. Node 20: <20, (11, 18, 29)>
6. Node 22: <22, (3, 7, 23)>
7. Node 25: <25, (12, 14, 24)>

Since there are 7 unique 3-star configurations, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
