Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 12) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 13) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 13) (18, 22) (18, 28) (18, 29) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 7) (2, 11) (2, 4) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 9) (6, 28) (6, 17) (28, 18) (28, 6) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 26) (29, 18) (29, 23) (26, 22) (26, 17) (26, 13) (26, 5) (13, 25) (13, 20) (13, 26) (13, 19) (13, 27) (8, 21) (8, 12) (21, 8) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 24) (10, 15) (10, 21) (10, 9) (11, 2) (11, 23) (11, 4) (23, 29) (23, 11) (23, 4) (27, 25) (27, 13) (27, 5) (16, 17) (16, 21) (16, 14) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 23) (4, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 0) (5, 26) (5, 27) (7, 3) (7, 22) (7, 1) (19, 15) (19, 13) (14, 22) (14, 16) (14, 9) (24, 21) (24, 0) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 14) (1, 7) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 24) 

Response:
There are three nodes in the graph that have exactly three neighbors each, which means they can form 3-star graphs. These nodes are:

- Node 15 with neighbors 10, 19, 20
- Node 13 with neighbors 19, 25, 27
- Node 26 with neighbors 13, 17, 22

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:

- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3. 

So, the final answer is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <15, (10, 19, 20)>
- <13, (19, 25, 27)>
- <26, (13, 17, 22)>
