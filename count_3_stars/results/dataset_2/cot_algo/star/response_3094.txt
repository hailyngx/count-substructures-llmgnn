Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 19) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 11) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 17) (6, 18) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 17) (7, 2) (7, 16) (7, 17) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 19) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 15) (4, 9) (4, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 15) (15, 14) (15, 0) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 14) (10, 9) (10, 1) (19, 3) (19, 16) (17, 18) (17, 11) (17, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 5, 8, 15
Node 1: 3, 4, 10, 12, 16
Node 2: 3, 5, 7, 18
Node 3: 1, 2, 11, 13, 19
Node 4: 1, 9
Node 5: 0, 2, 9
Node 6: 18
Node 7: 2, 16, 17
Node 8: 0, 14
Node 9: 4, 5, 10, 12
Node 10: 1, 9
Node 11: 3, 13, 17
Node 12: 1, 9, 13, 14
Node 13: 3, 11, 12
Node 14: 8, 12, 15
Node 15: 0, 14
Node 16: 1, 7, 19
Node 17: 7, 11, 18
Node 18: 2, 6, 17
Node 19: 3, 16

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 7: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 12: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 13: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 16: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 17: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 36

So, the final answer is [36], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 10)>
<1, (3, 12, 16)>
<1, (10, 12, 16)>

<3, (11, 13, 17)>
<9, (10, 12, 14)>
<9, (10, 12, 13)>
<9, (4, 12, 13)>
<9, (4, 12, 10)>
<12, (9, 13, 14)>
<12, (9, 13, 12)>
<12, (1, 13, 14)>

<17, (7, 11, 18)>
<17, (7, 11, 17)>
<17, (2, 11, 18)>
<17, (2, 11, 17)>
<17, (7, 2, 18)>
<17, (7, 2, 17)>
<17, (18, 2, 7)>

<17, (11, 2, 17)>
<16, (1, 7, 19)>
<16, (1, 16, 19)>
<16, (7, 16, 19)>
<13, (11, 17, 18)>
