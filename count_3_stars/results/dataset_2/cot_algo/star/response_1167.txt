Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
Node 1: {3, 4, 7}
Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 6, 8}
Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 9}
Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 7}
Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 9}
Node 7: {1, 4, 5, 9}
Node 8: {2, 4}
Node 9: {0, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 4, 7)
Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 6, 7)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2, so the answer is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>.
