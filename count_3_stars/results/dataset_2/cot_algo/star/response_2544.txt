Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 14) (1, 3) (1, 16) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 19) (4, 2) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 17) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 16) (15, 8) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 14) (7, 16) (7, 17) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 10) (16, 7) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 19) (6, 2) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 18) (17, 7) (17, 6) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (12, 8) (12, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {11, 6, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 16}
- Node 2: {4, 18, 19, 6}
- Node 3: {5, 1, 11, 16, 8}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {9, 3, 16}
- Node 6: {2, 17, 0}
- Node 7: {16, 17}
- Node 8: {3, 13, 15, 12}
- Node 9: {5, 14}
- Node 10: {13, 18, 16}
- Node 11: {3, 14, 0}
- Node 12: {8, 0}
- Node 13: {8, 10, 19}
- Node 14: {9, 11, 19}
- Node 15: {8}
- Node 16: {5, 1, 3, 10, 7}
- Node 17: {18, 7, 6}
- Node 18: {2, 10, 19, 17}
- Node 19: {2, 18, 13, 14}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 3 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 16 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 18 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 19 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 32 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (1, 16, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 16)>, <3, (5, 1, 16)>, <3, (5, 16, 1)>, <3, (16, 1, 5)>, <3, (16, 5, 1)>, 
<8, (13, 15, 3)>, <8, (15, 12, 3)>, <8, (13, 12, 3)>,
<16, (1, 10, 7)>, <16, (1, 7, 10)>, <16, (10, 7, 1)>,
<18, (10, 2, 19)>, <18, (10, 19, 2)>, <18, (2, 19, 10)>, <18, (2, 10, 19)>,
<19, (13, 14, 9)>, <19, (13, 9, 14)>, <19, (14, 9, 13)>.
