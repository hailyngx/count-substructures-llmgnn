Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 8) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7, 14}
- Node 2: {9, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {1, 8, 13}
- Node 6: {3, 8, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 6, 11}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {4, 6, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 13: {2, 5, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 2, 9}

Now, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors -> 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: 4 neighbors -> 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 3: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 4: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 5: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 6: 5 neighbors -> 10 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars
- Node 9: 5 neighbors -> 10 3-stars
- Node 10: 5 neighbors -> 10 3-stars
- Node 12: 5 neighbors -> 10 3-stars
- Node 13: 5 neighbors -> 10 3-stars
- Node 14: 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 68

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [68].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 9, 14)>, <1, (3, 7, 14)>, <2, (9, 13, 14)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 10, 11)>, <5, (1, 8, 13)>, <6, (3, 10, 12)>, <7, (1, 9, 10)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 12, 14)>, <10, (4, 6, 13)>, <12, (0, 6, 9)>, <13, (2, 10, 12)>, <14, (0, 1, 9)>
