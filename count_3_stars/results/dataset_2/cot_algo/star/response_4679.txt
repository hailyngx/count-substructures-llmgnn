Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 2) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 13) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph as follows:

Node 0 neighbors: {7, 14, 10, 11, 5, 13} => inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 1 neighbors: {7, 6, 14, 2} => inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 2 neighbors: {4, 9, 5, 1} => inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 3 neighbors: {7, 14, 12} => inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 4 neighbors: {7, 9, 2} => inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 5 neighbors: {0, 13, 2, 12} => inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6 neighbors: {9, 1, 14, 10, 11} => inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 7 neighbors: {4, 0, 3, 11, 10, 1} => inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 9 neighbors: {4, 6, 2} => inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 10 neighbors: {7, 6, 8, 0, 12} => inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 11 neighbors: {7, 6, 0, 13} => inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 12 neighbors: {5, 13, 10, 3} => inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 13 neighbors: {0, 5, 12, 11} => inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 14 neighbors: {6, 0, 3, 1} => inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 86

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [86].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 14, 10)>      
<1, (7, 6, 14)>    
<2, (4, 9, 5)>    
<3, (7, 14, 12)>    
<4, (7, 4, 9)>    
<5, (0, 13, 2)>    
<6, (9, 1, 6)>    
<7, (4, 7, 10)>    
<8, (7, 0, 3)>    
<9, (7, 11, 10)>    
<10, (7, 6, 1)>    
<11, (7, 10, 1)>    
<12, (7, 11, 13)>    
<13, (0, 14, 3)>    
<14, (5, 13, 12)>
