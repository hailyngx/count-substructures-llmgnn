Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 1) (22, 5) (22, 28) (22, 0) (22, 17) (23, 2) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 26) (18, 1) (18, 4) (18, 9) (6, 28) (28, 22) (28, 6) (28, 27) (28, 25) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 24) (13, 19) (26, 4) (26, 13) (26, 5) (17, 1) (17, 22) (17, 13) (17, 15) (7, 1) (7, 25) (7, 24) (7, 27) (25, 28) (25, 7) (25, 9) (25, 10) (20, 27) (20, 2) (20, 19) (29, 15) (29, 14) (29, 21) (29, 11) (21, 29) (21, 16) (21, 5) (5, 22) (5, 26) (5, 21) (5, 8) (2, 23) (2, 20) (2, 27) (2, 14) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 9) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 16) (15, 17) (15, 29) (15, 19) (19, 13) (19, 20) (19, 15) (19, 27) (0, 22) (0, 11) (11, 1) (11, 29) (11, 0) (24, 13) (24, 7) (24, 16) (8, 5) (10, 25) (27, 28) (27, 7) (27, 20) (27, 2) (27, 19) (14, 4) (14, 29) (14, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 1: {3, 17, 11, 18, 7}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 17: {1, 22, 13, 15}
- Node 11: {1, 29, 0}
- Node 18: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 25, 24, 27}
- Node 22: {5, 28, 0, 17}
- Node 28: {5, 6, 27, 25, 22}
- Node 0: {22, 11}
- Node 5: {22, 26, 21, 8}
- Node 2: {23, 20, 27, 14}
- Node 4: {18, 14, 26}
- Node 26: {4, 13, 5}
- Node 13: {26, 17, 24, 19}
- Node 25: {28, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 6: {28}
- Node 27: {28, 7, 20, 2, 19}
- Node 9: {18, 25, 16}
- Node 15: {17, 29, 19}
- Node 19: {13, 20, 15, 27}
- Node 20: {27, 2, 19}
- Node 29: {15, 14, 21, 11}
- Node 21: {29, 16, 5}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 10: {25}
- Node 23: {2}
- Node 16: {21, 24, 9}
- Node 14: {4, 29, 2}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph = \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 59 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [59].
