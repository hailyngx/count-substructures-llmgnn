Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 10) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 10) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 12) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 6, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 10}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 13}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 5}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 13: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 14: {6, 9, 10, 12}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes: \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 79 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [79].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 4, 12>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 5, 12>
- <0, 6, 12>
- <0, 6, 1>
- <0, 6, 2>
- <1, 5, 2>
- <1, 5, 12>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 6, 2>
- <4, 7, 13>
- <5, 12, 6>
- <5, 12, 0>
- <5, 12, 8>
- <6, 14, 9>
- <10, 12, 14>
