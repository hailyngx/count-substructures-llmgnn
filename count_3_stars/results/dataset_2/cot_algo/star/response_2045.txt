Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 3) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 3) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 9) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 6, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {8, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 9, 10}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4, 13}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 4, 11, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 3, 6}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 4, 9, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 5, 9, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 13}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars. Considering only the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [58].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 3, 6>
- <1, 8, 13>
- <2, 3, 10>
- <3, 7, 13>
- <4, 7, 13>
- <5, 6, 13>
- <6, 0, 14>
- <7, 4, 13>
- <9, 11, 12>
- <11, 1, 12>
