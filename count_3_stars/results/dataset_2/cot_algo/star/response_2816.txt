Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 11) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 0) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 10}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4, 7, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 5, 12}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 12, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors {8, 9, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {3, 11, 13}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 can form 3-stars with nodes {1, 8, 9} and {1, 9, 12}.
- Node 1 can form a 3-star with nodes {0, 8, 9}.
- Node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes {4, 7, 14}.
- Node 4 can form a 3-star with nodes {7, 9, 13}.
- Node 5 can form two 3-stars with nodes {1, 6, 11} and {1, 6, 12}.
- Node 8 can form a 3-star with nodes {0, 9, 13}.
- Node 9 can form two 3-stars with nodes {0, 4, 7} and {4, 5, 6}.
- Node 12 can form a 3-star with nodes {0, 6, 9}.
- Node 13 can form a 3-star with nodes {4, 8, 10}.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 8, 9>, <0, 1, 9, 12>, <1, 0, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 7, 14>, <4, 7, 9, 13>, <5, 1, 6, 11>, <5, 1, 6, 12>, <8, 0, 9, 13>, <9, 0, 4, 7>, <9, 4, 5, 6>.
