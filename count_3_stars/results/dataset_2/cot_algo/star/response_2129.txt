Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 11) (14, 17) (14, 10) (17, 14) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 15) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 3) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (0, 19) (2, 7) (2, 19) (2, 3) (1, 10) (1, 6) (15, 10) (15, 8) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 19) (16, 13) (16, 7) (16, 19) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 16) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 18) (18, 7) (18, 3) 

Response:
The nodes can be represented as follows:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19

Based on the given information, the neighbors for each node are as follows:

Node 0: 19
Node 1: 6, 10
Node 2: 3, 7, 19
Node 3: 2, 4, 12, 13, 18
Node 4: 3, 12, 19
Node 5: 8, 9, 13
Node 6: 1, 11, 19
Node 7: 2, 3, 12, 16, 18
Node 8: 5, 15
Node 9: 5, 11
Node 10: 1, 11, 12, 14, 15
Node 11: 6, 9, 10, 7
Node 12: 3, 4, 7, 10
Node 13: 3, 5, 16
Node 14: 10, 17
Node 15: 8, 10
Node 16: 7, 13, 19
Node 17: 14
Node 18: 3, 7
Node 19: 0, 2, 4, 6, 16

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44 3-stars in the graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<10, (11, 12, 15)>, <12, (3, 7, 10)>, <3, (12, 7, 18)>, <7, (3, 12, 16)>, <19, (4, 6, 16)>.
