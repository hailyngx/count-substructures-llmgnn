Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 4) (7, 14) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 10) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {9, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {6, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {5, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {6, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 4, 8, 11}
- Node 13: {5, 8}
- Node 14: {4, 7, 9, 10, 11}

Nodes 0, 5, and 13 have less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed with them.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for the remaining nodes:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 62.

Thus, the final answer is [62].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 12)>
<1, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (1, 2, 12)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 12, 14)>
<4, (7, 8, 14)>
<4, (12, 14, 11)>
<6, (9, 10, 11)>
<7, (4, 8, 14)>
<8, (4, 7, 12)>
<8, (4, 12, 11)>
<8, (7, 12, 14)>
<8, (8, 11, 12)>
<10, (5, 6, 9)>
<10, (5, 9, 14)>
<11, (6, 8, 12)>
<11, (8, 12, 14)>
