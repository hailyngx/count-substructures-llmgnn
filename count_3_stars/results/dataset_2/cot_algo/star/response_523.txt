Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 20) (3, 16) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 16) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 25) (7, 16) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 20) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 23) (17, 0) (17, 11) (12, 27) (12, 29) (12, 22) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 14) (27, 26) (27, 6) (9, 4) (9, 22) (22, 12) (22, 9) (18, 3) (18, 26) (18, 21) (18, 29) (26, 27) (26, 18) (26, 23) (26, 11) (25, 7) (25, 0) (25, 14) (25, 2) (19, 4) (0, 17) (0, 25) (0, 16) (16, 3) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 1) (6, 27) (6, 20) (23, 10) (23, 26) (2, 4) (2, 25) (2, 5) (2, 14) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 14) (1, 7) (1, 16) (1, 11) (11, 8) (11, 17) (11, 26) (11, 1) (21, 27) (21, 18) (29, 12) (29, 18) (20, 3) (20, 13) (20, 6) (14, 27) (14, 25) (14, 2) (14, 5) 

Response:
From the given information, we can construct the following neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {16, 17, 25}
- Node 1: {7, 11, 16}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 14, 25}
- Node 3: {15, 16, 18, 20}
- Node 4: {2, 9, 13, 19}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 8, 14, 15}
- Node 6: {20, 27}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 16, 25}
- Node 8: {5, 10, 11}
- Node 9: {4, 22}
- Node 10: {8, 15, 23}
- Node 11: {1, 8, 16, 17, 26}
- Node 12: {22, 27, 29}
- Node 13: {4, 20}
- Node 14: {2, 5, 25, 27}
- Node 15: {3, 5, 10, 16}
- Node 16: {0, 1, 3, 7, 15}
- Node 17: {0, 11}
- Node 18: {3, 21, 26, 29}
- Node 19: {4}
- Node 20: {3, 6, 13}
- Node 21: {18, 27}
- Node 22: {9, 12}
- Node 23: {10, 26}
- Node 25: {0, 2, 5, 7, 14}
- Node 26: {11, 18, 23, 27}
- Node 27: {6, 12, 14, 21, 26}
- Node 29: {12, 18}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:
- Node 3, Node 5, Node 7, Node 14, Node 16, Node 18, and Node 27 each have exactly 3 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For Node 16: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For Node 18: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For Node 27: inom{5}{3} = 10

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [43].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <3, (15, 16, 18)>
- <5, (2, 7, 14)>
- <7, (1, 5, 16)>
- <14, (2, 5, 27)>
- <16, (0, 1, 7)>
- <18, (3, 21, 29)>
- <27, (6, 12, 14)>
