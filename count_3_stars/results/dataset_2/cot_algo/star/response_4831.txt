Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding up these 3-star counts, we get:

4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 9>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <1, 8, 9>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <6, 8, 9>
