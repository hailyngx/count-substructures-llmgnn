Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) 

Response:
Since this graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges, we know it is a complete graph.

Let's first find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 7, 8}

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 10 + 10 = 30, so put [30] in brackets.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
