Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
Let's first list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 3, 1}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 7, 2, 8, 0}
- Node 2: {5, 4, 7, 8, 1}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 0}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 3, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 1, 4, 0}
- Node 6: {5, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {9, 2, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8, 1}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 65

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [65].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <1, (5, 1, 9)>
- <1, (5, 2, 8)>
- <1, (9, 5, 6)>
- <1, (9, 5, 2)>
- <1, (9, 8, 2)>
- <1, (6, 5, 9)>
- <1, (6, 5, 2)>
- <1, (2, 5, 4)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <2, (5, 4, 7)>
- <3, (4, 7, 2)>
- <4, (5, 7, 4)>
