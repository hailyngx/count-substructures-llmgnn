Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 5) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 12) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 1) (7, 12) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 0) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 4) (15, 17) (15, 10) (15, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 13) (13, 17) (13, 9) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 6) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 5) (19, 2) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 11) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 16) (16, 2) (16, 6) (16, 4) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 16) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {8, 11, 12, 6}
- Node 1: {10, 7, 14}
- Node 2: {16, 17, 18, 19}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 4: {6, 10, 16}
- Node 5: {3, 11, 18}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 16}
- Node 7: {1, 12, 14, 17}
- Node 8: {0, 9}
- Node 9: {8, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 4, 15}
- Node 11: {0, 5, 15}
- Node 12: {0, 7, 18}
- Node 13: {9, 17}
- Node 14: {1, 7, 9, 17}
- Node 15: {10, 11, 17}
- Node 16: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 17: {13, 14, 15, 2, 7}
- Node 18: {2, 12, 16, 5}
- Node 19: {2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [4]
    - <0, (8, 11, 12)>
    - <0, (8, 11, 6)>
    - <0, (8, 12, 6)>
    - <0, (11, 12, 6)>
- Node 2: [4]
    - <2, (16, 17, 18)>
    - <2, (16, 17, 19)>
    - <2, (16, 18, 19)>
    - <2, (17, 18, 19)>
- Node 4: [1]
    - <4, (6, 10, 16)>
- Node 7: [1]
    - <7, (12, 14, 17)>
- Node 12: [1]
    - <12, (7, 14, 17)>
- Node 14: [1]
    - <14, (9, 13, 17)>

Total number of 3-stars: [11]
