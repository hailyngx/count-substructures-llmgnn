Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (2, 13) (0, 4) (0, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 14) (8, 1) (8, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:
The nodes have the following number of neighbors:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 6 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 6 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 5 neighbors
- Node 14: 6 neighbors

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors that can potentially form 3-stars are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 95

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [95].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<3, (1, 13, 11)>, 
<4, (0, 6, 14)>, 
<4, (6, 7, 13)>, 
<6, (0, 4, 14)>, 
<6, (4, 7, 13)>, 
<7, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<10, (1, 11, 12)>, 
<11, (5, 9, 14)>, 
<13, (2, 6, 11)>, 
<14, (1, 5, 8)>.
