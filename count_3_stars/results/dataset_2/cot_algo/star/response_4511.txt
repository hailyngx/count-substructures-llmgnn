Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 19) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 19) (4, 12) (18, 11) (18, 17) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 10) (15, 1) (15, 10) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 14) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 17) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 0) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 17) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (16, 12) (3, 9) (3, 2) (14, 1) (14, 10) (7, 6) (7, 2) (17, 18) (17, 19) (17, 0) (17, 5) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 5) (5, 0) (5, 17) (5, 11) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

1. Node 0: neighbors {10, 12, 17, 5}
2. Node 1: neighbors {13, 15, 14, 10}
3. Node 2: neighbors {6, 19, 12, 3, 7}
4. Node 3: neighbors {9, 2}
5. Node 4: neighbors {12}
6. Node 5: neighbors {0, 17, 11}
7. Node 6: neighbors {9, 7, 2}
8. Node 7: neighbors {6, 2}
9. Node 8: neighbors {13, 10}
10. Node 9: neighbors {6, 11, 3, 19}
11. Node 10: neighbors {8, 1, 15, 0, 14}
12. Node 11: neighbors {9, 18, 5}
13. Node 12: neighbors {4, 2, 16, 0}
14. Node 13: neighbors {8, 1, 19}
15. Node 14: neighbors {1, 10}
16. Node 15: neighbors {1, 10}
17. Node 16: neighbors {12}
18. Node 17: neighbors {18, 19, 0, 5}
19. Node 18: neighbors {11, 17}
20. Node 19: neighbors {9, 13, 2, 17}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 19

Therefore, the final answer is [19], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (10, 12, 17)>
<1, (13, 15, 14)>
<2, (6, 19, 3)>
<5, (0, 17, 11)>
