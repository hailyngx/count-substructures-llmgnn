Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 16) (21, 1) (21, 15) (21, 4) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 10) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 22) (17, 18) (2, 29) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 23) (29, 11) (6, 17) (6, 10) (9, 15) (9, 24) (0, 17) (0, 20) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 13) (20, 4) (20, 19) (28, 12) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 22) (19, 15) (26, 5) (26, 12) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (4, 21) (4, 20) (4, 25) (12, 28) (12, 26) (7, 29) (7, 23) (7, 5) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 25) (5, 26) (5, 7) (5, 10) (11, 14) (11, 29) (11, 8) (11, 27) (22, 17) (22, 19) (22, 24) (15, 21) (15, 9) (15, 19) (13, 20) (13, 16) (3, 20) (3, 24) (3, 18) (24, 9) (24, 22) (24, 3) (24, 18) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 5) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 24) (18, 27) (23, 29) (23, 7) (23, 27) (27, 11) (27, 18) (27, 23) (25, 2) (25, 4) (25, 16) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {17, 20}
- Node 1: {16, 21}
- Node 2: {25, 29}
- Node 3: {18, 20, 24}
- Node 4: {20, 21, 25}
- Node 5: {7, 10, 26}
- Node 6: {10, 17}
- Node 7: {5, 23, 29}
- Node 8: {10, 11, 14, 19}
- Node 9: {15, 24}
- Node 10: {5, 6, 8, 14}
- Node 11: {8, 14, 27, 29}
- Node 12: {26, 28}
- Node 13: {16, 20}
- Node 14: {8, 10, 11}
- Node 15: {19, 21, 9}
- Node 16: {13, 25}
- Node 17: {0, 6, 18, 22}
- Node 18: {3, 17, 24, 27}
- Node 19: {8, 15, 22}
- Node 20: {0, 3, 4, 13, 19}
- Node 21: {1, 15, 16, 4}
- Node 22: {17, 19, 24}
- Node 23: {7, 27, 29}
- Node 24: {3, 9, 18, 22}
- Node 25: {2, 4, 16}
- Node 26: {5, 12}
- Node 27: {11, 18, 23}
- Node 28: {12}
- Node 29: {2, 7, 11, 23}

Now, let's identify nodes that could potentially form a 3-star:
- Node 8, Node 14, and Node 19 have 4 neighbors each, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [16], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<8, 10, 11>, <8, 10, 14>, <8, 11, 14>, <8, 19, 15>, <14, 8, 10>, <14, 8, 11>, <14, 10, 11>, <14, 11, 8>, <19, 15, 22>, <19, 15, 22>, <19, 22, 24>, <10, 14, 8>, <10, 14, 11>, <10, 8, 14>, <10, 11, 14>, <18, 24, 27>
