Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 18) (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 11) (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 18) (13, 6) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (0, 9) (0, 11) (2, 1) (2, 16) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 1) (18, 15) (18, 13) (19, 13) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 19) (16, 2) (16, 19) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 0) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can start by determining the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {9, 11}
- Node 1: {10, 12, 2}
- Node 2: {1, 16}
- Node 3: {15, 7, 12}
- Node 4: {5, 10, 12, 19}
- Node 5: {9, 11, 4}
- Node 6: {14, 17, 13}
- Node 7: {3, 8, 19}
- Node 8: {10, 12, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 11, 0, 13}
- Node 10: {15, 8, 1, 4}
- Node 11: {17, 5, 0}
- Node 12: {3, 8, 4, 1}
- Node 13: {9, 18, 6, 19}
- Node 14: {17, 6}
- Node 15: {3, 10, 18}
- Node 16: {2, 19}
- Node 17: {14, 6, 11}
- Node 18: {15, 13}
- Node 19: {13, 4, 7, 16}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 12: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 13: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us: \(4 + 4 + 4 = 12\), so we put [12] in the brackets.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
\<12, (4, 1, 8)\>, 
\<13, (19, 6, 9)\>, 
\<4, (12, 10, 5)\>
