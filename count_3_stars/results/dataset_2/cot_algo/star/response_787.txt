Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 24) (3, 9) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 26) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (23, 25) (23, 24) (12, 15) (12, 22) (27, 21) (27, 28) (27, 9) (21, 27) (21, 13) (28, 27) (24, 3) (24, 23) (24, 26) (24, 14) (24, 20) (26, 15) (26, 24) (26, 10) (17, 0) (17, 22) (5, 19) (5, 29) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 25) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 13) (7, 18) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 14) (16, 7) (16, 29) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 10) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 0) (10, 20) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (29, 5) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 6) (11, 2) (11, 20) (11, 25) (9, 3) (9, 27) (9, 2) (25, 23) (25, 19) (25, 11) (25, 22) (13, 21) (13, 18) (13, 4) (14, 8) (14, 24) (14, 7) (14, 20) (6, 2) (6, 29) (6, 22) (4, 15) (4, 13) (22, 12) (22, 17) (22, 25) (22, 6) (20, 24) (20, 10) (20, 11) (20, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 17, 10}
- Node 2: {15, 9, 6, 11}
- Node 3: {15, 24, 9, 19}
- Node 4: {15, 13}
- Node 5: {19, 29}
- Node 6: {2, 29, 22}
- Node 7: {18, 16, 29, 14}
- Node 8: {14, 0}
- Node 9: {3, 27, 2}
- Node 10: {26, 18, 0, 20}
- Node 11: {2, 20, 25}
- Node 12: {15, 22}
- Node 13: {21, 18, 4}
- Node 14: {8, 24, 7, 20}
- Node 15: {3, 2, 12, 4}
- Node 16: {7, 29}
- Node 17: {8, 22}
- Node 18: {10, 13, 7}
- Node 19: {3, 5, 25}
- Node 20: {24, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 21: {27, 13}
- Node 22: {12, 17, 25, 6}
- Node 23: {25, 24}
- Node 24: {15, 23, 26, 14, 20}
- Node 25: {23, 19, 11, 22}
- Node 26: {15, 24, 10}
- Node 27: {21, 28, 9}
- Node 28: {27}
- Node 29: {5, 7, 16, 6}

Based on the above neighbor sets, we can see that the nodes forming 3-stars are: 8, 14, 18, 20, and 24. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <8, (14, 24, 20)>
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <18, (10, 20, 13)>
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <20, (24, 10, 14)>
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars <24, (15, 20, 14)>, <24, (23, 26, 20)>, <24, (15, 12, 22)>, <24, (15, 14, 20)>, <24, (23, 25, 22)>

Adding these up, we get a total of 19 3-stars in the graph. So the final answer is [19].
