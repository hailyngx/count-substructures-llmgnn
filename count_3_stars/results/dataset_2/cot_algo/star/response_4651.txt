Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (4, 6) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 9}
- Node 1: {7, 11, 12}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 3: {7, 13}
- Node 4: {6, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 8, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 8, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 11: {1, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 5, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 14: {4, 6, 7, 9, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 84. Therefore, the final answer is [84].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (5, 7, 13)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 11, 13)>, <2, (7, 10, 11)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 13)>, <5, (8, 11, 12)>, <7, (1, 10, 11)>, <7, (2, 10, 11)>, <8, (5, 11, 12)>, <11, (1, 7, 14)>.
