Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 19) (15, 2) (15, 11) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 19) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 5) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 7) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 10) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 13) (11, 17) (1, 5) (1, 8) (16, 0) (16, 19) (2, 15) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 2) (12, 19) (14, 2) (17, 0) (17, 11) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 7) (8, 6) (8, 18) (8, 1) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 16) (19, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {16, 17, 2}
Node 1: {5, 8}
Node 2: {15, 5, 0, 12, 14}
Node 3: {11, 19}
Node 4: {9, 18, 13, 5}
Node 5: {1, 4, 2, 7}
Node 6: {9, 7, 8}
Node 7: {6, 5, 13, 10}
Node 8: {1, 18, 6}
Node 9: {4, 10, 19, 6}
Node 10: {9, 18, 7}
Node 11: {3, 15, 13, 17}
Node 12: {2, 19}
Node 13: {4, 7, 11}
Node 14: {2}
Node 15: {11, 2}
Node 16: {0, 19}
Node 17: {0, 11}
Node 18: {4, 10, 8}
Node 19: {3, 9, 16, 12}

Now, let's identify how many 3-star structures can be formed:

Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {9, 7, 8}
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {4, 10, 19, 6}
Node 13 has 3 neighbors: {4, 7, 11}
Node 18 has 3 neighbors: {4, 10, 8}

For each of these nodes, the number of 3-star structures that can be formed is given by the combination \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors of the node. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-star structures in the graph is:

\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7 \]

So, the final answer is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (9, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 10, 6)>
<13, (4, 7, 11)>
<18, (4, 10, 8)>
