Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 7) (9, 0) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 7) (18, 15) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 16) (14, 11) (14, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 19) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 11) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 18) (15, 10) (15, 4) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (8, 19) (8, 6) (8, 7) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 6) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 4) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 11) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 6) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 12) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 3) (12, 13) (12, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {5, 9, 16}
Node 1: {2, 10, 19}
Node 2: {1, 17, 7, 16}
Node 3: {14, 13, 7, 4, 12}
Node 4: {15, 13, 16, 3}
Node 5: {0}
Node 6: {8, 19, 11}
Node 7: {9, 2, 8, 3}
Node 8: {19, 6, 7}
Node 9: {7, 0}
Node 10: {1, 15, 19}
Node 11: {14, 17, 6}
Node 12: {13, 3}
Node 13: {17, 12, 4, 3}
Node 14: {11, 3}
Node 15: {18, 10, 4}
Node 16: {2, 0, 4}
Node 17: {2, 13, 11}
Node 18: {15}
Node 19: {1, 10, 8, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

1. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
6. Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
8. Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
9. Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 29

Thus, the final answer is [29], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 17, 7)>
<3, (14, 13, 7)>
<3, (14, 13, 4)>
<3, (13, 17, 4)>
<3, (13, 17, 3)>
<4, (15, 13, 16)>
<7, (9, 2, 8)>
<13, (17, 12, 3)>
<15, (18, 10, 4)>
<19, (1, 10, 8)>
