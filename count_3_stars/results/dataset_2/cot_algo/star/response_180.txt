Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 7}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 1, 4, and 9.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
