Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 11) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 0) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 1) (3, 12) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 11) (10, 4) (10, 14) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 4, 9, 13, 14, 5
- Node 1: 4, 3, 11, 2, 14
- Node 2: 7, 1, 11
- Node 3: 7, 13, 1, 12
- Node 4: 7, 12, 0, 10, 1
- Node 5: 7, 8, 0
- Node 6: 7, 11, 12
- Node 7: 4, 3, 6, 2, 5
- Node 8: 13, 5, 11, 12
- Node 9: 11, 0
- Node 10: 4, 14
- Node 11: 6, 9, 8, 1, 14, 2
- Node 12: 4, 6, 8, 13, 3
- Node 13: 8, 12, 3, 0
- Node 14: 1, 0, 11, 10

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, Node 8, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 73 \)

So, the final answer is [73], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (4, 1, 14)>, <1, (4, 3, 14)>, <3, (4, 7, 13)>, <4, (7, 12, 5)>, <5, (7, 0, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 12)>, <8, (13, 11, 12)>, <11, (6, 9, 14)>, <12, (6, 8, 13)>, <13, (8, 12, 3)>, <14, (11, 10, 1)>
