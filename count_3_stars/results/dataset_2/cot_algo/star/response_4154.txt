Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 8, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 11}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {2, 9, 12}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 7: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 10: {2, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 10}
- Node 12: {3, 4, 5, 10}
- Node 13: {2, 4, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 10, 13}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-star formations involving each of these nodes.

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: Does not form a 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 62

Therefore, the final answer is [62], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 2, 10>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 3, 10>
- <0, 6, 10>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <2, 3, 10>
- <2, 6, 10>
- <3, 6, 10>
- <5, 9, 12>
- <9, 7, 6>
- <9, 7, 3>
- <9, 7, 5>
- <9, 5, 12>
- <10, 13, 14>
- <11, 1, 0>
- <11, 1, 10>
- <11, 0, 2>
- <11, 0, 3>
- <11, 0, 8>
- <11, 10, 13>
- <13, 6, 4>
- <13, 6, 14>
- <13, 6, 10>
- <13, 4, 12>
