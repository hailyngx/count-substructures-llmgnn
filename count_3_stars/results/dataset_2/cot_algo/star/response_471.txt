Response:
To find the total number of 3-star graphs in this network, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each such node.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors and does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors and does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 2 neighbors and does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 2 neighbors and does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 2 neighbors and does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes:

1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in this network is [59]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (6, 7, 27)>, 
<2, (6, 7, 27)>, 
<2, (6, 10, 19)>, 
<2, (7, 27, 10)>, 
<2, (10, 19, 0)>, 
<4, (5, 12, 13)>, 
<5, (23, 4, 8)>, 
<6, (1, 26, 2)>, 
<9, (7, 16, 29)>, 
<12, (2, 13, 17)>, 
<15, (0, 11, 14)>, 
<19, (0, 20, 9)>, 
<20, (19, 8, 6)>, 
<21, (15, 26, 29)>
