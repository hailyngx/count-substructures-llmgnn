Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors => 4 3-stars
- Node 20 has 6 neighbors => \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors => 4 3-stars
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors => 4 3-stars
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors => 4 3-stars
- Node 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 17, 18, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 have less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 55

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [55].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:

- <7, 20, 23, 24>
- <20, 25, 3, 4>
- <20, 3, 4, 16>
- <20, 4, 16, 28>
- <8, 1, 19, 26>
- <8, 1, 19, 11>
- <8, 1, 19, 12>
- <8, 19, 11, 21>
- <8, 19, 5, 12>
- <8, 19, 0, 12>
