Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 11) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 0) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 5) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 10, 14}
- Node 1: {10, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 14}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {2, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 12}
- Node 8: {2, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 6, 12}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 7, 10}
- Node 13: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2, 9, 14 each have 6 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 3, 8 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 5, 6, 10 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- 20 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 72

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [72]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (8, 9, 13)>
- <9, (2, 6, 13)>
- <14, (0, 1, 6)>
