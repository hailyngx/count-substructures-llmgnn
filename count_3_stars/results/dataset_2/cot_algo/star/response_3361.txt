Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 22) (14, 18) (14, 20) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 27) (17, 15) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 10) (2, 7) (29, 5) (29, 11) (22, 14) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 6) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 6) (20, 14) (20, 21) (20, 28) (5, 29) (5, 23) (5, 6) (5, 27) (6, 23) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 0) (18, 14) (18, 19) (26, 2) (26, 10) (26, 4) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 24) (1, 8) (3, 22) (3, 10) (21, 20) (21, 19) (21, 4) (8, 1) (8, 12) (9, 4) (9, 11) (25, 0) (25, 11) (27, 17) (27, 5) (19, 17) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 21) (12, 2) (12, 8) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 7) (0, 17) (0, 6) (0, 25) (0, 16) (0, 24) (16, 0) (16, 13) (4, 26) (4, 21) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 2) (7, 10) (24, 1) (24, 0) (24, 13) (28, 20) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 24) (11, 29) (11, 9) (11, 25) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 17, 6, 25, 16, 24
- Node 1: 15, 10, 24, 8
- Node 2: 12, 26, 10, 7
- Node 3: 22, 10
- Node 4: 26, 21, 9, 13
- Node 5: 29, 23, 6, 27
- Node 6: 23, 15, 5, 0
- Node 7: 2, 10
- Node 8: 1, 12
- Node 9: 4, 11, 25
- Node 10: 2, 26, 1, 3, 7
- Node 11: 29, 9, 25
- Node 12: 2, 8
- Node 13: 16, 4, 24
- Node 14: 22, 18, 20
- Node 15: 17, 1, 6
- Node 16: 0, 13
- Node 17: 0, 19, 27, 15
- Node 18: 14, 19
- Node 19: 17, 22, 18, 21
- Node 20: 14, 21, 28
- Node 21: 20, 4, 19
- Node 22: 14, 23, 19, 3
- Node 23: 22, 5, 6
- Node 24: 1, 0, 13
- Node 25: 0, 11
- Node 26: 2, 10, 4
- Node 27: 17, 5
- Node 28: 20
- Node 29: 5, 11

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they can form:

- Node 0, Node 4, Node 10, Node 13, Node 19, and Node 24 have 3 neighbors or more. 
- Each of these nodes can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [6] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (6, 16, 25)>
- <4, (9, 13, 21)>
- <10, (3, 7, 26)>
- <13, (16, 24, 4)>
- <19, (18, 21, 22)>
- <24, (0, 13, 1)>
