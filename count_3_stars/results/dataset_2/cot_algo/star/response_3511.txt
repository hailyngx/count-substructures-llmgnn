Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 17) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 16) (13, 5) (13, 3) (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 9) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 19) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 12) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 11) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 3) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 3) (12, 18) (12, 0) (3, 13) (3, 16) (3, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 7, 12, 16}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 9, 15}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 8, 18}
- Node 3: {13, 14, 16}
- Node 4: {1, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 13, 19}
- Node 6: {5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 17}
- Node 8: {2, 14, 16}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 6, 17}
- Node 10: {16, 17}
- Node 11: {14, 17, 19}
- Node 12: {0, 18}
- Node 13: {3, 5}
- Node 14: {3, 8, 11}
- Node 15: {1, 14, 19}
- Node 16: {0, 3, 8, 10}
- Node 17: {7, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 18: {2, 12}
- Node 19: {5, 11, 15}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 = 5

Therefore, the final answer is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <9, (1, 4, 17)>
- <9, (4, 6, 17)>
- <9, (1, 6, 4)>
- <9, (1, 6, 17)>
- <14, (3, 8, 11)>
