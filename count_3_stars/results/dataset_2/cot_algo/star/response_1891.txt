Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

Nodes that can form a 3-star: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9

For these nodes, we will calculate the number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of \(4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 48\) 3-stars, so the answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, 3, 4>, 
<0, 3, 9>, 
<0, 4, 6>, 
<0, 4, 9>, 
<0, 6, 9>, 
<3, 4, 9>, 
<3, 8, 9>, 
<4, 5, 6>, 
<5, 8, 9>, 
<8, 9, 7>.
