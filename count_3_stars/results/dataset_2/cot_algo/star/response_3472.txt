Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 16) (9, 27) (26, 21) (26, 0) (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 21) (27, 9) (27, 15) (27, 25) (27, 1) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 3) (21, 26) (21, 15) (21, 5) (21, 14) (4, 0) (4, 17) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 2) (11, 28) (11, 29) (28, 11) (28, 14) (28, 10) (0, 26) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (25, 27) (25, 6) (25, 29) (16, 9) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 22) (16, 18) (23, 5) (23, 6) (19, 15) (19, 10) (22, 16) (22, 10) (22, 17) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 18) (5, 21) (5, 23) (5, 17) (2, 20) (2, 24) (14, 21) (14, 28) (14, 18) (17, 4) (17, 16) (17, 22) (17, 5) (12, 20) (12, 3) (12, 24) (12, 18) (6, 25) (6, 23) (6, 13) (18, 16) (18, 3) (18, 14) (18, 12) (24, 2) (24, 12) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 1) (29, 11) (29, 25) (1, 27) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 10) (10, 28) (10, 19) (10, 22) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 26
- Node 1: 0, 10, 13, 27
- Node 2: 12, 20, 24
- Node 3: 7, 12, 13, 18
- Node 4: 0, 16, 17
- Node 5: 17, 21, 23
- Node 6: 13, 23, 25
- Node 7: 0, 3, 16
- Node 9: 16, 27
- Node 10: 1, 19, 22, 28
- Node 11: 28, 29
- Node 12: 2, 3, 18, 20, 24
- Node 13: 1, 3, 6
- Node 14: 18, 21, 28
- Node 15: 19, 20, 21, 27
- Node 16: 4, 7, 9, 17, 18, 22
- Node 17: 4, 5, 16, 21, 22
- Node 18: 3, 12, 14, 16
- Node 19: 10, 15
- Node 20: 2, 12, 15
- Node 21: 5, 14, 15, 16
- Node 22: 10, 16, 17
- Node 23: 5, 6
- Node 24: 2, 12
- Node 25: 6, 27, 29
- Node 26: 0, 21
- Node 27: 1, 9, 15, 25
- Node 28: 10, 11, 14
- Node 29: 11, 25

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 5 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 4 neighbors
- Node 16: 6 neighbors
- Node 17: 5 neighbors
- Node 18: 4 neighbors
- Node 21: 4 neighbors
- Node 25: 3 neighbors
- Node 27: 4 neighbors
- Node 28: 3 neighbors

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:

- Nodes forming a 3-star: 0, 1, 3, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 25, 27, 28
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{15}{3} = 455 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [455].
