Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 13) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 8) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 16) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 5) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 5) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 17) (2, 10) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 1) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 18) (18, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 10) (5, 1) (12, 19) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph as an adjacency list to better visualize the connections:

1: {11, 16, 5}  
2: {17, 10}  
3: {15, 9, 5}  
4: {8, 0, 16}  
5: {3, 14, 10, 1}  
6: {9, 10}  
7: {15, 8, 19, 18}  
8: {13, 4, 0, 7}  
9: {3, 6, 17, 13}  
10: {6, 0, 2, 5}  
11: {1, 19}  
12: {19}  
13: {9, 17, 8}  
14: {19, 5}  
15: {3, 7}  
16: {17, 4, 1}  
17: {9, 13, 16, 2}  
18: {7}  
19: {14, 0, 11, 7, 12}  

Now, let's analyze each node to find the number of 3-stars it participates in:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (8, 4, 19) => [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (9, 15, 5) => [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (3, 14, 10, 1) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (15, 8, 19, 18) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (13, 4, 0, 7) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (3, 6, 17, 13) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 10: 4 neighbors (6, 0, 2, 5) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 11: 2 neighbors (1, 19) => [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 12: 1 neighbor (19) => 0
- Node 13: 3 neighbors (9, 17, 8) => [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 14: 2 neighbors (19, 5) => [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 15: 2 neighbors (3, 7) => 0
- Node 16: 3 neighbors (17, 4, 1) => [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 17: 4 neighbors (9, 13, 16, 2) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 18: 1 neighbor (7) => 0
- Node 19: 5 neighbors (14, 0, 11, 7, 12) => [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 10 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 19>, <3, 9, 15>, <3, 9, 5>, <3, 15, 7>, <3, 9, 6>, <3, 9, 17>, <3, 9, 13>, <3, 6, 10>, <5, 14, 10>, <5, 14, 1>, <5, 10, 1>, <15, 7, 18>, <15, 8, 7>, <15, 8, 19>, <8, 13, 4>, <8, 13, 17>, <8, 13, 7>, <8, 4, 0>, <9, 13, 17>, <9, 13, 8>, <9, 17, 16>, <9, 17, 2>, <9, 17, 13>, <9, 6, 10>, <10, 6, 0>, <10, 6, 2>, <10, 5, 1>, <13, 17, 16>, <17, 16, 4>.
