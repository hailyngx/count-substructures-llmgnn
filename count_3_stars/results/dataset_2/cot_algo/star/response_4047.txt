Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 1 does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 3 does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 4 forms one 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 5 does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 6 does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 8 forms one 3-star: <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 does not form any 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors).

Thus, there are 3 unique 3-stars in total. 
So, the final answer is [3].
