Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 13) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 13) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 2) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 3) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 12, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 8, 11}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 6, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 6, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 10, 11}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 10}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 11}
- Node 7: Neighbors {8, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 7, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 7, 11, 14, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 7, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 3, 12, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {2, 8, 9, 11, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 70

Therefore, the final answer is [70].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (1, 8, 11)>
- <8, (1, 11, 14)>
- <9, (2, 7, 11)>
- <11, (1, 8, 14)>
- <12, (7, 8, 9)>
- <14, (8, 9, 13)>
