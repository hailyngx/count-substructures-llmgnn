Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then, for each such node, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9.

1. Node 0:
   - Neighbors: 9, 3, 4, 8
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>

2. Node 1:
   - Neighbors: 5, 9, 3, 8
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>

3. Node 2:
   - Neighbors: 5, 6, 3, 4
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>

4. Node 3:
   - Neighbors: 1, 0, 7, 2
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>

5. Node 5:
   - Neighbors: 9, 6, 2, 8, 1
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>

6. Node 6:
   - Neighbors: 5, 9, 7, 2
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 2, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>

7. Node 8:
   - Neighbors: 5, 9, 1, 0
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>

8. Node 9:
   - Neighbors: 5, 6, 8, 1, 0
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 44 \). 
So, the final answer is [44].
