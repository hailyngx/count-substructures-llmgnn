Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 0) (2, 12) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 0) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 13) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 12) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 14) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 10) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by identifying the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 2, 13, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 13, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors {12, 7, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {8, 11, 10}
- Node 4: Neighbors {12, 9, 6, 14, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors {13, 14, 10}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 7, 4, 0, 11}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 2, 8, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {10, 3, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 4, 11, 1, 0}
- Node 10: Neighbors {8, 3, 4, 5, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {6, 9, 3, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 13, 4, 11, 1}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 7, 12, 0, 1}
- Node 14: Neighbors {5, 4, 10}

Now, let's find the number of 3-star configurations:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12 (a total of 6 nodes).

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 4: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 5: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 6: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 10: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 12: [5 choose 3] = 10

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 45

Therefore, the final result is [45], and the unique 3-star configurations found are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 10, 12)>
<5, (10, 13, 14)>
<6, (0, 9, 11)>
<10, (4, 5, 14)>
<12, (1, 11, 13)>
