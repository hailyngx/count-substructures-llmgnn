Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 6) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 7) (1, 11) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 6) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {3, 14}
- Node 1: {2, 7, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 4: {8, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 9, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 10: {5, 6, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 13: {4, 5, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 4, 5}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars by using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the final answer is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (7, 11, 14)>
- <1, (2, 7, 12)>
- <1, (2, 7, 14)>
- <1, (7, 12, 14)>
- <1, (11, 12, 14)>
- <2, (3, 7, 12)>
- <3, (6, 10, 12)>
- <12, (1, 6, 11)>
