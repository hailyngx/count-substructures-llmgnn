Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 15) (22, 13) (22, 19) (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 3) (26, 8) (0, 10) (27, 25) (27, 10) (27, 17) (27, 5) (7, 21) (7, 6) (7, 23) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 12) (21, 17) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 26) (8, 23) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 18) (23, 7) (23, 8) (23, 14) (2, 14) (18, 6) (18, 25) (18, 29) (28, 29) (29, 18) (29, 28) (29, 17) (29, 24) (17, 27) (17, 21) (17, 6) (17, 29) (24, 26) (24, 29) (24, 4) (24, 1) (24, 5) (20, 19) (20, 16) (25, 27) (25, 18) (5, 26) (5, 27) (5, 24) (4, 24) (4, 12) (4, 15) (4, 3) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 4) (19, 22) (19, 20) (10, 0) (10, 27) (10, 16) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 24) (1, 14) (14, 23) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 15) (3, 26) (3, 4) (16, 20) (16, 10) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {10}
- Node 1: {13, 7, 24, 14}
- Node 2: {14}
- Node 3: {26, 4}
- Node 4: {26, 12, 15, 3}
- Node 5: {26, 27, 24}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 17, 18}
- Node 7: {21, 6, 23, 1}
- Node 8: {13, 9, 26, 23}
- Node 9: {6, 26, 8, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 27, 16}
- Node 12: {9, 21, 4}
- Node 13: {22, 8, 1, 15}
- Node 14: {2, 23, 1, 15}
- Node 15: {13, 4, 14}
- Node 16: {20, 10}
- Node 17: {27, 21, 6, 29}
- Node 18: {6, 25, 29}
- Node 19: {22, 20}
- Node 20: {19, 16}
- Node 21: {7, 12, 17}
- Node 22: {13, 19}
- Node 23: {7, 8, 14}
- Node 24: {26, 29, 4, 1, 5}
- Node 25: {27, 18}
- Node 26: {9, 24, 5, 3, 8}
- Node 27: {25, 10, 5, 17}
- Node 28: {29}
- Node 29: {18, 28, 17, 24}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form a 3-star: <1, 13, 15, 14>
- Node 4 can form a 3-star: <4, 12, 15, 3>
- Node 5 can form a 3-star: <5, 26, 24>
- Node 6 can form a 3-star: <6, 7, 17, 18>, <6, 9, 12, 21>
- Node 8 can form a 3-star: <8, 13, 26, 23>
- Node 9 can form a 3-star: <9, 26, 8, 12>
- Node 13 can form a 3-star: <13, 8, 15, 4>
- Node 14 can form a 3-star: <14, 15, 1, 13>
- Node 15 can form a 3-star: <15, 1, 13, 4>
- Node 16 can form a 3-star: <16, 10, 27, 20>
- Node 17 can form a 3-star: <17, 27, 21, 29>
- Node 18 can form a 3-star: <18, 25, 29, 17>
- Node 24 can form a 3-star: <24, 26, 5, 29>
- Node 26 can form a 3-star: <26, 24, 5, 29>
- Node 27 can form a 3-star: <27, 10, 25, 17>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we get a total of 15 combinations. So, the final total number of 3-stars is [15].
