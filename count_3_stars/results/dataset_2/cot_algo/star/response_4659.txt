Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars 
- Node 16 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars 
- Node 17 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars 
- Node 21 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars 
- Node 23 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars 
- Node 27 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars 

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the final number to put inside brackets is [42].
