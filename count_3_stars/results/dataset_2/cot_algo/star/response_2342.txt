Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 10) (27, 11) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 22) (0, 5) (10, 27) (10, 19) (10, 9) (11, 15) (11, 27) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 26) (23, 8) (23, 5) (23, 29) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 25) (17, 29) (17, 22) (17, 7) (29, 23) (29, 17) (29, 13) (29, 18) (19, 10) (19, 26) (19, 16) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 2) (9, 10) (22, 0) (22, 17) (24, 8) (24, 4) (24, 1) (24, 14) (5, 0) (5, 23) (5, 21) (13, 29) (16, 19) (16, 28) (16, 3) (28, 0) (28, 16) (28, 2) (20, 2) (20, 6) (7, 17) (7, 25) (7, 18) (25, 4) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 18) (1, 24) (1, 25) (1, 14) (1, 12) (6, 20) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (14, 24) (14, 1) (14, 3) (2, 26) (2, 28) (2, 20) (2, 3) (2, 21) (21, 5) (21, 2) (18, 29) (18, 7) (18, 25) (18, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 18) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {15, 28, 22, 5}
Node 1: {24, 25, 14, 12}
Node 2: {26, 28, 20, 3, 21}
Node 3: {16, 14, 2, 12}
Node 4: {8, 24, 25}
Node 5: {0, 23, 21}
Node 6: {20}
Node 7: {17, 25, 18}
Node 8: {23, 4, 24, 26}
Node 9: {10}
Node 10: {27, 19, 9}
Node 11: {15, 27}
Node 12: {1, 3, 18}
Node 13: {29}
Node 14: {24, 1, 3}
Node 15: {27, 0, 11}
Node 16: {19, 28, 3}
Node 17: {29, 22, 7}
Node 18: {29, 7, 25, 12}
Node 19: {10, 26, 16}
Node 20: {2, 6}
Node 21: {5, 2}
Node 22: {0, 17}
Node 23: {8, 5, 29}
Node 24: {8, 4, 1, 14}
Node 25: {4, 7, 1, 18}
Node 26: {8, 19, 2}
Node 27: {15, 10, 11}
Node 28: {0, 16, 2}
Node 29: {23, 13, 17, 18}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars: nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 29.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate how many 3-stars they can form:

\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = \binom{n}{3} \]
where \( n \) is the number of neighbors of the node.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from all these nodes, we get:
\[ [99] \]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars formed by these nodes:
<0, 15, 28>, <0, 15, 22>, <0, 15, 5>, <0, 28, 22>, <0, 28, 5>, <0, 22, 5>, <2, 26, 28>, <2, 26, 20>, <2, 26, 3>, <2, 26, 21>, <2, 28, 20>, <2, 28, 3>, <2, 28, 21>, <2, 20, 3>, <2, 20, 21>, <2, 3, 21>, <3, 16, 28>, <3, 16, 2>, <3, 16, 2...
