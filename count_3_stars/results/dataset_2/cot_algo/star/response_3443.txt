Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 10) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {4, 9, 14}
Node 1: {7, 3, 11, 13}
Node 2: {6, 10, 11}
Node 3: {7, 1, 8}
Node 4: {9, 13, 0, 5, 6}
Node 5: {4, 7, 8, 13, 10}
Node 6: {4, 9, 14, 2}
Node 7: {3, 5, 13, 1}
Node 8: {3, 5, 10, 11}
Node 9: {4, 6, 0, 12, 11}
Node 10: {8, 2, 5}
Node 11: {1, 8, 9, 2, 12}
Node 12: {13, 9, 14, 11}
Node 13: {4, 7, 1, 5, 12}
Node 14: {6, 0, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes 4, 6, 9, 11, and 13 have 5 neighbors each. 

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 \). 

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (9, 13, 0)>, <4, (9, 13, 5)>, <4, (9, 0, 5)>, <4, (13, 0, 5)>, <4, (6, 9, 13)>, <4, (6, 9, 0)>, <4, (6, 13, 0)>, <4, (6, 13, 5)>, <6, (9, 14, 2)>, <6, (9, 14, 12)>, <6, (9, 2, 12)>, <9, (6, 0, 12)>, <9, (6, 14, 12)>, <11, (9, 12, 14)>, <11, (9, 12, 2)>, <11, (9, 14, 2)>, <11, (12, 14, 2)>, <13, (9, 12, 14)>, <13, (9, 12, 11)>, <13, (9, 14, 11)>, <13, (12, 14, 11)>
