Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (6, 7) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 13) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 3, 14)>
<1, (4, 10, 13)>
<1, (8, 12, 14)>
<1, (10, 11, 13)>
<1, (12, 13, 14)>
<3, (5, 7, 14)>
<3, (7, 10, 14)>
<3, (10, 12, 14)>
<4, (1, 8, 14)>
<4, (1, 10, 12)>
<7, (0, 5, 14)>
<7, (0, 12, 14)>
<7, (3, 5, 14)>
<9, (5, 10, 12)>
<9, (5, 12, 13)>
<9, (9, 10, 11)>
