Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 18) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (10, 13) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 0) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 18) (19, 15) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 18) (2, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 11) (18, 13) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are connected to each node. 

For each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 17, and 16.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 2, 14, and 12.
- Node 2 is connected to node 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 6, 9, and 12.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 15, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 18.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 17, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 13, 5, 11, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 16, and 11.
- Node 10 is connected to node 13.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 8, 14, 9, and 11.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 3, 1, 16, and 18.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 17, 10, and 18.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1 and 11.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 19, 4.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 0, 12, 18, and 9.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 7, 13, 0, and 17.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 13, 16, 12, and 6.
- Node 19 is connected to node 15.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes (15, 9, 12) <3, (15, 9, 12)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes (15, 9, 7) <4, (15, 9, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 8, 17) <7, (1, 8, 17)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 13, 17) <8, (0, 13, 17)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes (16, 11, 4) <9, (16, 11, 4)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes (16, 18, 3) <12, (16, 18, 3)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes (17, 18, 10) <13, (17, 18, 10)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes (18, 12, 9) <16, (18, 12, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
