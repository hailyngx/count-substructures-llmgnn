Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 0) (15, 3) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 12) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 7) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 1) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 12) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 19) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (14, 19) (4, 15) (4, 10) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, we will construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the provided edges:

- Node 0: {3, 6, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 1: {7, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 18}
- Node 3: {0, 15}
- Node 4: {5, 10, 15}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 17, 18}
- Node 6: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6, 17}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 11, 19}
- Node 9: {6, 12, 16}
- Node 10: {4, 12, 13, 18}
- Node 11: {8, 16}
- Node 12: {9, 10, 16, 19}
- Node 13: {0, 10}
- Node 14: {19}
- Node 15: {3, 4}
- Node 16: {9, 11, 12, 18}
- Node 17: {5, 7}
- Node 18: {2, 5, 10, 16}
- Node 19: {8, 12, 14}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 16: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
\[
\text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 38
\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [38]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 6, 7, 8>
- <0, 6, 7, 13>
- <0, 6, 8, 13>
- <0, 7, 8, 13>
- <4, 10, 12, 18>
- <5, 10, 12, 18>
- <7, 8, 11, 19>
- <7, 10, 12, 18>
- <8, 10, 12, 18>
- <10, 12, 16, 18>
