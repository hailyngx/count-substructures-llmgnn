Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 22) (1, 12) (21, 13) (21, 29) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 13) (27, 12) (27, 19) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 28) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 19) (22, 1) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 24) (23, 22) (23, 12) (12, 1) (12, 27) (12, 17) (12, 23) (28, 14) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 3) (29, 21) (29, 28) (29, 16) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 15) (6, 14) (6, 22) (6, 5) (6, 8) (13, 21) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) (26, 3) (26, 7) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 13) (11, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (3, 0) (3, 28) (3, 26) (3, 7) (3, 18) (16, 17) (16, 29) (16, 10) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 20) (19, 27) (19, 17) (19, 18) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 24) (15, 4) (7, 26) (7, 3) (7, 10) (2, 13) (2, 10) (20, 18) (10, 16) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 4) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 10) (24, 22) (24, 15) 

Response:
The nodes in the given graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29}.

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 11, 13, 15}
- Node 1: {4, 12, 22}
- Node 2: {10, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 18, 26, 28}
- Node 4: {1, 10, 11, 14, 15}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 15}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 14, 22}
- Node 7: {3, 10, 26}
- Node 8: {5, 6}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 7, 10}
- Node 11: {0, 4, 13, 28}
- Node 12: {1, 17, 23, 27}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 11, 21}
- Node 14: {4, 6, 17, 28}
- Node 15: {0, 4, 5, 24}
- Node 16: {10, 17, 29}
- Node 17: {12, 14, 16, 19}
- Node 18: {3, 19, 20}
- Node 19: {17, 18, 27}
- Node 20: {18}
- Node 21: {13, 29}
- Node 22: {1, 6, 23, 24}
- Node 23: {12, 22}
- Node 24: {15, 22}
- Node 26: {3, 7}
- Node 27: {12, 19}
- Node 28: {3, 11, 14, 29}
- Node 29: {16, 21, 28}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 1: [1] (Only has 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: [1] (Only has 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: [1] (Only has 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: [1] (Only has 3 neighbors)
- Node 17: [1] (Only has 3 neighbors)
- Node 22: [1] (Only has 3 neighbors)
- Node 28: [1] (Only has 3 neighbors)
- Node 0, 3, 6, 10, 13, 15, 16, 19, 27, 29: [0] (Less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of unique 3-stars: [7]

Unique 3-stars: <1, (4, 12, 22)>, <4, (1, 11, 13)>, <11, (0, 4, 28)>, <14, (6, 17, 28)>, <17, (12, 16, 19)>, <22, (1, 6, 24)>, <28, (3, 11, 29)>
