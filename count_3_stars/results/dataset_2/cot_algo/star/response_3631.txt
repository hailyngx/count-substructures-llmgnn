Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0, with 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1, with 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3, with 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4, with 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6, with 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8, with 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9, with 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 49.

Therefore, the final answer is [49], and the list of unique 3-stars is:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>
