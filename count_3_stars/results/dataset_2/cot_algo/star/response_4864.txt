This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 29) (7, 17) (7, 8) (18, 22) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 21) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 24) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 23) (27, 25) (27, 9) (27, 1) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 6) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 1) (20, 13) (20, 6) (26, 22) (26, 8) (1, 27) (1, 20) (1, 17) (17, 7) (17, 20) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 19) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 28) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 2) (25, 27) (25, 8) (16, 0) (28, 3) (28, 13) (28, 10) (9, 27) (9, 15) (9, 21) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 2) (5, 21) (5, 14) (29, 7) (29, 24) (29, 21) (23, 12) (13, 20) (13, 28) (13, 21) (21, 18) (21, 9) (21, 5) (21, 29) (21, 13) (8, 7) (8, 26) (8, 25) (8, 6) (14, 5) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 9) (19, 17) (19, 10) (6, 0) (6, 20) (6, 8) (10, 28) (10, 19) (24, 22) (24, 29) 

Response:
First, we need to create a visualization of the graph to better understand its structure and identify any 3-stars within it. 

The graph visualization will help us identify which nodes are connected and how. Let's first draw the graph:

Edges: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 29) (7, 17) (7, 8) (18, 22) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 21) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 24) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 23) (27, 25) (27, 9) (27, 1) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 6) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 1) (20, 13) (20, 6) (26, 22) (26, 8) (1, 27) (1, 20) (1, 17) (17, 7) (17, 20) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 19) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 28) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 2) (25, 27) (25, 8) (16, 0) (28, 3) (28, 13) (28, 10) (9, 27) (9, 15) (9, 21) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 2) (5, 21) (5, 14) (29, 7) (29, 24) (29, 21) (23, 12) (13, 20) (13, 28) (13, 21) (21, 18) (21, 9) (21, 5) (21, 29) (21, 13) (8, 7) (8, 26) (8, 25) (8, 6) (14, 5) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 9) (19, 17) (19, 10) (6, 0) (6, 20) (6, 8) (10, 28) (10, 19) (24, 22) (24, 29)
```

Now, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {20, 16, 15, 6}
- Node 1: {27, 20, 17}
- Node 2: {4, 11, 5}
- Node 3: {17, 11, 28}
- Node 4: {7, 12, 11, 2}
- Node 5: {2, 21, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 20, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 29, 17, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 26, 25, 6}
- Node 9: {27, 15, 21}
- Node 10: {28, 19}
- Node 11: {4, 3, 2}
- Node 12: {4, 18, 23}
- Node 13: {20, 28, 21}
- Node 14: {5}
- Node 15: {18, 0, 9}
- Node 16: {0}
- Node 17: {7, 20, 1, 3, 19}
- Node 18: {22, 15, 12, 21}
- Node 19: {17, 10}
- Node 20: {0, 17, 1, 13, 6}
- Node 21: {18, 9, 5, 29, 13}
- Node 22: {18, 26, 24}
- Node 23: {12}
- Node 24: {22, 29}
- Node 25: {27, 8}
- Node 26: {22, 8}
- Node 27: {25, 9, 1}
- Node 28: {3, 13, 10}
- Node 29: {7, 24, 21}

Now, let's calculate the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. 

We find that nodes 4, 7, 17, 20, 21, and 22 have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of them.

Let's calculate:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, 2, 11>
- <4, 11, 7>
- <4, 7, 17>
- <7, 4, 12>
- <7, 4, 11>
- <7, 4, 2>
- <17, 7, 29>
- <17, 7, 20>
- <17, 7, 1>
- <17, 7, 3>
- <17, 20, 1>
- <20, 1, 27>
- <20, 1, 17>
- <20, 1, 13>
- <20, 1, 6>
- <20, 17, 7>
- <21, 18, 22>
