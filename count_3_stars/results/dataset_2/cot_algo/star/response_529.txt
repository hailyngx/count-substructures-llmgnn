Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 18) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 8) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 11) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 10) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 17) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 6) (17, 18) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 16) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 19) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 12) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 8) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a visual representation of the graph based on the given edges:

```
   1 -- 3 -- 11    4 -- 9 -- 2
   |              / |            \
   |             /  |             \
   0 -- 15 -- 16 -- 18 -- 17 -- 6--19 -- 7
    \    |     |      |          |     /
     \   |     |      |          |    /
       14 -- 13       5 -- 8  --  12
``` 

Next, let's find all the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 8, 14, 15}
- Node 1: {3, 11}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 18}
- Node 3: {1, 11, 18}
- Node 4: {9, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 8, 19}
- Node 6: {7, 13, 17}
- Node 7: {6, 13, 19}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 12, 15}
- Node 9: {2, 4}
- Node 10: {11, 16}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 10}
- Node 12: {4, 8, 18}
- Node 13: {6, 7, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 4, 13}
- Node 15: {0, 8, 16}
- Node 16: {10, 15, 18, 19}
- Node 17: {6, 18}
- Node 18: {2, 3, 12, 16, 17}
- Node 19: {5, 7, 16}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 does not form a 3-star as it only has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star <3, (1, 11, 18)>.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star <5, (0, 2, 8)>.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star <6, (7, 13, 17)>.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star <8, (0, 5, 15)>.
- Node 16 forms a 3-star <16, (10, 15, 19)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, so [5].
