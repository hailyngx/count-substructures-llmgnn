Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 0) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 12) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7) (0, 11) (0, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are shown below:
1: (10, 13, 7)
2: (9, 4, 12)
3: (8, 7, 14, 12)
4: (5, 6, 8, 2)
5: (9, 6, 13, 4, 10)
6: (5, 9, 7, 4)
7: (9, 6, 11, 3, 1)
8: (11, 4, 14, 3)
9: (5, 6, 2, 7)
10: (5, 11, 13, 1)
11: (10, 14, 7, 0, 8)
12: (3, 2, 14)
13: (5, 6, 10, 1, 0)
14: (11, 8, 3, 12)

Node 5, Node 6, and Node 9 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
Therefore, there are 3 * 10 = 30 3-stars in total. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 6, 13)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
<10, (5, 11, 13)>
