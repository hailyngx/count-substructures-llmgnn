Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 0, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {7, 3}

Now let's count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>
