Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {4, 7, 2, 3}
- Node 1: neighbors {6, 2, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {7, 5, 1, 0}
- Node 3: neighbors {6, 0, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {7, 9, 0, 5, 6}
- Node 5: neighbors {4, 6, 2, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 7, 5, 1, 3}
- Node 7: neighbors {4, 6, 0, 9, 8, 2}
- Node 8: neighbors {7, 5}
- Node 9: neighbors {4, 7, 3, 1}

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 also has 5 neighbors, contributing 10 more 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, contributing 20 more 3-stars. 

Total 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (0, 5, 6)>, <6, (4, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>
