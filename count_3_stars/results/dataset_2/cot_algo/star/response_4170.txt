Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 27) (13, 18) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 21) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 28) (2, 15) (29, 2) (29, 16) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 25) (7, 11) (7, 9) (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 20) (23, 0) (8, 1) (18, 13) (18, 22) (18, 3) (15, 2) (15, 26) (15, 14) (20, 11) (20, 19) (20, 16) (0, 23) (0, 14) (0, 26) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 5) (19, 20) (19, 26) (19, 27) (26, 15) (26, 0) (26, 19) (26, 5) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 26) (5, 24) (6, 13) (28, 2) (28, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 25) (1, 12) (3, 18) (3, 21) (21, 22) (21, 10) (21, 3) (21, 27) (17, 16) (17, 27) (25, 4) (25, 1) (25, 12) (16, 29) (16, 10) (16, 20) (16, 17) (24, 5) (24, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 24) (27, 13) (27, 19) (27, 21) (27, 17) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 25) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges provided, let's follow the steps as described earlier to find the number of unique 3-stars formed:

### Step 1: Find the list of neighbors for each node:
1. Node 0: {23, 14, 26}
2. Node 1: {10, 8, 25, 12}
3. Node 2: {29, 5, 28, 15}
4. Node 3: {18, 21}
5. Node 4: {9, 28, 25}
6. Node 5: {2, 14, 26, 24}
7. Node 6: {13}
8. Node 7: {11, 9}
9. Node 8: {1}
10. Node 9: {4, 7, 24}
11. Node 10: {11, 21, 1, 16}
12. Node 11: {7, 12, 10, 20}
13. Node 12: {13, 11, 1, 25}
14. Node 13: {22, 12, 27, 18, 6}
15. Node 14: {15, 0, 5}
16. Node 15: {2, 26, 14}
17. Node 16: {29, 10, 20, 17}
18. Node 17: {16, 27}
19. Node 18: {13, 22, 3}
20. Node 19: {20, 26, 27}
21. Node 20: {10, 19, 16, 11}
22. Node 21: {22, 10, 3, 27}
23. Node 22: {13, 18, 21}
24. Node 23: {0}
25. Node 24: {5, 9}
26. Node 25: {4, 1, 12}
27. Node 26: {15, 0, 19, 5}
28. Node 27: {13, 21, 19, 17}
29. Node 28: {2, 4}
30. Node 29: {2, 16}

### Step 2: Identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21, 26, 27

### Step 3: Calculate the number of unique 3-stars:
For nodes with 3 neighbors (1 way to form 3-star), count = 1 * 14 = 14
For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, number of 3-stars = \( \binom{n}{3} \):
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} \]
\[ = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 \]
\[ = 78 \]

Adding both cases: 14 + 78 = 92

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [92].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 14, 26>, <1, 10, 25>, <1, 10, 12>, <1, 12, 25>, <2, 5, 28>, <2, 5, 15>, <2, 15, 28>, <2, 15, 14>, <4, 9, 24>, <5, 14, 26>, <10, 16, 20>, <10, 16, 29>, <10, 20, 29>, <10, 20, 19>, <15, 14, 26>, <16, 20, 29>, <16, 17, 27>, <20, 19, 27>, <20, 27, 19>, <24, 9, 5>, <26, 14, 0>
