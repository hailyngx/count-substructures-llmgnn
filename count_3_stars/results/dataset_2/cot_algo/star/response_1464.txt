Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 2}
- Node 1: {7, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {9, 1, 3, 8, 5, 0}
- Node 3: {9, 7, 2}
- Node 4: {7, 0}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 1, 8, 2}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 4, 3, 5, 1}
- Node 8: {9, 1, 2, 5}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 2, 3, 0}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 1 have 4 or more neighbors, so they form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 5 and Node 8 also have 5 or more neighbors, so they form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

Adding these up:
4 (from Node 0) + 4 (from Node 1) + 10 (from Node 5) + 10 (from Node 8) = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (9, 2, 4)>
<1, (7, 2, 5)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
