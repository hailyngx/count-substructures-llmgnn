Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (3, 8) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 4) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 7}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 54 3-stars, which we'll represent as [54].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
