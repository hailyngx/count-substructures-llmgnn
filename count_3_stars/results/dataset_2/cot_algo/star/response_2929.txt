Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 17) (6, 1) (9, 16) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 10) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 18) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 14) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 7) (18, 15) (18, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 7) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 19) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 19) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 7) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (4, 11) (4, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 16, 10, 7
- Node 1: 6, 14, 12, 8
- Node 3: 5, 8
- Node 4: 11, 12
- Node 5: 11, 3, 13, 19
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 15, 17, 0, 19
- Node 8: 3, 1, 13, 19, 10
- Node 9: 16, 12
- Node 10: 15, 8, 17, 0, 14
- Node 11: 16, 5, 4
- Node 12: 9, 1, 4
- Node 13: 16, 8, 5, 18
- Node 14: 1, 10
- Node 15: 10, 7, 18, 17
- Node 16: 11, 0, 9, 13
- Node 17: 15, 10, 7
- Node 18: 15, 13
- Node 19: 8, 5, 7

Now, we can identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 5, Node 7, Node 8, Node 10, Node 13, Node 15, and Node 19 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (16, 10, 7)>, <5, (11, 3, 13)>, <7, (15, 17, 0)>, <8, (3, 1, 13)>, <10, (15, 8, 17)>, <13, (16, 8, 5)>, <15, (10, 7, 18)>, <19, (8, 5, 7)>
