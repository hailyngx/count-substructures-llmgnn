Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 4) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 12) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 1) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 7) (1, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 5, 3, 12, 4  
Node 1: 9, 12, 7, 10  
Node 2: 3, 12, 14, 7  
Node 3: 7, 0, 10, 2  
Node 4: 6, 13, 0  
Node 5: 6, 8, 12, 7, 0  
Node 6: 5, 14, 10, 4  
Node 7: 13, 5, 3, 2, 1  
Node 8: 9, 13, 5, 12  
Node 9: 8, 14, 1  
Node 10: 6, 13, 3, 1  
Node 12: 8, 5, 2, 14, 0, 1  
Node 13: 8, 4, 10, 14, 7  
Node 14: 6, 9, 13, 2, 12  

Now, let's identify the nodes having three or more neighbors:  
Nodes with 3 neighbors: None  
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10  
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 5, 6, 8  
Nodes with 6 neighbors: 12, 13, 14  

For nodes with 4 or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of unique 3-stars each node can form:
Nodes with 4 neighbors can form [1] 3-star.  
Nodes with 5 neighbors can form [5 choose 3] = [10] 3-stars.  
Nodes with 6 neighbors can form [6 choose 3] = [20] 3-stars.  

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 10 + 20] = [31].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (5, 3, 12)>  
<1, (9, 12, 7)>  
<2, (3, 12, 14)>  
<3, (7, 0, 10)>  
<4, (6, 13, 0)>  
<5, (6, 8, 12)>  
<6, (5, 14, 10)>  
<8, (9, 13, 5)>  
<9, (8, 14, 1)>  
<10, (6, 13, 3)>  
<12, (8, 5, 14)>  
<13, (8, 7, 14)>  
<14, (9, 13, 2)>
