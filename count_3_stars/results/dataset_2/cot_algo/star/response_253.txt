Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 26) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 23) (16, 26) (15, 27) (15, 6) (15, 25) (15, 24) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 1) (20, 27) (20, 25) (20, 23) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 12) (25, 10) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 25) (12, 7) (12, 29) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 10) (1, 27) (1, 19) (26, 11) (26, 16) (26, 22) (21, 0) (28, 14) (22, 26) (22, 19) (22, 10) (22, 24) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 17) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 29) (19, 1) (19, 22) (23, 16) (23, 20) (23, 29) (23, 0) (2, 11) (2, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (14, 28) (14, 3) (14, 8) (24, 15) (24, 22) (24, 29) (0, 21) (0, 23) (0, 6) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 10) (29, 12) (29, 3) (29, 23) (29, 24) (10, 25) (10, 7) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 9) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {21, 23, 6}
- Node 1: {27, 19}
- Node 2: {11, 5}
- Node 3: {17, 14, 29}
- Node 4: {18, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 8}
- Node 6: {15, 0, 4}
- Node 7: {12, 10, 18, 13, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 14}
- Node 9: {7, 17, 10}
- Node 10: {25, 7, 18, 22, 9}
- Node 11: {16, 13, 26, 2}
- Node 12: {25, 7, 29}
- Node 13: {11, 7, 17}
- Node 14: {28, 3, 8}
- Node 15: {27, 6, 25, 24}
- Node 16: {11, 23, 26}
- Node 17: {13, 3, 9}
- Node 18: {7, 4, 10}
- Node 19: {1, 22}
- Node 20: {27, 25, 23}
- Node 21: {0}
- Node 22: {26, 19, 10, 24}
- Node 23: {16, 20, 29, 0}
- Node 24: {15, 22, 29}
- Node 25: {15, 20, 12, 10}
- Node 26: {11, 16, 22}
- Node 27: {15, 1, 20}
- Node 28: {14}
- Node 29: {12, 3, 23, 24}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 6, 12, 13, 22, 23, and 25 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

- In this case, we have 6 nodes that can form 3-stars.
- Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node:
  - Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 

\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <6, (15, 0, 24)>
- <12, (25, 7, 10)>
- <13, (11, 7, 17)>
- <22, (26, 19, 10)>
- <23, (16, 20, 29)>
- <25, (15, 20, 10)>
