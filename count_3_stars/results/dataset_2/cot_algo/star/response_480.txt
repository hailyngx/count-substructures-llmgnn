Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 3, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 1, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {9, 8, 0, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 4, 7, 3, 2}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 6, 8, 2}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 3, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 7, 0}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [49].
