This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 24) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 20) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 21) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 11) (28, 13) (29, 28) (29, 12) (6, 28) (6, 7) (6, 26) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 21) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 7) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 14) (22, 16) (22, 15) (17, 19) (17, 27) (20, 3) (20, 26) (5, 19) (5, 7) (5, 27) (19, 2) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 16) (8, 9) (8, 0) (23, 11) (10, 21) (10, 13) (10, 24) (21, 18) (21, 11) (21, 10) (21, 0) (4, 22) (12, 29) (13, 28) (13, 10) (13, 15) (26, 6) (26, 20) (26, 16) (26, 7) (16, 22) (16, 19) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 25) (24, 1) (24, 10) (24, 16) (25, 9) (25, 16) (14, 3) (14, 22) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 26) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 21) (0, 15) (15, 22) (15, 13) (15, 0) (27, 17) (27, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 1: Neighbors = {2, 3, 18, 24}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {1, 18, 19}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 14, 20}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {22}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {7, 19, 27}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {7, 26, 28}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9, 26}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {7, 8, 22, 25}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {13, 21, 24}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {0, 11, 21, 23, 28}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {29}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {10, 15, 28}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {3, 22}
- Node 15: Neighbors = {0, 13, 22}
- Node 16: Neighbors = {19, 22, 24, 25, 26}
- Node 17: Neighbors = {19, 27}
- Node 18: Neighbors = {1, 2, 21}
- Node 19: Neighbors = {2, 5, 16, 17}
- Node 20: Neighbors = {3, 26}
- Node 21: Neighbors = {0, 10, 11, 18}
- Node 22: Neighbors = {4, 9, 14, 15, 16}
- Node 23: Neighbors = {11}
- Node 24: Neighbors = {1, 10, 16}
- Node 25: Neighbors = {9, 16}
- Node 26: Neighbors = {6, 7, 16, 20}
- Node 27: Neighbors = {5, 17}
- Node 28: Neighbors = {6, 11, 13, 29}
- Node 29: Neighbors = {12, 28}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

  - <11, 21, 23> 
  - <11, 23, 28> 
  - <11, 0, 28>

  - <16, 25, 26>

- Node 19: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  - <19, 5, 17>
  - <19, 5, 16>
  - <19, 17, 27>
  - <19, 17, 27>

- Node 21: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  - <21, 0, 18>
  - <21, 0, 10>
  - <21, 0, 11>
  - <21, 0, 10>

- Node 22: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
  - <22, 4, 15>
  - <22, 9, 25>
  - <22, 9, 14>
  - <22, 9, 16>

- Node 28: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  - <28, 6, 11>
  - <28, 6, 13>
  - <28, 11, 13>
  - <28, 11, 29>

- Node 29: [inom{2}{3}] = 0

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].
