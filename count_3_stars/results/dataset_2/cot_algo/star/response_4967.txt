Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 10) (22, 15) (9, 13) (9, 1) (26, 1) (26, 2) (26, 20) (26, 27) (1, 9) (1, 26) (1, 21) (1, 28) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 6) (21, 8) (2, 26) (2, 29) (2, 27) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 0) (29, 3) (29, 18) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 18) (0, 29) (0, 20) (0, 25) (20, 26) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 14) (5, 6) (5, 24) (5, 28) (6, 21) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (28, 1) (28, 5) (28, 8) (3, 29) (3, 24) (3, 12) (11, 23) (11, 7) (7, 11) (7, 25) (7, 15) (25, 0) (25, 7) (25, 12) (17, 20) (17, 6) (17, 19) (8, 21) (8, 28) (19, 17) (19, 15) (19, 4) (4, 19) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 25) (16, 27) (15, 22) (15, 7) (15, 19) (18, 29) (18, 23) (14, 13) (14, 20) (14, 6) (24, 5) (24, 3) (10, 13) (10, 22) (10, 2) (27, 26) (27, 2) (27, 16) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 29, 20, 25
- Node 1: 9, 26, 21, 28, 12
- Node 2: 26, 29, 27, 10
- Node 3: 29, 24, 12
- Node 4: 19
- Node 5: 6, 24, 28
- Node 6: 21, 5, 17, 14
- Node 7: 11, 25, 15
- Node 8: 21, 28
- Node 9: 13, 1
- Node 10: 13, 22, 2
- Node 11: 23, 7
- Node 12: 1, 3, 25
- Node 13: 22, 9, 14, 10
- Node 14: 13, 20, 6
- Node 15: 22, 7, 19
- Node 16: 27
- Node 17: 20, 6, 19
- Node 18: 29, 23
- Node 19: 17, 15, 4
- Node 20: 26, 0, 17, 14
- Node 21: 1, 6, 8
- Node 22: 13, 23, 10, 15
- Node 23: 22, 11, 18
- Node 24: 5, 3
- Node 25: 0, 7, 12
- Node 26: 1, 2, 20, 27
- Node 27: 26, 2, 16
- Node 28: 1, 5, 8
- Node 29: 2, 0, 3, 18

Now, we will check each node to see if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 20, 25, 29
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 12, 26
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 26, 29
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 24, 29
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 17, 21
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 14, 22
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 19, 22
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 17, 20
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 15, 22
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 20, 26
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 26, 27
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, 28

The total number of 3-stars is 12, and they are listed below:
<0, (20, 25, 29)>, <1, (9, 12, 26)>, <2, (10, 26, 29)>, <3, (12, 24, 29)>, <6, (14, 17, 21)>, <13, (9, 14, 22)>, <15, (15, 19, 22)>, <17, (14, 17, 20)>, <22, (13, 15, 22)>, <26, (1, 20, 26)>, <27, (16, 26, 27)>, <28, (5, 8, 28)>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
