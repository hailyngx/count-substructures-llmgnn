Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 18) (7, 18) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 19) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 18) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 17) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 16) (16, 0) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 17) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 2) (19, 3) (19, 15) (6, 17) (6, 2) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 8) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 13) (14, 3) (14, 10) (8, 15) (8, 17) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
Given the provided edges, we can construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {10, 11, 16}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 13, 15}
- Node 3: {1, 9, 14, 19}
- Node 4: {18}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 9, 12, 17}
- Node 6: {2, 17}
- Node 7: {13, 18}
- Node 8: {15, 17}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 11}
- Node 10: {0, 14, 18}
- Node 11: {0, 9, 18}
- Node 12: {1, 5, 17}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 14: {3, 10}
- Node 15: {2, 8, 19}
- Node 16: {0}
- Node 17: {5, 6, 8, 12, 18}
- Node 18: {4, 7, 10, 11, 17}
- Node 19: {3, 15}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 47

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [47], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (10, 11, 16)>, <1, (3, 5, 12)>, <1, (3, 5, 13)>, <1, (5, 12, 17)>, <1, (5, 13, 17)>, <2, (5, 6, 13)>, <2, (5, 6, 17)>, <2, (6, 13, 17)>, <3, (1, 9, 14)>, <3, (1, 19, 3)>, <3, (9, 14, 19)>, <5, (1, 2, 17)>, <5, (1, 12, 17)>, <5, (2, 6, 17)>, <5, (12, 17, 6)>, <10, (0, 14, 18)>, <17, (5, 8, 12)>, <17, (5, 8, 18)>, <17, (6, 8, 17)>, <17, (8, 12, 17)>
