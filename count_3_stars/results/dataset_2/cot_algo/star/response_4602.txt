Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 7) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 0) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 14) (15, 19) (15, 2) (7, 18) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 8) (16, 17) (16, 7) (16, 12) (12, 16) (9, 14) (9, 19) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 0) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 3) (13, 0) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 2) (11, 4) (11, 6) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {17, 19, 13, 2}
- Node 1: {5, 10, 7}
- Node 2: {15, 6, 0}
- Node 3: {4, 18, 14}
- Node 4: {18, 3, 5, 11}
- Node 5: {4, 18, 1, 8}
- Node 6: {17, 2, 11, 8}
- Node 7: {18, 1, 16, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 6, 5}
- Node 9: {14, 19}
- Node 10: {1, 19, 14}
- Node 11: {4, 6}
- Node 12: {16}
- Node 13: {0}
- Node 14: {10, 9, 3}
- Node 15: {19, 2}
- Node 16: {17, 7, 12}
- Node 17: {6, 16, 0}
- Node 18: {4, 5, 7, 3}
- Node 19: {10, 15, 9, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 14, Node 19.

Next, let's apply the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 23. Therefore, the final answer is [23].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (17, 19, 2)>
- <0, (17, 19, 13)>
- <0, (17, 19, 2)>
- <0, (17, 19, 13)>
- <1, (5, 10, 7)>
- <2, (15, 6, 0)>
- <3, (18, 4, 5)>
- <4, (18, 5, 1)>
- <5, (4, 18, 8)>
- <6, (17, 2, 11)>
- <7, (18, 1, 16)>
- <14, (10, 9, 19)>
- <19, (10, 15, 9)>
