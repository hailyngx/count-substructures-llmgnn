Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 16) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 3) (9, 13) (9, 26) (9, 15) (26, 13) (26, 22) (26, 9) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 18) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (3, 22) (3, 10) (3, 6) (11, 19) (21, 13) (21, 20) (21, 12) (21, 4) (20, 21) (20, 29) (20, 18) (29, 20) (29, 7) (29, 25) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 24) (24, 17) (24, 16) (24, 8) (24, 23) (7, 29) (7, 10) (7, 1) (19, 11) (19, 25) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 15) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 27) (1, 12) (2, 1) (5, 25) (5, 4) (5, 28) (8, 0) (8, 24) (8, 15) (8, 27) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 8) (10, 3) (10, 7) (25, 29) (25, 19) (25, 5) (25, 28) (23, 24) (23, 28) (4, 0) (4, 21) (4, 5) (18, 17) (18, 20) (18, 12) (27, 1) (27, 8) (28, 5) (28, 25) (28, 23) (12, 21) (12, 1) (12, 18) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges based on the nodes they connect:

Node 0: {4, 8, 1}
Node 1: {0, 7, 2, 27, 12}
Node 2: {1}
Node 3: {22, 10, 6}
Node 4: {0, 21, 5}
Node 5: {25, 4, 28}
Node 6: {14, 3, 15}
Node 7: {29, 10, 1}
Node 8: {0, 24, 15, 27}
Node 9: {13, 26, 15}
Node 10: {3, 7}
Node 11: {19}
Node 12: {21, 18, 1}
Node 13: {22, 26, 21, 16, 9}
Node 14: {17, 6, 16}
Node 15: {9, 6, 8}
Node 16: {13, 14, 24}
Node 17: {14, 24, 18}
Node 18: {17, 20, 12}
Node 19: {11, 25}
Node 20: {21, 29, 18}
Node 21: {13, 20, 12, 4}
Node 22: {13, 26, 3}
Node 23: {24, 28}
Node 24: {17, 16, 8, 23}
Node 25: {29, 19, 5, 28}
Node 26: {22, 13, 9}
Node 27: {1, 8}
Node 28: {5, 25, 23}
Node 29: {20, 7, 25}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars each of them forms:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 13 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 14 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 15 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 16 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 17 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 18 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 20 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 21 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 24 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 25 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 28 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 29 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 44

The final answer, to be put inside brackets is [44].
