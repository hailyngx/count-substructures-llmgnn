Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 13) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 10) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {7, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 12}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {6, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 4, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 6, 10, 13}

Next, we identify nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, Node 8, Node 9, Node 11, Node 12, and Node 13 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 3-stars: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 4, 3-stars: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5, 3-stars: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8, 3-stars: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9, 3-stars: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 11, 3-stars: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 12, 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13, 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 78

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [78].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 5, 11>, <1, 5, 13>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 11, 13>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 12>, <8, 9, 11>, <10, 14, 6>, <10, 14, 13>, <11, 13, 14>
