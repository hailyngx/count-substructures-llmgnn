Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

    5---1---6---0
    |   |  /| / |
    |   | / |/  |
    3   2---4---8---9
            |   |
            |   |
            7---   

Now, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 8, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 6, 8, 2, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {5, 2, 7}
- Node 4: {9, 8, 2}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 8: {9, 6, 4, 2, 0, 1}
- Node 9: {8, 4, 1}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [20 + 20] = [40] \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 0)>
- <1, (6, 8, 0)>
- <1, (7, 0, 5)>
- <1, (7, 0, 6)>
- <1, (7, 0, 3)>
- <1, (8, 0, 6)>
- <1, (8, 0, 7)>
- <1, (8, 0, 2)>
- <1, (8, 6, 0)>
- <1, (8, 6, 7)>
- <1, (8, 6, 2)>
- <1, (8, 4, 9)>
- <1, (8, 4, 2)>
- <1, (8, 2, 4)>
- <1, (8, 2, 1)>
- <8, (9, 4, 2)>
- <8, (6, 0, 7)>

- <8, (4, 2, 1)>
- <8, (4, 2, 3)>
- <8, (4, 2, 8)>
- <8, (4, 9, 1)>
- <8, (4, 9, 6)>
- <8, (2, 1, 5)>
- <8, (2, 1, 7)>
- <8, (2, 3, 5)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- <8, (2, 1, 7)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
