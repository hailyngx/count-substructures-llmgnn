Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 5) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 5) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 11, 13
Node 1: 0, 8, 10
Node 2: 4, 10, 13, 14
Node 3: 9, 10, 6
Node 4: 2, 6, 12, 14
Node 5: 0, 7, 10, 12, 13
Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 7, 11
Node 7: 5, 6, 11
Node 8: 1, 11, 12, 13
Node 9: 3, 10
Node 10: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 11
Node 11: 6, 7, 8, 10
Node 12: 4, 5, 8
Node 13: 0, 2, 5, 8, 10, 14
Node 14: 2, 4, 13

Considering the number of neighbors for each node, we have:
- Nodes 0 and 10 have 5 neighbors.
- Nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 13 have 6 neighbors.
- Nodes 4, 7, 9, 11, and 12 have 4 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors.

Now, we count the number of 3-stars:
Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 10: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
Node 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 13: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 each
Total for nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 20*7 = 140

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 20 + 140] = [170].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 1, 10>, <0, 5, 10>, <0, 6, 10>, <1, 8, 10>, <2, 5, 13>, <2, 10, 13>, <2, 13, 14>, <3, 6, 10>, <4, 12, 14>, <5, 8, 13>, <6, 7, 11>, <6, 10, 11>, <6, 11, 13>, <8, 10, 11>, <13, 14, 2>.
