Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 20) (22, 13) (22, 25) (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 21) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 2) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 23) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 8) (15, 20) (15, 23) (20, 13) (20, 15) (20, 12) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 24) (14, 0) (14, 29) (14, 25) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) (28, 16) (28, 19) (7, 2) (16, 28) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 26) (16, 19) (3, 21) (3, 18) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 20) (12, 16) (12, 4) (23, 10) (23, 15) (26, 16) (26, 6) (19, 10) (19, 28) (19, 16) (24, 0) (24, 18) (24, 29) (8, 17) (8, 11) (8, 29) (27, 5) (27, 29) (29, 14) (29, 24) (29, 8) (29, 27) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 21) (2, 7) (18, 3) (18, 24) (6, 26) (6, 25) (25, 22) (25, 14) (25, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first construct the adjacency list representing the connections of each node in the graph:

1: {21, 17, 2, 10, 4}
2: {13, 1, 21, 7}
3: {21, 18}
4: {9, 1, 11, 16, 12}
5: {9, 0, 27}
6: {26, 25}
7: {2}
8: {17, 11, 29}
9: {5, 4, 11, 12}
10: {1, 17, 19, 23}
11: {9, 8, 4}
12: {9, 20, 16, 4}
13: {22, 2, 20}
14: {0, 29, 25}
15: {20, 23}
16: {28, 12, 4, 26, 19}
17: {1, 10, 8}
18: {3, 24}
19: {10, 28, 16}
20: {13, 15, 12}
21: {1, 3, 2}
22: {13, 25}
23: {10, 15}
24: {0, 29, 18}
25: {14, 22, 6}
26: {16, 6}
27: {5, 29}
28: {16, 19}
29: {14, 24, 8, 27}

Next, we'll calculate the total number of 3-star graphs in this network by finding the number of 3-stars centered at each node with three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 9, 12, 16, 21, 24, 25, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-star graphs in this network: 45

Therefore, the final number to be put inside brackets is [45].

Below is the list of unique 3-star structures found in this network:
<(1, 2, 21), (1, 4, 11), (1, 4, 16), (1, 4, 12), (1, 10, 17), (1, 10, 23), (1, 17, 8), (1, 21, 2), (1, 21, 3), (1, 21, 17), (2, 7, 1), (3, 18, 21), (4, 11, 9), (4, 11, 8), (4, 12, 9), (4, 12, 16), (4, 16, 12), (4, 16, 26), (5, 0, 9), (5, 0, 27), (5, 27, 29), (6, 26, 16), (8, 11, 9), (8, 11, 29), (8, 17, 1), (8, 29, 27), (9, 5, 4), (9, 12, 4), (9, 12, 16), (12, 9, 4), (12, 16, 4), (12, 20, 9), (14, 0, 29), (14, 25, 22), (16, 12, 9), (16, 12, 4), (16, 19, 10), (16, 19, 28), (16, 26, 6), (17, 1, 10), (19, 10, 17), (19, 10, 23), (19, 16, 28), (21, 1, 17), (24, 0, 29), (24, 18, 3), (24, 29, 14), (25, 6, 26), (25, 14, 0), (29, 8, 17), (29, 8, 27), (29, 14, 25)>.
