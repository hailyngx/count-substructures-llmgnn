Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 23) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 28) (9, 16) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 29) (25, 3) (25, 13) (25, 18) (25, 10) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 27) (8, 6) (8, 20) (8, 17) (13, 25) (13, 4) (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 2) (27, 21) (27, 0) (27, 2) (22, 26) (22, 11) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 23) (24, 3) (24, 26) (24, 12) (24, 1) (1, 24) (1, 14) (1, 10) (17, 8) (17, 4) (18, 25) (18, 26) (11, 22) (11, 19) (11, 15) (23, 6) (23, 7) (23, 26) (16, 9) (16, 7) (5, 26) (5, 29) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 19) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 12) (29, 3) (29, 7) (29, 5) (28, 9) (28, 0) (12, 24) (12, 19) (12, 14) (20, 8) (20, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 10) (10, 25) (10, 1) (10, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 27) (2, 20) (2, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 6, 9, 3, 25, 7, 26, 24, 1, 18, 11, 23, 16, 5, 15, 19, 29, 28, 12, 20, 14, 4, 10, and 2.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in as follows:
- Node 6 has 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars from each node gives us a total of 216 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [216]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<6, 9, 15>
<6, 9, 28>
<6, 9, 16>
<6, 9, 7>
<6, 9, 23>
<6, 9, 8>
<6, 3, 25>
<6, 3, 24>
<6, 3, 29>
<6, 25, 13>
<6, 25, 18>
<6, 25, 10>
<6, 7, 21>
<6, 7, 16>
<6, 7, 29>
<6, 7, 23>
<6, 21, 27>
<6, 21, 16>
<6, 21, 29>
<9, 3, 25>
...
(These 3-stars continue until all possible combinations are shown)
