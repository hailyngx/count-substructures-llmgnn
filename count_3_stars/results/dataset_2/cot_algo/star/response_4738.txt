Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
The central node, its neighbors, and the total number of 3-stars formed with each central node are as follows:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 7}, 3-stars formed [1]
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 7, 8}, 3-stars formed [1]
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 8}, 3-stars formed [1]
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}, 3-stars formed [1]
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 8}, 3-stars formed [1]
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}, 3-stars formed [1]
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 5}, 3-stars formed [1]
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 8}, 3-stars formed [1]
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}, 3-stars formed [1]
- Node 9: Neighbors {3}, 3-stars formed [0]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9], and the unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
