Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 29) (22, 15) (22, 11) (1, 21) (1, 28) (21, 1) (21, 9) (21, 23) (21, 2) (21, 15) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 20) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 12) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 18) (20, 8) (20, 0) (20, 14) (20, 28) (20, 11) (28, 1) (28, 20) (28, 16) (29, 13) (29, 10) (29, 19) (29, 24) (2, 21) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (26, 24) (24, 29) (24, 26) (24, 4) (24, 18) (5, 8) (5, 27) (19, 29) (19, 25) (15, 22) (15, 21) (15, 10) (9, 21) (9, 8) (9, 2) (16, 28) (16, 6) (4, 2) (4, 24) (4, 12) (4, 23) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 4) (25, 0) (25, 19) (25, 27) (27, 5) (27, 25) (27, 14) (7, 10) (7, 6) (11, 22) (11, 20) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 23) (6, 16) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 23) (14, 20) (14, 27) (18, 0) (18, 24) (23, 21) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: {20, 18, 25}
Node 1: {21, 28}
Node 2: {21, 10, 9, 4}
Node 3: {17, 6, 23}
Node 4: {2, 24, 12, 23}
Node 5: {8, 27}
Node 6: {16, 7, 3, 23}
Node 7: {10, 6}
Node 8: {9, 20, 5}
Node 9: {21, 2, 8}
Node 10: {17, 15, 29, 2, 7}
Node 11: {22, 20}
Node 12: {13, 17, 4}
Node 13: {12, 29}
Node 14: {20, 27}
Node 15: {22, 21, 10}
Node 16: {28, 6}
Node 17: {10, 3, 12}
Node 18: {0, 24}
Node 19: {29, 25}
Node 20: {11, 28, 0, 8, 14}
Node 21: {1, 15, 9, 23}
Node 22: {15, 11}
Node 23: {21, 4, 3, 6}
Node 24: {29, 4, 18, 26}
Node 25: {0, 19, 27}
Node 26: {24}
Node 27: {5, 25, 14}
Node 28: {1, 20, 16}
Node 29: {13, 10, 19, 24}

Since all the nodes with three or more neighbors form a 3-star, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} \]

\[ = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 62 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, 18, 20>, <0, 20, 25>, <0, 20, 28>, <0, 25, 27>, <1, 15, 21>, <1, 21, 28>, <2, 10, 21>, <2, 21, 9>, <2, 21, 15>, <2, 21, 10>, <2, 2, 4>, <3, 17, 10>, <4, 12, 13>, <6, 3, 7>, <6, 3, 16>, <6, 7, 10>, <6, 6, 23>, <10, 10, 29>, <12, 12, 17>, <14, 14, 20>, <15, 15, 22>, <18, 18, 24>, <19, 19, 25>, <23, 21, 4>, <23, 6, 3>
