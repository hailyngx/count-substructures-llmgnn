Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 3}

Now, we'll check which nodes can form a 3-star:
- Node 1: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: It has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 4: It has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 5: It has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: It has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 7: It has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 8: It has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 9: It has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is 10 (from node 1) + 10 (from node 2) + 20 (from node 5) = 40.

Therefore, the final answer is [40], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
