Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {14, 25, 23}
- Node 1: {22, 28}
- Node 2: {8, 18, 12}
- Node 3: {20, 11, 21}
- Node 4: {19, 26}
- Node 5: {27, 11, 14, 19}
- Node 6: {9, 28, 18, 26}
- Node 7: {11, 24, 28}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {27, 6, 29}
- Node 10: {26, 16}
- Node 11: {7, 3, 5, 17}
- Node 12: {2, 17}
- Node 13: {22, 17}
- Node 14: {0, 5}
- Node 15: {25, 16}
- Node 16: {15, 19, 10}
- Node 17: {13, 11, 12}
- Node 18: {6, 2, 24, 21}
- Node 19: {4, 5, 25, 16}
- Node 20: {3, 24}
- Node 21: {27, 18, 3}
- Node 22: {13, 23, 29, 1}
- Node 23: {22, 0, 26, 29}
- Node 24: {7, 20, 18}
- Node 25: {0, 15, 19, 29}
- Node 26: {4, 23, 6, 10}
- Node 27: {21, 9, 5}
- Node 28: {7, 6, 1}
- Node 29: {22, 23, 9, 25}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 0 3-star
- Node 2: 0 3-star
- Node 3: 0 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 0 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 0 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 0 3-star
- Node 13: 0 3-star
- Node 14: 0 3-star
- Node 15: 0 3-star
- Node 16: 0 3-star
- Node 17: 0 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star
- Node 20: 0 3-star
- Node 21: 0 3-star
- Node 22: 1 3-star
- Node 23: 1 3-star
- Node 24: 0 3-star
- Node 25: 1 3-star
- Node 26: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 0 3-star
- Node 28: 1 3-star
- Node 29: 1 3-star

There are a total of 12 unique 3-stars, and the total number of 3-stars is [10].
The unique 3-stars are as follows: 
<0, 14, 5>
<4, 19, 5>
<5, 27, 21>
<6, 9, 29>
<7, 11, 3>
<22, 23, 26>
<22, 29, 25>
<22, 13, 17>
<25, 0, 15>
<28, 7, 6>
