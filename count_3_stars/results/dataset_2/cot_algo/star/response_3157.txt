Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 6) (15, 10) (15, 1) (15, 12) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 7) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 2) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 17) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 7) (6, 20) (2, 25) (2, 8) (2, 28) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 20) (17, 8) (17, 29) (17, 1) (29, 17) (29, 21) (22, 4) (1, 15) (1, 25) (1, 17) (1, 23) (1, 12) (21, 3) (21, 25) (21, 6) (21, 29) (7, 9) (7, 6) (26, 28) (26, 18) (28, 9) (28, 2) (28, 26) (28, 20) (16, 4) (16, 19) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 19) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 23) (4, 22) (4, 16) (4, 10) (4, 23) (11, 20) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 23) (23, 1) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 19) (24, 14) (24, 12) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 24) (20, 6) (20, 14) (20, 28) (20, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {13, 14}
Node 1: {12, 15, 17, 23, 25}
Node 2: {8, 25, 28}
Node 3: {6, 21, 25}
Node 4: {10, 16, 22, 23}
Node 5: {6, 9, 13}
Node 6: {3, 5, 7, 21}
Node 7: {6, 9}
Node 8: {2, 13, 17}
Node 9: {5, 7, 14, 28}
Node 10: {4, 15, 19}
Node 11: {20}
Node 12: {1, 15, 24}
Node 13: {0, 5, 8}
Node 14: {9, 18, 20, 24}
Node 15: {1, 10, 12}
Node 16: {4, 19}
Node 17: {1, 8, 29}
Node 18: {14, 23, 26}
Node 19: {10, 16, 23}
Node 20: {6, 11, 14, 28}
Node 21: {3, 6, 25, 29}
Node 22: {4}
Node 23: {1, 4, 18, 19}
Node 24: {12, 14}
Node 25: {1, 2, 3, 21}
Node 26: {18, 28}
Node 28: {2, 9, 20, 26}
Node 29: {17, 21}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

\[ \sum_{v \in V} \binom{deg(v)}{3} \]

Calculating for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 44
So, the final result is [44].

Below are the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (12, 15, 23)>, <1, (12, 15, 24)>, <1, (12, 17, 23)>, <1, (12, 17, 25)>, <1, (12, 23, 24)>, <1, (15, 17, 23)>, <2, (8, 13, 28)>, <3, (6, 21, 25)>, <4, (10, 16, 19)>, <6, (3, 5, 21)>, <9, (14, 20, 28)>, <13, (0, 5, 8)>, <14, (9, 18, 24)>, <23, (1, 18, 19)>, <25, (1, 21, 29)>, <28, (2, 20, 26)>
