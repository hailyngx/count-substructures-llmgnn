Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 3) (27, 26) (27, 13) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 18) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 5) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 20) (0, 20) (0, 22) (20, 1) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 19) (11, 15) (11, 18) (28, 16) (28, 12) (28, 23) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 14) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 22) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 29) (9, 4) (9, 25) (9, 8) (9, 24) (16, 21) (16, 28) (16, 10) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 24) (19, 12) (2, 17) (22, 0) (22, 25) (22, 10) (17, 6) (17, 25) (17, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 5) (10, 16) (10, 22) (26, 27) (26, 20) (24, 9) (24, 19) (29, 1) (29, 8) (29, 13) (29, 18) (5, 21) (5, 14) (5, 23) (23, 28) (23, 5) (23, 3) (23, 12) (3, 27) (3, 23) (3, 18) (12, 28) (12, 19) (12, 23) (13, 15) (13, 27) (13, 29) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 29) (18, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: [20, 22]
- Node 1: [21, 20, 29]
- Node 2: [17]
- Node 3: [27, 23, 18]
- Node 4: [7, 9]
- Node 5: [21, 14, 23]
- Node 6: [15, 17, 14]
- Node 7: [4, 14, 18]
- Node 8: [9, 19, 29]
- Node 9: [4, 25, 8, 24]
- Node 10: [16, 22]
- Node 11: [15, 18]
- Node 12: [28, 19, 23]
- Node 13: [15, 27, 29]
- Node 14: [7, 6, 5]
- Node 15: [27, 6, 13, 11]
- Node 16: [21, 28, 10]
- Node 17: [6, 25, 2]
- Node 18: [7, 11, 29, 3]
- Node 19: [20, 8, 24, 12]
- Node 20: [1, 0, 26, 19]
- Node 21: [1, 5, 16]
- Node 22: [0, 25, 10]
- Node 23: [28, 5, 3, 12]
- Node 24: [9, 19]
- Node 25: [4, 22, 17, 9]
- Node 26: [27, 20]
- Node 27: [15, 3, 26, 13]
- Node 28: [16, 12, 23]
- Node 29: [1, 8, 13, 18]

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 15: <15, (27, 6, 13)>
- Node 27: <27, (15, 3, 26)> 
- Node 5: <5, (21, 14, 23)> 
- Node 6: <6, (15, 17, 14)>
- Node 7: <7, (4, 14, 18)> 
- Node 9: <9, (4, 25, 8)> 
- Node 18: <18, (7, 11, 29)> 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed: 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
