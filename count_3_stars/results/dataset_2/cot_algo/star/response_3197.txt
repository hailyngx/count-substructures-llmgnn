Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 4) (10, 8) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 10) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 6) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 3) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (0, 7) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (19, 16) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 12) (15, 9) (15, 1) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 11) (2, 11) (2, 1) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 6) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 6) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 16) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 2 neighbors
- Node 16: 4 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 1 neighbor

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 13, Node 14, Node 16, Node 17, and Node 18

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [35], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (12, 1, 15)>, <3, (2, 11, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 11)>, <5, (14, 17, 16)>, <6, (3, 11, 16)>, <7, (0, 8, 3)>, <8, (10, 13, 17)>, <9, (1, 15, 17)>, <10, (1, 12, 6)>, <11, (2, 3, 14)>, <13, (4, 10, 17)>, <14, (5, 11, 18)>, <16, (5, 6, 18)>, <17, (5, 9, 13)>, <18, (3, 11, 16)>
