Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 41 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [41].

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 15, 27)>
- <2, (1, 22, 26)>
- <5, (9, 17, 23)>
- <9, (5, 18, 28)>
- <15, (2, 17, 25)>
- <17, (5, 15, 19)>
- <19, (14, 17, 29)>
- <21, (3, 11, 22)>
- <22, (2, 7, 9)>
