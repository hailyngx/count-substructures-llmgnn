Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 4) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 13) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 5) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 9, 12, 2, 4, 5
- Node 1: 10, 11, 13
- Node 2: 7, 0, 13, 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 11, 12, 0, 2, 5, 3
- Node 5: 11, 0, 4, 14
- Node 6: 9, 10, 12, 13
- Node 7: 9, 12, 2
- Node 8: 9, 10, 12
- Node 9: 6, 8, 14, 7, 0
- Node 10: 6, 8, 1, 13
- Node 11: 14, 1, 5, 4
- Node 12: 6, 7, 4, 0, 8
- Node 13: 6, 10, 2, 1
- Node 14: 9, 11, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 6 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 = 40

Therefore, the final answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <2, 4, 5>
