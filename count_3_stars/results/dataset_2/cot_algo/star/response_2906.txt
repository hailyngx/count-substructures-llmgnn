Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 3) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 13) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 7) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 10) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 12}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {5, 10, 14}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 6, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 13}
- Node 10: {3, 7, 13}
- Node 11: {3, 5, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 13}
- Node 13: {6, 9, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13}

Now, we can find the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 88 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [88].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 14)>
- <3, (0, 5, 12)>
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <8, (3, 4, 14)>
- <13, (6, 9, 10)>
- <14, (0, 6, 11)>
