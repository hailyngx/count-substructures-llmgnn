Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 8
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7, 9
Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 9
Node 3: 1, 2, 7, 8
Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 8
Node 5: 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 6: 2, 4
Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 5
Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 5, 9
Node 9: 1, 2, 5, 8

Now let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can potentially form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can potentially form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can potentially form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can potentially form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can potentially form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can potentially form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can potentially form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of potential 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 40

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
