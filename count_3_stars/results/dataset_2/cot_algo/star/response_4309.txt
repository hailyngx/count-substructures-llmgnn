Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 2) (27, 26) (27, 16) (1, 21) (1, 5) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 25) (4, 29) (8, 10) (8, 25) (8, 17) (8, 3) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 12) (28, 14) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 24) (3, 13) (11, 3) (11, 5) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 5) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 22) (0, 25) (16, 27) (16, 0) (16, 18) (6, 29) (6, 12) (6, 26) (29, 4) (29, 6) (29, 14) (19, 12) (19, 9) (14, 28) (14, 29) (14, 23) (22, 0) (24, 3) (24, 17) (24, 20) (24, 25) (20, 24) (20, 26) (26, 27) (26, 6) (26, 20) (26, 7) (23, 15) (23, 1) (23, 14) (23, 13) (2, 27) (2, 13) (9, 19) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 12) (17, 8) (17, 0) (17, 24) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 3) (13, 23) (13, 2) (7, 28) (7, 26) (12, 15) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 19) (12, 18) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 24) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 16, 17, 22, 25  
Node 1: 5, 15, 21, 23  
Node 2: 13, 27  
Node 3: 8, 11, 13, 24  
Node 4: 29  
Node 5: 1, 10, 11  
Node 6: 12, 26, 29  
Node 7: 26, 28  
Node 8: 3, 8, 10, 17, 25  
Node 9: 19  
Node 10: 5, 8, 18  
Node 11: 3, 5  
Node 12: 6, 12, 18, 19, 28  
Node 13: 2, 3, 13, 23  
Node 14: 23, 28, 29  
Node 15: 1, 12, 23, 27  
Node 16: 0, 18, 27  
Node 17: 0, 8, 24  
Node 18: 10, 12, 16, 18  
Node 19: 9, 12  
Node 20: 24, 26  
Node 21: 1, 21, 25  
Node 22: 0  
Node 23: 1, 13, 14, 15  
Node 24: 3, 17, 20, 25  
Node 25: 8, 21, 24, 25  
Node 26: 6, 7, 20, 26  
Node 27: 2, 15, 16, 27  
Node 28: 21, 26, 28  
Node 29: 4, 6, 14, 29  

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]  
Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]  
Node 12: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]  
Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]  
Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]  
Node 15: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]  
Node 16: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]  
Node 21: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]  
Node 23: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]  
Node 26: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]  
Node 28: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]  
Node 29: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]  

There are a total of 44 3-stars in this graph. 

Unique 3-stars:

<1, 21, 23>  
<1, 15, 27>

<8, 3, 13>  
<8, 3, 24>  
<8, 3, 11>  
<8, 17, 0>  
<8, 17, 24>
