Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 0) (8, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 5
Node 1 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
Node 2 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 9
Node 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 9
Node 6 neighbors: 0, 9
Node 7 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 4
Node 9 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9

Now, we apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 64

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [64], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
