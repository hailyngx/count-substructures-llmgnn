Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 3}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Next, calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 60

Therefore, the final answer is [60], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (7, 8, 2)>.
