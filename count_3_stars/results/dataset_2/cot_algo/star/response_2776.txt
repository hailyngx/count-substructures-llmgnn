Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 7, 14, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 4, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 7, 11, 8, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {10, 13, 0, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 10, 1, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 6, 2, 0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 10, 11, 2, 0}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 13, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 1, 13}
- Node 10: Neighbors {4, 7, 3, 13, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {7, 12, 2}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 14, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors {9, 10, 8, 3, 1, 6}
- Node 14: Neighbors {4, 10, 0, 3, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 13: [inom{6}{3}] = 20

Adding these up, we get a total of 54 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 7, 10)>, <0, (7, 10, 14)>, <0, (3, 14, 14)>,
<4, (1, 10, 13)>, <7, (2, 11, 12)>, <10, (3, 13, 14)>, 
<13, (1, 6, 9)>, <13, (3, 9, 10)>, <13, (1, 9, 10)>
