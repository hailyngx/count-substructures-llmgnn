Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (8, 3) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 1) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 2) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 13) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the 3-star graph can be analyzed as follows:

Node 0 has neighbors: {7, 14, 9, 2}
Node 1 has neighbors: {7, 10, 14, 13}
Node 2 has neighbors: {11, 0, 12, 9}
Node 3 has neighbors: {7, 8, 5, 14}
Node 4 has neighbors: {9, 10, 11, 6}
Node 5 has neighbors: {10, 6, 13, 12, 3}
Node 6 has neighbors: {4, 7, 10, 11, 5, 13}
Node 7 has neighbors: {0, 3, 6, 13, 1}
Node 8 has neighbors: {3}
Node 9 has neighbors: {4, 11, 0, 2}
Node 10 has neighbors: {4, 6, 1, 5}
Node 11 has neighbors: {4, 9, 6, 2}
Node 12 has neighbors: {5, 14, 2}
Node 13 has neighbors: {7, 5, 6, 1}
Node 14 has neighbors: {0, 3, 1, 12}

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 6: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 63

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [63].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 14, 9)>
<1, (7, 10, 14)>
<2, (11, 0, 12)>
<5, (10, 6, 13)>
<6, (4, 7, 10)>
<7, (0, 3, 13)>
<9, (4, 11, 0)>
<10, (4, 6, 5)>
<11, (4, 9, 6)>
<12, (5, 14, 2)>
<13, (7, 5, 6)>
<14, (0, 3, 1)>
