Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 7, 8, 2}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 8, 2}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {3, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves (2, 4, 7) as <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves (2, 7, 8) as <4, (2, 7, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
