Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 9) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 20) (22, 29) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 21) (9, 13) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 17) (9, 16) (15, 14) (27, 12) (27, 8) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 10) (21, 5) (21, 7) (21, 19) (21, 11) (21, 14) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 12) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 23) (17, 10) (17, 1) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 0) (8, 27) (8, 4) (8, 29) (8, 25) (12, 27) (12, 23) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 26) (14, 13) (14, 15) (14, 21) (14, 18) (18, 4) (18, 14) (1, 17) (1, 24) (24, 1) (24, 26) (26, 5) (26, 0) (26, 24) (26, 29) (26, 25) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 25) (6, 10) (6, 2) (11, 7) (11, 21) (11, 2) (3, 20) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 26) (28, 9) (28, 19) (20, 22) (20, 3) (25, 23) (25, 8) (25, 26) (25, 2) (19, 7) (19, 21) (19, 28) (16, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 12, 26}
- Node 1: {17, 24}
- Node 2: {6, 11, 25}
- Node 3: {20}
- Node 4: {0, 8, 14, 18}
- Node 5: {9, 21, 26}
- Node 6: {2, 10}
- Node 7: {10, 11, 19, 21}
- Node 8: {4, 8, 25, 27, 29}
- Node 9: {5, 13, 16, 17, 28}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 17}
- Node 11: {2, 7, 11, 21}
- Node 12: {0, 23, 27}
- Node 13: {9, 13, 14, 17}  
- Node 14: {4, 13, 18, 21}
- Node 15: {14}
- Node 16: {9}
- Node 17: {1, 9, 10, 13, 23}
- Node 18: {4, 14}
- Node 19: {7, 19, 21, 28}
- Node 20: {3, 22}
- Node 21: {5, 7, 11, 14, 19}
- Node 22: {13, 20, 29}
- Node 23: {12, 17, 25}
- Node 24: {1, 26}
- Node 25: {2, 8, 23, 25, 26}
- Node 26: {0, 5, 24, 25, 29}
- Node 27: {8, 12}
- Node 28: {9, 19, 28}
- Node 29: {8, 22, 26}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have exactly 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 5
- Node 9
- Node 13
- Node 17
- Node 21
- Node 25
- Node 26
- Node 29

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star subgraphs for these nodes:
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 56 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <5, (9, 21, 26)>
- <9, (5, 13, 17)>
- <13, (9, 14, 17)>
- <17, (9, 10, 23)>
- <21, (7, 11, 19)>
- <25, (2, 8, 26)>
- <26, (0, 24, 29)>
