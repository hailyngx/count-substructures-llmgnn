Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 27) (20, 22) (20, 6) (20, 10) (25, 20) (25, 23) (25, 0) (25, 22) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 3) (13, 1) (26, 13) (26, 21) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 9) (15, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 21) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 27) (11, 19) (11, 27) (11, 18) (23, 25) (23, 18) (7, 16) (7, 24) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 19) (3, 13) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 29) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 12) (12, 16) (12, 28) (17, 28) (17, 4) (21, 13) (21, 26) (21, 8) (21, 2) (21, 24) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 4) (5, 8) (5, 10) (14, 9) (14, 22) (14, 2) (22, 20) (22, 25) (22, 14) (18, 11) (18, 23) (27, 20) (27, 9) (27, 11) (29, 3) (24, 7) (24, 3) (24, 21) (24, 10) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 10) (0, 25) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 21) (2, 14) (10, 20) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 24) (10, 4) (6, 20) 

Response:
Since the graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will build the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges, and then count the number of 3-stars formed.

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:

1. Node 0: {25}
2. Node 1: {9, 10, 13}
3. Node 2: {2, 14, 15, 16, 21}
4. Node 3: {13, 24, 28, 29}
5. Node 4: {9, 10, 17, 19}
6. Node 5: {8, 10}
7. Node 6: {20}
8. Node 7: {16, 24}
9. Node 8: {5, 9, 21}
10. Node 9: {1, 4, 8, 14, 27}
11. Node 10: {1, 4, 10, 20, 24}
12. Node 11: {18, 19, 27}
13. Node 12: {16, 28}
14. Node 13: {1, 3, 21, 26}
15. Node 14: {2, 9, 22}
16. Node 15: {2}
17. Node 16: {2, 7, 12, 19}
18. Node 17: {4, 28}
19. Node 18: {11, 23}
20. Node 19: {4, 11, 16}
21. Node 20: {6, 10, 22, 25, 27}
22. Node 21: {2, 13, 21, 24, 26}
23. Node 22: {14, 20, 25}
24. Node 23: {18, 25}
25. Node 24: {3, 7, 10, 21, 24}
26. Node 26: {13, 21}
27. Node 27: {9, 11, 20}
28. Node 28: {3, 4, 12, 17}
29. Node 29: {3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 1 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (9, 4, 10) <1, 9, 10>
2. Node 4 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (9, 10, 17) <4, 9, 10>
3. Node 9 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (1, 4, 10) <9, 1, 10>
4. Node 10 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (1, 4, 24) <10, 1, 24>
5. Node 13 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (1, 26, 21) <13, 1, 26>
6. Node 16 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (19, 2, 7) <16, 19, 2>
7. Node 21 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (13, 26, 9) <21, 13, 26>
8. Node 22 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (20, 14, 25) <22, 20, 25>
9. Node 24 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (3, 21, 10) <24, 3, 21>
10. Node 28 forms 1 3-star with neighbors (3, 4, 17) <28, 3, 4>

The total number of 3-stars formed is 10, so we put this final number inside brackets as [10].
