Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 19) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 12) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 11) (18, 12) (6, 2) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (10, 0) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 12) (19, 16) (19, 15) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 15) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 6) (1, 8) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 14) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 3) (13, 6) (13, 15) 

Response:
Since the graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can start by visualizing the graph and identifying the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 8, 7, 10}
- Node 1: Neighbors {8, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 6, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 4, 7, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 9, 8, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbor {4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 17, 3, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 0, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 17, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 15}
- Node 11: Neighbors {16, 18}
- Node 12: Neighbors {9, 18, 15}
- Node 13: Neighbors {6, 15}
- Node 14: Neighbors {2, 7, 15, 1, 3}
- Node 15: Neighbors {10, 19, 13, 14, 12}
- Node 16: Neighbors {11, 17, 19}
- Node 17: Neighbors {16, 9, 6}
- Node 18: Neighbors {11, 12}
- Node 19: Neighbors {16, 15}

Now, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 14, 15 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars around them:
  - Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 37\)

Therefore, the final answer is [37], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 8, 10)>
- <0, (2, 8, 7)>
- <0, (2, 8, 14)>
- <0, (2, 7, 10)>
- <2, (0, 6, 14)>
- <3, (6, 4, 14)>
- <3, (6, 4, 7)>
- <3, (4, 8, 14)>
- <4, (5, 9, 8)>
- <4, (5, 9, 3)>
- <4, (5, 9, 17)>
- <4, (9, 17, 12)>
- <6, (2, 17, 13)>
- <6, (2, 17, 3)>
- <6, (17, 9, 4)>
- <6, (17, 9, 12)>
- <14, (2, 7, 1)>
- <14, (2, 7, 15)>
- <14, (2, 15, 1)>
- <14, (2, 15, 3)>
- <14, (7, 3, 1)>
- <15, (10, 19, 13)>
- <15, (10, 19, 14)>
- <15, (13, 6, 15)>
- <15, (13, 6, 14)>
- <15, (6, 2, 14)>
- <15, (6, 2, 13)>
- <15, (2, 14, 1)>
- <15, (2, 14, 3)>
- <15, (14, 7, 1)>
- <15, (14, 7, 3)>
