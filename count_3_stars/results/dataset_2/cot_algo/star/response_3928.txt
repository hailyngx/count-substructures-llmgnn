Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 4: <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 7: <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20

Summing up all the 3-stars formed: 10 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 20 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [41].
