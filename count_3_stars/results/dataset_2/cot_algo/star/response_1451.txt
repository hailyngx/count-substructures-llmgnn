Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 11) (13, 1) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 12) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
The 3-stars formed in this graph are as follows:

<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 7, 11)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 9, 11)>
<6, (0, 8, 10)>
<0, (6, 8, 13)>
<14, (1, 3, 13)>
<13, (0, 1, 11)>
<3, (1, 10, 12)>
<11, (1, 9, 13)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<12, (1, 3, 11)>
<2, (5, 9, 10)>
<1, (4, 11, 14)>
<10, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
