Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 12) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 13) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 2) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: {9, 1, 6}
- Node 1: {9, 3, 11, 0, 7}
- Node 2: {11, 13, 6, 10}
- Node 3: {9, 1, 11, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {8, 12, 13, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {9, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {12, 0, 2}
- Node 7: {9, 1, 3, 12}
- Node 8: {5, 3, 4, 11}
- Node 9: {5, 3, 1, 7, 0}
- Node 10: {5, 4, 2}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 4, 8, 2}
- Node 12: {4, 7, 14, 6}
- Node 13: {4, 14, 2}
- Node 14: {5, 12, 13}

Based on the neighbor sets, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves {3, 11, 7} <1, (3, 11, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves {1, 11, 7, 8} <3, (1, 11, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves {8, 12, 13} <4, (8, 12, 13)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves {9, 8, 10} <5, (9, 8, 10)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves {5, 3, 7} <9, (5, 3, 7)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with leaves {7, 14, 6} <12, (7, 14, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
