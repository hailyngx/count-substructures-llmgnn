Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 9) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 14) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 9) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 14) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {12, 10, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {13}
- Node 3: {13, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {13, 12, 9, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 11, 7, 1}
- Node 6: {8, 11, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 9, 5}
- Node 8: {13, 0, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 12, 10, 14, 1}
- Node 10: {13, 0, 1, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {3, 6, 5}
- Node 12: {4, 3, 0, 6, 1, 9}
- Node 13: {8, 4, 2, 3, 10}
- Node 14: {10, 6, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors (degree â‰¥ 3) and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0, degree = 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1, degree = 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3, degree = 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4, degree = 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5, degree = 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6, degree = 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 7, degree = 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9, degree = 6: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 10, degree = 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 12, degree = 6: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 13, degree = 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 87

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (8, 7, 10)>
- <1, (12, 10, 5)>
- <3, (13, 11, 12)>
- <4, (13, 12, 9)>
- <5, (4, 11, 7)>
- <6, (8, 11, 7)>
- <6, (11, 5, 7)>
- <6, (12, 1, 9)>
- <9, (7, 12, 10)>
- <10, (13, 0, 9)>
- <12, (3, 0, 6)>
- <13, (8, 2, 10)>
