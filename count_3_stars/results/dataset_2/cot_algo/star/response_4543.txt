Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 25) (13, 17) (13, 0) (12, 27) (12, 7) (27, 12) (27, 25) (27, 2) (27, 28) (4, 8) (4, 29) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 14) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 20) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 28) (14, 15) (1, 7) (1, 0) (26, 2) (26, 20) (26, 11) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 28) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 17) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 18) (11, 26) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (17, 13) (17, 20) (17, 15) (10, 21) (10, 22) (10, 29) (21, 10) (21, 22) (25, 8) (25, 27) (25, 24) (18, 3) (18, 15) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 24) (29, 4) (29, 10) (2, 27) (2, 26) (2, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 22) (5, 28) (15, 14) (15, 23) (15, 17) (15, 18) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 24) (6, 22) (22, 10) (22, 21) (22, 5) (22, 6) (24, 25) (24, 19) (24, 9) (28, 27) (28, 14) (28, 23) (28, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 13, 14, 20}
- Node 1: {0, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 26, 27}
- Node 3: {4, 11, 18, 19}
- Node 4: {3, 8, 29}
- Node 5: {8, 11, 22, 28}
- Node 6: {22}
- Node 7: {1, 12, 14, 19}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 23, 25}
- Node 9: {2, 11, 24}
- Node 10: {21, 22, 29}
- Node 11: {3, 5, 9, 26}
- Node 12: {7, 27}
- Node 13: {0, 17}
- Node 14: {0, 7, 15, 28}
- Node 15: {14, 17, 18, 23}
- Node 17: {13, 15, 20}
- Node 18: {3, 15}
- Node 19: {3, 7, 24}
- Node 20: {0, 17, 26}
- Node 21: {10, 22}
- Node 22: {5, 6, 10, 21}
- Node 23: {8, 15, 28}
- Node 24: {9, 19, 25}
- Node 25: {8, 24, 27}
- Node 26: {2, 11, 20}
- Node 27: {2, 12, 25, 28}
- Node 28: {5, 14, 23, 27}
- Node 29: {4, 10}

Now, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:

- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (4, 5, 23)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (7, 15, 28)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (17, 18, 23)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star: <22, (5, 10, 21)>
- Node 25 forms a 3-star: <25, (24, 27, 8)>
- Node 27 forms a 3-star: <27, (2, 25, 28)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [6].
