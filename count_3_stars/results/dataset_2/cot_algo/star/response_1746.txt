Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 13) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 15) (7, 12) (12, 7) (4, 19) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 19) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 18) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 19) (15, 17) (16, 5) (16, 14) (16, 0) (6, 14) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 10) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 6) 

Response:
Considering the given graph, let's first list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {14, 16, 19}
- Node 1: {8, 11, 19, 10}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 13}
- Node 3: {17, 18, 11, 6}
- Node 4: {19, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 16}
- Node 6: {14, 18, 3, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {12}
- Node 8: {17, 2, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 19, 13}
- Node 11: {18, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 12: {7}
- Node 13: {9, 2, 10, 6}
- Node 14: {17, 0, 16, 6}
- Node 15: {17}
- Node 16: {5, 14, 0}
- Node 17: {14, 3, 8, 15}
- Node 18: {11, 6, 3}
- Node 19: {4, 0, 1, 10}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
3. Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
5. Node 4 has only 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
6. Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
7. Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
8. Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
9. Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
10. Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
11. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
12. Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
13. Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
14. Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
15. Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
16. Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
17. Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = [34]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 14, 16>
<1, 8, 11>
<1, 8, 19>
<1, 8, 10>
<1, 11, 3>
<1, 11, 6>
<1, 19, 10>
<3, 17, 15>
<6, 14, 16>
<6, 18, 11>
<6, 18, 3>
<6, 18, 13>
<10, 1, 19>
<13, 9, 6>
<13, 9, 10>
<13, 2, 10>
<13, 6, 11>
<14, 17, 15>
