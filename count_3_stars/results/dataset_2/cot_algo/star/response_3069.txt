Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (13, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 2) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 10}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 2}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 9: {10, 11}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 11: {5, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 4, 6, 11}
- Node 13: {11}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 6, 8}

Calculating the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 78 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [78], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 10, 12)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 12)>, <0, (1, 7, 12)>, <0, (3, 2, 7)>, <0, (5, 8, 11)>, <0, (10, 1, 2)>, <0, (10, 1, 4)>, <0, (10, 2, 14)>, <0, (12, 2, 4)>, <2, (1, 10, 14)>, <2, (2, 7, 10)>, <2, (4, 12, 14)>, <5, (6, 8, 14)>, <8, (4, 7, 14)>
