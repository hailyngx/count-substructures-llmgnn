Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 9, 3}
- Node 1: {6, 2}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 6, 1, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 8, 0}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 3, 5, 6, 2}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 6, 2, 0}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 5, 1, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 6, 5}
- Node 8: {3}
- Node 9: {4, 2, 0}

Now, we will identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 64

Therefore, the final answer is [64], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 3)>, <0, (5, 9, 3)>, <0, (6, 9, 3)>, 
<2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, 
<4, (5, 6, 2)>, <4, (5, 6, 0)>, <4, (5, 2, 0)>, <4, (6, 2, 0)>,
<5, (6, 2, 0)>, <5, (7, 6, 4)>, 
<6, (7, 5, 4)>, <6, (7, 2, 4)>, <6, (5, 2, 4)>, <6, (5, 2, 0)>,
<6, (7, 2, 5)>
