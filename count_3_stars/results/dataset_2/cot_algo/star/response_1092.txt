Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighboring nodes for each node:

Node 0: {5, 9, 7, 2}
Node 1: {5, 9, 7, 3, 2, 8}
Node 2: {9, 7, 1, 0}
Node 3: {9, 4, 1, 8}
Node 4: {9, 7, 8, 3}
Node 5: {8, 1, 0}
Node 7: {4, 8, 1, 0, 2}
Node 8: {5, 4, 7, 1, 3}
Node 9: {4, 2, 3, 1, 0}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars based on the number of neighbors of each node:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 5 (1 3-star each)
Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
1 -> inom{6}{3} = 20
3 -> inom{5}{3} = 10
4 -> inom{5}{3} = 10
7 -> inom{5}{3} = 10
8 -> inom{5}{3} = 10
9 -> inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 63

Therefore, the final answer is [63], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 5, 1>
<2, 9, 4>
<5, 1, 8>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 9, 4>
<3, 4, 8>
<7, 4, 8>
<8, 3, 9>
<9, 1, 2>
