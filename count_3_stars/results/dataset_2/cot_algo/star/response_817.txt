Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 18) (16, 10) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 10) (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 7) (6, 7) (6, 12) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 0) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 15) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 16) (18, 2) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 4) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 13) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 0) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 0) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 4) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 4, 12, 19}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {5, 14, 18, 19}
- Node 3: {7, 12, 6}
- Node 4: {14, 1, 10, 19, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 2}
- Node 6: {7, 12}
- Node 7: {17, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {13, 19, 15, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 10}
- Node 10: {16, 9, 4}
- Node 11: {13, 17}
- Node 12: {17, 3, 6, 0}
- Node 13: {11, 8, 15}
- Node 14: {17, 4, 2}
- Node 15: {16, 8, 13}
- Node 16: {18, 10, 15}
- Node 17: {11, 14, 12, 7}
- Node 18: {16, 2}
- Node 19: {8, 2, 4, 0}

Next, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 12, 14, 19 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the final answer is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 8, 19, 4>, <2, 18, 19, 4>, <4, 0, 12, 14>, <7, 3, 12, 6>, <8, 15, 13, 19>.
