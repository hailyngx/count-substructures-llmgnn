Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

1: {0, 4, 5, 7, 8}
2: {3, 6, 8, 9}
3: {0, 2, 5, 6, 9}
4: {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
5: {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
6: {2, 3, 5}
7: {1, 4, 5}
8: {1, 2, 4}
9: {2, 3, 4, 5}

Now, let's check for each node if they form a 3-star:

From the neighbor sets:
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found are:
