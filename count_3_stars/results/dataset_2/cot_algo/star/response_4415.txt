Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 4, 1}
- Node 1: {9, 4, 7, 8, 2, 0}
- Node 2: {6, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {6, 8, 2}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 8, 0, 1}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 3, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 6, 4, 1}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {8, 4, 1, 7}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1, 4, and 7 have 6 neighbors each, so they will form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( 3 \times 20 + 1 = 61 \), which we represent as [61].

The unique 3-stars formed are:
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
