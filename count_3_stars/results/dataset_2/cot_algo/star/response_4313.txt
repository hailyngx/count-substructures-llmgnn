Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 8
Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 9
Node 3: 2, 4, 8, 9
Node 4: 3, 5, 7, 9
Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 8
Node 6: 7
Node 7: 0, 4, 6
Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5, 9
Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes which can form at least one 3-star:

Node 0, with 6 neighbors, can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 2, with 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3, with 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4, with 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5, with 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8, with 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9, with 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars formed gives a total of 62 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [62].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 9, 0)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
