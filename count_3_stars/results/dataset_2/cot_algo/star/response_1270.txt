Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Since the graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can first represent the graph as an adjacency list for easier visualization:

Node 0: 5, 4, 3, 8
Node 1: 9, 4, 3
Node 2: 5, 7, 6, 8
Node 3: 9, 4, 1, 0
Node 4: 0, 1, 3
Node 5: 6, 2, 8, 0
Node 6: 5, 7, 2, 8
Node 7: 9, 6, 2, 8
Node 8: 5, 9, 7, 6, 2, 0
Node 9: 8, 3, 1, 7

Next, we'll identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 3, 5, 8
Node 1: 3, 4, 9
Node 2: 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 3
Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 8
Node 6: 2, 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 2, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 9: 1, 3, 7, 8

Now, we can calculate the number of unique 3-stars. The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 
We will apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) for these nodes.

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up these results, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 44 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].
