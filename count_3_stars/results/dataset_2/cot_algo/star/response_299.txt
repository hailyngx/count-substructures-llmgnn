Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 15) (8, 14) (8, 7) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 3) (5, 19) (5, 16) (5, 14) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 17) (9, 18) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 13) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 11) (0, 1) (16, 5) (16, 17) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 6) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 11) (3, 18) (3, 14) (3, 13) (17, 19) (17, 16) (17, 12) (6, 2) (6, 7) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 17) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 3) 

Response:
The first step is to identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor nodes = {1}
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes = {0, 10, 11}
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes = {6, 13, 18, 19}
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes = {13, 14, 18}
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes = {14, 15, 19}
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes = {14, 16, 17, 19}
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes = {2, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes = {6, 8, 15}
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes = {7, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes = {18}
- Node 10: Neighbor nodes = {1, 13, 15}
- Node 11: Neighbor nodes = {1, 12, 14, 15}
- Node 12: Neighbor nodes = {11, 17, 18}
- Node 13: Neighbor nodes = {2, 3, 10}
- Node 14: Neighbor nodes = {3, 4, 5, 8, 11}
- Node 15: Neighbor nodes = {4, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 16: Neighbor nodes = {5, 17}
- Node 17: Neighbor nodes = {5, 12, 16, 19}
- Node 18: Neighbor nodes = {2, 3, 9, 12}
- Node 19: Neighbor nodes = {2, 4, 5, 17}

Now, let's identify 3-stars in the graph:

Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (6, 13, 18)>  
Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (13, 14, 18)>  
Node 4 forms multiple 3-stars: <4, (14, 15, 19)>, <4, (14, 19, 5)>  
Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (14, 17, 19)>  
Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (1, 14, 15)>  
Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (11, 17, 18)>  

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
