Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 6, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {6, 7, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 4, 1}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 4: {9, 6, 7, 8, 0, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 8, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 3, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 4, 0, 1}
- Node 8: {5, 4, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 2, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the final answer is [48] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (6, 4, 9)>
- <2, (5, 4, 9)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (2, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 4)>
