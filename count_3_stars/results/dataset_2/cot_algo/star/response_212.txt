Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 12) (16, 7) (16, 15) (3, 1) (15, 16) (15, 2) (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 7) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 17) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 17) (18, 13) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 6) (7, 16) (7, 5) (7, 1) (14, 2) (14, 4) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 11) (12, 0) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 13) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 4) (13, 0) (13, 18) (13, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {5, 12, 13}
Node 1: {3, 7, 10, 18}
Node 2: {8, 14, 15}
Node 3: {1}
Node 4: {5, 6, 14, 17}
Node 5: {0, 4, 7, 9, 17}
Node 6: {4, 8, 11, 19}
Node 7: {1, 5, 16}
Node 8: {2, 6, 17}
Node 9: {5, 18}
Node 10: {1, 13, 19}
Node 11: {6, 12}
Node 12: {0, 11}
Node 13: {0, 10, 18}
Node 14: {2, 4}
Node 15: {2, 16}
Node 16: {7, 15}
Node 17: {4, 5, 8, 18}
Node 18: {1, 9, 13, 17, 19}
Node 19: {6, 10, 18}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: 1 3-star
Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 2: 1 3-star
Node 4: 1 3-star
Node 5: 1 3-star
Node 6: 1 3-star
Node 7: 1 3-star
Node 8: 1 3-star
Node 10: 1 3-star
Node 11: 1 3-star
Node 12: 1 3-star
Node 13: 1 3-star
Node 14: 1 3-star
Node 15: 1 3-star
Node 16: 1 3-star
Node 17: 1 3-star
Node 18: 3 3-stars
Node 19: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 19

Putting this final number inside brackets, we get [19].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 10>, <2, 8, 14>, <4, 5, 17>, <6, 8, 19>, <7, 5, 16>, <11, 12, 0>, <13, 10, 18> <15, 2, 16>, <17, 4, 5>, <18, 1, 9>, <18, 1, 13>, <18, 1, 17>
