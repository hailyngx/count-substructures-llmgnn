Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 2) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (8, 12) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 14) (14, 9) (14, 5) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 10) (11, 12) (11, 9) (11, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 12, 13, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 12}
- Node 2: {1, 3}
- Node 3: {1, 9, 13, 10, 2}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 0}
- Node 5: {1, 8, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 0, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 13}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {4, 3, 8, 11, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 8, 9, 6, 13}
- Node 11: {12, 9, 6}
- Node 12: {1, 0, 8, 11}
- Node 13: {7, 3, 0, 10}
- Node 14: {9, 5}

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13.

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 99 \]

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [99].
The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 7, 6)>
- <1, (3, 10, 2)>
- <3, (1, 9, 10)>
- <4, (7, 9, 0)>
- <5, (1, 8, 14)>
- <6, (1, 0, 10)>
- <7, (4, 0, 13)>
- <8, (5, 9, 10)>
- <9, (4, 3, 10)>
- <10, (1, 3, 9)>
- <12, (1, 8, 11)>
- <13, (7, 3, 10)>
