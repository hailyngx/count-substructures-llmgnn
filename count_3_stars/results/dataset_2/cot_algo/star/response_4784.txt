Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 0) (0, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 2) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first identify the neighbor set for each node:

1. Node 0 neighbors: {13}
2. Node 1 neighbors: {9, 7, 8, 10, 2}
3. Node 2 neighbors: {10, 3, 4, 1}
4. Node 3 neighbors: {7, 10, 4, 2}
5. Node 4 neighbors: {5, 13, 3, 2}
6. Node 5 neighbors: {6, 12, 13, 11, 4}
7. Node 6 neighbors: {5, 7, 12}
8. Node 7 neighbors: {6, 12, 3, 1}
9. Node 8 neighbors: {9, 12, 14, 10, 1}
10. Node 9 neighbors: {8, 11, 14, 1}
11. Node 10 neighbors: {8, 3, 1, 2, 14}
12. Node 11 neighbors: {9, 5, 14}
13. Node 12 neighbors: {6, 7, 5, 8, 14}
14. Node 13 neighbors: {5, 4, 0}
15. Node 14 neighbors: {9, 12, 8, 10, 11}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes that have three or more neighbors:

1. Node 1 has \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
2. Node 3 has \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
3. Node 4 has \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
4. Node 5 has \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
5. Node 8 has \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
6. Node 9 has \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
7. Node 10 has \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
8. Node 12 has \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
9. Node 14 has \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

Adding these up: \(10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 72\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [72].
