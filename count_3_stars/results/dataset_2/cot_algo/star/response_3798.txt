- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {6, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {7, 9, 21}
- Node 4: {10, 26}
- Node 5: {10, 14, 25}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 15}
- Node 7: {3, 11, 26}
- Node 8: {14, 27}
- Node 9: {3, 17, 22}
- Node 10: {4, 5, 20, 22, 27}
- Node 11: {2, 6, 7, 15, 19}
- Node 12: {21, 28, 29}
- Node 13: {2, 26}
- Node 14: {5, 8, 17, 25}
- Node 15: {6, 11, 15, 22, 23}
- Node 17: {0, 9, 14}
- Node 18: {22, 24, 26, 29}
- Node 19: {11}
- Node 20: {10, 24, 28}
- Node 21: {0, 3, 12, 29}
- Node 22: {9, 10, 15, 17, 18}
- Node 23: {15, 24}
- Node 24: {18, 20, 23}
- Node 25: {5, 14, 28}
- Node 26: {4, 13, 18, 7}
- Node 27: {8, 10}
- Node 28: {0, 12, 20, 25}
- Node 29: {0, 12, 18, 21}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{20} \binom{n_i}{3} = \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{6}{3} = 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 120 + 120 + 10 + 20 + 120 + 20 = 487 \]

Therefore, the final answer is [487].
