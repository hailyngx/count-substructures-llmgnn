Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 8) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 0) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 3) (10, 7) (10, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 8) (8, 12) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {7, 8, 13}
- Node 1: {9, 10, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 9, 12}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 8, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 6, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 10: {1, 7}
- Node 11: {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 12: {2, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 5}
- Node 14: {6, 8, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 4, 7, and 9 have >= 3 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars are <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, and <9, (1, 4, 11)>.
