Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 12) (16, 10) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 18) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 19) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 15) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 15) (2, 8) (2, 19) (0, 4) (0, 15) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 18) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 13) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 1) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 2) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 0) (18, 17) (18, 10) (18, 3) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify the neighbor set for each node. Let's list out the neighbor sets for each node:

1. Node 0: {4, 15}
2. Node 1: {6, 13}
3. Node 2: {8, 19}
4. Node 3: {5, 9, 11, 18}
5. Node 4: {0, 14, 19}
6. Node 5: {3, 12, 13}
7. Node 6: {1, 7, 11, 14, 17}
8. Node 7: {6, 9}
9. Node 8: {2, 9, 15}
10. Node 9: {3, 7, 8, 13}
11. Node 10: {16, 18, 19}
12. Node 11: {3, 6, 12}
13. Node 12: {5, 11, 13, 15}
14. Node 13: {1, 5, 9, 12}
15. Node 14: {4, 6, 17}
16. Node 15: {0, 8, 12}
17. Node 16: {10}
18. Node 17: {6, 14, 18}
19. Node 18: {3, 10, 17}
20. Node 19: {2, 4, 10}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

1. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
3. Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
5. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
6. Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
7. Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
8. Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
9. Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
10. Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get a total of 30 3-stars in the graph. Hence, the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (5, 9, 18)>, <3, (5, 11, 12)>, <3, (5, 11, 13)>, <3, (9, 12, 13)>, <4, (0, 14, 19)>, <6, (1, 7, 14)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <12, (5, 9, 13)>, <13, (1, 6, 9)>, <19, (2, 4, 10)>
