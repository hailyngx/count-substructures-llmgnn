Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 10) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 7) (1, 19) (17, 0) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 11) (9, 8) (9, 2) (0, 17) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 19) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 5) (16, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) (19, 18) (19, 1) (19, 0) (19, 15) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 13) (7, 18) (7, 11) (7, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 2) (3, 14) (3, 13) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 16) (5, 2) (14, 12) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 13) (6, 18) (6, 2) (10, 4) (10, 16) (13, 4) (13, 15) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. Let's denote the nodes as follows:
\[ \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19\} \]

Next, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 17, 16, 15, 12, and 19.
- Node 1 is connected to node 19.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 11, 5, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 14 and 13.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 18, 13, and 10.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 16 and 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 18 and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 18, 11, and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 16, and 11.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 2.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 4, 16.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 8, 12, 7, and 2.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 0, 14, and 11.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 15, 3, and 14.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 7, 3, 13, and 12.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 0, 19, and 13.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 8, 0, 5, 10, and 18.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 0.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 4, 19, 6, and 7.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 18, 1, 0, and 15.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, therefore it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, therefore it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, therefore it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, therefore it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, therefore it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, therefore it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, therefore it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, therefore it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, therefore it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, therefore it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, therefore it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, therefore it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Now let's sum up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, 13, 14>
- <7, 11, 14>
- <8, 11, 16>
- <0, 15, 19>
- <0, 16, 17>
- <0, 16, 19>
- <0, 16, 15>
- <0, 17, 19>
- <10, 16, 18>
- <4, 10, 18>
- <2, 6, 18>
- <2, 11, 14>
