Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
The 3-star graph can be analyzed as follows:

Node 0 has neighbors {1, 2, 4, 9}.
Node 1 has neighbors {0, 3, 6, 7}.
Node 2 has neighbors {0, 3, 6, 9}.
Node 3 has neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9}.
Node 4 has neighbors {0, 3, 9}.
Node 5 has neighbors {3, 6, 8}.
Node 6 has neighbors {1, 2, 5, 7, 8}.
Node 7 has neighbors {1, 6, 8}.
Node 8 has neighbors {3, 5, 6, 7}.
Node 9 has neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4}.

Node 3, 6, and 8 have 6, 5, and 4 neighbors respectively, forming a total of \( \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 20 + 10 + 4 = 34 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
