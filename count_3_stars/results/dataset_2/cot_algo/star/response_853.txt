Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's write down the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 49

Therefore, the final answer is [49].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
