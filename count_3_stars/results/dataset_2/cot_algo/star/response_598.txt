Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 7}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 5: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50

Thus, the answer is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>
