Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 4}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 50 \).

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)> 
<7, (4, 6, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50].
