Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 12) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 8, 2}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 11, 12, 2}
- Node 2: {4, 3, 0, 12, 1, 10}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 11, 10, 2}
- Node 4: {9, 12, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 1, 3}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 3}
- Node 7: {0, 11, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 13, 14, 0, 6}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 1, 12}
- Node 10: {3, 12, 2}
- Node 11: {7, 13, 3, 1}
- Node 12: {9, 4, 2, 10, 14, 1}
- Node 13: {8, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {8, 13, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 9, and 12. <1, (5, 9, 12)>
- Node 2 has more than 3 neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars it forms using \( \binom{n}{3} \). Node 2 forms three 3-stars: <2, (4, 1, 10)>, <2, (4, 12, 1)>, <2, (1, 12, 10)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 6, and 11. <3, (5, 6, 11)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 9, 12, and 2. <4, (9, 12, 2)>
- Node 8 forms one 3-star with neighbors 13, 14, and 9. <8, (13, 14, 9)>
- Node 12 forms three 3-stars with its neighbors. These are <12, (4, 1, 10)>, <12, (4, 2, 10)>, <12, (1, 2, 10)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
