Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 5) (27, 0) (27, 28) (27, 1) (27, 16) (1, 27) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 17) (25, 26) (25, 21) (25, 10) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 15) (7, 15) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 21) (29, 11) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 4) (26, 25) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 15) (26, 11) (20, 21) (20, 10) (2, 17) (2, 16) (22, 14) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 5) (16, 27) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 14) (23, 26) (23, 10) (23, 9) (28, 0) (28, 27) (28, 8) (28, 4) (28, 5) (6, 17) (6, 4) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 7) (15, 26) (15, 11) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 16) (14, 10) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 28) (4, 6) (9, 23) (9, 24) (21, 25) (21, 17) (21, 20) (5, 0) (5, 18) (5, 28) (5, 24) (24, 9) (24, 5) (10, 25) (10, 20) (10, 23) (10, 14) (11, 29) (11, 26) (11, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {27, 28, 15, 5}
- Node 1: {27, 13, 8}
- Node 2: {17, 16}
- Node 3: {17}
- Node 4: {19, 16, 28, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 18, 28, 24}
- Node 6: {17, 4}
- Node 7: {15}
- Node 8: {1, 13, 28, 14, 18}
- Node 9: {23, 24}
- Node 10: {25, 20, 23, 14}
- Node 11: {29, 26, 15}
- Node 13: {1, 8, 15}
- Node 14: {8, 22, 16, 10}
- Node 15: {0, 13, 7, 26, 11}
- Node 16: {27, 2, 4, 14}
- Node 17: {3, 6, 2, 21}
- Node 18: {8, 19, 5}
- Node 19: {26, 18, 4}
- Node 20: {21, 10}
- Node 21: {25, 17, 20}
- Node 22: {14}
- Node 23: {26, 10, 9}
- Node 24: {5, 9}
- Node 25: {26, 21, 10}
- Node 26: {25, 19, 23, 15, 11}
- Node 27: {0, 28, 1, 16}
- Node 28: {0, 27, 8, 4, 5}
- Node 29: {11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star graphs:

- Node 0, Node 8, Node 15, Node 16, and Node 26 have 5 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of unique 3-stars they are a central node of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 38

Therefore, the final answer is [38].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 27, 28, 15>
- <8, 1, 13, 15>
- <8, 1, 13, 28>
- <8, 1, 15, 13>
- <8, 1, 15, 28>
- <8, 1, 28, 13>
- <8, 13, 15, 1>
- <8, 13, 15, 28>
- <8, 13, 28, 15>
- <8, 15, 1, 13>
- <8, 15, 1, 28>
- <8, 15, 13, 1>
- <8, 15, 13, 28>
- <8, 15, 28, 1>
- <8, 28, 1, 13>
- <8, 28, 1, 15>
- <8, 28, 13, 1>
- <8, 28, 15, 1>
- <15, 0, 13, 26>
