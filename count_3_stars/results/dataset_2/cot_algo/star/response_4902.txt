Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 7}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars formed at each node: 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 68

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
