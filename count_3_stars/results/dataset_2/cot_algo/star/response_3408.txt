Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbor set for each node. 

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 44.

Therefore, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (5, 4, 6)>
