Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 10) 

Response:
First, we will identify the neighbors of each node:

1: 3, 8  
2: 4, 7, 11, 12  
3: 0, 1, 13  
4: 2, 8, 11, 14  
5: 6, 7, 9, 13  
6: 0, 5, 8, 10, 13  
7: 2, 5, 9, 13  
8: 1, 4, 6, 10, 11  
9: 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14  
10: 6, 8, 9, 14  
11: 0, 2, 4, 8  
12: 2, 9, 14  
13: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9  
14: 4, 9, 10, 12  

Next, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, there are C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars: <2, (4, 7, 12)>, <2, (4, 11, 12)>, <2, (7, 11, 12)>, <2, (4, 7, 11)>  
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 13)>  
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, there are C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars: <4, (2, 8, 14)>, <4, (8, 11, 14)>, <4, (2, 11, 14)>, <4, (2, 8, 11)>  
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, there are C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars: <5, (6, 7, 13)>, <5, (6, 9, 13)>, <5, (7, 9, 13)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>  
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, there are C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars  
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, there are C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars: <7, (5, 9, 13)>, <7, (2, 9, 13)>, <7, (5, 6, 13)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>  
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, there are C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars  
Node 9 has 6 neighbors, there are C(6, 3) = 20 3-stars  
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, there are C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars: <10, (6, 9, 14)>, <10, (8, 9, 14)>, <10, (6, 8, 14)>, <10, (6, 8, 9)>  
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, there are C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars: <11, (2, 4, 8)>, <11, (4, 8, 14)>, <11, (2, 8, 14)>, <11, (2, 4, 14)>  
Node 12 has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star: <12, (2, 9, 14)>  
Node 13 has 5 neighbors, there are C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars  
Node 14 has 4 neighbors, there are C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars: <14, (9, 10, 12)>, <14, (4, 9, 12)>, <14, (4, 10, 12)>, <14, (4, 9, 10)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives [77].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:  
<2, (4, 7, 12)>, <2, (4, 11, 12)>, <2, (7, 11, 12)>, <2, (4, 7, 11)>,  
<3, (0, 1, 13)>,  
<4, (2, 8, 14)>, <4, (8, 11, 14)>, <4, (2, 11, 14)>, <4, (2, 8, 11)>,  
<5, (6, 7, 13)>, <5, (6, 9, 13)>, <5, (7, 9, 13)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>,  
<6, (0, 8, 10)>, <6, (0, 5, 13)>, <6, (5, 8, 10)>, <6, (5, 9, 10)>, <6, (7, 8, 10)>, <6, (7, 9, 10)>, <6, (8, 9, 10)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 13)>, <6, (5, 9, 13)>,  
<7, (5, 9, 13)>, <7, (2, 9, 13)>, <7, (5, 6, 13)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>,  
<8, (1, 6, 10)>, <8, (1, 4, 11)>, <8, (1, 6, 11)>, <8, (4, 6, 11)>, <8, (6, 10, 11)>, <8, (6, 11, 14)>, <8, (8, 10, 11)>, <8, (8, 11, 14)>, <8, (6, 10, 14)>, <8, (6, 8, 10)>,  
<9, (5, 10, 14)>, <9, (5, 12, 13)>, <9, (6, 10, 14)>, <9, (6, 12, 13)>, <9, (7, 12, 13)>, <9, (10, 12, 14)>,  
<10, (6, 8, 14)>, <10, (8, 9, 14)>, <10, (6, 9, 14)>, <10, (6, 8, 9)>,  
<11, (2, 4, 8)>, <11, (4, 8, 14)>, <11, (2, 8, 14)>, <11, (2, 4, 14)>,  
<12, (2, 9, 14)>,  
<13, (3, 6, 7)>, <13, (3, 5, 9)>, <13, (5, 6, 7)>, <13, (5, 6, 9)>, <13, (5, 7, 9)>, <13, (7, 9, 9)>, <13, (3, 6, 13)>, <13, (3, 7, 13)>, <13, (5, 6, 13)>, <13, (5, 7, 13)>,  
<14, (4, 9, 12)>, <14, (4, 10, 12)>, <14, (4, 9, 10)>, <14, (9, 10, 12)>.
