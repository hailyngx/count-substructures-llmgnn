Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 14) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 1) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 2) (8, 16) (8, 19) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 0) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 18) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 19) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 1) (13, 12) (13, 1) (18, 11) (18, 0) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (17, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 12, 18}
- Node 1: {2, 13, 19}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 15}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 10, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 10, 17, 19}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 9, 16}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 5, 6, 15}
- Node 8: {16, 19}
- Node 9: {6, 14}
- Node 10: {4, 5, 14}
- Node 11: {14, 16, 18}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 12}
- Node 14: {9, 10, 11}
- Node 15: {2, 7, 16}
- Node 16: {6, 8, 11, 15}
- Node 17: {5}
- Node 18: {0, 11}
- Node 19: {1, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, which are candidates for forming 3-stars:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors

For each of these nodes with 3 or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 23, so the final answer is [23].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 12, 18>
- <5, 7, 10>
- <5, 7, 19>
- <7, 2, 15>
- <10, 4, 14>
