Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 8}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8.  
For these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with them:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 

\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 58 \)

So, there are a total of 58 3-stars in the given graph. 

Thus, the final answer is [58], and some of the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <1, 3, 8>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 5, 8>
