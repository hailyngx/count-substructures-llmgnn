Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 15) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 18) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 10) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 12) (9, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 19) (17, 11) (17, 0) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 10) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 19) (18, 6) (18, 19) (18, 14) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 3) (0, 6) (0, 17) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 18) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 19) (2, 16) (2, 4) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

    0 --- 6 --- 18 --- 14
    |     |     |     |
    10 -- 1 --- 15 -- 7
     |    |     |     |
    12 -- 4 --- 8 --- 9
     |    |     |     
    3 --- 13 -- 19 -- 17
           |
          5
           |
          2

Now, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 6, 17, 10
Node 1: 5, 2, 15, 10
Node 2: 16, 4, 1
Node 3: 4, 13, 19
Node 4: 8, 2, 3, 5, 12
Node 5: 4, 6, 1
Node 6: 5, 18, 12, 0
Node 7: 16, 15, 19
Node 8: 4, 9, 15
Node 9: 8
Node 10: 1, 12, 0
Node 12: 4, 6, 15, 13, 10
Node 13: 12, 3, 19
Node 14: 18
Node 15: 1, 8, 7, 12
Node 16: 7, 2
Node 17: 0, 11
Node 18: 6, 19, 14
Node 19: 13, 3, 7, 18

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <3, (4, 13, 19)>

Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are C(5,3) = 10 3-stars:
<4, (2, 5, 12)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 13)>, <4, (5, 6, 12)>, <4, (5, 12, 15)>, <4, (5, 12, 10)>, <4, (6, 12, 15)>, <4, (12, 15, 10)>, <4, (8, 9, 15)>, <4, (8, 15, 1)>

Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so there are C(5,3) = 10 3-stars:
<12, (4, 6, 15)>, <12, (4, 10, 12)>, <12, (4, 13, 12)>, <12, (4, 13, 15)>, <12, (6, 15, 18)>, <12, (6, 18, 14)>, <12, (10, 15, 0)>, <12, (10, 0, 6)>, <12, (13, 19, 3)>, <12, (15, 7, 19)>

Summing up, there are 1 + 10 + 10 = 21 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [21].
