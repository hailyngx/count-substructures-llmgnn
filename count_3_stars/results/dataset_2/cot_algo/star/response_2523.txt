Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 1) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 8) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given edges in a more readable format:

Node 0: 5, 9, 10, 14
Node 1: 9, 11, 14, 8
Node 2: 5, 10, 11, 6
Node 3: 11, 12, 13, 8
Node 4: 7, 14, 11
Node 5: 6, 2, 11, 0
Node 6: 5, 14, 2, 8
Node 7: 4, 8
Node 8: 7, 14, 6, 3, 1
Node 9: 1, 13, 0
Node 10: 0, 13, 2, 14
Node 11: 5, 4, 3, 1, 2
Node 12: 13, 3
Node 13: 9, 10, 12, 0, 3
Node 14: 4, 10, 0, 6, 8, 1

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: [4]
- Node 1: [8]
- Node 2: [4]
- Node 3: [8]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 5: [2]
- Node 6: [2]
- Node 8: [4]
- Node 10: [2]
- Node 11: [8]
- Node 13: [8]
- Node 14: [4]

 Total number of 3-stars: [47]

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 9, 10)>
<1, (9, 11, 14)>
<2, (5, 10, 11)>
<3, (11, 13, 8)>
<4, (7, 14, 4)>
<5, (6, 2, 5)>
<6, (8, 6, 14)>
<8, (7, 8, 3)>
<10, (0, 13, 10)>
<11, (5, 4, 3)>
<13, (9, 12, 3)>
