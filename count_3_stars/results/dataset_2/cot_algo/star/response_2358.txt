Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {6, 12}

Node 1: {3, 7, 9, 14}

Node 2: {5, 10, 14}

Node 3: {1, 4, 7, 12, 13}

Node 4: {3, 7, 9}

Node 5: {2, 6, 7, 9}

Node 6: {0, 5, 8, 11}

Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 5, 11}

Node 8: {6, 10, 11, 14}

Node 9: {1, 4, 5, 13}

Node 10: {2, 8, 13, 14}

Node 11: {6, 7, 8, 12, 13}

Node 12: {0, 3, 11, 13}

Node 13: {1, 3, 9, 10, 11, 12}

Node 14: {1, 2, 8, 10}

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can potentially form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can potentially form 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can potentially form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can potentially form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can potentially form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can potentially form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can potentially form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can potentially form 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can potentially form 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can potentially form 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can potentially form 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it can potentially form 20 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can potentially form 4 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of potential 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 69

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [69].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 8, 11)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (6, 10, 14)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<10, (2, 8, 13)>
<11, (6, 7, 8)>
<12, (0, 3, 11)>
<13, (1, 3, 9)>
<14, (8, 10, 14)>
