Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 6) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 6) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 14) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {1, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 1 neighbors: {0, 3, 4, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 2 neighbors: {7, 8, 14}
- Node 3 neighbors: {1, 4, 5, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 13}
- Node 5 neighbors: {3, 9, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 6 neighbors: {8, 10, 11}
- Node 7 neighbors: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 8 neighbors: {1, 2, 6, 10}
- Node 9 neighbors: {0, 5, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 10 neighbors: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 11 neighbors: {5, 6, 14}
- Node 12 neighbors: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 13 neighbors: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 14 neighbors: {1, 2, 5, 9, 11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 1 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 3 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 5 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 14 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Adding them up: 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 70

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [70].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 3, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 13)>
- <5, (3, 9, 14)>
- <9, (3, 7, 12)>
- <14, (1, 11, 5)>
