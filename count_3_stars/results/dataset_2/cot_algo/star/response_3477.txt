Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 7) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 7) (17, 6) (17, 0) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 19) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 11) (6, 4) (6, 17) (6, 0) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 2) (19, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 15) (7, 18) (7, 13) (15, 5) (15, 16) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (10, 1) (0, 2) (0, 17) (0, 6) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 12, 17}
- Node 1: {3, 10, 16}
- Node 2: {0, 8, 13, 19}
- Node 3: {1, 12, 14, 16, 19}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 18}
- Node 5: {4, 11, 14, 15}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 17}
- Node 7: {13, 18}
- Node 8: {2, 16}
- Node 9: {12, 19}
- Node 10: {1}
- Node 11: {5, 14, 19}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 9, 13}
- Node 13: {2, 7, 12}
- Node 14: {3, 5, 11}
- Node 15: {5, 16}
- Node 16: {1, 3, 8, 15}
- Node 17: {0, 6}
- Node 18: {4, 7}
- Node 19: {2, 3, 9, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 19 have at least 3 neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 6 nodes * 1 3-star each = 6 3-stars
- For the remaining nodes:
  - Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
  - Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
  - Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  
Adding them all up: 6 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 39

Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 2, 12>
- <0, 2, 13>
- <0, 2, 19>
- <2, 8, 16>
- <2, 13, 12>
- <2, 13, 7>
- <3, 12, 0>
- <3, 12, 13>
- <3, 12, 9>
- <3, 12, 19>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <5, 14, 11>
- <5, 14, 3>
- <5, 15, 16>
- <12, 0, 17>
- <16, 1, 10>
- <16, 1, 3>
- <16, 8, 2>
- <16, 15, 5>
- <19, 9, 12>
- <19, 9, 3>
- <19, 11, 5>
- <19, 11, 14>
