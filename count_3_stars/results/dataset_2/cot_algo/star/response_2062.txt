Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 26) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 23) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 20) (2, 7) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 5) (7, 2) (7, 21) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 28) (21, 7) (4, 7) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 25) (23, 9) (23, 15) (23, 19) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 17) (20, 2) (20, 29) (20, 0) (20, 1) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 24) (18, 28) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 1) (22, 6) (26, 6) (26, 25) (26, 17) (3, 9) (3, 13) (24, 0) (24, 18) (24, 12) (15, 23) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 23) (19, 25) (1, 20) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 27) (11, 1) (11, 12) (13, 3) (13, 28) (13, 27) (25, 8) (25, 26) (25, 19) (16, 17) (16, 10) (17, 0) (17, 26) (17, 16) (17, 12) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 28) (5, 29) (5, 18) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 16) (12, 24) (12, 11) (12, 17) (28, 7) (28, 18) (28, 13) (28, 27) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {20, 24, 17}
- Node 1: {20, 14, 11, 27}
- Node 2: {29, 18, 19, 20, 7}
- Node 3: {9, 13}
- Node 4: {7, 14}
- Node 5: {29, 18}
- Node 6: {9, 22, 26}
- Node 7: {2, 21, 4, 10, 28}
- Node 8: {10, 25}
- Node 9: {6, 14, 3, 23}
- Node 10: {7, 8, 16}
- Node 11: {1, 12}
- Node 12: {24, 11, 17}
- Node 13: {3, 28, 27}
- Node 14: {9, 4, 1}
- Node 15: {23}
- Node 16: {17, 10}
- Node 17: {0, 26, 16, 12}
- Node 18: {2, 5, 24, 28}
- Node 19: {2, 29, 23, 25}
- Node 20: {2, 29, 0, 1}
- Node 21: {7}
- Node 22: {6}
- Node 23: {9, 15, 19}
- Node 24: {0, 18, 12}
- Node 25: {8, 26, 19}
- Node 26: {6, 25, 17}
- Node 27: {1, 13, 28}
- Node 28: {7, 18, 13, 27}
- Node 29: {2, 20, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2, Node 7, Node 9, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19, Node 20, Node 24, Node 25, and Node 28 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <2, (7, 18, 28)>
- <7, (2, 18, 28)>
- <9, (14, 4, 1)>
- <17, (0, 26, 16)>
- <18, (2, 5, 24)>
- <19, (2, 29, 23)>
- <20, (2, 29, 0)>
- <24, (0, 18, 12)>
- <25, (8, 26, 19)>
- <28, (7, 18, 13)>
