Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 13) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 21) (26, 16) (26, 4) (4, 26) (4, 25) (7, 29) (7, 6) (7, 22) (0, 27) (0, 20) (0, 11) (27, 0) (27, 18) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 16) (18, 21) (22, 7) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 12) (22, 21) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 5) (5, 26) (5, 20) (5, 6) (5, 11) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 24) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 25) (1, 15) (1, 25) (17, 28) (3, 20) (3, 13) (11, 0) (11, 22) (11, 5) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 2) (19, 8) (19, 24) (25, 4) (25, 8) (25, 1) (24, 6) (24, 19) (24, 29) (10, 2) (10, 23) (12, 22) (12, 16) (12, 29) (16, 26) (16, 18) (16, 12) (16, 29) (29, 7) (29, 24) (29, 12) (29, 16) (13, 9) (13, 3) (21, 26) (21, 18) (21, 22) (14, 8) (14, 23) (14, 28) (28, 9) (28, 17) (28, 14) (28, 2) (23, 15) (23, 10) (23, 14) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 28) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first need to find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {27, 20, 11}
- Node 1: {15, 25}
- Node 2: {15, 10, 28}
- Node 3: {20, 13}
- Node 4: {26, 25}
- Node 5: {26, 20, 6, 11}
- Node 6: {7, 5, 24}
- Node 7: {29, 22, 6}
- Node 8: {19, 14, 25}
- Node 9: {26, 28, 13}
- Node 10: {2, 23}
- Node 11: {0, 22, 5}
- Node 12: {22, 16, 29}
- Node 13: {9, 3}
- Node 14: {8, 23, 28}
- Node 15: {1, 23, 2}
- Node 16: {26, 18, 12, 29}
- Node 17: {28}
- Node 18: {27, 22, 16, 21}
- Node 19: {8, 24}
- Node 20: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 21: {26, 18, 22}
- Node 22: {7, 18, 11, 21, 12}
- Node 23: {15, 10, 14}
- Node 24: {6, 19, 29}
- Node 25: {4, 8, 1}
- Node 26: {9, 5, 21, 16, 4}
- Node 27: {0, 18}
- Node 28: {9, 17, 14, 2}
- Node 29: {7, 24, 12, 16}

Now, we identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 5: <5, (11, 20, 26)>
- Node 8: <8, (14, 19, 25)>
- Node 14: <14, (1, 23, 28)>
- Node 16: <16, (12, 26, 29)>
- Node 18: <18, (21, 22, 26)>
- Node 22: <22, (7, 11, 18)>
- Node 23: <23, (10, 14, 15)>
- Node 24: <24, (6, 19, 29)>
- Node 25: <25, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 26: <26, (4, 5, 16)>
- Node 28: <28, (2, 14, 17)>
- Node 29: <29, (12, 16, 24)>

There are 12 unique 3-stars found. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [12].
