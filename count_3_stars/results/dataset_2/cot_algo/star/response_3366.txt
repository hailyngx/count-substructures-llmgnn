Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 8, 9, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 5: Forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 8, 9)
- Node 9: Forms 3-stars with nodes (3, 7, 5) and (7, 0, 5)
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 2, 8)
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 2, 5)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, (1, 8, 9)>
- <9, (3, 7, 5)>
- <9, (7, 0, 5)>
- <1, (4, 2, 8)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>
