Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 25) (15, 16) (27, 7) (27, 1) (6, 7) (6, 29) (6, 0) (9, 0) (22, 2) (23, 8) (23, 0) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 17) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 21) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 23) (0, 14) (0, 29) (14, 4) (14, 0) (13, 16) (13, 29) (13, 10) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 21) (26, 7) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 28) (17, 8) (17, 20) (17, 12) (17, 5) (20, 17) (20, 24) (20, 28) (20, 10) (21, 4) (21, 26) (21, 16) (28, 26) (28, 11) (28, 20) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 21) (16, 1) (10, 13) (10, 26) (10, 20) (10, 7) (10, 24) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 12) (24, 20) (24, 10) (24, 7) (24, 25) (7, 27) (7, 6) (7, 26) (7, 10) (7, 24) (29, 6) (29, 0) (29, 13) (19, 1) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 25) (1, 27) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 19) (25, 15) (25, 24) (25, 12) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges into sets for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 9, 23, 14, 29}
- Node 1: {16, 4, 27, 19}
- Node 2: {22, 5, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {14, 1, 21}
- Node 5: {8, 2, 17, 12}
- Node 6: {7, 29, 0}
- Node 7: {27, 6, 26, 10, 24}
- Node 8: {23, 5, 17}
- Node 9: {0}
- Node 10: {13, 26, 20, 7, 24}
- Node 11: {3, 28}
- Node 12: {3, 17, 5, 25}
- Node 13: {16, 29, 10}
- Node 14: {4, 0}
- Node 15: {25, 16}
- Node 16: {15, 13, 21, 1}
- Node 17: {8, 20, 12, 5}
- Node 19: {1}
- Node 20: {17, 24, 28, 10}
- Node 21: {4, 26, 16}
- Node 22: {2}
- Node 23: {0, 8}
- Node 24: {20, 10, 7, 25}
- Node 25: {15, 24, 12}
- Node 26: {28, 26, 21, 7, 10}
- Node 27: {1, 7}
- Node 28: {26, 20, 11}
- Node 29: {6, 0, 13}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 23 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 0 + 1 = 66

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the given graph is [66].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 6, 29>, <0, 6, 23>, <0, 9, 29>, <0, 14, 29>, <0, 23, 14>, <1, 4, 16>, <1, 19, 27>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 11, 12>, <5, 8, 17>, <7, 10, 24>, <7, 10, 26>, <7, 24, 25>, <10, 13, 26>, <10, 20, 24>, <16, 21, 26>, <16, 1, 15>, <17, 20, 28>.
