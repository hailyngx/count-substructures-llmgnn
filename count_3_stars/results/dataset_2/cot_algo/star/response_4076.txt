Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 11) (13, 9) (22, 10) (15, 27) (15, 26) (15, 23) (15, 7) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 16) (18, 7) (18, 28) (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (25, 3) (25, 16) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 20) (1, 24) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 7) (20, 1) (20, 16) (21, 27) (21, 10) (24, 1) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 28) (14, 2) (17, 1) (17, 9) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 3) (7, 0) (5, 19) (5, 29) (5, 11) (5, 16) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 16) (26, 15) (26, 24) (26, 28) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 17) (29, 5) (29, 8) (10, 22) (10, 21) (10, 28) (8, 24) (8, 19) (8, 29) (8, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 24) (6, 8) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 5) (23, 15) (28, 18) (28, 14) (28, 26) (28, 10) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 19) (16, 27) (16, 25) (16, 20) (16, 5) (16, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 17, 20, 24}
- Node 2: {14, 15, 19}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7, 25}
- Node 5: {11, 16, 19, 29}
- Node 6: {3, 8, 12, 24}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 15, 18}
- Node 8: {6, 19, 24, 29}
- Node 9: {12, 13, 17}
- Node 10: {21, 22, 28}
- Node 11: {5, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {6, 9, 27}
- Node 13: {9, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 11, 28}
- Node 15: {2, 7, 23, 26, 27}
- Node 16: {5, 19, 20, 25, 27}
- Node 17: {1, 9}
- Node 18: {7, 28}
- Node 19: {2, 5, 8, 16}
- Node 20: {1, 16}
- Node 21: {10, 27}
- Node 22: {10}
- Node 23: {15}
- Node 24: {1, 6, 8, 26}
- Node 25: {3, 16}
- Node 26: {15, 24, 28}
- Node 27: {12, 15, 16, 21}
- Node 28: {10, 14, 26}
- Node 29: {5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 17, 20)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (3, 8, 12)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (3, 15, 18)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (6, 19, 24)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (12, 13, 17)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (21, 22, 28)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (5, 13, 14)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (6, 9, 27)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (2, 11, 28)>
- Node 15 forms two 3-stars: <15, (2, 7, 23)> and <15, (2, 15, 26)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star: <16, (5, 19, 20)>
- Node 19 forms two 3-stars: <19, (2, 5, 19)> and <19, (5, 16, 8)>
- Node 24 forms a 3-star: <24, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 26 forms a 3-star: <26, (15, 24, 28)>
- Node 27 forms a 3-star: <27, (12, 15, 16)>
- Node 28 forms a 3-star: <28, (10, 14, 26)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
