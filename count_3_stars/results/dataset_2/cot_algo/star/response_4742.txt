Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (1, 25) (1, 22) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 12) (25, 1) (25, 3) (25, 14) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 22) (20, 4) (20, 6) (22, 1) (22, 15) (22, 17) (26, 16) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 7) (19, 4) (19, 10) (16, 26) (16, 28) (16, 21) (28, 16) (28, 0) (28, 23) (27, 8) (27, 17) (21, 16) (21, 0) (7, 9) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 24) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 2) (29, 24) (29, 18) (29, 10) (18, 15) (18, 29) (18, 23) (18, 8) (23, 28) (23, 18) (23, 4) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 24) (4, 20) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 10) (6, 20) (6, 8) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 29) (10, 2) (10, 4) (24, 7) (24, 29) (24, 2) (24, 17) (17, 22) (17, 27) (17, 24) (12, 3) (12, 14) (8, 27) (8, 18) (8, 0) (8, 6) (14, 25) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 21, 28}
- Node 1: {22, 25}
- Node 2: {9, 10, 11, 24}
- Node 3: {10, 12, 25}
- Node 4: {10, 19, 20, 23}
- Node 5: {9, 13}
- Node 6: {8, 20}
- Node 7: {9, 11, 13, 15, 24}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 18, 27}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 4, 19, 29}
- Node 11: {2, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {3, 14}
- Node 13: {5, 7, 11}
- Node 14: {12, 25}
- Node 15: {7, 18, 22}
- Node 16: {21, 26, 28}
- Node 17: {22, 24, 27}
- Node 18: {8, 15, 23, 29}
- Node 19: {4, 10}
- Node 20: {4, 6}
- Node 21: {16, 0}
- Node 22: {1, 15, 17}
- Node 23: {4, 18, 28}
- Node 24: {2, 7, 17, 29}
- Node 25: {1, 3, 14}
- Node 26: {16, 28}
- Node 27: {8, 17}
- Node 28: {0, 16, 23}
- Node 29: {10, 18, 24}

Now, letâ€™s calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 26
    - Total 3-stars from these nodes: \(\binom{0}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{12}{3} + \binom{13}{3} + \binom{14}{3} + \binom{20}{3} + \binom{21}{3} + \binom{26}{3} = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 220 + 286 + 364 + 1140 + 1330 + 2600 = 7744\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7744].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (8, 21, 28)>
- <1, (22, 25)>
- <3, (10, 12, 25)>
- <5, (9, 13)>
- <6, (8, 20)>
- <12, (3, 14, 25)>
- <13, (5, 7, 11)>
- <14, (12, 25, 3)>
- <20, (4, 19, 10)>
- <21, (0, 16, 28)>
- <26, (16, 21, 28)>
