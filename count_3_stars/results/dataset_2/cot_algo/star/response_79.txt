Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (3, 5) (3, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 2) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 14), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 1), (4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 10), (4, 6), (7, 12), (7, 0), (6, 14), (6, 13), (10, 11), (10, 0), (11, 3), (11, 14), (11, 1), (11, 2), (2, 13), (8, 1), (0, 7), (0, 10), (12, 14)

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

### Node Analysis:
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: {9, 6, 1, 3, 14}
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {5, 6, 8, 1}
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {7, 12, 10, 6}
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {4, 12, 0}
Node 6 has 6 neighbors: {5, 9, 4, 14, 8, 13}
Node 10 has 3 neighbors: {4, 11, 0}
Node 11 has 5 neighbors: {10, 3, 14, 1, 2}
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {11, 13, 14}
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {9, 6, 1}
Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {7, 10, 1}
Node 12 has 3 neighbors: {4, 7, 14}
Node 3 has 2 neighbors: {5, 11}
Node 14 has 6 neighbors: {5, 6, 10, 11, 2, 12}
Node 1 has 5 neighbors: {5, 9, 11, 8, 0}
Node 13 has 3 neighbors: {6, 10, 2}

### Calculation:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {5, 9, 4, 6, 11, 14, 1, 13}
Number of 3-stars:
[inom{5}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{6}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{6}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{3}{3}]
= [10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1]
= [79]

### Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 1)>, <6, (5, 9, 8)>, <6, (5, 4, 14)>, <6, (9, 4, 14)>, <6, (4, 14, 13)>, <11, (10, 3, 14)>, <11, (10, 14, 2)>, <14, (6, 10, 11)>
