Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {9, 4, 6, 3}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 2}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 6, 8, 1}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 4, 8, 0}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 0, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 3}
- Node 6: {7, 1, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 6}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 2, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 2, 3, 0}

Now, we can find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 62

Therefore, the final answer is [62] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (9, 4, 6)>
- <2, (9, 4, 8)>
- <3, (5, 4, 9)>
- <4, (7, 8, 0)>
- <6, (7, 1, 2)>
- <8, (9, 4, 3)>
- <9, (5, 2, 3)>
