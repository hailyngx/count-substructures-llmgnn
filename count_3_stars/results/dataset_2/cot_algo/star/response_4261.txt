Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 10) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 10) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 11) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 11) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {9, 4, 2, 7, 11}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {9, 3, 13, 8}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {8, 4, 0, 10}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {1, 7, 12, 4}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {3, 8, 0, 2}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {9, 10, 14}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {7, 13}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {6, 3, 0, 11}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4, 2, 14}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {5, 10, 14, 1, 0}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {5, 9, 13, 2}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {13, 7, 12, 0, 14}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {3, 14, 11}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {6, 1, 11, 10}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {5, 9, 8, 12, 11}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Nodes 0, 4, 2, 7, 11, and 14 each have 5 neighbors or more, so we will apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of them.

Calculating:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 42

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us the answer: [42].
