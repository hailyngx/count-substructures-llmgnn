Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 16) (22, 13) (22, 6) (22, 12) (22, 1) (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 13) (16, 11) (16, 20) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 22) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 27) (3, 26) (9, 18) (9, 2) (26, 3) (26, 28) (26, 23) (12, 22) (12, 10) (12, 23) (27, 3) (27, 21) (27, 24) (27, 6) (0, 2) (0, 15) (2, 14) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (28, 26) (28, 19) (28, 5) (28, 10) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 8) (21, 27) (21, 29) (23, 26) (23, 12) (23, 25) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 29) (15, 4) (19, 14) (19, 28) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 29) (29, 21) (29, 15) (29, 7) (29, 8) (29, 5) (20, 16) (20, 10) (25, 13) (25, 23) (24, 27) (10, 12) (10, 28) (10, 20) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 28) (5, 29) (5, 4) (6, 22) (6, 27) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 29) (4, 15) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 15}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 22}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 26, 27}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 15}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4, 11, 28, 29}
- Node 6: Neighbors {22, 27}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 17, 18, 29}
- Node 8: Neighbors {11, 18, 29}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 18}
- Node 10: Neighbors {12, 20, 28}
- Node 11: Neighbors {5, 8, 16}
- Node 12: Neighbors {10, 22, 23}
- Node 13: Neighbors {16, 22, 25}
- Node 14: Neighbors {2, 19}
- Node 15: Neighbors {0, 4, 17, 29}
- Node 16: Neighbors {11, 13, 20}
- Node 17: Neighbors {7, 15, 18}
- Node 18: Neighbors {7, 8, 9, 17}
- Node 19: Neighbors {14, 28}
- Node 20: Neighbors {10, 16}
- Node 21: Neighbors {27, 29}
- Node 22: Neighbors {1, 12, 13, 6}
- Node 23: Neighbors {12, 25, 26}
- Node 24: Neighbors {27}
- Node 25: Neighbors {13, 23}
- Node 26: Neighbors {3, 23, 27, 28}
- Node 27: Neighbors {3, 6, 21, 24}
- Node 28: Neighbors {5, 10, 19, 26}
- Node 29: Neighbors {5, 7, 8, 15, 21}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 17, 19, 23, 24, 25
Number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star
- Node 23: 1 3-star
- Node 24: 0 3-stars
- Node 25: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 14
Therefore, the final answer is [14] 

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 5, 22)>, <3, (1, 26, 27)>, <4, (5, 15, -)>, <6, (22, 27, -)>, <9, (2, 18, -)>, <10, (28, 20, -)>, <12, (23, 22, -)>, <13, (22, 16, 25)>, <17, (7, 15, 18)>, <19, (28, 14, -)>, <23, (25, 26, 12)>, <25, (13, 23, -)>
