Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 13) (17, 19) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 15) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 13) (13, 17) (13, 18) (4, 16) (4, 6) (4, 15) (12, 16) (12, 2) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 18) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 5) (3, 14) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 8) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 0) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {6, 9, 5}
- Node 1: {9, 10, 8}
- Node 2: {14, 12, 15}
- Node 3: {14, 18, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {16, 6, 15}
- Node 5: {18, 7, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {10, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 15, 3}
- Node 9: {6, 10, 1, 0}
- Node 10: {16, 9, 7, 1}
- Node 11: {16}
- Node 12: {16, 2}
- Node 13: {17, 18}
- Node 14: {3, 19, 2}
- Node 15: {4, 2, 8}
- Node 16: {11, 12, 4, 10}
- Node 17: {13, 19}
- Node 18: {19, 5, 3, 13}
- Node 19: {14, 17, 18}

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 2 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 26

So, the final answer is [26].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 6, 9>
- <3, 14, 18>
- <5, 7, 18>
- <6, 0, 9>
- <8, 1, 10>
- <9, 6, 10>
- <10, 1, 9>
- <14, 3, 19>
- <15, 2, 4>
- <16, 11, 12>
- <18, 13, 19>
