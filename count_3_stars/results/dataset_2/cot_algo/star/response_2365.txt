Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 2, 6}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 6, 9, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 2}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 8, 5, 1, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 4, 7, 8, 3}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 7, 2}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 6, 0, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 2}
- Node 9: {2, 7}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 have 6 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 90 \). Therefore, the answer is [90].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 4, 6)>
