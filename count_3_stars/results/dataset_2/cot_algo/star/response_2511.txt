Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 0) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 6) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 11}
- Node 2: {3, 8, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {2, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 7, 12}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 7, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {2, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 9: {2, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 5, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {2, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 14: {5, 6, 9, 10, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars based on the number of neighbors each node has:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form  inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form  inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form  inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form  inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form  inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form  inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form  inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form  inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form  inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form  inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form  inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Adding all the possible 3-stars for each node, we get a total of 4+4+10+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+10 = 60 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:
