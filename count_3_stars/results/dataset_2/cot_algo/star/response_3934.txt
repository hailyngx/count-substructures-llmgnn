Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 28) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 15) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 20) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 24) (18, 0) (18, 29) (15, 8) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 24) (20, 13) (20, 15) (20, 1) (17, 27) (29, 18) (19, 15) (19, 26) (19, 10) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 11) (26, 16) (26, 7) (6, 10) (6, 22) (28, 5) (28, 10) (28, 23) (0, 8) (0, 18) (7, 26) (7, 25) (7, 16) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 16) (25, 22) (25, 10) (11, 2) (11, 26) (11, 23) (23, 26) (23, 28) (23, 11) (23, 16) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 26) (16, 7) (16, 25) (16, 23) (16, 12) (1, 2) (1, 20) (1, 25) (1, 4) (27, 17) (27, 24) (27, 14) (3, 24) (14, 4) (14, 27) (24, 8) (24, 18) (24, 15) (24, 27) (24, 3) (10, 5) (10, 19) (10, 6) (10, 28) (10, 25) (22, 6) (22, 25) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we first need to find the neighbor set for each node:

1. Node 0 neighbors: {8, 18}
2. Node 1 neighbors: {2, 4, 25}
3. Node 2 neighbors: {1, 11, 12, 18}
4. Node 3 neighbors: {24}
5. Node 4 neighbors: {1, 9, 14}
6. Node 5 neighbors: {9, 10, 28}
7. Node 6 neighbors: {10, 22}
8. Node 7 neighbors: {16, 25, 26}
9. Node 8 neighbors: {0, 13, 15, 24}
10. Node 9 neighbors: {4, 5}
11. Node 10 neighbors: {5, 19, 25, 28, 6}
12. Node 11 neighbors: {2, 23, 26}
13. Node 12 neighbors: {2, 16}
14. Node 13 neighbors: {8, 20}
15. Node 14 neighbors: {4, 27}
16. Node 15 neighbors: {8, 20, 24, 19}
17. Node 16 neighbors: {7, 12, 23, 25, 26}
18. Node 17 neighbors: {27}
19. Node 18 neighbors: {2, 24, 29, 8}
20. Node 19 neighbors: {15, 10, 26}
21. Node 20 neighbors: {13, 15, 1}
22. Node 22 neighbors: {6, 25}
23. Node 23 neighbors: {11, 16, 26, 28}
24. Node 24 neighbors: {8, 18, 15, 3, 27}
25. Node 25 neighbors: {1, 10, 22, 16, 7}
26. Node 26 neighbors: {7, 11, 16, 19, 23}
27. Node 27 neighbors: {17, 14, 24}
28. Node 28 neighbors: {5, 10, 23}

Now, we need to identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 8 all have 3+ neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1, there is only 1 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 25)>
- For Node 2, there is only 1 3-star: <2, (1, 11, 18)>
- For Node 4, there is only 1 3-star: <4, (1, 9, 14)>
- For Node 8, there are 4 3-stars: <8, (0, 13, 15)>, <8, (0, 18, 24)>, <8, (13, 15, 20)>, <8, (18, 24, 27)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
