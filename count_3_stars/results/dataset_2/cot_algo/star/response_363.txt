Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 1) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 28) (0, 27) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 12) (27, 0) (27, 10) (2, 29) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 26) (29, 15) (18, 0) (18, 7) (14, 23) (14, 28) (14, 9) (17, 9) (15, 29) (15, 5) (15, 24) (20, 1) (20, 23) (20, 5) (20, 16) (5, 15) (5, 20) (5, 26) (5, 25) (16, 22) (16, 20) (16, 28) (28, 22) (28, 2) (28, 14) (28, 16) (28, 24) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 19) (23, 14) (23, 20) (23, 11) (23, 9) (23, 19) (25, 5) (25, 6) (25, 26) (26, 29) (26, 5) (26, 25) (19, 22) (19, 11) (19, 23) (19, 3) (19, 1) (7, 29) (7, 18) (7, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 10) (1, 13) (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 4) (10, 27) (10, 3) (10, 4) (12, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (6, 25) (6, 8) (24, 15) (24, 28) (24, 21) (9, 14) (9, 17) (9, 23) (8, 6) (8, 21) (21, 24) (21, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 27, 3, 18, 12
- Node 1: 13, 20, 19, 4
- Node 2: 29, 28
- Node 3: 0, 19, 10
- Node 4: 1, 10
- Node 5: 15, 20, 26, 25
- Node 6: 25, 8
- Node 7: 29, 18, 11
- Node 8: 6, 21
- Node 9: 14, 17, 23
- Node 10: 27, 3, 4
- Node 11: 23, 7, 19
- Node 12: 0
- Node 13: 22, 1
- Node 14: 23, 28, 9
- Node 15: 29, 5, 24
- Node 16: 22, 20, 28
- Node 17: 9
- Node 18: 0, 7
- Node 19: 22, 11, 23, 3, 1
- Node 20: 1, 16, 23, 5
- Node 21: 24, 8
- Node 22: 13, 19, 16, 28
- Node 23: 14, 20, 11, 9, 19
- Node 24: 15, 21, 28
- Node 25: 5, 26, 6
- Node 26: 29, 5, 25
- Node 27: 0, 10
- Node 28: 22, 2, 14, 16, 24
- Node 29: 15, 2, 26, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 5: <5, (15, 25, 26)>
- Node 20: <20, (1, 16, 23)>
- Node 22: <22, (13, 16, 28)>
- Node 23: <23, (20, 11, 19)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars, so the total number of 3-stars is [4].
