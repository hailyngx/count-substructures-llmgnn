Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 0, 3, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 6 neighbors (forms a 3-star)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (forms a 3-star)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 10 = 30, which we put inside brackets: [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <7, (1, 2, 8)>
