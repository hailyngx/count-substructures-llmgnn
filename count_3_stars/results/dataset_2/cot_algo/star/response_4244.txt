Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (3, 26) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 12) (15, 28) (6, 9) (6, 22) (9, 6) (9, 27) (8, 29) (8, 16) (8, 12) (13, 24) (4, 3) (2, 18) (2, 11) (18, 2) (0, 20) (0, 10) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 22) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 21) (20, 27) (17, 20) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 22) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 24) (1, 7) (16, 8) (16, 28) (16, 22) (28, 15) (28, 16) (28, 22) (25, 17) (25, 19) (10, 0) (10, 19) (26, 3) (26, 12) (7, 1) (7, 11) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 19) (5, 23) (5, 29) (23, 15) (23, 5) (23, 24) (23, 27) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 21) (21, 20) (21, 19) (21, 29) (27, 9) (27, 20) (27, 23) (24, 13) (24, 0) (24, 1) (24, 23) (24, 14) (14, 24) (29, 8) (29, 0) (29, 5) (29, 21) (22, 6) (22, 0) (22, 17) (22, 16) (22, 28) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 26) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {10, 20, 22, 24, 29}
- Node 1: {7, 11, 15, 24}
- Node 2: {11, 18}
- Node 3: {4, 19, 26}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {23, 29}
- Node 6: {9, 22}
- Node 7: {1, 11}
- Node 8: {12, 16, 29}
- Node 9: {6, 27}
- Node 10: {0, 19}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 7, 19}
- Node 12: {8, 17, 15, 26}
- Node 13: {24}
- Node 14: {24}
- Node 15: {1, 12, 23, 28}
- Node 16: {8, 22, 28}
- Node 17: {12, 20, 22, 25}
- Node 18: {2}
- Node 19: {3, 10, 11, 21, 25}
- Node 20: {0, 17, 21, 27}
- Node 21: {19, 20, 29}
- Node 22: {0, 6, 16, 17, 28}
- Node 23: {5, 15, 24, 27}
- Node 24: {0, 1, 13, 14, 23}
- Node 25: {17, 19}
- Node 26: {3, 12}
- Node 27: {9, 20, 23}
- Node 28: {15, 16, 22}
- Node 29: {0, 5, 8, 21}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 3, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, and 29.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of unique 3-stars they can form:

- Node 0: [C(5, 3)] = [10]
- Node 1: [C(4, 3)] = [4]
- Node 3: [C(3, 3)] = [1]
- Node 8: [C(3, 3)] = [1]
- Node 11: [C(4, 3)] = [4]
- Node 12: [C(4, 3)] = [4]
- Node 15: [C(4, 3)] = [4]
- Node 16: [C(3, 3)] = [1]
- Node 17: [C(4, 3)] = [4]
- Node 19: [C(5, 3)] = [10]
- Node 20: [C(4, 3)] = [4]
- Node 22: [C(5, 3)] = [10]
- Node 23: [C(4, 3)] = [4]
- Node 24: [C(5, 3)] = [10]
- Node 27: [C(3, 3)] = [1]
- Node 28: [C(3, 3)] = [1]
- Node 29: [C(4, 3)] = [4]

Adding all of these up, we have a total of 70 unique 3-stars:
<0, 10, 20, 22>, <0, 10, 20, 24>, <0, 10, 20, 29>, <0, 10, 22, 24>, <0, 10, 22, 29>, <0, 10, 24, 29>, <0, 20, 22, 24>, <0, 20, 22, 27>, <0, 20, 24, 27>, <0, 22, 24, 27>, <0, 24, 29, 5>, <1, 7, 11, 19>, <1, 7, 19, 21>, <1, 11, 19, 21>, <1, 24, 13, 14>, <3, 4, 19, 25>, <8, 12, 17, 22>, <15, 12, 26, 3>, <15, 23, 5, 29>, <16, 8, 29, 5>, <17, 12, 26, 3>, <19, 21, 29, 5>, <20, 17, 22, 28>, <22, 16, 28, 15>, <23, 24, 13, 14>, <24, 13, 14, 23>
