Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 10) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 18) (1, 29) (1, 7) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 22) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 23) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 24) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 5) (11, 6) (26, 6) (29, 1) (28, 3) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 2) (24, 10) (24, 0) (24, 7) (2, 17) (2, 28) (2, 22) (2, 27) (2, 16) (22, 8) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (25, 27) (27, 2) (27, 25) (27, 21) (27, 23) (4, 22) (4, 12) (12, 28) (12, 22) (12, 4) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 9) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 23) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 19) (0, 18) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 15) (7, 9) (21, 27) (21, 9) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 2) (20, 14) (20, 9) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 21) (9, 20) (6, 11) (6, 26) (18, 17) (18, 0) (23, 14) (23, 13) (23, 27) (23, 19) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star formations:

- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 20, and 23: <14, (10, 20, 23)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 16, and 18: <17, (2, 16, 18)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 19, and 23: <13, (8, 19, 23)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 14, and 24: <10, (11, 14, 24)>
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 11, and 12: <28, (2, 11, 12)>
- Node 2 has more than 3 neighbors, thus can form additional 3-stars:
  - Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 17, and 28: <2, (16, 17, 28)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, and 12: <22, (4, 8, 12)>
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with nodes 23, 25, and 27: <27, (23, 25, 27)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 13, and 23: <19, (0, 13, 23)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 18, and 19: <0, (3, 18, 19)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 9, and 15: <7, (1, 9, 15)>

Adding up all the unique 3-stars we found, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
