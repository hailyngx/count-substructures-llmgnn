Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 2}
- Node 1: {6, 7, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 3, 5, 8, 0}
- Node 3: {9, 1, 2, 5}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 2, 0}
- Node 5: {6, 1, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {5, 1, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 9, 4, 1}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 2}
- Node 9: {4, 3, 7, 0}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [ \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) ] = 1
- Node 1: [ \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) ] = 10
- Node 2: [ \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) ] = 10
- Node 3: [ \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ] = 4
- Node 5: [ \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) ] = 10
- Node 7: [ \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ] = 4
- Node 9: [ \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ] = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 43

Thus, the final answer is [43].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (9, 4, 2)>
- <1, (6, 7, 3)>
- <1, (6, 7, 5)>
- <1, (7, 4, 2)>
- <1, (7, 3, 5)>
- <1, (7, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 2, 5)>
- <1, (5, 2, 8)>
- <2, (4, 3, 5)>
- <3, (9, 7, 4)>
- <5, (6, 7, 1)>
- <5, (6, 1, 7)>
- <7, (9, 4, 1)>
