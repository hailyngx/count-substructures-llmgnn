Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 6, 7
Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 3: 4, 8
Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 8, 9
Node 5: 2, 7, 8
Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8
Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 70 3-stars. So, the final answer is [70].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
