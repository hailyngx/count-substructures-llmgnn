Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (17, 13) (17, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 2) (5, 13) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 12) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 3) (15, 9) (16, 12) (16, 6) (18, 14) (18, 19) (18, 6) (12, 13) (12, 16) (3, 17) (3, 9) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 11) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 1) (11, 6) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 6) (6, 16) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 2) 

Response:
The graph described has a total of 20 nodes and 60 edges. 

After examining the neighbor nodes for each node, we find the following nodes and their neighbors: 

- Node 0: {8, 10, 14}
- Node 1: {9, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {6, 14, 19}
- Node 3: {9, 13, 17}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {13}
- Node 6: {2, 11, 16, 18}
- Node 7: {4, 8, 10}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 8, 15}
- Node 10: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 11: {1, 4, 6, 19}
- Node 12: {13, 16}
- Node 13: {3, 5, 12, 17}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 2, 4, 18}
- Node 15: {9}
- Node 16: {6, 12}
- Node 17: {3, 13}
- Node 18: {6, 14, 19}
- Node 19: {2, 11, 18}

From the neighbor sets, we can identify the following 3-stars:

- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 9, 10}: <8, (4, 9, 10)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 18}: <14, (1, 2, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
