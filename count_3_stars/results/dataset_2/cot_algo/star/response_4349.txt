Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46 \) 3-stars. 
Therefore, the final answer is [46]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 6, 5>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <4, 7, 5>
- <7, 1, 5>
- <7, 1, 4>
- <7, 0, 1>
- <7, 0, 4>
- <7, 0, 5>
- <9, 6, 1>
- <9, 6, 5>
- <9, 6, 4>
- <9, 2, 1>
- <9, 2, 3>
- <9, 2, 0>
