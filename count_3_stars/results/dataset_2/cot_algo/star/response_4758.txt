Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: 5, 6, 8
Node 1: 9, 6, 4, 7, 8
Node 2: 9, 4
Node 3: 6, 4
Node 4: 9, 7, 6, 8, 1, 2, 3
Node 5: 8, 0, 7
Node 6: 9, 1, 3, 8, 0, 4
Node 7: 5, 4, 1, 8
Node 8: 5, 6, 4, 7, 0, 1
Node 9: 6, 4, 2, 1

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:
Node 1: 5 neighbors
Node 4: 7 neighbors
Node 6: 6 neighbors
Node 8: 6 neighbors
Node 9: 4 neighbors

For the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 35 + 20 + 20 = 85

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [85].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
