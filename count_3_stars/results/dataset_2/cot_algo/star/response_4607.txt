Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 22) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 27) (4, 0) (4, 29) (4, 2) (7, 23) (7, 26) (21, 28) (21, 18) (21, 29) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 27) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 16) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 0) (1, 16) (1, 18) (26, 7) (26, 15) (26, 20) (28, 21) (28, 12) (28, 10) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 18) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 20) (11, 9) (11, 23) (11, 15) (23, 7) (23, 11) (23, 27) (17, 25) (17, 22) (25, 13) (25, 17) (25, 10) (22, 5) (22, 14) (22, 17) (22, 19) (19, 22) (19, 3) (19, 12) (18, 21) (18, 1) (18, 0) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 24) (16, 15) (24, 16) (24, 3) (15, 26) (15, 11) (15, 16) (3, 19) (3, 2) (3, 24) (20, 26) (20, 14) (20, 12) (12, 28) (12, 19) (12, 20) (10, 6) (10, 28) (10, 25) (10, 2) (27, 9) (27, 8) (27, 23) (29, 4) (29, 21) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4, 6, 14, 18
- Node 1: 16, 18
- Node 2: 3, 4, 10
- Node 3: 2, 19, 24
- Node 4: 0, 2, 29
- Node 5: 6, 9, 22
- Node 6: 0, 5, 8, 10
- Node 7: 23, 26
- Node 8: 6, 13, 27
- Node 9: 5, 11, 27
- Node 10: 2, 6, 25, 28
- Node 11: 9, 15, 23
- Node 12: 19, 20, 28
- Node 13: 8, 16, 25
- Node 14: 0, 20, 22
- Node 15: 11, 16, 26
- Node 16: 1, 13, 15, 24
- Node 17: 22, 25
- Node 18: 1, 21, 0
- Node 19: 3, 12, 22
- Node 20: 12, 14, 26
- Node 21: 18, 28, 29
- Node 22: 5, 14, 17, 19
- Node 23: 7, 11, 27
- Node 24: 3, 16
- Node 25: 10, 13, 17
- Node 26: 7, 15, 20
- Node 27: 8, 9, 23
- Node 28: 10, 12, 21
- Node 29: 4, 21

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the number of 3-stars formed by each:

- Node 0 and Node 6 have 4 neighbors each, so they each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 10, Node 22, and Node 27 have 3 neighbors each, so they each form 1 3-star.
- Node 12, Node 14, Node 16, and Node 25 have 3 neighbors each, so they each form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 6 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed by this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (4, 6, 14)>
- <6, (0, 8, 10)>
- <2, (4, 10, 29)>
- <4, (0, 2, 29)>
- <5, (6, 9, 22)>
- <10, (2, 6, 28)>
- <22, (14, 17, 19)>
- <27, (9, 23, 8)>
- <12, (19, 20, 28)>
- <14, (0, 20, 22)>
- <16, (1, 13, 15)>
- <25, (10, 13, 17)>
