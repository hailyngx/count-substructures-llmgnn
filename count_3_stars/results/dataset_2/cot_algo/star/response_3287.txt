Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1, 3, 7
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: neighbors are 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 4: neighbors are 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 5: neighbors are 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: neighbors are 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 8: neighbors are 4, 5
- Node 9: neighbors are 3, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 3, 7)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 1, 5)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 6, 8)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes (6, 8, 9)
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 2, 9)

Total number of 3-stars: 5

Therefore, the final answer is [5]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>
