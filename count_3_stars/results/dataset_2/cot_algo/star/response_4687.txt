Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 20) (0, 10) (0, 23) (27, 2) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 29) (13, 8) (13, 3) (23, 0) (23, 8) (23, 20) (23, 12) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 23) (20, 29) (20, 12) (14, 11) (14, 5) (4, 24) (4, 29) (18, 21) (18, 1) (18, 3) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 18) (26, 28) (26, 5) (26, 25) (28, 26) (28, 17) (28, 9) (28, 22) (5, 14) (5, 26) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 6) (1, 18) (1, 22) (15, 5) (15, 12) (29, 8) (29, 20) (29, 4) (29, 25) (6, 19) (6, 21) (6, 16) (21, 18) (21, 6) (21, 22) (2, 27) (2, 22) (2, 25) (22, 28) (22, 1) (22, 21) (22, 2) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 6) (16, 24) (24, 4) (24, 16) (24, 25) (9, 28) (9, 25) (25, 26) (25, 29) (25, 2) (25, 24) (25, 9) (12, 23) (12, 20) (12, 15) (7, 5) (7, 17) (17, 28) (17, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {10, 20, 23}
- Node 1: {18, 22}
- Node 2: {25, 27, 22}
- Node 3: {11, 13, 18}
- Node 4: {24, 29}
- Node 5: {7, 14, 15, 19, 26}
- Node 6: {16, 19, 21}
- Node 7: {5, 17}
- Node 8: {13, 20, 23, 29}
- Node 9: {25, 28}
- Node 10: {0, 16}
- Node 11: {3, 14}
- Node 12: {15, 20, 23}
- Node 13: {3, 8}
- Node 14: {5, 11}
- Node 15: {5, 12}
- Node 16: {6, 10, 19, 24}
- Node 17: {7, 28}
- Node 18: {1, 3, 21}
- Node 19: {5, 6, 16}
- Node 20: {0, 8, 12, 23, 29}
- Node 21: {6, 18, 22}
- Node 22: {1, 2, 21, 28}
- Node 23: {0, 8, 12, 20}
- Node 24: {4, 16, 25}
- Node 25: {2, 9, 24, 25, 29}
- Node 26: {5, 25, 28}
- Node 27: {2}
- Node 28: {9, 17, 22, 25, 26}
- Node 29: {4, 8, 20, 25}

Node 25, 28, and 29 each have 5 neighbors, so they form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \), which can be represented as [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <25, (2, 9, 28)>
- <28, (9, 17, 22)>
- <29, (4, 8, 20)>
