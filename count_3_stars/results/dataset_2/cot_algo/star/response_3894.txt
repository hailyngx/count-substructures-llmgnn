Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 19) (22, 13) (22, 27) (22, 11) (22, 12) (8, 23) (8, 28) (8, 25) (8, 17) (23, 8) (23, 24) (2, 18) (2, 14) (2, 21) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 5) (1, 26) (1, 16) (1, 10) (26, 1) (26, 21) (0, 14) (0, 21) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 4) (4, 18) (4, 14) (15, 2) (15, 16) (20, 6) (21, 2) (21, 26) (21, 0) (21, 28) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 24) (17, 8) (17, 25) (17, 5) (17, 7) (25, 8) (25, 17) (25, 5) (25, 10) (25, 24) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 25) (10, 29) (3, 7) (3, 6) (7, 17) (7, 3) (24, 23) (24, 28) (24, 25) (6, 20) (6, 3) (6, 29) (6, 11) (29, 10) (29, 6) (29, 19) (19, 13) (19, 29) (19, 12) (27, 22) (27, 11) (27, 16) (9, 16) (16, 1) (16, 15) (16, 27) (16, 9) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 11) (11, 22) (11, 6) (11, 27) (11, 5) (12, 22) (12, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 23: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 26: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding them up:
1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 47

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 47, which can be represented as [47]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: <1, (16, 1, 10)>, <2, (2, 18, 4)>, <4, (2, 14, 0)>, <5, (18, 5, 11)>, <6, (20, 6, 29)>, <8, (23, 8, 28)>, <10, (25, 10, 13)>, <11, (11, 5, 27)>, <13, (19, 12, 22)>, <14, (14, 0, 4)>, <16, (9, 16, 27)>, <17, (5, 11, 17)>, <18, (2, 4, 5)>, <21, (1, 26, 21)>, <22, (13, 19, 27)>, <23, (8, 24, 23)>, <24, (28, 24, 25)>, <25, (17, 25, 8)>, <26, (16, 1, 21)>, <27, (11, 16, 27)>, <28, (24, 25, 28)>, <29, (6, 19, 29)>
