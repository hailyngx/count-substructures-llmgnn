Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 6) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 12) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 6) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 12) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) 

Response:
Since there are 15 nodes in the graph, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 9, 10}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 6, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 11}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {1, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 12: {3, 5, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 4, 6, 10}
- Node 14: {3, 5, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 79

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [79].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 4)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (5, 9, 10)>, <2, (6, 11, 13)>, <3, (4, 12, 14)>, <4, (3, 6, 13)>, <5, (3, 12, 14)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 11, 13)>, <8, (11, 6, 13)>, <12, (9, 10, 14)>
