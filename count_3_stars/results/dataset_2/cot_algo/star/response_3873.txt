Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 11) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 10) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 10}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 11, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7, 9, 11}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 9, 10}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 8, 10}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 12, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 4, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {3, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {7, 11, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 7, 9
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 6, 8
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 12, 1, 11
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, 9
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 8, 12
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 7, 9, 13
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 4, 12
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 6, 8

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars formed, we get a total of 8 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, 7, 9>
- <9, 5, 6>
- <4, 1, 12>
- <6, 1, 3>
- <7, 5, 8>
- <8, 7, 9>
- <11, 5, 12>
- <3, 1, 6>
