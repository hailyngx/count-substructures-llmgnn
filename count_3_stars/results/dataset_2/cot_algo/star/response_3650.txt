Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 8}

Next, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 34 \). Thus, the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
