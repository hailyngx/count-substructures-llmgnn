Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 23) (15, 0) (15, 11) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 2) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 28) (7, 4) (7, 20) (7, 19) (7, 28) (2, 17) (2, 8) (29, 13) (29, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 16) (8, 2) (8, 24) (8, 20) (8, 12) (22, 6) (26, 18) (26, 23) (26, 21) (9, 18) (9, 21) (18, 26) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 12) (21, 26) (21, 9) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 27) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 22) (5, 29) (5, 28) (23, 3) (23, 26) (23, 20) (23, 12) (11, 15) (24, 8) (24, 27) (27, 16) (27, 24) (27, 20) (20, 7) (20, 8) (20, 23) (20, 27) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 23) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 29) (13, 12) (13, 19) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 25) (25, 14) (25, 16) (25, 19) (28, 4) (28, 7) (28, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the number of neighbors for each node in the graph based on the given edges. 
Here is the list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 4, 15, 16, 19
Node 1 neighbors: 3, 6
Node 2 neighbors: 8, 10, 17
Node 3 neighbors: 1, 23
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 7, 13, 28
Node 5 neighbors: 28, 29
Node 6 neighbors: 1, 10, 22
Node 7 neighbors: 4, 7, 19, 20
Node 8 neighbors: 2, 12, 20, 24
Node 9 neighbors: 18, 21
Node 10 neighbors: 6, 16, 17
Node 11 neighbors: 15
Node 12 neighbors: 8, 12, 13, 14, 18, 23
Node 13 neighbors: 4, 12, 19, 29
Node 14 neighbors: 12, 17, 25
Node 15 neighbors: 0, 11
Node 16 neighbors: 0, 10, 18, 25, 27
Node 17 neighbors: 2, 10, 14
Node 18 neighbors: 9, 12, 16
Node 19 neighbors: 0, 7, 13, 25
Node 20 neighbors: 7, 8, 23, 27
Node 21 neighbors: 9, 26
Node 22 neighbors: 6
Node 23 neighbors: 3, 12, 20, 26
Node 24 neighbors: 8, 27
Node 25 neighbors: 14, 16, 19
Node 26 neighbors: 18, 21, 23
Node 27 neighbors: 16, 20, 24
Node 28 neighbors: 4, 5, 7
Node 29 neighbors: 5, 13

Now, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars. 
These nodes are: 0, 4, 7, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20, 23, 25, 28.

For these nodes, we find the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 65 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [65].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, 15, 16>, <0, 15, 11>, <0, 19, 7>, <0, 19, 25>, <4, 0, 28>, <4, 7, 19>, <4, 7, 28>, <4, 7, 13>, <7, 20, 8>, <7, 20, 27>, <12, 23, 20>, <12, 23, 26>, <12, 13, 19>, <12, 13, 4>, <12, 18, 16>, <12, 18, 26>, <13, 29, 5>, <13, 29, 4>, <16, 0, 25>, <16, 0, 27>, <16, 25, 19>, <16, 25, 14>, <19, 25, 14>, <19, 25, 16>, <23, 26, 21>, <23, 26, 18>, <25, 14, 17>, <25, 14, 16>, <28, 4, 7>, <28, 4, 5>
