Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 1, 6
Node 1: 7, 3, 6, 13, 9, 0
Node 2: 4, 10, 8
Node 3: 4, 1, 11, 14, 5, 8
Node 4: 7, 0, 3, 2
Node 5: 3, 12, 13
Node 6: 1, 14, 0
Node 7: 4, 11, 14, 1, 8
Node 8: 7, 3, 2
Node 9: 1, 10, 11, 13, 14
Node 10: 11, 12, 2, 9
Node 11: 7, 3, 10, 9, 12
Node 12: 10, 11, 5
Node 13: 1, 5, 9
Node 14: 7, 3, 6, 9

Now let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it forms: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 70

Therefore, the final answer is [70].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 7, 3>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 3, 13>
<1, 9, 13>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 7, 13>
<3, 9, 13>
