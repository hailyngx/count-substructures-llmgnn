Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 6) (12, 14) (12, 10) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) 

Response:
First, we need to find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 8, 9, 11, 14}
Node 1: {0, 5, 10}
Node 2: {5, 9, 13}
Node 3: {4, 7, 9}
Node 4: {3, 6, 8, 11}
Node 5: {1, 2, 11, 13, 14}
Node 6: {4, 8, 11, 13}
Node 7: {3, 8, 9, 13}
Node 8: {0, 4, 6, 7}
Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 7, 11, 14}
Node 10: {1, 5, 12}
Node 11: {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
Node 12: {10, 14}
Node 13: {5, 6, 7, 2}
Node 14: {0, 5, 9, 12}

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: [1]
Node 1: [1]
Node 2: [1]
Node 3: [1]
Node 4: [1]
Node 5: [1]
Node 6: [1]
Node 7: [1]
Node 8: [1]
Node 9: [1]
Node 10: [1]
Node 11: [1]
Node 12: [1]
Node 13: [1]
Node 14: [1]

The total number of 3-stars is 14. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, 1, 11>, 
<1, 0, 5>, 
<2, 5, 13>, 
<3, 4, 9>, 
<4, 11, 6>, 
<5, 1, 10>, 
<6, 4, 13>, 
<7, 8, 9>, 
<8, 0, 6>, 
<9, 3, 11>, 
<10, 1, 12>, 
<11, 4, 6>, 
<12, 10, 14>, 
<13, 2, 7>, 
<14, 0, 5>.
