Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 14) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 9) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 12) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {10, 7, 12}
- Node 1: {11, 2, 13, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {10, 8, 5, 1, 6}
- Node 3: {11, 13, 7, 14, 6}
- Node 4: {8, 6}
- Node 5: {10, 8, 2, 14}
- Node 6: {11, 4, 2, 7, 3}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 6, 14, 1}
- Node 8: {4, 2, 5}
- Node 9: {13, 1, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 11, 2, 5, 14}
- Node 11: {10, 3, 1, 6}
- Node 12: {0, 9, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 1, 9}
- Node 14: {10, 5, 7, 3, 12}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 14: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by each node gives: 
1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 72

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [72], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, 7, 12>, <1, 2, 13>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 7, 13>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 9, 13>, <2, 5, 10>, <2, 5, 14>, <2, 6, 11>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 11>, <3, 6, 14>, <3, 7, 14>, <5, 10, 14>, <6, 11, 13>, <7, 10, 14>, <7, 11, 14>, <7, 12, 14>
