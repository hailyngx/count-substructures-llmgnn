Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 17) (27, 24) (27, 28) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 24) (22, 23) (22, 6) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 3) (23, 9) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 29) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (1, 20) (1, 5) (26, 14) (26, 29) (26, 6) (26, 17) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 21) (14, 26) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 18) (20, 28) (20, 16) (7, 12) (7, 25) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 7) (25, 7) (25, 6) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 3) (19, 8) (19, 5) (16, 0) (16, 20) (16, 29) (21, 0) (21, 9) (21, 2) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 2) (29, 8) (29, 26) (29, 16) (9, 23) (9, 21) (9, 3) (13, 6) (18, 20) (18, 6) (18, 28) (28, 27) (28, 20) (28, 18) (6, 22) (6, 26) (6, 25) (6, 13) (6, 18) (17, 15) (17, 23) (17, 26) (3, 23) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 14) (2, 21) (2, 24) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {4, 14, 16, 21}
- Node 1: {5, 20}
- Node 2: {3, 14, 21, 24}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 9, 23}
- Node 4: {0, 8, 10}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 19}
- Node 6: {13, 18, 22, 25, 26}
- Node 7: {12, 25}
- Node 8: {4, 8, 19, 29}
- Node 9: {3, 9, 21, 23}
- Node 10: {4, 11, 12}
- Node 11: {10, 24}
- Node 12: {7, 10, 14}
- Node 13: {6}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 12, 26}
- Node 15: {17, 20}
- Node 16: {0, 20, 29}
- Node 17: {15, 23, 26}
- Node 18: {6, 18, 20, 28}
- Node 19: {5, 8}
- Node 20: {1, 15, 18, 28}
- Node 21: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 22: {6, 23}
- Node 23: {3, 9, 17, 22}
- Node 24: {2, 11, 27}
- Node 25: {6, 7}
- Node 26: {6, 14, 17, 26}
- Node 27: {24, 28}
- Node 28: {18, 20, 27}
- Node 29: {8, 16, 26}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

By observing the neighbor sets, we see that nodes 6, 18, and 20 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form 10 3-stars each. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 10 + 10 = 30, which we write as [30].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <6, (13, 18, 22)>
- <18, (6, 20, 28)>
- <20, (1, 15, 28)>
