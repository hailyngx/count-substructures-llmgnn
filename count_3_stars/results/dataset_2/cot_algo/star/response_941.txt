Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 11) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 7) (0, 14) (0, 16) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 11) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 17) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 0) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (11, 15) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 17) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 6) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 18) (17, 8) (17, 19) (17, 2) (18, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {14, 16}
- Node 1: {11, 16, 7}
- Node 2: {13, 10, 17}
- Node 3: {5, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 10}
- Node 5: {9, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {12, 4, 10}
- Node 7: {5, 1, 11}
- Node 8: {15, 19, 10, 17}
- Node 9: {5, 16, 13}
- Node 10: {8, 4, 6, 2}
- Node 11: {15, 1, 7, 19, 12}
- Node 12: {14, 6, 11}
- Node 13: {9, 2, 18}
- Node 14: {0, 15, 12}
- Node 15: {8, 11, 14}
- Node 16: {9, 1, 0}
- Node 17: {8, 19, 2}
- Node 18: {13}
- Node 19: {8, 11, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \binom{1}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + 1 + 1 + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 3 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 37 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [37].

Unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 7, 11>
- <2, 8, 10>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <5, 3, 7>
- <8, 10, 17>
- <11, 1, 7>
- <13, 9, 2>
- <14, 0, 15>
- <15, 8, 11>
- <17, 8, 19>
