Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 7) (15, 9) (4, 14) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 13) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 18) (5, 10) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 16) (1, 14) (1, 13) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 2) (13, 7) (13, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 18) (16, 9) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 11) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 19) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 11) (12, 3) (12, 0) (11, 18) (11, 9) 

Response:
Let's first construct the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3, 8, 12, 16}
Node 1: {13, 14}
Node 2: {3, 10, 17, 19}
Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 12}
Node 4: {14}
Node 5: {6, 10, 17, 19}
Node 6: {3, 5, 16}
Node 7: {9, 13, 15, 19}
Node 8: {0, 14, 18}
Node 9: {7, 11, 15, 16}
Node 10: {2, 5, 17}
Node 11: {9, 18}
Node 12: {0, 3}
Node 13: {1, 7}
Node 14: {1, 4, 8}
Node 15: {7, 9}
Node 16: {0, 6, 9, 18}
Node 17: {2, 5, 10}
Node 18: {8, 11, 16, 19}
Node 19: {2, 5, 7, 18}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
<3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 12)>, <3, (0, 6, 12)>, <3, (2, 6, 12)>

Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
<7, (9, 13, 15)>, <7, (9, 13, 19)>, <7, (9, 15, 19)>, <7, (13, 15, 19)>

Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 
<10, (2, 5, 17)>

Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 
<14, (1, 8, 4)>

Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
<16, (0, 6, 9)>, <16, (0, 9, 18)>, <16, (6, 9, 18)>, <16, (0, 6, 18)>

Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
<18, (8, 11, 16)>, <18, (8, 11, 19)>, <18, (8, 16, 19)>, <18, (11, 16, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \([4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [18]\). 
The unique 3-stars found are <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 12)>, <3, (0, 6, 12)>, <3, (2, 6, 12)>, <7, (9, 13, 15)>, <7, (9, 13, 19)>, <7, (9, 15, 19)>, <7, (13, 15, 19)>, <10, (2, 5, 17)>, <14, (1, 8, 4)>, <16, (0, 6, 9)>, <16, (0, 9, 18)>, <16, (6, 9, 18)>, <16, (0, 6, 18)>, <18, (8, 11, 16)>, <18, (8, 11, 19)>, <18, (8, 16, 19)>, <18, (11, 16, 19)>.
