Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 3, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 1, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 1, 6, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 9, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 2, 1, 4, 3, 0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 2, 8, 7, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9, 8, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 0, 7, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 4, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 2, 4}.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 1, 6}.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 9, 6}.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 2, 8}.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 2, 4)>
- <3, (5, 1, 6)>
- <4, (5, 9, 6)>
- <6, (3, 2, 8)>
