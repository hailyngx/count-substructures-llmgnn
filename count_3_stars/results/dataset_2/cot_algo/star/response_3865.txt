Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 19) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (1, 15) (1, 0) (17, 12) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 4) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 1) (15, 17) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 5) (19, 4) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 4) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 18) (16, 12) (16, 4) (14, 8) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 16) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 7) (2, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 18) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 11)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (0, 15)
- Node 2: 1 neighbor (6)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (8, 12)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (0, 16, 17, 19)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (7, 11, 19)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (2, 19)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (5, 9, 13, 18)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (3, 13, 14)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (7, 10, 13, 15)
- Node 10: 4 neighbors (9, 11, 15, 19)
- Node 11: 4 neighbors (0, 5, 10, 19)
- Node 12: 4 neighbors (3, 17, 16, 18)
- Node 13: 3 neighbors (7, 8, 19)
- Node 14: 1 neighbor (8)
- Node 15: 4 neighbors (9, 10, 1, 17)
- Node 16: 2 neighbors (4, 12)
- Node 17: 4 neighbors (4, 18, 12, 15)
- Node 18: 3 neighbors (7, 12, 17)
- Node 19: 5 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 10, 13)

Next, we will count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 19

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node:

- Node 0: No 3-star
- Node 4: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 7: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 10: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 11: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 15: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 17: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 19: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <4, (0, 16, 17)>
- <5, (7, 11, 19)>
- <7, (9, 13, 18)>
- <9, (10, 13, 15)>
- <10, (9, 11, 19)>
- <11, (0, 5, 19)>
- <12, (3, 16, 18)>
- <15, (9, 10, 17)>
- <17, (4, 12, 18)>
- <19, (5, 6, 13)>
