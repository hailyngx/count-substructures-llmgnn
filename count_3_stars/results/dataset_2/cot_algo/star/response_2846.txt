Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 10) (17, 19) (17, 4) (17, 7) (1, 14) (1, 13) (5, 15) (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (4, 17) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 12) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 2) (16, 7) (16, 10) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 19) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (0, 15) (0, 18) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 16) (10, 6) (13, 1) (13, 18) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 13) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {15, 18}
- Node 1: {13, 14}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {9, 15, 18}
- Node 4: {17, 19}
- Node 5: {9, 11, 15}
- Node 6: {2, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 10, 16, 17}
- Node 8: {9, 12}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 8, 11}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 14, 16}
- Node 11: {5, 9, 19}
- Node 12: {8, 14, 15}
- Node 13: {1, 18}
- Node 14: {1, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 15: {0, 3, 5, 12}
- Node 16: {7, 10}
- Node 17: {4, 7, 19}
- Node 18: {3, 13}
- Node 19: {4, 11, 17}

Calculating the possible 3-star combinations:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 3 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [29].

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (9, 15, 18)>, <5, (9, 11, 15)>, <7, (10, 14, 16)>, <9, (2, 5, 11)>, <10, (6, 7, 14)>, <11, (5, 9, 19)>, <14, (6, 10, 12)>, <15, (3, 5, 12)>, <17, (4, 7, 19)>
