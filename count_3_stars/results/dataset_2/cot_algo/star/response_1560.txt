Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 20) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 20) (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 15) (5, 4) (9, 0) (9, 24) (10, 21) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 19) (17, 29) (17, 8) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (29, 17) (29, 14) (15, 22) (15, 20) (15, 2) (20, 11) (20, 16) (20, 15) (20, 27) (26, 13) (26, 3) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 7) (18, 13) (18, 14) (18, 28) (18, 21) (19, 10) (19, 27) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 21) (6, 1) (21, 10) (21, 18) (21, 6) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 24) (1, 6) (1, 25) (1, 8) (4, 22) (4, 5) (28, 18) (28, 24) (28, 23) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 24) (8, 27) (24, 9) (24, 2) (24, 28) (24, 8) (24, 23) (25, 1) (25, 23) (25, 14) (27, 20) (27, 19) (27, 8) (27, 3) (3, 10) (3, 26) (3, 27) (14, 29) (14, 18) (14, 25) (23, 28) (23, 24) (23, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {16, 9, 7}
- Node 1: {6, 25, 8}
- Node 2: {12, 15, 24}
- Node 3: {10, 26, 27}
- Node 4: {22, 5}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {11, 7, 21, 1}
- Node 7: {16, 12, 0, 6}
- Node 8: {17, 1, 24, 27}
- Node 9: {0, 24}
- Node 10: {21, 3, 12, 19}
- Node 11: {6, 20}
- Node 12: {10, 7, 2}
- Node 13: {22, 26, 18}
- Node 14: {29, 18, 25}
- Node 15: {22, 20, 2}
- Node 16: {0, 20, 7}
- Node 17: {8, 29}
- Node 18: {13, 14, 28, 21}
- Node 19: {10, 27}
- Node 20: {11, 16, 15, 27}
- Node 21: {10, 6, 18}
- Node 22: {13, 4, 15}
- Node 23: {28, 24, 25}
- Node 24: {9, 2, 28, 8, 23}
- Node 25: {1, 14, 23}
- Node 26: {13, 3}
- Node 27: {20, 19, 8, 3}
- Node 28: {18, 24, 23}
- Node 29: {17, 14}

Next, we'll determine the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 24, 3-star formed with neighbors: {8, 28, 23}
- Node 27, 3-star formed with neighbors: {20, 19, 8}
- Node 18, 3-star formed with neighbors: {21, 14, 28}
- Node 20 has exactly 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <20, (11, 16, 15)>

There are 3 3-stars in total formed by the nodes above, hence the answer is [3].
