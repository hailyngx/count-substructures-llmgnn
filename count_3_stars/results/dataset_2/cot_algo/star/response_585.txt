- Node 23: 0, 7, 13
- Node 24: 16, 21, 25, 26, 29
- Node 25: 4, 15, 21, 24
- Node 26: 19, 24
- Node 27: 6, 22, 19
- Node 28: 14, 18
- Node 29: 9, 15, 24

From the above neighbor sets, we can calculate the number of 3-star graphs formed. There are 38 unique 3-star graphs in total. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [38], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (12, 20, 18)>, <4, (16, 11, 24)>, <5, (22, 15, 29)>, <6, (2, 1, 27)>, <7, (17, 20, 23)>, <8, (11, 19, 22)>, <9, (29, 15, 24)>, <10, (5)>, <12, (0)>, <13, (23, 5)>, <14, (9, 28)>, <15, (5, 25, 29)>, <16, (11, 4, 24)>, <17, (7, 2, 1)>, <18, (12, 28, 20)>, <19, (26, 8, 27)>, <20, (12, 7, 18)>, <21, (25, 24, 6)>, <22, (8, 5, 27)>, <23, (0, 7, 13)>, <24, (25, 29, 16)>, <25, (15, 21, 24)>, <26, (24, 19)>, <27, (19, 6, 22)>, <28, (18, 14)>, <29, (15, 24, 9)>
