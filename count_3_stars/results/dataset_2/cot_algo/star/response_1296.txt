Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {1, 3, 5}
Node 1: {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
Node 2: {3, 5, 8}
Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
Node 4: {3, 5, 7}
Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
Node 6: {3, 5, 8, 9}
Node 7: {1, 4, 5, 8}
Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
Node 9: {1, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star graphs:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
