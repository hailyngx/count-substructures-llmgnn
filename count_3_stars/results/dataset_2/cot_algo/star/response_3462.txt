Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 27) (11, 12) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 20) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 14) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 13) (1, 18) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 10) (23, 18) (23, 7) (23, 6) (23, 19) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 25) (4, 26) (28, 4) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 9) (29, 14) (17, 2) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 29) (25, 11) (25, 4) (25, 13) (27, 11) (27, 22) (27, 7) (7, 23) (7, 27) (7, 26) (14, 15) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 5) (26, 4) (26, 7) (26, 14) (26, 10) (26, 6) (10, 8) (10, 26) (19, 23) (19, 6) (22, 27) (22, 0) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 5) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 23) (6, 26) (6, 19) (6, 18) (20, 16) (20, 1) (18, 1) (18, 23) (18, 6) (18, 24) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 24) (24, 8) (24, 18) (24, 12) (0, 22) (0, 21) (21, 0) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 25) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we first need to identify nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 1: {3, 13, 18, 20}
- Node 2: {5, 16, 17}
- Node 3: {1, 13, 15}
- Node 4: {8, 9, 25, 26, 28}
- Node 5: {2, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {18, 19, 23, 26}
- Node 7: {22, 23, 26, 27}
- Node 8: {4, 10, 24}
- Node 9: {4, 9, 14, 15, 29}
- Node 10: {8, 26}
- Node 11: {12, 16, 25, 27}
- Node 12: {5, 11, 24}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 25}
- Node 14: {5, 9, 14, 15, 26, 29}
- Node 15: {3, 9, 14}
- Node 16: {2, 11, 20}
- Node 17: {2}
- Node 18: {1, 6, 23, 24}
- Node 19: {6, 23}
- Node 20: {1, 16}
- Node 21: {0}
- Node 22: {0, 7, 27}
- Node 23: {6, 7, 18, 19}
- Node 24: {8, 12, 18}
- Node 25: {4, 11, 13}
- Node 26: {4, 6, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 27: {7, 11, 22}
- Node 28: {4, 29}
- Node 29: {9, 14, 28}

Now, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 4, 9, 14, and 26 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 1, 3, 18, 23, and 24 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 \times 4 + 4 \times 5 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
1. <4, (9, 14, 26)>
2. <9, (4, 14, 29)>
3. <14, (4, 9, 26)>
4. <26, (4, 7, 14)>
5. <1, (3, 13, 18)>
6. <3, (1, 13, 15)>
7. <18, (1, 6, 24)>
8. <23, (7, 19, 18)>
9. <24, (8, 12, 18)>
