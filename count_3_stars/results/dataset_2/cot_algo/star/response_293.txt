Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 19) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 1) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 15) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 16) (2, 16) (2, 3) (18, 12) (18, 19) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 15) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 16) (15, 12) (15, 13) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 19) (16, 0) (16, 6) (16, 2) (16, 1) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 9) (10, 4) (10, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {12, 14, 16, 11, 1}
- Node 1: {4, 8, 0, 16}
- Node 2: {16, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 10, 9}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 1, 10}
- Node 5: {6, 13}
- Node 6: {14, 5, 16}
- Node 7: {4, 12, 11, 19}
- Node 8: {4, 9, 12, 1}
- Node 9: {8, 14, 3, 19}
- Node 10: {4, 3}
- Node 11: {7, 0}
- Node 12: {7, 8, 0, 18, 15}
- Node 13: {5, 15}
- Node 14: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 15: {12, 13}
- Node 16: {0, 6, 2, 1}
- Node 18: {12, 19}
- Node 19: {7, 18, 9}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, and 19.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \).

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 40

Therefore, the final answer is [40].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 1, 16>, <0, 1, 14>, <0, 1, 12>, <0, 1, 16>, <0, 1, 11>, <0, 16, 6>, <0, 16, 2>, <0, 16, 1>, <1, 4, 10>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 8, 12>, <1, 8, 4>, <3, 9, 14>, <4, 10, 3>, <4, 8, 12>, <4, 8, 1>, <6, 16, 2>, <12, 18, 19>, <12, 18, 7>, <12, 15, 13>, <12, 15, 7>, <12, 15, 0>, <12, 15, 9>, <14, 6, 5>, <16, 2, 3>, <16, 6, 5>, <16, 6, 14>, <16, 0, 1>, <19, 18, 12>
