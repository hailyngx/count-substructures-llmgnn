Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 18) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 10) (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 15) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 16) (11, 6) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 12) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 7) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 10) (7, 2) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 16) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 18) (4, 9) (4, 17) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (12, 19) (12, 10) (12, 18) (18, 8) (18, 17) (18, 16) (18, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we need to find the number of 3-stars in the graph.

First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {8, 13, 15}
- Node 2: {0, 7}
- Node 3: {8, 14, 16}
- Node 4: {9, 17}
- Node 5: {14, 19}
- Node 6: {9, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 10, 16, 17, 19}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 18}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {7, 9, 12, 13, 15}
- Node 11: {6}
- Node 12: {10, 18, 19}
- Node 13: {1, 6, 10}
- Node 14: {5, 9, 3}
- Node 15: {1, 10, 19}
- Node 16: {3, 7, 18}
- Node 17: {4, 7, 18}
- Node 18: {8, 12, 16, 17}
- Node 19: {5, 7, 12, 15}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 18: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 19: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (8, 13, 15)>, <10, (7, 9, 12)>, <12, (10, 18, 19)>, <13, (1, 6, 10)>, <14, (5, 9, 3)>, <18, (8, 12, 16)>, <19, (7, 12, 15)>
