Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 10) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (18, 4) (18, 15) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 8) (7, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 15) (19, 16) (19, 12) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 3) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 15) (10, 16) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 2) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 9) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 12) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors. Then we will count the number of unique 3-stars formed around each of those nodes.

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 16, 18)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (14, 4, 17)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (11, 15, 17)
- Node 12: 4 neighbors (2, 13, 15, 19)
- Node 10: 4 neighbors (5, 9, 13, 16)
- Node 13: 4 neighbors (3, 7, 10, 12)
- Node 15: 3 neighbors (8, 12, 18)

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22

Therefore, there are a total of 22 3-stars in this graph. 

<4, (1, 5, 16)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 18)>, <4, (3, 5, 18)>, <4, (1, 3, 18)>, <4, (3, 16, 18)>, <1, (14, 17, 4)>, <12, (2, 15, 19)>, <12, (2, 13, 15)>, <12, (2, 13, 19)>, <10, (5, 9, 13)>, <10, (5, 10, 13)>, <13, (3, 7, 10)>, <13, (3, 10, 12)>, <15, (8, 12, 18)>
