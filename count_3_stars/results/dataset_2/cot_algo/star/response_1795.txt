Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 9, 3, 4, 8, 2, 6
- Node 1: 9, 3, 2
- Node 2: 1, 3, 0
- Node 3: 5, 9, 1, 0, 2
- Node 4: 5, 8, 0, 6
- Node 5: 9, 4, 3, 7
- Node 6: 4, 8, 0, 7
- Node 7: 5, 8, 6
- Node 8: 4, 0, 6, 7
- Node 9: 5, 3, 1, 0

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: 6C3 = 20
- Node 3: 5C3 = 10
- Node 4: 4C3 = 4
- Node 5: 4C3 = 4
- Node 6: 4C3 = 4
- Node 8: 4C3 = 4
- Node 9: 4C3 = 4

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<3, 1, 9>
<3, 2, 0>
<3, 2, 1>
<3, 2, 5>
<4, 0, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 4, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<8, 6, 7>
<9, 3, 5>
