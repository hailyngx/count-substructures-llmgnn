Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 18) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 8) (0, 4) (0, 18) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 10) (1, 17) (1, 7) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (17, 7) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 8) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 12) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 18) (8, 14) (8, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 2) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 10) (7, 1) (7, 17) (2, 10) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 18}
- Node 1: {7, 17}
- Node 2: {10}
- Node 3: {9, 15, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 13, 10}
- Node 5: {11, 16, 8}
- Node 6: {9, 17, 12, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 17}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 18, 14, 5}
- Node 9: {3, 16, 6, 8}
- Node 10: {4, 14, 2, 19}
- Node 11: {5}
- Node 12: {3, 6, 13}
- Node 13: {4, 16, 17, 12}
- Node 14: {8, 10, 19}
- Node 15: {3, 18}
- Node 16: {13, 9, 5}
- Node 17: {1, 6, 13, 19, 7}
- Node 18: {15, 0, 8}
- Node 19: {14, 17, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars formed
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars formed
- Node 13: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars formed
- Node 17: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars formed

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 28

Therefore, the final answer is [28], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<8, (6, 9, 18)>
<8, (6, 9, 14)>

<9, (3, 6, 12)>

<17, (10, 14, 2)>
<17, (10, 14, 19)>
<17, (14, 2, 19)>
<17, (14, 2, 7)>
