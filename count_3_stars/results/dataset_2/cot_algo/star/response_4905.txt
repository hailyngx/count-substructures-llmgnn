Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 6) (2, 18) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 5) (12, 5) (12, 9) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 17) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 17) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 5) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 4) (1, 11) (1, 5) (19, 11) (19, 14) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 12) (9, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 14) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 1) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 6) (4, 15) (15, 4) (15, 14) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 15) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 11}
- Node 1: {5, 11}
- Node 2: {16, 18}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 13, 17}
- Node 4: {6, 10, 15, 17}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 12, 18}
- Node 6: {4, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {3, 14, 17}
- Node 8: {13, 16, 17}
- Node 9: {12, 17}
- Node 10: {4, 11}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 4, 6, 10, 19}
- Node 12: {5, 9}
- Node 13: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 14: {7, 15, 16, 19}
- Node 15: {4, 14}
- Node 16: {2, 8, 14}
- Node 17: {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 18: {2, 5}
- Node 19: {11, 14}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 50.

Therefore, the final answer, in brackets, is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 5, 11)>, 
<3, (0, 6, 8)>, 
<4, (6, 10, 15)>, 
<5, (0, 1, 12)>,
<7, (3, 14, 17)>, 
<8, (13, 16, 17)>, 
<11, (0, 1, 4)>, 
<13, (3, 6, 8)>, 
<14, (7, 15, 16)>, 
<16, (2, 8, 14)>, 
<17, (3, 4, 9)>.
