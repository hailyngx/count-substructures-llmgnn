Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 8) (14, 17) (14, 2) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 4) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 2) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 17) (12, 7) (12, 5) (8, 3) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 0) (0, 6) (0, 19) (0, 15) (0, 18) (16, 17) (16, 7) (16, 19) (15, 0) (15, 13) (18, 0) (18, 5) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 4) (11, 2) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 15) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 5) (2, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {6, 19, 15, 18}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {10, 11, 14}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 8, 10}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 5, 6, 17}
- Node 5: neighbors {4, 12, 14, 18}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 4, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 12, 16}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 19}
- Node 9: neighbors {6, 13}
- Node 10: neighbors {2, 3, 17}
- Node 11: neighbors {2}
- Node 12: neighbors {5, 7, 17}
- Node 13: neighbors {9, 15, 19}
- Node 14: neighbors {2, 5, 17}
- Node 15: neighbors {0, 13}
- Node 16: neighbors {7, 17, 19}
- Node 17: neighbors {4, 10, 12, 14, 16}
- Node 18: neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 19: neighbors {0, 8, 13, 16}

Now, let's check nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 4: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 17: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 19: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the final answer is [23].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph: 
<4, (1, 5, 17)>, <5, (4, 12, 14)>, <12, (5, 7, 17)>, <17, (4, 10, 12)>, <17, (4, 10, 14)>, 
<17, (4, 12, 14)>, <17, (5, 10, 14)>, <17, (5, 12, 14)>, <17, (10, 12, 14)>, <19, (8, 13, 16)>.
