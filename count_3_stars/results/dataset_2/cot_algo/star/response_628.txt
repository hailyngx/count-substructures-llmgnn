Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {4, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {4, 6, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total 3-stars = 1. 
    - <0, 4, 8>
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars = 11.
    - <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <0, 1, 9>
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars = 31.
    - <4, 7, 6>, <4, 2, 7>, <4, 0, 7>, <4, 3, 7>, <4, 1, 2>, <4, 1, 3>, <4, 1, 6>, <4, 0, 2>, <4, 0, 3>, <4, 0, 6>, <4, 0, 1>, <4, 2, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 3, 1>, <4, 3, 5>, <4, 6, 1>, <4, 7, 5>, <4, 1, 7>, <4, 3, 1>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total 3-stars = 32.
    - <5, 7, 9>
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars = 42.
    - <6, 7, 8>, <6, 0, 7>, <6, 0, 8>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 1, 8>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 4, 8>, <7, 4, 5>, <7, 6, 5>, <6, 1, 4>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total 3-stars = 43.
    - <8, 0, 9>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total 3-stars = 44.
    - <9, 1, 5>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44], and the unique 3-stars are <0, 4, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <0, 1, 9>, <4, 7, 6>, <4, 2, 7>, <4, 0, 7>, <4, 3, 7>, <4, 1, 2>, <4, 1, 3>, <4, 1, 6>, <4, 0, 2>, <4, 0, 3>, <4, 0, 6>, <4, 0, 1>, <4, 2, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 3, 1>, <4, 3, 5>, <4, 6, 1>, <4, 7, 5>, <4, 1, 7>, <4, 3, 1>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 0, 7>, <6, 0, 8>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 1, 8>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 4, 8>, <7, 4, 5>, <7, 6, 5>, <6, 1, 4>, <8, 0, 9>, <9, 1, 5>.
