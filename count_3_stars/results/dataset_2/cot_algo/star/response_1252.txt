Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 1: 4 neighbors, so can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 9>
- Node 4: 5 neighbors, so can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - <4, 2, 5>, <4, 2, 7>, <4, 2, 8>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 3, 7>, <4, 3, 5>, <4, 7, 3>, <4, 2, 8>

Counting the total number of 3-stars we found, we have 4 + 10 = 14. So, the final answer is [14].
