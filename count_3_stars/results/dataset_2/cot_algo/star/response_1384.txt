Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 8, 5, 1}
- Node 1: Neighbors {8, 2, 0}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 8, 5, 1}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 7, 6, 9, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8, 9, 5, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 2, 0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 7, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 6, 3, 0}

Now let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms in \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 7 neighbors, so it forms in \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from node 4) + 35 (from node 8) = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [45].

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 8, 3)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 3)>
<8, (4, 9, 3)>
<8, (7, 2, 3)>
<8, (7, 3, 9)>
<8, (7, 3, 6)>
<8, (7, 3, 4)>
<8, (9, 3, 4)>
<8, (4, 3, 9)>
<8, (4, 3, 6)>
<8, (4, 3, 7)>
