Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 11) (27, 17) (27, 13) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 20) (2, 22) (2, 17) (2, 0) (29, 0) (29, 24) (20, 7) (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 5) (25, 20) (8, 13) (8, 21) (8, 6) (13, 15) (13, 27) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 18) (18, 4) (18, 13) (18, 11) (18, 12) (22, 2) (22, 10) (1, 26) (1, 16) (1, 9) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 11) (21, 4) (21, 8) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 14) (28, 21) (28, 23) (24, 29) (24, 11) (6, 8) (6, 21) (3, 16) (17, 27) (17, 4) (17, 2) (23, 26) (23, 28) (11, 27) (11, 18) (11, 26) (11, 24) (19, 15) (19, 16) (19, 0) (19, 12) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 19) (16, 14) (9, 1) (9, 10) (5, 20) (5, 10) (0, 2) (0, 29) (0, 19) (10, 22) (10, 9) (10, 5) (12, 18) (12, 19) (12, 14) (14, 20) (14, 13) (14, 21) (14, 16) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, we will find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 19, 29}
- Node 1: {9, 16, 26}
- Node 2: {0, 17, 22}
- Node 3: {16}
- Node 4: {7, 17, 18, 21}
- Node 5: {10, 20}
- Node 6: {8, 21}
- Node 7: {4, 20}
- Node 8: {6, 13, 21}
- Node 9: {1, 10}
- Node 10: {5, 9, 22}
- Node 11: {18, 24, 26, 27}
- Node 12: {14, 18, 19}
- Node 13: {8, 14, 15, 18, 27}
- Node 14: {12, 13, 16, 20, 21}
- Node 15: {13, 19, 27}
- Node 16: {1, 14, 19, 26, 3}
- Node 17: {2, 4, 27}
- Node 18: {4, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 19: {0, 12, 15, 16}
- Node 20: {5, 7, 14, 21, 25}
- Node 21: {4, 6, 14, 20, 28}
- Node 22: {2, 10}
- Node 23: {26, 28}
- Node 24: {11, 29}
- Node 25: {20}
- Node 26: {1, 11, 16, 23}
- Node 27: {11, 13, 15, 17}
- Node 28: {21, 23}
- Node 29: {0, 24}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0, 1 3-star
- Node 2, 1 3-star
- Node 4, 1 3-star
- Node 18, 1 3-star
- Node 21, 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 5

Therefore, the final answer is [5].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (2, 19, 29)>
- <2, (0, 17, 22)>
- <4, (7, 17, 18)>
- <18, (4, 12, 13)>
- <21, (4, 14, 20)>
