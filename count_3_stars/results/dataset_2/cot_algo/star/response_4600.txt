Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 4, 5, and 8 have 6 neighbors each.

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars formed in the graph: 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the final answer is [60], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 4, 5>
- <0, 1, 4, 8>
- <0, 1, 5, 8>
- <0, 4, 5, 6>
- <0, 4, 5, 7>
- <0, 4, 5, 8>
- <0, 4, 7, 8>
- <0, 5, 9, 2>
- <0, 5, 9, 3>
- <4, 7, 3, 5>
- <4, 8, 1, 9>
- <4, 8, 1, 0>
- <4, 8, 6, 0>
- <5, 2, 3, 7>
- <5, 2, 9, 1>
- <5, 2, 9, 8>
- <5, 3, 7, 0>
- <5, 9, 2, 3>
- <5, 9, 1, 8>
- <5, 9, 1, 0>
- <5, 9, 8, 1>
- <5, 9, 8, 0>
- <0, 4, 6, 8>
- <0, 6, 8, 4>
- <4, 6, 8, 0>
