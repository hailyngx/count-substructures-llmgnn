Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 9, 6}
- Node 1: {5, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 3}
- Node 3: {9, 7, 2}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 1, 0}
- Node 6: {5, 4, 7, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 6}
- Node 9: {5, 2, 3, 7, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 0: <5, (1, 6, 0)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 8: <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 2: <9, (3, 7, 2)>

There are a total of 3 unique 3-stars, so the final answer is [3].
