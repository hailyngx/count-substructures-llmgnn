Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 9) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 2) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 14) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 9) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 3) (9, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors based on the given edges are as follows:

- Node 0: {10, 5, 6, 4}
- Node 1: {8, 10, 2}
- Node 2: {10, 11, 7, 1, 4}
- Node 3: {8, 5, 14, 9}
- Node 4: {13, 10, 0, 2, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {11, 12, 0}
- Node 7: {8, 5, 12, 9, 2}
- Node 8: {13, 7, 12, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {13, 7, 12, 3, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 12, 1, 4, 2}
- Node 11: {6, 2}
- Node 12: {8, 10, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 13: {8, 4, 9, 7}
- Node 14: {4, 3, 9}

Calculation for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 74

Therefore, the final answer is [74], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 10, 5, 6>, <2, 4, 10, 1>, <2, 4, 10, 7>, <2, 10, 7, 1>, 
<2, 10, 4, 7>, <7, 9, 12, 3>, <7, 9, 12, 13>, <8, 7, 12, 13>, 
<8, 9, 12, 13>, <8, 10, 12, 13>, <8, 12, 13, 3>, <8, 9, 13, 3>, 
<8, 10, 13, 3>, <9, 12, 13, 3>, <0, 4, 5, 3>, <0, 4, 5, 14>, 
<0, 4, 14, 3>, <4, 9, 13, 14>
