Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 24) (22, 1) (18, 22) (18, 24) (18, 29) (12, 10) (12, 21) (27, 28) (27, 26) (27, 19) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 14) (24, 22) (24, 18) (24, 1) (24, 25) (26, 27) (26, 21) (26, 3) (7, 25) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (25, 24) (25, 7) (25, 11) (11, 25) (11, 23) (11, 8) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 14) (23, 0) (8, 11) (8, 19) (19, 27) (19, 8) (3, 26) (3, 0) (3, 4) (28, 27) (28, 1) (0, 23) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 23) (5, 0) (5, 4) (16, 2) (16, 29) (16, 10) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 21) (4, 29) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 10) (15, 6) (15, 21) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 10) (10, 12) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 1) (29, 18) (29, 16) (29, 4) (1, 22) (1, 24) (1, 7) (1, 28) (1, 10) (14, 2) (14, 23) (14, 20) (20, 14) (21, 12) (21, 26) (21, 4) (21, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 23}
- Node 1: {7, 10, 22, 24, 28}
- Node 2: {6, 14, 16}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 26}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 9, 21, 29}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 7, 23}
- Node 6: {2, 10, 15}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 9, 25}
- Node 8: {11, 19}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 10}
- Node 10: {1, 6, 9, 12, 16}
- Node 11: {8, 23, 25}
- Node 12: {10, 21}
- Node 13: {22}
- Node 14: {2, 20, 23}
- Node 15: {6, 21}
- Node 16: {2, 10, 29}
- Node 18: {22, 24, 29}
- Node 19: {8, 27}
- Node 20: {14}
- Node 21: {4, 12, 15, 26}
- Node 22: {1, 13, 18, 24}
- Node 23: {5, 11, 14}
- Node 24: {1, 18, 22, 25}
- Node 25: {7, 11, 24}
- Node 26: {3, 21, 27}
- Node 27: {19, 26, 28}
- Node 28: {1, 27}
- Node 29: {4, 16, 18}

Now, we can see that the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 14, 16, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 29. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 50 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-star configurations found in the graph are:
- <1, (7, 10, 28)>
- <4, (3, 5, 21)>
- <5, (0, 4, 23)>
- <9, (4, 7, 10)>
- <10, (1, 6, 16)>
- <14, (2, 20, 23)>
- <16, (2, 10, 29)>
- <18, (22, 24, 29)>
- <21, (4, 12, 26)>
- <22, (1, 18, 24)>
- <23, (5, 11, 14)>
- <24, (1, 18, 25)>
- <29, (4, 16, 18)>
