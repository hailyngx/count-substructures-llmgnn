Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 14) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 13) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 14}
- Node 1: {7, 6, 12, 8}
- Node 2: {7, 11, 8, 14, 12}
- Node 3: {4, 14}
- Node 4: {9, 13, 5, 6, 3}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 10}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 1, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 13, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 9, 0, 12}
- Node 9: {4, 10, 11, 8, 14}
- Node 10: {9, 5, 14}
- Node 11: {14, 9, 13, 2}
- Node 12: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 13: {4, 7, 11, 6}
- Node 14: {3, 10, 11, 2, 0, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors, which could potentially form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 64

Therefore, there are 64 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 8, 12)>, <1, (6, 8, 2)>, <1, (6, 12, 2)>, <1, (8, 12, 2)>, <2, (7, 11, 14)>, <2, (8, 11, 14)>, <2, (7, 9, 14)>, <2, (8, 9, 14)>, <2, (7, 9, 11)>, <2, (8, 9, 11)>, <4, (9, 13, 6)>, <4, (9, 13, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 13, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 13)>, <4, (5, 7, 13)>, <4, (6, 7, 13)>, <4, (3, 13, 14)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [64].
