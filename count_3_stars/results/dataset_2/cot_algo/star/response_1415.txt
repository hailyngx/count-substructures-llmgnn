Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 1) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 14) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 14) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 1) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 0) 

Response:
As we are looking for 3-star structures in this graph, let's first identify the nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: neighbors = {10, 6, 9, 4}
- Node 1: neighbors = {8, 13, 2, 7, 14}
- Node 2: neighbors = {8, 10, 1}
- Node 3: neighbors = {6, 7, 14}
- Node 4: neighbors = {13, 11, 5, 0}
- Node 5: neighbors = {13, 6, 4}
- Node 6: neighbors = {5, 14, 3, 12, 0}
- Node 7: neighbors = {10, 3, 14, 1}
- Node 8: neighbors = {13, 2, 10, 1}
- Node 9: neighbors = {10, 11, 0, 12}
- Node 10: neighbors = {8, 11, 0, 7, 9}
- Node 11: neighbors = {10, 9, 4}
- Node 12: neighbors = {6, 9}
- Node 13: neighbors = {8, 5, 4, 1, 14}
- Node 14: neighbors = {13, 6, 3, 7, 1}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0, Node 4, and Node 10 form a 3-star: <0, 4, 10>
- Node 1, Node 7, and Node 14 form a 3-star: <1, 7, 14>
- Node 1, Node 8, and Node 13 form a 3-star: <1, 8, 13>
- Node 4, Node 11, and Node 13 form a 3-star: <4, 11, 13>
- Node 6, Node 12, and Node 9 form a 3-star: <6, 12, 9>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
