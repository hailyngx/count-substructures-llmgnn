Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 22) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 25) (27, 28) (27, 7) (27, 23) (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 25) (13, 29) (13, 14) (22, 26) (22, 13) (22, 28) (7, 9) (7, 27) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 24) (21, 7) (21, 1) (21, 17) (10, 24) (11, 19) (11, 17) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 16) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 6) (23, 27) (23, 8) (23, 5) (23, 17) (5, 23) (5, 3) (28, 27) (28, 22) (28, 16) (28, 19) (29, 13) (29, 20) (29, 0) (1, 21) (17, 21) (17, 11) (17, 23) (17, 24) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 29) (16, 18) (16, 28) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 2) (20, 29) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 28) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 13) (12, 16) (12, 19) (12, 3) (24, 7) (24, 10) (24, 8) (24, 17) (25, 15) (25, 13) (3, 5) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 12) (3, 6) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 16) (2, 6) (14, 13) 

Response:
The graph has a total of 30 nodes and 90 edges. Given the edges provided, the nodes and their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: Neighbors {15, 7, 29}
- Node 1: Neighbors {21}
- Node 2: Neighbors {16, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 16, 19, 12, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {23, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {8, 3, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9, 27, 21, 24, 0}
- Node 8: Neighbors {23, 24, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {26, 18, 7}
- Node 10: Neighbor {24}
- Node 11: Neighbors {19, 17}
- Node 12: Neighbors {13, 16, 19, 3}
- Node 13: Neighbors {22, 12, 25, 29, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbor {13}
- Node 15: Neighbors {0, 18, 25}
- Node 16: Neighbors {18, 28, 19, 12, 3, 2}
- Node 17: Neighbors {21, 11, 23, 24}
- Node 18: Neighbors {9, 15, 19, 16}
- Node 19: Neighbors {11, 18, 28, 3, 12}
- Node 20: Neighbor {29}
- Node 21: Neighbors {7, 1, 17}
- Node 22: Neighbors {26, 13, 28}
- Node 23: Neighbors {27, 8, 5, 17}
- Node 24: Neighbors {7, 10, 8, 17}
- Node 25: Neighbors {15, 13}
- Node 26: Neighbors {9, 22}
- Node 27: Neighbors {28, 7, 23}
- Node 28: Neighbors {27, 22, 16, 19}
- Node 29: Neighbors {13, 20, 0}

Now, we will identify the 3-star structures formed in the graph:

- Node 3, with neighbors {5, 16, 19, 12, 6}, forms the 3-stars: <3, (5, 16, 19)>, <3, (5, 16, 12)>, and <3, (19, 12, 16)>.

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [3].
