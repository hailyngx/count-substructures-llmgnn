Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in a more structured way:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 9.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, 7.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 8.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, 9.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, 9.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 9.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 9.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 7, 8.

Now, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Neighbors of Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7.
Neighbors of Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 9.
Neighbors of Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7.
Neighbors of Node 3: 0, 5.
Neighbors of Node 4: 1, 2, 8.
Neighbors of Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 9.
Neighbors of Node 6: 0, 2, 7, 9.
Neighbors of Node 7: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9.
Neighbors of Node 8: 4, 9.
Neighbors of Node 9: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8.

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with Node 0 as the center.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed with Node 1.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 2 as the center.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed with Node 3.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed with Node 4.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed with Node 5.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed with Node 6.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 7 as the center.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed with Node 8.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 9 as the center.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 \). 

So, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, and <7, (5, 6, 9)>.
