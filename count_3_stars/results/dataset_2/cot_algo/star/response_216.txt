Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 8) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 19) (18, 2) (18, 0) (7, 19) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 16) (15, 10) (15, 14) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 19) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 9) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 17) (6, 3) (6, 8) (14, 15) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 17) (4, 3) (4, 16) (4, 19) (13, 3) (13, 7) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 9, 10, 18}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 18, 19}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 6, 13}
- Node 4: {3, 16, 19}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 17}
- Node 6: {3, 8}
- Node 7: {13, 19}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 9: {0, 8, 16, 17, 19}
- Node 10: {0, 11, 12, 15}
- Node 11: {8, 10}
- Node 12: {10, 16}
- Node 13: {3, 7}
- Node 14: {15}
- Node 15: {10, 14}
- Node 16: {4, 9, 12}
- Node 17: {5, 9, 19}
- Node 18: {0, 2}
- Node 19: {2, 4, 7, 9, 17}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 16: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 19: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 43

Hence, the final answer is [43].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 9, 18)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 8, 16)>
- <10, (0, 11, 12)>
- <16, (4, 9, 12)>
- <19, (2, 4, 7)>
