Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 14) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 9, 11}
- Node 1: {3, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {6, 9, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 8, 12}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {4, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 11}
- Node 7: {8, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {3, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {5, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 13: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors that can form a 3-star:
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 64

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [64]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <7, (8, 10, 14)>
- <9, (10, 14, 2)>
- <10, (9, 14, 2)>
- <11, (5, 7, 8)>
- <14, (7, 8, 10)>
