Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 19) (9, 18) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 15) (2, 3) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 15) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 19) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (7, 1) (19, 6) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 17) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 17) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 1) (17, 8) (17, 19) (17, 15) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the set of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {12, 14}
- Node 1: {7, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {2, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {11, 15}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 15, 19}
- Node 6: {5, 14, 19}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {5, 11, 12, 13, 17}
- Node 9: {18}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 12}
- Node 11: {3, 4, 8, 16}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 10, 18}
- Node 13: {8, 15}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 6, 18, 19}
- Node 15: {5, 13, 4, 17}
- Node 16: {11}
- Node 17: {8, 15, 19}
- Node 18: {9, 12, 14}
- Node 19: {5, 6, 14, 17}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph based on the neighbor sets:

- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 10, 11}
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 8, 19}
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {11, 12, 17}
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 10, 18}
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 18, 19}
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 13, 17}

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of 6. 
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
