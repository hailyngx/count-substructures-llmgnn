Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 2}
- Node 1: {5, 4, 3, 6, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 1, 8, 6, 0}
- Node 3: {7, 1, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 0, 1}
- Node 5: {2, 1, 4}
- Node 6: {7, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 3, 6, 8, 2}
- Node 8: {7, 3, 2, 6}
- Node 9: {7, 0}

Now, we identify nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 8 have 3 or more neighbors.

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 2: [inom{6}{3}] = [20]
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 7: [inom{6}{3}] = [20]
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [59], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (9, 4, 2)>, <1, (5, 4, 3, 6, 2)>, <2, (5, 7, 1, 8, 6, 0)>, <4, (5, 7, 0, 1)>, <7, (9, 4, 3, 6, 8, 2)>, and <8, (7, 3, 2, 6)>.
