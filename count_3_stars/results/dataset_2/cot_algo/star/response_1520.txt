Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 8) (27, 4) (27, 24) (4, 27) (4, 5) (4, 29) (4, 6) (7, 15) (7, 6) (1, 26) (1, 25) (1, 16) (1, 5) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 18) (26, 20) (26, 17) (19, 26) (19, 9) (11, 23) (11, 17) (11, 2) (28, 8) (28, 13) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 13) (13, 28) (13, 5) (13, 29) (18, 26) (18, 29) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 7) (21, 3) (21, 25) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 20) (3, 23) (10, 22) (10, 16) (23, 11) (23, 3) (23, 14) (23, 12) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 20) (2, 24) (2, 17) (12, 23) (12, 2) (12, 29) (22, 10) (8, 15) (8, 28) (8, 14) (0, 3) (0, 24) (9, 19) (9, 25) (9, 20) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 9) (20, 26) (20, 3) (20, 2) (20, 9) (20, 16) (14, 23) (14, 8) (24, 27) (24, 2) (24, 0) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 20) (17, 26) (17, 11) (17, 2) (29, 4) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we can find the number of 3-stars formed using the provided edge information.

Let's first determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 16, 25, 26}
- Node 2: Neighbors {11, 12, 17, 20, 24}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 20, 21, 23}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 6, 27, 29}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 7, 15}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 15}
- Node 8: Neighbors {14, 15, 28}
- Node 9: Neighbors {19, 20, 25}
- Node 10: Neighbors {16, 22}
- Node 11: Neighbors {2, 17, 23}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 23, 29}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 28, 29}
- Node 14: Neighbors {8, 23}
- Node 15: Neighbors {6, 7, 8}
- Node 16: Neighbors {1, 10, 20}
- Node 17: Neighbors {2, 11, 26}
- Node 18: Neighbors {26, 29}
- Node 19: Neighbors {9, 26}
- Node 20: Neighbors {2, 3, 9, 16, 26}
- Node 21: Neighbors {3, 25}
- Node 22: Neighbors {10}
- Node 23: Neighbors {3, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 24: Neighbors {0, 2, 27}
- Node 25: Neighbors {1, 9, 21}
- Node 26: Neighbors {1, 17, 18, 19, 20}
- Node 27: Neighbors {4, 24}
- Node 28: Neighbors {8, 13}
- Node 29: Neighbors {4, 12, 13, 18}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, 2 3-star(s): <1, (5, 16, 25)>
- Node 2, 2 3-star(s): <2, (11, 17, 26)>, <2, (11, 17, 24)>
- Node 3, 1 3-star(s): <3, (0, 20, 21)>
- Node 4, 0 3-star(s)
- Node 5, 1 3-star(s): <5, (1, 4, 13)>
- Node 6, 1 3-star(s): <6, (4, 7, 15)>
- Node 8, 0 3-star(s)
- Node 9, 1 3-star(s): <9, (19, 20, 25)>
- Node 11, 0 3-star(s)
- Node 12, 0 3-star(s)
- Node 13, 0 3-star(s)
- Node 14, 0 3-star(s)
- Node 15, 1 3-star(s): <15, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 16, 1 3-star(s): <16, (1, 10, 20)>
- Node 17, 0 3-star(s)
- Node 18, 1 3-star(s): <18, (26, 29, 18)>
- Node 19, 0 3-star(s)
- Node 20, 2 3-star(s): <20, (2, 16, 26)>, <20, (9, 16, 20)>
- Node 21, 0 3-star(s)
- Node 23, 0 3-star(s)
- Node 24, 0 3-star(s)
- Node 25, 0 3-star(s)
- Node 26, 1 3-star(s): <26, (17, 18, 26)>
- Node 27, 0 3-star(s)
- Node 28, 0 3-star(s)
- Node 29, 0 3-star(s)

Total number of 3-stars: [11]
