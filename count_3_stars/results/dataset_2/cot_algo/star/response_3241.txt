Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 1) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 3) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 8) (10, 5) (10, 4) 

Response:
In this case, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {1, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 1 neighbors: {0, 2, 6, 11}
- Node 2 neighbors: {1, 3, 9, 13}
- Node 3 neighbors: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4 neighbors: {3, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 5 neighbors: {7, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 6 neighbors: {1, 3, 8, 12}
- Node 7 neighbors: {0, 3, 5, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 8 neighbors: {6, 13, 14}
- Node 9 neighbors: {2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 10 neighbors: {4, 5}
- Node 11 neighbors: {0, 1, 13}
- Node 12 neighbors: {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 13 neighbors: {2, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 14 neighbors: {5, 8, 9}

Now we can count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 20 = 40 \), so we put this number inside brackets []: [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
  
<7, (3, 9, 13)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 9, 14)>
<7, (5, 9, 14)>
<7, (5, 9, 10)>
<9, (2, 5, 14)>
<9, (2, 5, 10)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 7, 13)>
<9, (4, 5, 10)>
