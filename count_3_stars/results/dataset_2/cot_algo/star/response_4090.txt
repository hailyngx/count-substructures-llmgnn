Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 8) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 5) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0 has neighbors: {3, 4, 6, 13}
- Node 1 has neighbors: {3, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 2 has neighbors: {5, 13, 14}
- Node 3 has neighbors: {0, 1, 11}
- Node 4 has neighbors: {0, 6, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 5 has neighbors: {1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 6 has neighbors: {0, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 7 has neighbors: {5, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 8 has neighbors: {5, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 9 has neighbors: {4, 6, 12}
- Node 10 has neighbors: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 11 has neighbors: {3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 12 has neighbors: {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 13 has neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 14 has neighbors: {2, 4, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Total number of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 13)>
<5, (7, 8, 12)>
