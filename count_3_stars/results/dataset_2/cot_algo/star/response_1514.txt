Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 3, 13, 7, 10}
- Node 1: {6, 3, 5, 4, 12}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 0, 2, 5}
- Node 4: {9, 1, 13}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 11, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 14}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 13, 11}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 4, 14, 0}
- Node 10: {0, 12, 5}
- Node 11: {6, 8, 13}
- Node 12: {1, 13, 2, 10}
- Node 13: {9, 8, 4, 11, 0, 12}
- Node 14: {9, 7, 5}

We can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will count the number of 3-stars that can be formed with these nodes.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars  

Total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 72, so [72].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 3, 13>, <0, 5, 10>, <0, 5, 14>, <0, 9, 13>, <0, 9, 14>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 12>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 9, 4>, <1, 9, 14>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 10>, <5, 7, 14>, <6, 8, 11>, <8, 9, 13>.
