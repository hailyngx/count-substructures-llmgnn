Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 6}

Next, we find nodes with three or more neighbors since only they can form 3-stars. These nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9.

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>
