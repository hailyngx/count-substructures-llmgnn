Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 9, 11}
- Node 6: {3, 8, 10}
- Node 7: {10, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 8, 10}
- Node 10: {4, 6, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 10, 11}
- Node 14: {2, 7, 12}

Now, let's identify the 3-star structures:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding them all up:  
\( 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 64 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 13)>
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>
- <10, (4, 6, 7)>
- <11, (5, 7, 13)>
- <12, (2, 3, 11)>
- <13, (0, 4, 10)>
