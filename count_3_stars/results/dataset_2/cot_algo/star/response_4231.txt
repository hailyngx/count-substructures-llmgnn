Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 16) (3, 13) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 15) (17, 0) (17, 18) (10, 15) (10, 14) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 12) (13, 3) (13, 11) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 11) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 14) (18, 5) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 0) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 19) (14, 11) (12, 15) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 18) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we can first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 9, 17, 18}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 11}
- Node 3: Neighbors {13, 16}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 11, 16}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 18}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 6, 15}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 11, 16, 19}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 14}
- Node 10: Neighbors {14, 15}
- Node 11: Neighbors {2, 4, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {15, 16}
- Node 13: Neighbors {3, 11}
- Node 14: Neighbors {9, 10, 11, 19}
- Node 15: Neighbors {7, 10, 12}
- Node 16: Neighbors {3, 4, 8, 12}
- Node 17: Neighbors {0, 18}
- Node 18: Neighbors {5, 17, 19, 0}
- Node 19: Neighbors {8, 14, 18}

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, 18, and 19 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 9, 11, and 14 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 8 and 16 have 4 neighbors each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 33 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, 18, 19>, <9, 11, 14>, <8, 16, 19>, <5, 9, 18>, <6, 7, 15>, <4, 7, 16>, <11, 14, 19>, <0, 1, 17>, <8, 11, 16>, <0, 17, 18>, <9, 14, 19>
