Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 15) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 19) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 8) (2, 17) (2, 6) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 2) (18, 16) (7, 0) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (13, 17) (13, 0) (13, 15) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 3) (3, 10) (3, 4) (19, 9) (19, 11) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 13) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 4) 

Response:
Given that there are 20 nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of 3-stars in this graph.
First, let's determine the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (1, 7, 13)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (0, 6, 10)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (6, 12, 17, 18)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (4, 10)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (3, 12, 16)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (7, 8, 11)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (1, 2, 9, 12)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (0, 5)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (5, 10, 11)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (6, 9, 15, 19)
- Node 10: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 8, 11)
- Node 11: 4 neighbors (5, 8, 10, 19)
- Node 12: 4 neighbors (2, 4, 6, 16)
- Node 13: 3 neighbors (0, 17, 15)
- Node 15: 3 neighbors (9, 13, 17)
- Node 16: 3 neighbors (4, 9, 18)
- Node 17: 4 neighbors (2, 13, 14, 15)
- Node 18: 2 neighbors (2, 16)
- Node 19: 2 neighbors (9, 11)

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars formed using the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is:
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final answer, in brackets, is: [26]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (6, 12, 16)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <10, (1, 3, 8)>, <17, (13, 15, 17)>.
