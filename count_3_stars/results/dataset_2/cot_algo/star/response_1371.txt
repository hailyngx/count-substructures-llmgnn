Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 15) (22, 13) (22, 2) (22, 11) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 26) (15, 13) (15, 3) (15, 11) (8, 24) (8, 10) (8, 17) (23, 11) (23, 21) (23, 12) (0, 3) (0, 20) (0, 11) (20, 0) (20, 14) (20, 6) (7, 12) (7, 26) (7, 5) (12, 23) (12, 7) (12, 16) (6, 20) (6, 28) (28, 6) (28, 18) (28, 10) (19, 1) (19, 16) (26, 3) (26, 7) (26, 24) (24, 8) (24, 26) (24, 10) (24, 29) (4, 27) (4, 2) (27, 4) (27, 18) (27, 1) (16, 12) (16, 19) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 29) (9, 25) (29, 24) (29, 9) (29, 10) (11, 22) (11, 15) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 1) (2, 13) (2, 22) (2, 4) (2, 14) (18, 28) (18, 27) (18, 21) (25, 9) (25, 10) (14, 20) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 21) (1, 19) (1, 27) (1, 11) (21, 23) (21, 18) (21, 14) (21, 17) (17, 8) (17, 21) (10, 8) (10, 28) (10, 24) (10, 29) (10, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 neighbors: {3, 20, 11}
- Node 1 neighbors: {19, 27, 11}
- Node 2 neighbors: {13, 22, 4, 14}
- Node 3 neighbors: {15, 0, 26}
- Node 4 neighbors: {27, 2}
- Node 5 neighbors: {7, 14}
- Node 6 neighbors: {20, 28}
- Node 7 neighbors: {12, 26, 5}
- Node 8 neighbors: {24, 10, 17}
- Node 9 neighbors: {29, 25}
- Node 10 neighbors: {8, 28, 24, 29, 25}
- Node 11 neighbors: {22, 15, 23, 0, 1}
- Node 12 neighbors: {23, 7, 16}
- Node 13 neighbors: {22, 15, 2}
- Node 14 neighbors: {20, 5, 2, 21}
- Node 15 neighbors: {13, 3, 11}
- Node 16 neighbors: {12, 19}
- Node 17 neighbors: {8, 21}
- Node 18 neighbors: {28, 27, 21}
- Node 19 neighbors: {1, 16}
- Node 20 neighbors: {0, 6, 14}
- Node 21 neighbors: {23, 18, 14, 17}
- Node 22 neighbors: {13, 2, 11}
- Node 23 neighbors: {11, 21, 12}
- Node 24 neighbors: {8, 26, 10, 29}
- Node 25 neighbors: {9, 10}
- Node 26 neighbors: {3, 7, 24}
- Node 27 neighbors: {4, 18, 1}
- Node 28 neighbors: {6, 18, 10}
- Node 29 neighbors: {24, 10, 9}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 20: 1 3-star
- Node 21: 1 3-star
- Node 22: 1 3-star
- Node 24: 1 3-star
- Node 26: 1 3-star
- Node 28: 1 3-star
- Node 29: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 18, so the answer is [18].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 20, 11)>
<1, (19, 27, 11)>
<2, (13, 22, 4)>
<3, (15, 11, 0)>
<8, (24, 10, 17)>
<10, (25, 29, 24)>
<11, (1, 15, 22)>
<14, (21, 5, 20)>
<15, (13, 3, 11)>
<16, (19, 12, 16)>
<18, (28, 21, 27)>
<20, (6, 14, 5)>
<21, (17, 23, 18)>
<22, (13, 2, 11)>
<24, (26, 10, 29)>
<26, (7, 24, 3)>
<28, (18, 10, 27)>
<29, (10, 9, 24)>
