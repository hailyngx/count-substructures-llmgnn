Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 7, 8, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9
Node 2: 1, 4, 5
Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 7
Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
Node 6: 3, 4, 8
Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5
Node 8: 0, 6, 9
Node 9: 0, 1, 5, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, forming 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, forming 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, forming 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, not forming any 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
