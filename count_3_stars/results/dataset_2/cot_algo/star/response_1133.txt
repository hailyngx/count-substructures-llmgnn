Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 13, 5, 1}
- Node 1: {7, 10, 5, 0, 9, 12}
- Node 2: {7, 8, 6, 3}
- Node 3: {4, 2, 5}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 10, 14, 6, 3}
- Node 5: {11, 1, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 2}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 2, 9, 1}
- Node 8: {4, 10, 11, 13, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {7, 11, 1, 12}
- Node 10: {4, 11, 8, 1}
- Node 11: {10, 9, 5, 8}
- Node 12: {14, 9, 1}
- Node 13: {8, 0}
- Node 14: {4, 12}

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves {0, 5, 9}. (<1, (0, 5, 9)>)

Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves {3, 6, 14}. (<4, (3, 6, 14)>)

Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves {0, 11, 13}. (<8, (0, 11, 13)>)

Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves {1, 11, 12}. (<9, (1, 11, 12)>)

Summing up the total count of 3-stars gives [4].
