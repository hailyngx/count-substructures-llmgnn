Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 7) (21, 1) (21, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 29) (3, 26) (20, 1) (20, 15) (20, 26) (20, 19) (25, 17) (25, 18) (25, 24) (12, 21) (12, 27) (12, 17) (12, 0) (27, 12) (27, 11) (27, 9) (27, 13) (15, 20) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 2) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 4) (29, 3) (29, 28) (29, 7) (19, 20) (19, 18) (26, 3) (26, 20) (26, 18) (5, 22) (5, 28) (5, 7) (28, 29) (28, 5) (28, 13) (18, 25) (18, 19) (18, 26) (2, 15) (2, 13) (22, 5) (22, 11) (16, 23) (11, 27) (11, 22) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 4) (9, 27) (7, 1) (7, 29) (7, 5) (7, 10) (24, 25) (24, 0) (24, 10) (8, 15) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 24) (0, 8) (0, 13) (23, 16) (23, 4) (23, 10) (4, 17) (4, 14) (4, 23) (13, 27) (13, 15) (13, 28) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 7) (10, 24) (10, 23) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {12, 24, 8, 13}
- Node 1: {21, 3, 20, 7}
- Node 2: {15, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 14, 29, 26}
- Node 4: {17, 14, 23}
- Node 5: {22, 28, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 29, 5, 10}
- Node 8: {15, 14, 0}
- Node 9: {27}
- Node 10: {7, 24, 23}
- Node 11: {27, 22, 14}
- Node 12: {21, 27, 17, 0}
- Node 13: {27, 15, 28, 2, 0}
- Node 14: {3, 11, 8, 4}
- Node 15: {20, 8, 13, 2}
- Node 16: {23}
- Node 17: {25, 12, 4}
- Node 18: {25, 19, 26}
- Node 19: {20, 18}
- Node 20: {1, 15, 26, 19}
- Node 21: {1, 12}
- Node 22: {5, 11}
- Node 23: {16, 4, 10}
- Node 24: {25, 0, 10}
- Node 25: {17, 18, 24}
- Node 26: {3, 20, 18}
- Node 27: {12, 11, 9, 13}
- Node 28: {29, 5, 13}
- Node 29: {3, 28, 7}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 10: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 13: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 14: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 15: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 17: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 18: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 20: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 24: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 25: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 26: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 27: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 28: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 29: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from Node 4) + 2*1 (from Nodes 0, 8, 10, 17, 18, 25, 26, 29) + 4*4 (from Nodes 1, 3, 7, 14, 15, 20, and 28) + 2*10 (from Nodes 13 and 27) = 1 + 2 + 16 + 20 = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [39], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (17, 14, 23)>
<0, (12, 24, 8)>
<1, (3, 20, 7)>
<3, (1, 14, 29)>
<7, (1, 29, 5)>
<8, (15, 13, 2)>
<10, (7, 24, 23)>
<13, (27, 15, 28)>
<14, (3, 11, 8)>
<15, (20, 8, 13)>
<17, (25, 12, 4)>
<18, (25, 19, 26)>
<20, (1, 15, 26)>
<24, (25, 0, 10)>
<25, (17, 18, 24)>
<26, (3, 20, 18)>
<27, (12, 11, 9)>
<28, (29, 5, 13)>
