Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 11) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 16) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 18) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 11) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 0) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 6) (18, 7) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 0) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 19) (7, 5) (7, 18) (7, 1) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 0) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 4) (6, 18) (14, 18) (14, 16) (12, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 2) (16, 9) (16, 14) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:

Node 0: 2, 11, 19, 1
Node 1: 0, 12, 7
Node 2: 10, 18, 13, 0
Node 3: 11, 13, 8
Node 4: 9, 8, 13, 6
Node 5: 7
Node 6: 15, 17, 4, 18
Node 7: 5, 18, 1
Node 8: 4, 11, 15, 3
Node 9: 4, 16
Node 10: 2, 19
Node 11: 3, 15, 8, 0
Node 12: 1
Node 13: 2, 3, 4
Node 14: 18, 16
Node 15: 6, 8
Node 16: 9, 14
Node 17: 6, 18, 19
Node 18: 17, 2, 14, 6, 7
Node 19: 10, 17, 0

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors will form 3-stars. Let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 10 + 1 = 40

Thus, the final answer is [40]. Some unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 11, 19>, <0, 2, 11, 1>, <0, 2, 19, 1>, <0, 11, 19, 1>, <2, 3, 4, 13>, <2, 4, 13, 8>, <2, 13, 3, 8>, <4, 6, 13, 18>, <4, 6, 8, 18>, <4, 8, 11, 15>, <6, 15, 17, 18>, <7, 1, 12>, <17, 18, 19, 0>.
