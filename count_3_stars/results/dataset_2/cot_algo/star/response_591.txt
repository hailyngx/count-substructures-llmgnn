Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 2: 0, 6, 7
Node 3: 0, 4, 5
Node 4: 1, 3, 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8
Node 6: 2, 7, 9
Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6
Node 8: 4, 5, 9
Node 9: 1, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors, as these are the potential centers of 3-stars:

Node 0, Node 1, Node 7, Node 5, Node 4, Node 9

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: None (4 neighbors)
Node 1: None (5 neighbors)
Node 7: None (5 neighbors)
Node 5: None (5 neighbors)
Node 4: [1] (4 neighbors)
Node 9: None (4 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1]. The unique 3-star found is <4, (1, 8, 9)>.
