Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 8
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 4, 8, 9
Node 2 neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 9
Node 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9
Node 7 neighbors: 2, 3, 8
Node 8 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 7
Node 9 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Nodes forming 3-star: 5, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
Number of 3-stars for node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars for node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 = 8, so the final answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (6, 9, 3)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (4, 1, 2)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (6, 2, 4)>
