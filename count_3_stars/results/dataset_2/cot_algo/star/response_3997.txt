Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 28) (13, 7) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 11) (22, 28) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 5) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 15) (9, 26) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 0) (26, 17) (23, 22) (23, 20) (20, 23) (20, 0) (20, 24) (25, 16) (25, 15) (25, 14) (0, 26) (0, 20) (0, 12) (0, 5) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 24) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 27) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 14) (18, 5) (18, 4) (28, 13) (28, 22) (28, 21) (28, 6) (28, 7) (3, 21) (3, 29) (10, 16) (8, 29) (29, 1) (29, 3) (29, 8) (29, 15) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 28) (7, 11) (11, 13) (11, 22) (11, 7) (11, 27) (16, 9) (16, 25) (16, 10) (16, 17) (17, 26) (17, 16) (2, 13) (12, 0) (12, 24) (24, 20) (24, 5) (24, 12) (27, 6) (27, 11) (14, 25) (14, 4) (14, 15) (15, 21) (15, 25) (15, 29) (15, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors.

From the given edges, we can construct the following neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 1: {21, 29, 5}
- Node 2: {13}
- Node 3: {21, 29}
- Node 4: {9, 18, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 0, 6, 18, 24}
- Node 6: {28, 5, 27}
- Node 7: {13, 9, 28, 11}
- Node 8: {29}
- Node 9: {26, 4, 16, 7}
- Node 10: {16}
- Node 11: {13, 22, 7, 27}
- Node 12: {0, 24}
- Node 13: {22, 2, 11, 28, 7}
- Node 14: {25, 4, 15}
- Node 15: {21, 25, 29, 14}
- Node 16: {9, 25, 10, 17}
- Node 17: {26, 16}
- Node 18: {5, 4}
- Node 20: {23, 0, 24}
- Node 21: {1, 28, 3, 15}
- Node 22: {13, 23, 11, 28}
- Node 23: {22, 20}
- Node 24: {20, 0, 12}
- Node 25: {16, 15, 14}
- Node 26: {9, 0, 17}
- Node 27: {6, 11}
- Node 28: {22, 21, 13, 6, 7}
- Node 29: {1, 3, 8, 15}

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 16: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 21: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 22: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 28: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 29: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 21, 29>
<5, 1, 0>
<5, 1, 6>
<5, 1, 24>
<5, 0, 6>
<5, 0, 18>
<5, 0, 24>
<5, 6, 24>
<9, 26, 0>
<9, 26, 17>
<9, 4, 18>
<9, 4, 14>
<13, 22, 11>
<13, 22, 28>
<13, 11, 28>
<13, 7, 9>
<13, 7, 28>
