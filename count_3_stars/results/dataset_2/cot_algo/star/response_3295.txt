Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 9) (1, 3) (3, 17) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (8, 2) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 15) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 12) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (6, 18) (6, 19) (0, 16) (16, 18) (16, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 10) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 15) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 12) (9, 17) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 15) (15, 13) (15, 7) (15, 11) (15, 9) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 19) (19, 6) (19, 10) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {16}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {8, 18}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 7, 17}
- Node 4: {9, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {18, 19}
- Node 7: {3, 10, 11, 15}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {4, 12, 15, 17}
- Node 10: {4, 7, 14, 19}
- Node 11: {7, 13, 15}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 9, 18}
- Node 13: {11, 15, 17}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 10, 17}
- Node 15: {7, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 16: {0, 18}
- Node 17: {3, 13, 14, 9}
- Node 18: {2, 6, 12, 16}
- Node 19: {6, 10}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43].

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (9, 12, 14)>
<5, (3, 12, 14)>
<7, (3, 10, 15)>
<9, (4, 12, 15)>
<10, (4, 10, 14)>
<(12, 4, 9)>
<14, (4, 10, 17)>
<15, (7, 9, 11)>
<17, (9, 13, 14)>
<18, (12, 16, 18)>
