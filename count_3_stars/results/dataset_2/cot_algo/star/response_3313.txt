Response:
This graph forms multiple 3-stars. Let's find them:

Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 7, 12, 9, and 14. This forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (7, 12, 9)>, <4, (7, 12, 14)>, <4, (7, 9, 14)>, <4, (12, 9, 14)>.

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 6, 8, 12, and 10. This forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (6, 8, 12)>, <5, (6, 8, 10)>, <5, (6, 12, 10)>, <5, (8, 12, 10)>.

Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 5, 2, 8, and 13. This forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center: <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (5, 2, 13)>, <6, (5, 8, 13)>, <6, (2, 8, 13)>.

Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 8, 11, 14, and 12. This forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center: <3, (8, 11, 14)>, <3, (8, 11, 12)>, <3, (8, 14, 12)>, <3, (11, 14, 12)>.

Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 3, 14, 9, 13, and 12. This forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 11 as the center: <11, (3, 14, 9)>, <11, (3, 14, 13)>, <11, (3, 14, 12)>, <11, (3, 9, 13)>, <11, (3, 9, 12)>, <11, (3, 13, 12)>, <11, (14, 9, 13)>, <11, (14, 9, 12)>, <11, (14, 13, 12)>, <11, (9, 13, 12)>.

Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 4, 5, 3, 11, and 10. This forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 12 as the center: <12, (4, 5, 3)>, <12, (4, 5, 11)>, <12, (4, 5, 10)>, <12, (4, 3, 11)>, <12, (4, 3, 10)>, <12, (4, 11, 10)>, <12, (5, 3, 11)>, <12, (5, 3, 10)>, <12, (5, 11, 10)>, <12, (3, 11, 10)>.

Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 6, 2, 11, 1, and 10. This forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 13 as the center: <13, (6, 2, 11)>, <13, (6, 2, 1)>, <13, (6, 2, 10)>, <13, (6, 11, 1)>, <13, (6, 11, 10)>, <13, (6, 1, 10)>, <13, (2, 11, 1)>, <13, (2, 11, 10)>, <13, (2, 1, 10)>, <13, (11, 1, 10)>.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 1, 9, and 10. This forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center: <0, (2, 1, 9)>, <0, (2, 1, 10)>, <0, (2, 9, 10)>, <0, (1, 9, 10)>.

Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 5, 2, 12, and 13. This forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 10 as the center: <10, (5, 2, 12)>, <10, (5, 2, 13)>, <10, (5, 12, 13)>, <10, (2, 12, 13)>.

Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 4, 3, 11, and 1. This forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 14 as the center: <14, (4, 3, 11)>, <14, (4, 3, 1)>, <14, (4, 11, 1)>, <14, (3, 11, 1)>.

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 12, 13, 9, and 0. This forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center: <1, (12, 13, 9)>, <1, (12, 13, 0)>, <1, (12, 9, 0)>, <1, (13, 9, 0)>.

In total, there are \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 \) = 89 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [89].
