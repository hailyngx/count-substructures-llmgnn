Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 13) (7, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 5) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 3) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 2) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 14}
- Node 3: {6, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 9, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {8, 13}
- Node 8: {3, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {9, 11, 12}
- Node 11: {3, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 6, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 has inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 3 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 9 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 14 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is:
10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 83

Therefore, the final answer is [83], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 12)>, <0, (1, 5, 14)>, <0, (1, 6, 12)>, <0, (1, 6, 14)>, <0, (5, 6, 14)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 12, 6)>, <1, (0, 13, 6)>, <1, (5, 2, 14)>, <1, (4, 9, 14)>, <3, (6, 8, 13)>, <6, (0, 1, 12)>, <6, (0, 1, 14)>, <6, (1, 6, 14)>, <6, (3, 9, 13)>, <9, (4, 6, 14)>, <9, (6, 10, 13)>, <10, (9, 11, 13)>, <11, (3, 5, 13)>, <13, (1, 9, 11)>, <13, (3, 11, 7)>, <13, (9, 11, 7)>, <14, (0, 2, 5)>, <14, (0, 4, 5)>, <14, (2, 5, 14)>.
