Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (15, 10) (15, 14) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 14) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 1) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 0) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 1) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 1) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 11) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 17) (1, 12) (1, 19) (1, 13) (1, 7) (14, 15) (14, 16) (14, 4) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, we can start by building the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 11, 19}
- Node 1: {7, 12, 13, 19}
- Node 2: {9, 10}
- Node 3: {8, 16, 17}
- Node 4: {0, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 9, 18}
- Node 6: {5, 10}
- Node 7: {1, 9, 17}
- Node 8: {3, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 12, 15}
- Node 11: {0, 4, 12}
- Node 12: {1, 4, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 17, 18}
- Node 14: {4, 15, 16}
- Node 15: {10, 14}
- Node 16: {3, 14, 18}
- Node 17: {3, 7, 13}
- Node 18: {5, 13, 16}
- Node 19: {0, 1}

Next, we identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 1, and Node 4 have 4 neighbors each, so each can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3, Node 9, Node 10, and Node 12 have 4 neighbors each, so each can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 and Node 18 have 3 neighbors each, so each can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 18 \), which can be written as [18]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 

<0, (4, 11, 19)>, <1, (7, 13, 19)>, <1, (7, 12, 13)>, <1, (12, 13, 19)>, 
<4, (11, 12, 14)>, <4, (0, 11, 19)>, <4, (0, 11, 12)>, <4, (0, 12, 19)>, 
<3, (8, 17, 1)>, <3, (8, 16, 17)>, <3, (16, 17, 1)>, <3, (8, 16, 1)>, 
<9, (8, 7, 2)>, <9, (8, 7, 5)>, <9, (8, 2, 5)>, <9, (7, 2, 5)>, 
<10, (12, 15, 2)>, <10, (12, 15, 6)>, <14, (16, 15, 3)>, <18, (5, 13, 16)>
