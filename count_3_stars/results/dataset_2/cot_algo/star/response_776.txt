Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 4, 7, 3, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7, 6, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6, 0, 1, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 6, 0, 2} 
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8, 0, 1}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 0, 6, 1, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9, 4, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8, 3, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Since these nodes have exactly 3 neighbors, each will form exactly 1 unique 3-star. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\) which we will represent as [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (9, 7, 4)>
- <2, (5, 6, 1)>
- <6, (7, 1, 3)>
- <7, (4, 0, 8)>
