Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 11) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 12) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 4, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 10}
- Node 8: {11, 13}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 12}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {4, 5, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {2, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {3, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 10}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2, 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4, 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6, 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10, 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11, 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 9, 13)>
- <2, (3, 10, 14)>
- <2, (6, 3, 4)>
- <2, (6, 4, 14)>
- <2, (6, 10, 14)>
- <3, (6, 13, 4)>
- <3, (6, 13, 10)>
- <4, (6, 3, 13)>
- <4, (6, 3, 10)>
- <4, (6, 13, 10)>
- <10, (6, 11, 14)>
- <11, (12, 8, 13)>
- <11, (12, 8, 12)>
- <11, (12, 8, 11)>
- <11, (12, 13, 8)>
- <11, (12, 13, 9)>
- <11, (12, 13, 2)>
- <11, (12, 13, 6)>
- <12, (11, 8, 13)>
- <12, (11, 8, 11)>
- <12, (11, 13, 8)>
- <12, (11, 13, 6)>
