Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 14, 27}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 14, 27}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 12, 20}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 13, 15}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {8, 16, 26}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 7, 20}
- Node 7: {6, 14, 22}
- Node 8: {5, 11}
- Node 9: {16, 25}
- Node 10: {12, 13, 26}
- Node 11: {8, 15, 28, 29}
- Node 12: {2, 10, 29}
- Node 13: {3, 10, 17, 20}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 7, 19}
- Node 15: {3, 11, 13, 26}
- Node 16: {5, 9, 23}
- Node 17: {13, 18}
- Node 18: {17, 19, 26, 29}
- Node 19: {14, 18, 25}
- Node 20: {2, 6, 13, 24}
- Node 21: {23, 24, 25}
- Node 22: {7, 24}
- Node 23: {16, 21, 29}
- Node 24: {20, 21, 22}
- Node 25: {9, 19, 21}
- Node 26: {10, 15, 18, 5}
- Node 27: {0, 1}
- Node 28: {11}
- Node 29: {11, 12, 18, 23}

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars in the graph by calculating \( \sum_{v \in V} \binom{d(v)}{3} \), where \( d(v) \) is the degree of node \( v \).

Calculating for each node:
- Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 1: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 2: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 3: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 4: Not enough neighbors
- Node 5: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 6: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 7: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 8: 2 choose 2 = 1
- Node 9: Not enough neighbors
- Node 10: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 11: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 12: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 13: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 14: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 15: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 16: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 17: 2 choose 2 = 1
- Node 18: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 19: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 20: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 21: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 22: 2 choose 2 = 1
- Node 23: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 24: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 25: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 26: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 27: 2 choose 2 = 1
- Node 28: Not enough neighbors
- Node 29: 4 choose 3 = 4

Summing these values, we get: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 61

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [61].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, 1, 27>
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 14, 1>
<0, 27, 1>
<1, 0, 6>
<1, 6, 0>
<1, 14, 7>
<1, 27, 0>
<2, 0, 6>
<2, 6, 0>
<2, 20, 13>
<3, 6, 20>
<3, 13, 20>
<3, 15, 11>
<4, 3, 15>
<5, 8, 11>
<6, 3, 13>
<6, 20, 2>
<7, 14, 0>
<8, 5, 16>
<10, 12, 29>
<11, 8, 5>
<11, 15, 13>
<14, 0, 7>
<15, 3, 11>
<18, 19, 25>
<20, 2, 6>
<21, 23, 29>
<24, 20, 13>
<25, 19, 18>
