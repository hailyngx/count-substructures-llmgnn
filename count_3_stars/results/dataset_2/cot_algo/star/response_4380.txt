Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 3) 

Response:
This graph forms the following 3-stars:

1. Node 9: <9, (0, 6, 8)>
2. Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 7)>
3. Node 8: <8, (0, 4, 9)>
4. Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 8)>
5. Node 0: <0, (6, 8, 9)>
6. Node 2: <2, (3, 4, 6)>
7. Node 1: <1, (4, 6, 8)>
8. Node 3: <3, (2, 6, 8)>
9. Node 7: <7, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in this graph.
