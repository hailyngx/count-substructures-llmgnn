Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 6) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 4) (18, 11) (18, 8) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 19) (13, 17) (13, 7) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 15) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 11) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 10) (3, 10) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 12) (19, 2) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 12) (15, 0) (15, 16) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 0) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 10) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 12) (8, 18) 

Response:
First, let's summarize the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {14, 16, 15, 4, 19}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 6}
- Node 2: {5, 19, 6, 4}
- Node 3: {10}
- Node 4: {9, 14, 2, 0}
- Node 5: {2, 12, 1}
- Node 6: {17, 2, 1, 11}
- Node 7: {13, 16, 10}
- Node 8: {18}
- Node 9: {4, 1}
- Node 10: {7, 3, 19, 12}
- Node 11: {18, 6, 12}
- Node 12: {5, 11, 19, 10}
- Node 13: {17, 7}
- Node 14: {17, 0, 4}
- Node 15: {0, 16}
- Node 16: {0, 7, 15}
- Node 17: {14, 13, 6}
- Node 18: {11, 8}
- Node 19: {2, 0, 10, 12}

Now we can count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 20 \) 3-stars. 

So the final answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, 14, 16, 15>
<0, 14, 16, 4>
<0, 14, 16, 19>
<0, 14, 15, 4>
<0, 14, 15, 19>
<0, 16, 15, 4>
<0, 16, 15, 19>
<0, 14, 4, 19>
<0, 16, 4, 19>
<14, 16, 15, 4>
<14, 16, 15, 19>
<14, 16, 4, 19>
<13, 17, 6, 2>
<10, 12, 11, 6>
<9, 4, 2, 1>
<7, 16, 15, 0>
<4, 14, 2, 0>
<16, 7, 15, 0>
<17, 13, 7, 16>
<19, 12, 10, 7>
