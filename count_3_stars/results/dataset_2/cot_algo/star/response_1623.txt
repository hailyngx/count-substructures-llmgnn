Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (12, 0) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 13) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be identified as follows:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: {9, 12, 6, 3, 10}. 
Since node 0 has more than 3 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
These 10 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 6, 3)>, <0, (9, 6, 10)>, <0, (9, 3, 10)>, <0, (12, 6, 3)>, <0, (12, 6, 10)>, <0, (12, 3, 10)>, <0, (6, 3, 10)>, <0, (9, 6, 12)>, <0, (9, 3, 12)>, <0, (6, 3, 12)>

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {8, 1, 14, 13}. 
Since node 2 has more than 3 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
These 4 3-stars are:
<2, (8, 1, 14)>, <2, (8, 1, 13)>, <2, (8, 14, 13)>, <2, (1, 14, 13)>

Node 3 has 6 neighbors: {5, 8, 12, 6, 11, 0}. 
Since node 3 has more than 3 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. 
These 20 3-stars are:
<3, (5, 8, 6)>, <3, (5, 8, 11)>, <3, (5, 8, 0)>, <3, (5, 6, 11)>, <3, (5, 6, 0)>, <3, (5, 11, 0)>, <3, (8, 6, 11)>, <3, (8, 6, 0)>, <3, (8, 11, 0)>, <3, (6, 11, 0)>, <3, (5, 8, 12)>, <3, (5, 6, 12)>, <3, (5, 11, 12)>, <3, (5, 0, 12)>, <3, (8, 6, 12)>, <3, (8, 11, 12)>, <3, (8, 0, 12)>, <3, (6, 11, 12)>, <3, (6, 0, 12)>, <3, (11, 0, 12)>

Summing up all the possible 3-stars formed by nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
10 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 2) + 20 (from node 3) = 34 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].
