Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 6, 9, 12, 14, 2
- Node 1: Neighbors are 3, 11, 2, 14, 12, 8
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 0
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 5, 8
- Node 4: Neighbors are 10, 11, 12, 13
- Node 5: Neighbors are 6, 3, 11, 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 9, 5, 10, 0
- Node 7: Neighbor is 13
- Node 8: Neighbors are 1, 3, 11, 14, 5
- Node 9: Neighbors are 6, 13, 0
- Node 10: Neighbors are 6, 12, 4, 13
- Node 11: Neighbors are 1, 14, 5, 8, 4
- Node 12: Neighbors are 1, 10, 4, 0
- Node 13: Neighbors are 9, 10, 4, 7, 14
- Node 14: Neighbors are 1, 11, 0, 8, 13

Now, let's check for nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, 1, 8, 11, and 14 have 5 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars. There are 5 * \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 50 3-stars formed by them.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 12, 14)>, <0, (6, 9, 13)>, <0, (6, 14, 2)>, <0, (9, 13, 14)>, <0, (12, 14, 2)>, <1, (3, 11, 14)>, <1, (3, 8, 11)>, <1, (11, 4, 12)>, <1, (2, 14, 8)>, <1, (12, 14, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 11)>, <8, (5, 11, 14)>, <8, (11, 4, 12)>, <11, (4, 5, 8)>, <14, (13, 9, 0)>
