Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the given edges based on the nodes they connect:

Node 0: {6, 5, 2}
Node 1: {4, 2, 8}
Node 2: {9, 8, 1, 3, 0}
Node 3: {9, 5, 2}
Node 4: {7, 9, 5, 1, 6}
Node 5: {4, 6, 0, 3}
Node 6: {4, 9, 5, 0}
Node 7: {4, 9, 8}
Node 8: {7, 9, 2, 1}
Node 9: {4, 7, 6, 8, 2, 3}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 52 3-stars in the graph. 

So, the final answer is [52], and the unique 3-stars are:
