Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 21) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 9) (22, 12) (22, 3) (20, 25) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 29) (25, 4) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 17) (8, 14) (8, 29) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 16) (26, 16) (9, 22) (9, 10) (9, 12) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 28) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 27) (16, 1) (16, 26) (16, 6) (21, 18) (21, 29) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 6) (3, 22) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 28) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 29) (5, 24) (5, 15) (15, 19) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 12) (14, 20) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 28) (14, 4) (28, 17) (28, 2) (28, 14) (4, 25) (4, 19) (4, 14) (12, 22) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 13) (13, 18) (13, 0) (13, 12) (24, 5) (29, 25) (29, 8) (29, 21) (29, 5) (27, 10) (27, 7) (27, 6) (6, 16) (6, 19) (6, 3) (6, 27) 

Response:
Based on the given edge list, we can construct the adjacency list for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 13}
- Node 1: {2, 10, 16, 17}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 28}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 7, 22}
- Node 4: {14, 19, 25}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 15, 24, 29}
- Node 6: {3, 16, 19, 27}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 11, 27}
- Node 8: {14, 29}
- Node 9: {10, 12, 22}
- Node 10: {1, 9, 27}
- Node 11: {7, 17}
- Node 12: {9, 13, 15, 22}
- Node 13: {0, 12, 18}
- Node 14: {4, 8, 15, 20, 28}
- Node 15: {4, 12, 14, 19}
- Node 16: {1, 6, 26}
- Node 17: {1, 11, 28}
- Node 18: {13, 21, 22}
- Node 19: {4, 6, 15}
- Node 20: {14, 25}
- Node 21: {18, 29}
- Node 22: {3, 9, 12, 18}
- Node 24: {5}
- Node 25: {4, 20, 29}
- Node 26: {16}
- Node 27: {6, 7, 10}
- Node 28: {2, 14, 17}
- Node 29: {5, 8, 21, 25}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <5, (2, 3, 29)>, <5, (2, 15, 29)>, <5, (2, 24, 29)>, <5, (3, 15, 29)>, <5, (3, 24, 29)>, <5, (2, 15, 24)>, <5, (15, 24, 29)>, <5, (2, 15, 3)>, <5, (3, 24, 15)>, <5, (3, 24, 2)>
Node 14 also has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <14, (4, 15, 28)>, <14, (4, 20, 28)>, <14, (4, 19, 28)>, <14, (19, 20, 28)>, <14, (15, 19, 28)>, <14, (4, 15, 20)>, <14, (15, 20, 28)>, <14, (4, 15, 19)>, <14, (4, 20, 15)>, <14, (20, 19, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
