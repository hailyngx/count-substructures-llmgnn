Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 23) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 23) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 22) (29, 9) (29, 2) (29, 25) (29, 10) (14, 26) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 26) (8, 23) (8, 26) (23, 7) (23, 9) (23, 8) (23, 3) (23, 28) (18, 2) (18, 5) (28, 6) (28, 23) (28, 16) (22, 2) (22, 11) (22, 20) (26, 14) (26, 17) (26, 8) (26, 0) (27, 4) (27, 24) (16, 17) (16, 28) (25, 7) (25, 29) (25, 11) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (0, 4) (0, 26) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 29) (10, 0) (10, 5) (15, 24) (15, 21) (19, 1) (19, 11) (3, 17) (3, 23) (3, 12) (3, 20) (11, 22) (11, 25) (11, 0) (11, 19) (11, 13) (20, 6) (20, 22) (20, 3) (21, 15) (24, 27) (24, 15) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 26, 10, 11
- Node 1: 6, 5, 13, 19
- Node 2: 29, 18, 22
- Node 3: 17, 23, 12, 20
- Node 4: 7, 27, 12, 0
- Node 5: 18, 12, 1, 10
- Node 6: 9, 28, 1, 20
- Node 7: 4, 25, 23
- Node 8: 23, 26
- Node 9: 6, 29, 23
- Node 10: 29, 0, 5
- Node 11: 22, 25, 0, 19, 13
- Node 12: 4, 5, 3
- Node 13: 1, 11
- Node 14: 26
- Node 15: 24, 21
- Node 16: 17, 28
- Node 17: 3, 16, 26
- Node 18: 2, 5
- Node 19: 1, 11
- Node 20: 6, 22, 3
- Node 21: 15
- Node 22: 2, 11, 20
- Node 23: 7, 9, 8, 3, 28
- Node 24: 27, 15
- Node 25: 7, 29, 11
- Node 26: 14, 17, 8, 0
- Node 27: 4, 24
- Node 28: 6, 23, 16
- Node 29: 9, 2, 25, 10

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 4, 5, 6, 11, 23, and 29 have 4 neighbors.
- Node 1, 2, 3, 7, and 10 have 3 neighbors.

For each of the nodes listed above, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 40 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 10, 11)>
- <4, (0, 7, 27)>
- <5, (0, 10, 12)>
- <6, (1, 20, 28)>
- <11, (0, 19, 25)>
- <23, (3, 8, 28)>
- <29, (2, 10, 25)>
