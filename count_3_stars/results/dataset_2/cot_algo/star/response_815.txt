Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (27, 4) (27, 22) (27, 3) (18, 4) (18, 5) (22, 27) (22, 4) (22, 12) (10, 7) (10, 28) (10, 16) (10, 14) (11, 3) (4, 27) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 5) (4, 26) (19, 26) (19, 28) (19, 9) (26, 4) (26, 19) (26, 23) (28, 10) (28, 19) (28, 15) (28, 20) (3, 27) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 5) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 23) (21, 17) (21, 24) (23, 26) (23, 6) (23, 29) (23, 12) (9, 19) (9, 24) (9, 20) (9, 13) (29, 23) (29, 25) (29, 15) (1, 6) (1, 20) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 1) (12, 22) (12, 23) (7, 10) (7, 20) (7, 14) (16, 10) (16, 3) (20, 28) (20, 9) (20, 1) (20, 7) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 13) (8, 14) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 25) (25, 29) (25, 13) (25, 15) (5, 0) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 3) (17, 21) (17, 24) (24, 21) (24, 9) (24, 17) (15, 28) (15, 29) (15, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 6, 20, 13, 2
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 27, 11, 16, 5
- Node 4: 27, 18, 22, 5, 26
- Node 5: 0, 18, 4, 3
- Node 6: 0, 1, 23
- Node 7: 10, 20, 14
- Node 8: 14
- Node 9: 19, 24, 20, 13
- Node 10: 7, 28, 16, 14
- Node 11: 3
- Node 12: 22, 23
- Node 13: 1, 14, 25, 9
- Node 14: 10, 7, 8, 13
- Node 15: 28, 29, 25
- Node 16: 10, 3
- Node 17: 21, 24
- Node 18: 4, 5
- Node 19: 26, 28, 9
- Node 20: 28, 9, 1, 7
- Node 21: 17, 24
- Node 22: 27, 4, 12
- Node 23: 26, 6, 29, 12
- Node 24: 9, 17, 21
- Node 25: 29, 13, 15
- Node 26: 4, 19, 23
- Node 27: 4, 22, 3
- Node 28: 10, 19, 15, 20
- Node 29: 23, 25, 15

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:

- <4, 27, 18>
- <5, 0, 18>
- <9, 24, 17>
- <10, 14, 7>
- <13, 9, 25>
- <14, 10, 7>
- <15, 25, 29>
- <20, 1, 13>
- <23, 26, 29>
- <24, 21, 17>
- <27, 22, 4>
- <28, 10, 20>
