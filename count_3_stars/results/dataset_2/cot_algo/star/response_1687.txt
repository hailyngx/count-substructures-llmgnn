Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 14) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 9) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) 

Response:
To solve this problem, we first need to determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors = {4, 7, 5, 12, 9, 10}
2. Node 1: Neighbors = {4, 7, 2, 9}
3. Node 2: Neighbors = {4, 1, 3, 10}
4. Node 3: Neighbors = {4, 2, 14, 6}
5. Node 4: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 2}
6. Node 5: Neighbors = {13, 0, 10, 14}
7. Node 6: Neighbors = {3, 8, 14}
8. Node 7: Neighbors = {12, 0, 11, 1, 10}
9. Node 8: Neighbors = {11, 6}
10. Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 0, 11}
11. Node 10: Neighbors = {7, 13, 5, 0, 2, 14}
12. Node 11: Neighbors = {7, 8, 13, 9}
13. Node 12: Neighbors = {7, 13, 0}
14. Node 13: Neighbors = {5, 12, 11, 10}
15. Node 14: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 10}

Now, we apply the combinatorial calculation to each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 10: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Adding these up gives us a total of 60 3-stars. 

So, the final answer is [60], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 12)>
<0, (4, 9, 10)>
<0, (5, 10, 12)>
<0, (7, 9, 10)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (10, 13, 14)>
<7, (10, 11, 13)>
<10, (2, 7, 14)>
<10, (5, 7, 13)>
