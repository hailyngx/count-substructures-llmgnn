Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (12, 6) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 3) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 12, 3, 11}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 14, 10}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 6, 4, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {8, 13, 0, 14, 11}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 7, 8, 0, 10, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8, 4, 10}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 12, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 11, 2, 13, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 6, 4, 13, 10, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 11, 10}
- Node 10: Neighbors {5, 9, 4, 8, 1}
- Node 11: Neighbors {9, 7, 0, 14, 3}
- Node 12: Neighbors {6, 0}
- Node 13: Neighbors {7, 8, 3}
- Node 14: Neighbors {11, 3, 1}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 6 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 6 neighbors
- Node 10: 5 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed with it:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 84 \)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars that can be formed in this graph is [84].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 12, 3)>
<3, (8, 13, 0)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 11, 2)>
<8, (5, 6, 4)>
<10, (5, 9, 4)>
<11, (9, 7, 0)>
