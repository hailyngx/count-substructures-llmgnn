Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 12) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 9) 

Response:
Calculating the degrees of each node:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 6
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3

Identifying the central nodes with 3 or more neighbors: Node 1, Node 2, Node 8, Node 9, Node 11, Node 12

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each central node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 64

Therefore, the final answer is [64], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 11, 5)>, <2, (1, 8, 14)>, <8, (0, 6, 11)>, <9, (4, 3, 12)>, <11, (7, 1, 6)>, <12, (13, 0, 9)>.
