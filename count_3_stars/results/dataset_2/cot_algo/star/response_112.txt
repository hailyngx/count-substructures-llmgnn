Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 10) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 14) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 13) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 9, and 13.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8, 10, 11, 14.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, 13.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, 13, 14.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 10, 14.
- Node 6 is connected to node 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 8, 9, 11, 13.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 10.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8, 14.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 12, 14.
- Node 12 is connected to node 11.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, 12.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 10, 11.

From this information, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph as follows:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 92 \). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [92].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 5, 13>, <1, 2, 10>, <1, 2, 14>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 10>, <1, 3, 11>, <1, 3, 14>, <1, 8, 11>, <1, 8, 14>, <1, 10, 14>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 5, 14>, <3, 4, 13>, <4, 7, 13>, <4, 7, 14>, <4, 5, 13>, <5, 10, 14>, <7, 8, 11>, <7, 11, 14>, <7, 13, 12>, <10, 11, 14>.
