Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 0) (2, 7) (2, 16) (18, 4) (18, 11) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 16) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 3) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 1) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 6) (10, 4) (10, 0) (11, 18) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 12) (14, 13) (14, 3) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 6) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 16) (15, 4) (15, 9) (12, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {4, 10, 13, 17}
- Node 1: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 16}
- Node 3: {6, 14, 19}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 10, 15, 18}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 7, 16, 19}
- Node 6: {3, 11, 16}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 13}
- Node 9: {1, 15, 17}
- Node 10: {0, 4}
- Node 11: {6, 11, 18, 19}
- Node 12: {11}
- Node 13: {0, 8, 14, 19}
- Node 14: {3, 13}
- Node 15: {4, 9}
- Node 16: {2, 5, 6, 17}
- Node 17: {0, 9, 16}
- Node 18: {4, 11}
- Node 19: {3, 5, 11, 13}

Now, we'll identify nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0, 5 stars
- Node 2, 3 stars
- Node 3, 1 star
- Node 4, 1 star
- Node 5, 1 star
- Node 6, 1 star
- Node 7, 1 star
- Node 9, 1 star
- Node 13, 1 star
- Node 16, 1 star
- Node 17, 1 star
- Node 19, 1 star

Total number of 3-stars: 5 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 10, 13)>
<0, (4, 10, 17)>
<0, (13, 17, 19)>
<0, (4, 13, 17)>
<0, (10, 13, 17)>
<2, (5, 7, 16)>
<3, (6, 14, 19)>
<4, (7, 5, 18)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (3, 11, 16)>
<7, (2, 5, 16)>
<9, (1, 9, 15)>
<13, (0, 8, 14)>
<16, (2, 6, 17)>
<17, (0, 9, 16)>
<19, (3, 11, 13)>
