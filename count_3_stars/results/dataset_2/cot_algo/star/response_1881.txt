Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (4, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 2) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 13) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {1, 3, 10, 11, 14}
Node 1 neighbors: {0, 3, 6, 11, 13}
Node 2 neighbors: {6, 7, 8, 14}
Node 3 neighbors: {0, 1, 6, 12}
Node 4 neighbors: {5}
Node 5 neighbors: {4, 7, 8, 11}
Node 6 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 8, 13}
Node 7 neighbors: {2, 5, 8, 9, 11}
Node 8 neighbors: {2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 9 neighbors: {7, 8, 10, 11}
Node 10 neighbors: {0, 9, 14}
Node 11 neighbors: {0, 1, 5, 7, 9}
Node 12 neighbors: {3, 13, 14}
Node 13 neighbors: {1, 6, 12}
Node 14 neighbors: {0, 2, 10, 12}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 0 forms 3-stars with the following neighbors: <0, (1, 10, 11)>, <0, (1, 11, 14)>, <0, (3, 10, 14)>, <0, (10, 14, 0)>
Node 1 forms 3-stars with the following neighbors: <1, (0, 3, 11)>, <1, (0, 6, 13)>, <1, (3, 6, 13)>, <1, (6, 13, 1)>
Node 3 forms 3-stars with the following neighbors: <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 6, 12)>, <3, (1, 6, 13)>, <3, (6, 13, 12)>
Node 6 forms 3-stars with the following neighbors: <6, (1, 3, 13)>, <6, (1, 2, 13)>, <6, (2, 13, 6)>
Node 8 forms 3-stars with the following neighbors: <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 11)>, <8, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 13)>, <8, (5, 8, 9)>, <8, (5, 8, 6)>, <8, (5, 8, 7)>, <8, (5, 8, 11)>, <8, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (6, 8, 13)>, <8, (6, 13, 8)>, <8, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (7, 8, 11)>, <8, (7, 8, 6)>, <8, (7, 8, 5)>, <8, (7, 9, 11)>, <8, (7, 9, 8)>, <8, (7, 11, 8)>, <8, (7, 11, 5)>, <8, (9, 11, 8)>
Node 13 forms 3-stars with the following neighbors: <13, (1, 6, 12)>, <13, (6, 12, 14)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [29].
