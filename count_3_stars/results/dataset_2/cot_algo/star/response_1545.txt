Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 8, 1, 4, 9
- Node 1: 7, 2, 11, 14, 10, 0
- Node 2: 12, 1, 4
- Node 3: 13, 12, 5, 10
- Node 4: 13, 2, 14, 0
- Node 5: 6, 13, 3
- Node 6: 9, 5, 11, 0
- Node 7: 9, 13, 12, 1
- Node 8: 9, 13, 0
- Node 9: 6, 8, 14, 7, 0, 12
- Node 10: 1, 3
- Node 11: 6, 14, 1
- Node 12: 9, 7, 2, 3
- Node 13: 8, 5, 4, 3, 7
- Node 14: 9, 11, 1, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0, 4, 1, 9, 7, 13 have at least 3 neighbors.
- Node 0, 4, 1, 9, 7, and 13 will contribute to the formation of 3-stars.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 68 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [68] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (6, 8, 1)>, <4, (13, 2, 14)>, <1, (7, 11, 14)>, <9, (6, 8, 14)>, <7, (9, 13, 12)>, <13, (8, 5, 7)>.
