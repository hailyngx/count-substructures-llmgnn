Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (10, 8) (10, 19) (11, 7) (11, 13) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 5) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 19) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 5) (9, 15) (1, 18) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 13) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 12) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 3) (15, 2) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 13) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 15) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 17, 18, 12, 3
- Node 1: 18, 6
- Node 2: 18, 16, 3, 15
- Node 3: 2, 7, 0
- Node 4: 8, 6
- Node 5: 8, 7, 19, 15
- Node 6: 4, 1, 13
- Node 7: 11, 12, 3, 5
- Node 8: 10, 4, 5
- Node 9: 15
- Node 10: 8, 19
- Node 11: 7, 13
- Node 12: 7, 16, 0, 19
- Node 13: 11, 6, 15
- Node 14: 16
- Node 15: 2, 5, 9, 13
- Node 16: 2, 18, 12, 14
- Node 17: 0, 19
- Node 18: 2, 16, 0, 1
- Node 19: 17, 10, 12, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2, 5, 7, 8, 12, 15, and 16 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 0, 3, 6, 13, 18, and 19 have 3 neighbors each.

We can now calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- From 7 nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each node, resulting in \( 7 \times 4 = 28 \) 3-stars.
- From 6 nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 3-star for each node, resulting in \( 6 \times 1 = 6 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 28 + 6 = 34 \), so the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <2, (3, 15, 16)>
- <5, (7, 15, 19)>
- <7, (5, 12, 19)>
- <8, (4, 5, 10)>
- <12, (0, 7, 16)>
- <15, (2, 13, 5)>
- <16, (2, 14, 18)>
