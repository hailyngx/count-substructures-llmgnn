Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 12) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 4) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 4) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 6) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 12, 3
Node 1: 2, 11, 10, 4
Node 2: 1, 11, 4
Node 3: 13, 0, 11
Node 4: 2, 11, 1, 6
Node 5: 9, 8, 7, 14
Node 6: 12, 10, 4
Node 7: 5, 9, 13, 12, 11, 14
Node 8: 5, 13
Node 9: 5, 14, 7, 13, 12
Node 10: 13, 1, 6
Node 11: 7, 12, 2, 3, 1, 4
Node 12: 9, 7, 14, 0, 6, 11
Node 13: 9, 8, 7, 12, 3, 10
Node 14: 5, 9, 7, 12

Now let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 106 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [106].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 4, 11)>
<2, (1, 4, 11)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (7, 9, 14)>
<7, (5, 9, 13)>
<9, (5, 7, 14)>
<11, (7, 12, 13)>
<12, (7, 9, 14)>
<13, (7, 12, 14)>
<14, (5, 7, 9)>
