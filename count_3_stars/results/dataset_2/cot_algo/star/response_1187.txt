Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {6, 8}
Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 6}
Node 2: {1, 7, 8}
Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
Node 4: {3, 6, 7, 9}
Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
Node 7: {2, 4, 5}
Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
Node 9: {4, 5, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 45 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [45], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
