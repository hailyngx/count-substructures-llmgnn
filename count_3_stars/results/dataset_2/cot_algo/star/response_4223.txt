Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 17) (22, 10) (22, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 28) (17, 18) (17, 5) (17, 11) (19, 2) (19, 26) (19, 20) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 6) (26, 25) (26, 4) (4, 18) (4, 26) (4, 15) (13, 1) (13, 26) (13, 0) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 24) (27, 25) (27, 9) (27, 5) (12, 2) (12, 28) (12, 29) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (14, 11) (14, 20) (16, 24) (16, 8) (16, 5) (7, 3) (7, 22) (7, 11) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 21) (0, 29) (24, 25) (24, 16) (5, 17) (5, 27) (5, 16) (8, 11) (8, 16) (20, 19) (20, 14) (29, 12) (29, 0) (29, 21) (15, 18) (15, 4) (23, 10) (23, 28) (21, 0) (21, 29) (6, 3) (6, 26) (6, 10) (10, 22) (10, 23) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 28) (9, 27) (9, 10) (9, 28) (28, 2) (28, 12) (28, 23) (28, 10) (28, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3, 13, 21, 29}
Node 1: {13}
Node 2: {3, 12, 19, 28}
Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 7, 13}
Node 4: {15, 18, 26}
Node 5: {16, 17, 27}
Node 6: {3, 10, 26}
Node 7: {3, 11, 22}
Node 8: {11, 16}
Node 9: {10, 27, 28}
Node 10: {6, 9, 22, 23, 28}
Node 11: {7, 8, 14, 17}
Node 12: {2, 28, 29}
Node 13: {0, 1, 26}
Node 14: {11, 20}
Node 15: {4, 18}
Node 16: {5, 8, 24}
Node 17: {11, 15, 18}
Node 18: {4, 15, 17}
Node 19: {2, 20, 26}
Node 20: {14, 19}
Node 21: {0, 29}
Node 22: {7, 10}
Node 23: {10, 28}
Node 24: {16, 25}
Node 25: {24, 26, 27}
Node 26: {4, 13, 19, 25}
Node 27: {5, 9, 25}
Node 28: {2, 9, 10, 12, 23}
Node 29: {0, 12, 21}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 
Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 6)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (3, 11, 22)>
Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (6, 22, 28)>
Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (7, 14, 17)>
Node 16 forms a 3-star: <16, (5, 8, 24)>
Node 18 forms a 3-star: <18, (4, 15, 17)>
Node 26 forms a 3-star: <26, (4, 13, 25)>
Node 28 forms a 3-star: <28, (2, 9, 10)>
Node 29 forms a 3-star: <29, (12, 21, 0)>

Total number of 3-stars: 9

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
