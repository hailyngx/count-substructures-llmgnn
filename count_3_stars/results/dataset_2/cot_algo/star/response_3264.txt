Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 0) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (12, 10) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 3, 6, 13
- Node 1: Neighbors are 5, 7, 14
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 4, 6, 8, 10
- Node 4: Neighbors are 3, 7, 8, 11
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 3, 9, 10
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 14
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: Neighbors are 2, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14
- Node 10: Neighbors are 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13
- Node 11: Neighbors are 2, 4
- Node 12: Neighbor is 10
- Node 13: Neighbors are 0, 9, 10, 14
- Node 14: Neighbors are 1, 2, 7, 9, 13

Now, let's find 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \(20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 90\).

Therefore, the final answer is [90].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <2, 7, 9>
- <10, 7, 14>
- <9, 13, 14>
- <2, 9, 14>
- <3, 8, 11>
