Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 7}

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with (3, 6, 8)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with (1, 4, 8)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with (1, 6, 9)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with (1, 3, 6) and (7, 9, 1)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with (1, 4, 5)
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with (5, 8, 9)

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of 6 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
