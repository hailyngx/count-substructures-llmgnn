Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 4: {9, 11}
- Node 5: {1, 8, 11}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 7: {10, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 10, 11}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 12: {2, 7, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 10, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 7, 9}

Nodes 0, 1, and 6 each have 6 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- For node 0: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- For node 1: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- For node 6: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 10>
<0, 2, 11>
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 6, 10>
<0, 6, 11>
<0, 6, 13>
<0, 6, 14>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 13>
<1, 6, 14>
