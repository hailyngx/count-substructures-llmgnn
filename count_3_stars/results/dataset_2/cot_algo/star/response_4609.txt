Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 8, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {4, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: has 4 neighbors
- Node 1: has 4 neighbors
- Node 3: has 4 neighbors
- Node 4: has 6 neighbors
- Node 7: has 5 neighbors
- Node 8: has 6 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Finally, sum up the total number of 3-stars:

\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 62 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [62]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6), (0, 7, 8), (0, 8, 9), (1, 6, 8), (1, 4, 7), (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 8), (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7), (1, 4, 9), (1, 6, 9), (3, 7, 9), (4, 6, 9), (4, 7, 9)>
