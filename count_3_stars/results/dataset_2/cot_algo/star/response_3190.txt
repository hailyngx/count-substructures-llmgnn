Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 8, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 6, 3, 4, 0, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 9, 3, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 1, 4, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 9, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 2, 1, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbor {8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 6, 1, 4, 0, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8, 4, 2}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 8, 5)>
<1, (0, 8, 4)>
<1, (0, 8, 2)>
<1, (0, 5, 4)>
<1, (0, 5, 2)>
<1, (0, 4, 2)>
<1, (8, 5, 4)>
<1, (8, 5, 2)>
<1, (8, 4, 2)>
<1, (5, 4, 2)>
<4, (9, 6, 8)>
<4, (9, 3, 8)>
<4, (6, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (9, 6, 1)>
