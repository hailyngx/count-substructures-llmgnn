Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 26) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 17) (1, 21) (1, 6) (1, 16) (21, 1) (21, 11) (7, 24) (7, 6) (7, 9) (24, 7) (24, 11) (24, 27) (24, 22) (24, 23) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 9) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 6) (4, 14) (4, 2) (18, 26) (18, 14) (17, 15) (17, 20) (29, 13) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 23) (2, 20) (8, 2) (8, 19) (11, 21) (11, 24) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 13) (28, 25) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 23) (5, 25) (5, 14) (13, 29) (13, 28) (13, 5) (20, 17) (20, 2) (20, 16) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 22) (19, 25) (22, 24) (22, 19) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 27) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 25) (10, 27) (10, 0) (10, 16) (26, 3) (26, 18) (23, 24) (23, 2) (23, 5) (16, 1) (16, 20) (16, 10) (16, 9) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 5) (25, 28) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 16) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {12, 10, 25}
- Node 1: {21, 6, 16}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 23, 20}
- Node 3: {15, 26, 18}
- Node 4: {14, 2}
- Node 5: {13, 19, 23, 25, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 27}
- Node 7: {24, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 19}
- Node 9: {7, 12, 16}
- Node 10: {27, 0, 16}
- Node 11: {21, 24, 28}
- Node 12: {14, 0, 9}
- Node 13: {29, 28, 5}
- Node 14: {12, 4, 18, 5}
- Node 15: {3, 19, 17}
- Node 16: {1, 20, 10, 9}
- Node 17: {15, 20}
- Node 18: {26, 14, 4}
- Node 19: {15, 8, 5, 22, 25}
- Node 20: {17, 2, 16}
- Node 21: {1, 11}
- Node 22: {24, 19}
- Node 23: {24, 2, 5}
- Node 24: {7, 11, 27, 22, 23}
- Node 25: {28, 5, 19, 0}
- Node 26: {3, 18}
- Node 27: {24, 10, 6}
- Node 28: {11, 13, 25}
- Node 29: {13}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (21, 6, 16)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (13, 19, 23)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (7, 12, 16)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (21, 24, 28)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (12, 4, 18)> and <14, (5, 13, 19)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (3, 19, 17)>
- Node 24 forms a 3-star: <24, (7, 11, 27)> and <24, (19, 22, 23)>
- Node 25 forms a 3-star: <25, (5, 19, 28)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [11].
