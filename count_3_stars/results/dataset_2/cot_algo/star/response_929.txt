Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 7 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 2 and Node 8 have 5 neighbors each, but they are not directly connected to each other, so they can only form 0 3-stars each.
- Node 3 and Node 6 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 1 and Node 9 have 2 neighbors each, which is less than 3, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from Node 0) + 10 (from Node 4) + 10 (from Node 5) + 10 (from Node 7) + 4 (from Node 3) + 4 (from Node 6) = 48

Therefore, the final answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <5, 7, 9>
- <6, 7, 9>
- <7, 9, 2>
