Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {6, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 4, 7, 1}
- Node 3: {7, 0, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {9, 0, 6, 2} 
- Node 5: {9, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {9, 0, 3, 2}
- Node 8: {5, 1, 3, 0, 6}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 2, 7}

Now, let's check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:
- Node 0: Does not form a 3-star (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 1: Does not form a 3-star (has 3 neighbors, but not all are connected)
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star [1] and the unique 3-star is <(2, 5, 9)>
- Node 3: Does not form a 3-star (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star [1] and the unique 3-star is <(4, 9, 2)>
- Node 5: Does not form a 3-star (has 3 neighbors, but not all are connected)
- Node 6: Does not form a 3-star (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 7: Does not form a 3-star (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 8: Does not form a 3-star (has 5 neighbors)
- Node 9: Does not form a 3-star (has 4 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars formed: [2]

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
