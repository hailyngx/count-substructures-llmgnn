Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 19) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 17) (1, 3) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (14, 3) (14, 16) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 15) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 19) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 12) (16, 18) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 19) (19, 9) (19, 6) (19, 2) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 18) (18, 16) (18, 15) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated as follows:

For each node, we will determine its neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {4, 10, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {13, 0, 11, 19}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {7, 1, 14, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {9, 0, 16, 11}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {6, 13, 15}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {5, 15, 19, 12}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {11, 3, 17}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {3, 10, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {4, 15, 19}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {8, 0}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {4, 7, 2}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {8, 6, 16}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {5, 17, 2}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {3, 16}
- Node 15: Neighbors = {9, 17, 6, 18}
- Node 16: Neighbors = {4, 14, 12, 18}
- Node 17: Neighbors = {7, 13, 15}
- Node 18: Neighbors = {16, 15}
- Node 19: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 15, 16

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 16: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 26

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 10, 2)>, <2, (13, 11, 19)>, <3, (7, 1, 14)>, <4, (9, 16, 11)>, <6, (5, 15, 19)>, <9, (4, 15, 19)>, <15, (9, 17, 6)>, <16, (4, 14, 12)>
