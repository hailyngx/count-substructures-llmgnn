Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 6) (16, 10) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 2) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 8) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 15) (5, 13) (5, 18) (13, 5) (13, 19) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 2) (0, 16) (0, 8) (9, 7) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 6) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 4) (19, 3) (19, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (6, 16) (6, 18) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 16}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 7, 8, 17}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 15, 17}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 17, 19}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {13, 15, 18}
- Node 6: Neighbors {16, 18}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 9, 12, 18}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 10}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7}
- Node 10: Neighbors {8, 11, 16}
- Node 11: Neighbors {10, 12, 14, 16}
- Node 12: Neighbors {7, 11, 15}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 19}
- Node 14: Neighbors {11, 4, 17}
- Node 15: Neighbors {2, 12, 18}
- Node 16: Neighbors {0, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 17: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 14}
- Node 18: Neighbors {5, 6, 7, 15}
- Node 19: Neighbors {3, 13}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and count the 3-stars:
- Node 1: <1, (3, 7, 17)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 17, 4)>
- Node 4: <4, (2, 3, 14)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 12, 18)>
- Node 8: <8, (0, 1, 10)>
- Node 11: <11, (10, 12, 14)>
- Node 12: <12, (7, 11, 15)>
- Node 14: <14, (11, 17, 4)>
- Node 15: <15, (2, 12, 18)>
- Node 16: <16, (0, 10, 11)>
- Node 17: <17, (1, 3, 14)>
- Node 18: <18, (5, 7, 15)>

There are 12 unique 3-stars formed in total, so the final answer is [12].
