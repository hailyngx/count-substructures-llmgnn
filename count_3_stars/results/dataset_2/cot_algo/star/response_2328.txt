Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 10) (3, 5) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 6) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 0) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 6) (2, 0) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 18) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 8) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 19) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 8) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 18) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 14) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 11) (18, 13) (18, 1) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 6, 17, 19, 12}
- Node 1: {10, 16, 18}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {5, 11, 15, 16}
- Node 4: {10}
- Node 5: {3, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 8, 14, 15}
- Node 8: {6, 11, 16}
- Node 9: {3, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 4, 17, 19}
- Node 11: {3, 9, 12, 8}
- Node 12: {0, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {12, 14, 18}
- Node 14: {6, 9, 13, 19}
- Node 15: {3, 6}
- Node 16: {1, 3, 8, 17}
- Node 17: {0, 10, 16}
- Node 18: {1, 13}
- Node 19: {0, 10, 14}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed by nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. 
- Node 1 forms 0 3-stars. 
- Node 3 forms 0 3-stars. 
- Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 8 forms 0 3-stars. 
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (3, 11, 12)>
- Node 10 forms 0 3-stars. 
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star: <11, (3, 9, 12)>
- Node 12 forms 0 3-stars. 
- Node 13 forms 0 3-stars. 
- Node 14 forms 0 3-stars. 
- Node 16 forms 0 3-stars. 
- Node 17 forms 0 3-stars. 
- Node 18 forms 0 3-stars. 
- Node 19 forms 0 3-stars. 

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 16. 

Therefore, the final answer is [16]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<9, (3, 11, 12)>
<11, (3, 9, 12)>
