Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 1) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first determine the set of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 12, 14
- Node 1 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 10, 12
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 3, 14
- Node 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 8, 11
- Node 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 9, 13
- Node 5 neighbors: 1, 10, 12
- Node 6 neighbors: 1
- Node 7 neighbors: 0, 4, 9, 12, 13
- Node 8 neighbors: 3, 11, 13
- Node 9 neighbors: 4, 7, 11, 13
- Node 10 neighbors: 1, 5, 13, 14
- Node 11 neighbors: 3, 8, 9, 14
- Node 12 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 13 neighbors: 4, 7, 8, 9, 10
- Node 14 neighbors: 0, 2, 10, 11

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 14, 12)
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (3, 5, 10)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 8, 11)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes (7, 9, 13)

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 14, 12)>, <1, (3, 5, 10)>, <3, (2, 8, 11)>, and <4, (7, 9, 13)>.
