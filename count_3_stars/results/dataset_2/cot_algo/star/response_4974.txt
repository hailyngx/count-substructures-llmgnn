Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 14) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 1) (3, 9) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 0) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 17) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 8) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (15, 11) (15, 2) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 0) (12, 4) (6, 19) (6, 7) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 10) (10, 2) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 13) (9, 3) (9, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 17) (17, 4) (17, 7) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 10) (14, 16) (14, 2) (14, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {8, 10, 18}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 13}
- Node 2: {14, 15, 18}
- Node 3: {1, 9, 16}
- Node 4: {12, 14, 16, 17, 18}
- Node 5: {1, 8, 19}
- Node 6: {7, 19}
- Node 7: {6, 9, 17}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 8, 19}
- Node 9: {3, 7}
- Node 10: {0, 13, 19}
- Node 11: {15, 16}
- Node 12: {4}
- Node 13: {1, 10, 19}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 16}
- Node 15: {2, 11}
- Node 16: {3, 4, 11, 14}
- Node 17: {4, 7}
- Node 18: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 19: {5, 6, 8, 10, 13}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: [1] (as it has 3 neighbors)
    - <0, (8, 10, 18)>
- Node 1: [1] (as it has 3 neighbors)
    - <1, (3, 5, 13)>
- Node 2: [1] (as it has 3 neighbors)
    - <2, (14, 15, 18)>
- Node 4: [3] (as it has 5 neighbors)
    - <4, (14, 16, 18)>
    - <4, (14, 16, 17)>
    - <4, (16, 17, 18)>
- Node 5: [1] (as it has 3 neighbors)
    - <5, (1, 8, 19)>
- Node 8: [1] (as it has 4 neighbors)
    - <8, (0, 5, 19)>
- Node 10: [1] (as it has 3 neighbors)
    - <10, (13, 18, 19)>
- Node 14: [1] (as it has 3 neighbors)
    - <14, (2, 4, 16)>
- Node 16: [1] (as it has 4 neighbors)
    - <16, (3, 4, 11)>
- Node 17: [1] (as it has 3 neighbors)
    - <17, (4, 7, 17)>
- Node 18: [1] (as it has 3 neighbors)
    - <18, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 19: [1] (as it has 5 neighbors)
    - <19, (5, 8, 10)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [13].
