Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 16) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (5, 8) (5, 13) (0, 17) (0, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (15, 10) (15, 2) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 16) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 9) (18, 14) (18, 19) (18, 16) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 6) (2, 15) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 6) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 2) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 9) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 16) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 17
- Node 1: 0, 3, 11
- Node 2: 6, 12, 15, 19
- Node 3: 1, 7, 10, 16
- Node 4: 12, 16, 19
- Node 5: 8, 13
- Node 6: 2, 17, 19
- Node 7: 3, 8
- Node 8: 5, 7, 13
- Node 9: 10, 12, 14, 16
- Node 10: 3, 9, 11, 15
- Node 11: 1, 10
- Node 12: 4, 9, 2
- Node 13: 5, 8
- Node 14: 9, 17, 18
- Node 15: 2, 10
- Node 16: 3, 4, 9, 18
- Node 17: 0, 6, 14
- Node 18: 14, 16, 19
- Node 19: 2, 4, 6, 12, 18

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has at least three neighbors:

- Node 0: 1
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 1
- Node 6: 1
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 1
- Node 10: 1
- Node 12: 1
- Node 14: 1
- Node 16: 1
- Node 18: 1
- Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars: 14

So, the final answer is [14].

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, 1, 17>
<2, 6, 19>
<3, 7, 10>
<4, 12, 16>
<6, 2, 19>
<8, 13, 5>
<9, 14, 17>
<10, 3, 15>
<12, 2, 9>
<14, 17, 18>
<16, 9, 18>
<18, 14, 19>
<19, 2, 4>
