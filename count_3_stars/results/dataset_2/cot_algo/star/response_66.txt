Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 8
- Node 5: 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 60

Thus, the final number to be put inside brackets is [60].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 8>
