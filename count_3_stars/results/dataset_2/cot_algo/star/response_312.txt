Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 11) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 5) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 11) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 14) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 14) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 10, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 12}
- Node 8: {4, 11}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 9, 13}

Next, we identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 78 \).

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [78].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 10, 13)>, <0, (1, 10, 14)>, <0, (1, 13, 14)>, <0, (3, 10, 12)>, <0, (3, 5, 12)>, <0, (10, 11, 13)>, <0, (10, 11, 14)>, <0, (10, 13, 14)>, <3, (5, 6, 12)>, <4, (7, 8, 12)>, <6, (2, 9, 13)>, <9, (4, 11, 14)>, <12, (4, 7, 12)>, <13, (2, 6, 9)>.
