Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 19) (16, 0) (16, 2) (5, 4) (5, 17) (9, 8) (9, 17) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 14) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 18) (4, 5) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 13) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 18) (15, 14) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 13) (2, 16) (2, 0) (2, 19) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 2) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 15) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 7, 10, 16
- Node 1: 6, 8, 11, 13
- Node 2: 0, 16, 19
- Node 3: 0, 11, 13, 18
- Node 4: 5, 19
- Node 5: 4, 17
- Node 6: 1, 13, 18
- Node 7: 0, 10, 12, 14
- Node 8: 1, 9, 17
- Node 9: 8, 17
- Node 10: 0, 14, 17
- Node 11: 1, 3, 19
- Node 12: 7, 13
- Node 13: 1, 3, 6, 12
- Node 14: 7, 10, 15
- Node 15: 14, 18
- Node 16: 0, 2
- Node 17: 5, 8, 9, 10, 18
- Node 18: 3, 6, 15, 17
- Node 19: 2, 4, 11

Now, we can identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 1: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 14: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 17: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 18: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 37

Therefore, the final answer is [37], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 10, 16)>, <0, (2, 16, 19)>, <0, (7, 10, 14)>, <0, (7, 10, 17)>, <0, (7, 14, 17)>, <1, (6, 13, 18)>, <3, (0, 11, 19)>, <3, (0, 13, 18)>, <13, (1, 6, 18)>, <17, (8, 9, 10)>, <17, (8, 9, 18)>, <17, (8, 10, 18)>, <17, (9, 10, 18)>, <17, (9, 10, 17)>, <18, (3, 6, 15)>
