Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 4, 2}
- Node 1: {9, 8, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 4, 0, 3}
- Node 3: {9, 6, 8, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 8, 2, 0}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 8, 1}
- Node 8: {6, 4, 3, 1, 7}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 3, 1, 0}

Now, we need to find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 and Node 9 have 3 neighbors, so each forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, and Node 8 have more than 3 neighbors, so we need to calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \):
  - Node 1: 3-stars = 1
  - Node 2: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Node 3: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 4: 3-stars = 1
  - Node 6: 3-stars = 1
  - Node 8: 3-stars = 1

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 18 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [18], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 0>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <6, 8, 9>
