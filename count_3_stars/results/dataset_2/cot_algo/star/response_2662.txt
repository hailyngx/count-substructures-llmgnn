Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 17) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 6) (11, 18) (11, 15) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 12) (12, 9) (12, 6) (16, 17) (16, 19) (15, 7) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 14) (19, 16) (19, 15) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 16) (10, 3) (10, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 13) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 12) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will start by identifying the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {7, 2, 1, 9}
Node 1 neighbors: {4, 0, 13}
Node 2 neighbors: {18, 8, 0}
Node 3 neighbors: {17, 10, 6}
Node 4 neighbors: {7, 14, 1, 6}
Node 6 neighbors: {4, 18, 3, 12}
Node 7 neighbors: {4, 0, 15, 17}
Node 8 neighbors: {2, 9}
Node 9 neighbors: {8, 0, 10, 12}
Node 10 neighbors: {3, 9}
Node 11 neighbors: {18, 15}
Node 12 neighbors: {9, 6}
Node 13 neighbors: {18, 15, 1, 14}
Node 14 neighbors: {4, 15, 13}
Node 15 neighbors: {7, 11, 19, 13, 14}
Node 16 neighbors: {17, 19}
Node 17 neighbors: {7, 3, 16}
Node 18 neighbors: {2, 6, 13}
Node 19 neighbors: {16, 15}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars based on the neighbor sets:

Node 0 forms no 3-star.
Node 1 forms no 3-star.
Node 2 forms no 3-star.
Node 3 forms [1] 3-star: <3, (6, 10, 17)>
Node 4 forms no 3-star.
Node 6 forms [1] 3-star: <6, (3, 12, 18)>
Node 7 forms [1] 3-star: <7, (4, 15, 17)>
Node 8 forms no 3-star.
Node 9 forms no 3-star.
Node 10 forms no 3-star.
Node 11 forms no 3-star.
Node 12 forms no 3-star.
Node 13 forms [1] 3-star: <13, (15, 14, 18)>
Node 14 forms no 3-star.
Node 15 forms [1] 3-star: <15, (7, 13, 19)>
Node 16 forms no 3-star.
Node 17 forms [1] 3-star: <17, (7, 3, 16)>
Node 18 forms no 3-star.
Node 19 forms no 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (6, 10, 17)>
<6, (3, 12, 18)>
<7, (4, 15, 17)>
<13, (15, 14, 18)>
<15, (7, 13, 19)>
<17, (7, 3, 16)>
