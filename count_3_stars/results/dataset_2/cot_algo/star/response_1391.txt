Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {1, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 1 neighbors: {0, 4, 8, 13}
- Node 2 neighbors: {7, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 3 neighbors: {4, 5}
- Node 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 8, 11}
- Node 5 neighbors: {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 6 neighbors: {0, 12, 14}
- Node 7 neighbors: {2, 5, 9, 12}
- Node 8 neighbors: {1, 4, 10, 11, 9}
- Node 9 neighbors: {5, 7, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 10 neighbors: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 11 neighbors: {4, 8, 13}
- Node 12 neighbors: {0, 6, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 13 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 11, 12}
- Node 14 neighbors: {2, 6, 9}

Now, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 80

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [80].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 6, 13)>, <1, (0, 8, 13)>, <2, (7, 10, 14)>, <4, (3, 8, 11)>, <5, (7, 9, 12)>, <7, (5, 9, 12)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 12)>, <12, (0, 6, 13)>, <13, (0, 1, 12)>
