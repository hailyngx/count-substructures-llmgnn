Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 14) 

Response:
The nodes can be represented as follows:  
• Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, 10, 14  
• Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 13, 14  
• Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 8, 13  
• Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, 9, 13  
• Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 14  
• Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 11, 12, 13  
• Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8, 10, 11  
• Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, 10, 14  
• Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 12, 13  
• Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 11  
• Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 14  
• Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 9, 12  
• Node 12 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 11, 13  
• Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12  
• Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, 10  
  
Node 5, 6, 7, 13, and 14 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can potentially be the center of a 3-star. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

For Node 5:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For Node 6:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For Node 7:
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

For Node 13:
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

For Node 14:
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 38 \). Hence, the final answer is [38].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 13>
<5, 6, 12>
<5, 7, 13>
<5, 12, 13>
<6, 7, 10>
<6, 7, 14>
<6, 13, 2>
<6, 13, 3>
<7, 0, 3>
<7, 0, 14>
<7, 1, 13>
<7, 1, 14>
<13, 2, 8>
<13, 2, 3>
<13, 8, 12>
<13, 12, 5>
<14, 0, 4>
<14, 0, 7>
<14, 0, 1>
