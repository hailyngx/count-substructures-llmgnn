Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 18) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 5) (8, 10) (8, 0) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 15) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 9) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 18) (9, 19) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 5) (15, 2) (15, 7) (19, 2) (19, 9) (19, 17) (6, 0) (6, 13) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 15) (7, 17) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 18) (14, 12) (14, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, we will find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 10, 18}
- Node 2: {11, 12, 15, 19}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 9, 18}
- Node 4: {5, 11, 16}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 12, 18}
- Node 6: {0, 13}
- Node 7: {15, 17}
- Node 8: {0, 10}
- Node 9: {3, 9, 12, 18, 19}
- Node 10: {1, 8}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 16, 17}
- Node 12: {2, 5, 9, 14}
- Node 13: {6, 14}
- Node 14: {12, 13}
- Node 15: {2, 7}
- Node 16: {4, 11}
- Node 17: {7, 11, 19}
- Node 18: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 19: {2, 9, 17}

Next, we will apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed with node 2.
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars are formed with node 3.
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed with node 5.
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars are formed with node 9.
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed with node 11.
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed with node 12.
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star is formed with node 17.
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed with node 18.
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star is formed with node 19.

Adding them all up, we get a total of 38 3-stars in this graph: [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (11, 15, 19)>
- <3, (0, 1, 18)>
- <5, (3, 12, 18)>
- <9, (3, 12, 18)>
- <11, (4, 16, 17)>
- <12, (2, 5, 9)>
- <17, (7, 11, 19)>
- <18, (1, 3, 5)>
- <19, (2, 9, 17)>
