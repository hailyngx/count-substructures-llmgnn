Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 12) (14, 4) (17, 2) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 18) (2, 17) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 7) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 5) (1, 19) (1, 12) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 16) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 16) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 0) (6, 16) (6, 7) (7, 15) (7, 5) (7, 6) (0, 19) (0, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph and their neighbors are as follows:

1: {19, 12}  
2: {17, 4, 18, 9, 13}  
3: {15, 10, 13, 12}  
4: {14, 2, 11}  
5: {13, 19, 7}  
6: {16, 7}  
7: {15, 5, 6}  
8: {9, 10, 11, 18}  
9: {8, 2, 18, 16}  
10: {3, 8}  
11: {4, 8, 19, 0}  
12: {3, 15, 1, 16}  
13: {3, 2, 5}  
14: {4}  
15: {3, 7, 12}  
16: {9, 12, 6}  
17: {2}  
18: {8, 2, 9}  
19: {5, 1, 11, 0}  
0: {19, 11}

Calculating the inom{n}{3} for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 1: [1 3-star]

Nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
- Node 3: [4 3-stars]
    - <3, (15, 10, 13)>
    - <3, (15, 10, 12)>
    - <3, (15, 13, 12)>
    - <3, (10, 13, 12)>
- Node 8: [4 3-stars]
    - <8, (9, 10, 11)>
    - <8, (9, 10, 18)>
    - <8, (9, 11, 18)>
    - <8, (10, 11, 18)>
- Node 9: [4 3-stars]
    - <9, (8, 2, 18)>
    - <9, (8, 2, 16)>
    - <9, (8, 18, 16)>
    - <9, (2, 18, 16)>
- Node 11: [4 3-stars]
    - <11, (4, 8, 19)>
    - <11, (4, 8, 0)>
    - <11, (4, 19, 0)>
    - <11, (8, 19, 0)>
- Node 12: [4 3-stars]
    - <12, (3, 15, 1)>
    - <12, (3, 15, 16)>
    - <12, (3, 1, 16)>
    - <12, (15, 1, 16)>
- Node 13: [4 3-stars]
    - <13, (3, 2, 5)>
    - <13, (3, 2, 19)>
    - <13, (3, 5, 19)>
    - <13, (2, 5, 19)>
- Node 19: [4 3-stars]
    - <19, (5, 11, 0)>
    - <19, (5, 11, 1)>
    - <19, (5, 0, 1)>
    - <19, (11, 0, 1)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [25] 3-stars in this graph.
