Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 10) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 6, 9, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 7, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 10, 12}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 4}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {3, 7, 8}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 4, 10, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {3, 8, 10}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: No 3-star formed (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: No 3-star formed (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: No 3-star formed (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: No 3-star formed (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: No 3-star formed (has only 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 66 \)

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars formed in the given graph is [66].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (3, 9, 12)>
- <0, (6, 9, 12)>
- <0, (3, 6, 12)>
- <2, (4, 9, 12)>
- <2, (4, 5, 12)>
- <2, (4, 5, 10)>
- <2, (5, 10, 13)>
- <2, (1, 10, 13)>
- <3, (0, 5, 12)>
- <4, (9, 12, 13)>
- <7, (6, 10, 11)>
- <10, (5, 13, 14)>
