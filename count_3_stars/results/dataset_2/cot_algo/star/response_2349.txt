Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 14) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 8) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 6) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 2) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 9, 11
- Node 1: 8, 9, 14, 6
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 9, 13
- Node 3: 4, 6, 12, 14
- Node 4: 3, 5, 11, 13
- Node 5: 2, 4, 7, 10
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 8, 13, 14
- Node 7: 5, 14
- Node 8: 1, 6, 10, 11
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2
- Node 10: 5, 8, 11, 12
- Node 11: 0, 4, 8, 10, 14
- Node 12: 10, 3, 13
- Node 13: 2, 4, 6, 12
- Node 14: 1, 3, 6, 7, 11

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14

For these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 75

Therefore, the final answer is [75]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 9, 11>
- <1, 6, 14>
- <1, 9, 14>
- <2, 6, 13>
- <2, 9, 13>
- <3, 6, 14>
- <4, 11, 13>
- <5, 10, 11>
- <6, 8, 13>
- <6, 11, 14>
- <8, 10, 11>
