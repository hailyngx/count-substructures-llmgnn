Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 25) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 27) (17, 7) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 18) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 22) (27, 17) (27, 12) (5, 19) (5, 10) (6, 3) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 29) (22, 12) (22, 26) (26, 22) (26, 29) (26, 3) (26, 4) (0, 17) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 24) (24, 19) (24, 2) (11, 12) (11, 19) (11, 23) (11, 4) (23, 11) (23, 1) (23, 29) (23, 10) (9, 29) (9, 2) (9, 28) (29, 7) (29, 26) (29, 23) (29, 9) (3, 6) (3, 26) (3, 28) (28, 9) (28, 3) (28, 15) (1, 23) (1, 16) (1, 10) (20, 2) (21, 14) (21, 18) (2, 24) (2, 9) (2, 20) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 15) (10, 5) (10, 23) (10, 1) (10, 16) (25, 14) (25, 12) (25, 18) (4, 26) (4, 11) (4, 15) (15, 13) (15, 28) (15, 16) (15, 4) (18, 13) (18, 21) (18, 25) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: {17}
Node 1: {10, 16, 23}
Node 2: {9, 20, 24}
Node 3: {6, 26, 28}
Node 4: {11, 15, 26}
Node 5: {10, 19}
Node 6: {3}
Node 7: {12, 17, 29}
Node 8: {13, 16}
Node 9: {2, 28, 29}
Node 10: {1, 5, 16, 23}
Node 11: {4, 12, 19, 23}
Node 12: {7, 11, 17, 22, 25}
Node 13: {8, 15, 17, 18}
Node 14: {17, 21, 25}
Node 15: {4, 13, 15, 16, 28}
Node 16: {1, 8, 10, 15}
Node 17: {0, 7, 13, 14, 27}
Node 18: {13, 21, 25}
Node 19: {5, 11, 24}
Node 20: {2}
Node 21: {14, 18}
Node 22: {12, 26}
Node 23: {1, 10, 11, 29}
Node 24: {2, 19}
Node 25: {12, 14, 18}
Node 26: {3, 4, 22, 29}
Node 27: {12, 17}
Node 28: {3, 9, 15}
Node 29: {7, 9, 23, 26}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 3: No 3-star possible (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: No 3-star possible (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 12: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 15: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 17: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 23: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 25: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 26: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 28: No 3-star possible (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 29: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [59].
