Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 18) (21, 14) (3, 25) (3, 17) (3, 20) (3, 5) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 29) (25, 15) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 7) (23, 1) (23, 8) (23, 16) (23, 10) (0, 20) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 0) (20, 28) (28, 20) (28, 27) (28, 5) (29, 25) (29, 6) (14, 21) (14, 5) (10, 21) (10, 23) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 24) (17, 3) (17, 25) (17, 10) (17, 6) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 12) (4, 15) (4, 2) (27, 28) (27, 22) (15, 1) (15, 25) (15, 4) (15, 24) (18, 21) (18, 9) (18, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 26) (12, 18) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 23) (16, 12) (16, 24) (16, 6) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 29) (6, 17) (6, 16) (6, 22) (24, 10) (24, 15) (24, 16) (5, 3) (5, 28) (5, 14) (5, 2) (22, 27) (22, 6) (22, 11) (11, 9) (11, 22) (7, 8) (7, 9) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 20
Node 1: 21, 15, 23
Node 2: 10, 4, 12, 5
Node 3: 25, 17, 20, 5
Node 4: 15, 2
Node 5: 3, 28, 14, 2
Node 6: 29, 17, 16, 22
Node 7: 8, 9
Node 8: 23, 20, 7
Node 9: 18, 11, 7
Node 10: 21, 23, 17, 2, 24
Node 11: 9, 22
Node 12: 26, 18, 2, 16
Node 14: 21, 5
Node 15: 1, 25, 4, 24
Node 16: 23, 12, 24, 6
Node 17: 3, 25, 10, 6
Node 18: 21, 12, 9
Node 19: 26
Node 20: 3, 8, 0, 28
Node 21: 1, 10, 18, 14
Node 22: 27, 6, 11
Node 23: 1, 8, 16, 10
Node 24: 10, 15, 16
Node 25: 3, 15, 17, 29
Node 26: 19, 12
Node 27: 28, 22
Node 28: 20, 27, 5
Node 29: 25, 6

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 1, Node 3, Node 10, and Node 15 each have 4 neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they can form.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 4 neighbors:
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16, so the final answer is [16].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (21, 15, 23)>
<3, (25, 17, 20)>
<10, (21, 23, 17)>
<15, (1, 25, 4)>
<1, (21, 15, 23)>
<21, (1, 10, 18)>
<3, (25, 17, 10)>
<15, (1, 25, 4)>
