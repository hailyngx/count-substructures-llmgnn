Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 7) (8, 5) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 9) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 9) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 6, 14, 2}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 3, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 11, 13, 0, 12, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 11, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 10, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {10, 11, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 14, 12, 0}
- Node 7: {6, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 5}
- Node 9: {3, 13, 14, 2}
- Node 10: {4, 13, 5}
- Node 11: {3, 0, 5, 2}
- Node 12: {13, 5, 6, 2}
- Node 13: {10, 12, 2, 9}
- Node 14: {1, 5, 6, 0, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 14: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [75].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (11, 6, 14)>
- <0, (11, 2, 14)>
- <0, (6, 14, 2)>
- <0, (6, 14, 12)>
- <1, (4, 7, 3)>
- <2, (4, 11, 13)>
- <2, (4, 13, 12)>
- <2, (11, 13, 9)>
- <2, (13, 9, 12)>
- <3, (1, 11, 9)>
- <4, (2, 10, 1)>
- <5, (10, 11, 8)>
- <5, (10, 11, 12)>
- <5, (10, 12, 14)>
- <5, (11, 12, 14)>
- <6, (1, 7, 14)>
- <6, (4, 7, 12)>
- <6, (4, 7, 14)>
- <6, (7, 1, 8)>
- <9, (13, 9, 14)>
- <11, (0, 5, 2)>
- <12, (13, 5, 6)>
- <14, (1, 5, 6)>
