Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 2, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {4, 8, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 3, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 8, 2, 0, 7}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 2, 1}
- Node 5: {9, 4, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 8, 4}
- Node 7: {8, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 8: {6, 2, 3, 1, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 3, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 53

Therefore, the final answer is [53].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, 2, 3>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <3, 0, 7>
- <4, 1, 8>
