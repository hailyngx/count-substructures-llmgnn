Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 5) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (9, 1) (9, 8) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 14) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 6) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 14, 7, 11, 12, 5
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 11, 10, 13, 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 12, 13, 6, 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 11, 6, 12, 4
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 12, 6
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 14, 10
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 2, 11, 10
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 0, 14, 13
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 11, 0
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 8
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, 0, 6
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 2, 0, 14
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 12, 5
  
Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with (8, 11, 12), <0, (8, 11, 12)>
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with (1, 11, 6), (1, 12, 4), (11, 6, 10), <3, (1, 11, 6)>, <3, (1, 12, 4)>, <3, (11, 6, 10)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with (3, 4, 10), <6, (3, 4, 10)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with (1, 3, 0), <11, (1, 3, 0)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with (0, 14, 7), <12, (0, 14, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of 6. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
