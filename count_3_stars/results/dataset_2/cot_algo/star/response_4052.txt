Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 19) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 16) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 14) (13, 11) (1, 10) (1, 18) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 18) (8, 6) (8, 12) (16, 0) (16, 2) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 6) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 5) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 6) (17, 12) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {16, 12, 6}
- Node 1: {10, 18}
- Node 2: {4, 16}
- Node 3: {15, 14}
- Node 4: {15, 7, 10, 5, 2}
- Node 5: {4, 19, 14}
- Node 6: {15, 0, 8, 18, 12}
- Node 7: {15, 4, 19}
- Node 8: {6, 12}
- Node 9: {10, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {4, 11, 1, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {10, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 8, 9, 17, 6}
- Node 13: {11}
- Node 14: {3, 10, 5}
- Node 15: {3, 7, 6, 4}
- Node 16: {0, 2}
- Node 17: {12}
- Node 18: {1, 19, 6}
- Node 19: {7, 5, 18}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 15, 18, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (5 choose 3)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 38 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 12, 6>, <0, 12, 9>, <0, 12, 17>, <0, 6, 12>, <1, 10, 9>, <2, 4, 16>, <4, 7, 15>, <4, 10, 14>, <4, 5, 14>, <4, 5, 19>, <5, 4, 19>, <6, 12, 17>, <6, 12, 9>, <6, 15, 7>, <6, 15, 0>, <6, 15, 4>, <7, 15, 4>, <10, 11, 9>, <10, 4, 14>, <10, 4, 5>
