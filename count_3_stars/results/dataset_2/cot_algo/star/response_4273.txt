Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 14) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 17) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 4) (6, 11) (6, 17) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 14) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 19) (15, 19) (15, 17) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 3) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 18) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 15) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 16) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 18) (16, 4) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 16) (18, 8) (18, 3) (18, 16) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to analyze the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {5, 10, 3, 19}
Node 1: Neighbors {7, 4, 12}
Node 2: Neighbors {10, 7, 14}
Node 3: Neighbors {10, 0, 19, 18}
Node 4: Neighbors {5, 11, 1, 16}
Node 5: Neighbors {9, 13, 4, 0}
Node 6: Neighbors {11, 17}
Node 7: Neighbors {2, 1}
Node 8: Neighbors {13, 14, 18}
Node 9: Neighbors {5, 16}
Node 10: Neighbors {0, 3, 2}
Node 11: Neighbors {6, 4, 17}
Node 12: Neighbors {1}
Node 13: Neighbors {5, 8, 14}
Node 14: Neighbors {8, 13, 2, 16}
Node 15: Neighbors {19, 17}
Node 16: Neighbors {9, 14, 18, 4}
Node 17: Neighbors {11, 6, 15}
Node 18: Neighbors {8, 3, 16}
Node 19: Neighbors {0, 15, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [24], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 10, 3)>
<3, (10, 0, 19)>
<4, (5, 11, 1)>
<5, (9, 13, 4)>
<14, (8, 13, 16)>
<16, (9, 14, 18)>
