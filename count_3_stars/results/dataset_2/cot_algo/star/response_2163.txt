Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 2) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 10) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 10) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 8) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 4: {10, 11, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6, 11}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 8, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 12}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 12: {10, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 14: {0, 9, 12}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14

Total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 20 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 8, 14)>
- <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- <2, (0, 6, 11)>
- <3, (2, 11, 13)>
- <5, (0, 6, 13)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <7, (1, 3, 11)>
- <9, (1, 5, 14)>
- <11, (2, 6, 7)>
- <13, (0, 3, 4)>
- <14, (0, 9, 12)>
