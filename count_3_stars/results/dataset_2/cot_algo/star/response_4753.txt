Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 10) (13, 1) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 17) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 26) (15, 2) (15, 6) (15, 4) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 23) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 0) (7, 21) (7, 23) (21, 13) (21, 7) (21, 20) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 10) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 28) (26, 15) (26, 18) (26, 29) (26, 27) (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 29) (28, 3) (28, 19) (28, 11) (28, 18) (28, 10) (18, 26) (18, 28) (18, 24) (4, 15) (4, 9) (4, 25) (12, 23) (24, 18) (24, 17) (24, 14) (17, 3) (17, 24) (17, 5) (29, 26) (29, 11) (25, 9) (25, 4) (1, 13) (1, 11) (20, 21) (20, 5) (20, 16) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 28) (5, 17) (5, 20) (16, 20) (16, 14) (14, 9) (14, 24) (14, 16) (14, 27) (27, 26) (27, 14) (27, 23) (23, 6) (23, 7) (23, 12) (23, 27) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {9}
- Node 1: {11, 13}
- Node 2: {3, 8, 15, 19}
- Node 3: {2, 15, 17, 28}
- Node 4: {9, 15, 25}
- Node 5: {17, 20}
- Node 6: {9, 10, 15, 23}
- Node 7: {21, 23}
- Node 8: {2, 8, 10, 19}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 6, 14, 25}
- Node 10: {6, 8, 10, 13, 28}
- Node 11: {1, 28, 29}
- Node 12: {23}
- Node 13: {1, 10, 21}
- Node 14: {9, 16, 24, 27}
- Node 15: {2, 3, 4, 6, 26}
- Node 16: {14, 20}
- Node 17: {3, 5, 24}
- Node 18: {26, 28, 24}
- Node 19: {2, 8, 28}
- Node 20: {5, 16, 21}
- Node 21: {7, 13, 20}
- Node 23: {6, 7, 12, 27}
- Node 24: {14, 17, 18}
- Node 25: {4, 9}
- Node 26: {15, 18, 27, 29}
- Node 27: {14, 23, 26}
- Node 28: {3, 10, 11, 18, 19}
- Node 29: {11, 26}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, Node 9, Node 10, Node 14, Node 15, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19, Node 20, Node 21, Node 23, Node 24, Node 26, Node 27, and Node 28.

For each of these nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
