Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 38

Therefore, the final answer is [38].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>
