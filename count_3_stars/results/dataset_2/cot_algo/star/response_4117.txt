Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 27) (13, 22) (13, 3) (13, 9) (22, 11) (22, 13) (22, 7) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 19) (17, 16) (17, 15) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 18) (21, 7) (21, 10) (23, 20) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 25) (3, 20) (3, 4) (25, 3) (25, 27) (1, 6) (1, 5) (26, 11) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 29) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 20) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 15) (24, 26) (24, 19) (24, 10) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 28) (8, 15) (8, 6) (19, 14) (19, 24) (19, 8) (19, 9) (27, 16) (27, 25) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 29) (5, 1) (5, 26) (5, 2) (0, 2) (10, 21) (10, 24) (28, 8) (28, 9) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 28) (9, 2) (20, 23) (20, 3) (20, 4) (20, 12) (12, 20) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 8) (29, 26) (29, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 9, 16}
- Node 3: {4, 13, 14, 20, 25}
- Node 4: {3, 11, 18, 20}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 26}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 14, 29}
- Node 7: {18, 21, 22}
- Node 8: {6, 14, 15, 19, 28}
- Node 9: {2, 13, 19, 28}
- Node 10: {21, 24}
- Node 11: {4, 16, 22, 26}
- Node 12: {20}
- Node 13: {3, 9, 22}
- Node 14: {3, 6, 8, 19}
- Node 15: {8, 17, 18}
- Node 16: {2, 11, 17, 27}
- Node 17: {15, 16}
- Node 18: {4, 7, 15}
- Node 19: {8, 9, 14, 24}
- Node 20: {3, 4, 12, 23}
- Node 21: {7, 10}
- Node 22: {7, 11, 13}
- Node 23: {20}
- Node 24: {10, 19, 26}
- Node 25: {3, 27}
- Node 26: {5, 11, 24, 29}
- Node 27: {16, 25}
- Node 28: {8, 9}
- Node 29: {6, 26}

Node 0 does not have at least 3 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star. 

Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (5, 6)>

Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (5, 16, 9)>

Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (4, 13, 25)>

Node 4 forms two 3-stars: <4, (3, 20, 18)> and <4, (11, 20, 18)>

Node 5 does not form a 3-star because it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (8, 14, 29)>

Node 7 does not form a 3-star because it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (14, 15, 19)>

Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (13, 19, 28)>

Node 10 does not form a 3-star because it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (16, 22, 26)>

Node 12 does not form a 3-star because it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 13 does not form a 3-star because it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 14 does not form a 3-star because it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (17, 18, 8)>

Node 16 forms a 3-star: <16, (2, 17, 27)>

Node 17 does not form a 3-star because it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 18 does not form a 3-star because it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 19 does not form a 3-star because it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 20 does not form a 3-star because it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 21 does not form a 3-star because it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 22 does not form a 3-star because it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 23 does not form a 3-star because it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 24 does not form a 3-star because it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 25 does not form a 3-star because it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 26 forms a 3-star: <26, (5, 11, 29)>

Node 27 does not form a 3-star because it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 28 does not form a 3-star because it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 29 does not form a 3-star because it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get a final count of [11].
