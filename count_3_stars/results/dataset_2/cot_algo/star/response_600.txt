Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 10) (15, 26) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 28) (27, 9) (27, 13) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 27) (9, 6) (9, 23) (18, 20) (18, 28) (22, 1) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (17, 3) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 8) (29, 17) (29, 7) (29, 13) (29, 5) (29, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 15) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 16) (26, 15) (26, 24) (26, 12) (28, 27) (28, 6) (28, 18) (28, 2) (1, 22) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 7) (24, 26) (24, 19) (24, 2) (10, 15) (10, 3) (11, 29) (11, 23) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 2) (23, 20) (23, 12) (7, 29) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 13) (13, 27) (13, 29) (13, 7) (13, 21) (21, 13) (2, 14) (2, 28) (2, 24) (2, 23) (12, 3) (12, 26) (12, 23) (20, 18) (20, 23) (8, 3) (8, 17) (16, 14) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 5) (19, 24) (19, 7) (19, 16) (5, 29) (5, 16) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 14}
- Node 1: {7, 16, 17, 22}
- Node 2: {14, 23, 24, 28}
- Node 3: {8, 10, 12, 17}
- Node 5: {16, 29}
- Node 6: {0, 9, 14, 28}
- Node 7: {1, 13, 19, 29}
- Node 8: {3, 17}
- Node 9: {6, 9, 23, 27}
- Node 10: {3, 15}
- Node 11: {23, 29}
- Node 12: {3, 23, 26}
- Node 13: {7, 13, 21, 27, 29}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 6, 15, 16}
- Node 15: {10, 14, 26, 27}
- Node 16: {1, 5, 14, 19}
- Node 17: {1, 3, 8, 29}
- Node 18: {20, 28}
- Node 19: {7, 16, 24}
- Node 20: {18, 23}
- Node 21: {13}
- Node 22: {1}
- Node 23: {9, 12, 20, 23}
- Node 24: {2, 19, 26}
- Node 26: {12, 15, 24}
- Node 27: {9, 13, 15, 27, 28}
- Node 28: {2, 6, 18, 27}
- Node 29: {7, 11, 13, 17, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 74

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [74].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (7, 16, 17)>
- <2, (14, 23, 28)>
- <3, (8, 10, 17)>
- <6, (0, 9, 14)>
- <7, (1, 13, 29)>
- <9, (6, 23, 27)>
- <13, (7, 13, 29)>
- <14, (2, 6, 15)>
- <15, (14, 26, 27)>
- <16, (5, 16, 29)>
- <17, (1, 3, 29)>
- <23, (9, 12, 20)>
- <24, (2, 19, 26)>
- <26, (12, 15, 24)>
- <27, (13, 15, 28)>
- <28, (6, 18, 27)>
- <29, (5, 7, 13)>
