Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}

Now, we need to identify the nodes that can form 3-stars. These are the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors. In this case, nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 can form 3-stars.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <7, (3, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 6)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>
