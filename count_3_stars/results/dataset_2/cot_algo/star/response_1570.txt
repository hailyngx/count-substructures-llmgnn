Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 4) (14, 15) (17, 0) (17, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 7) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 10) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 18) (11, 0) (11, 15) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 2) (15, 14) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 12) (18, 3) (18, 19) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 12) (7, 13) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 4) (16, 9) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 9) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 16) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 19) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 9) (9, 3) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can identify the 3-star graphs in this network. First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {17, 11, 9}, degree 3
- Node 1: Neighbors {8, 16, 2, 9}, degree 4
- Node 2: Neighbors {10, 1, 4}, degree 3
- Node 3: Neighbors {13, 10, 9, 18}, degree 4
- Node 4: Neighbors {14, 17, 16, 2}, degree 4
- Node 5: Neighbors {8, 12}, degree 2
- Node 6: Neighbors {10}, degree 1
- Node 7: Neighbors {13}, degree 1
- Node 8: Neighbors {13, 5, 16, 1}, degree 4
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 16, 1, 0}, degree 4
- Node 10: Neighbors {6, 3, 15, 2}, degree 4
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 15}, degree 2
- Node 12: Neighbors {5, 15, 19}, degree 3
- Node 13: Neighbors {8, 3, 19, 7}, degree 4
- Node 14: Neighbors {4, 15}, degree 2
- Node 15: Neighbors {14, 11, 10, 12}, degree 4
- Node 16: Neighbors {8, 1, 4, 9}, degree 4
- Node 17: Neighbors {0, 4}, degree 2
- Node 18: Neighbors {3, 19}, degree 2
- Node 19: Neighbors {13, 18, 12}, degree 3

Now, let's count the number of 3-star graphs:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [10].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (17, 11, 9)>
- <1, (8, 16, 2)>
- <2, (10, 1, 4)>
- <3, (13, 10, 9)>
- <4, (14, 17, 16)>
- <12, (5, 15, 19)>
- <13, (8, 3, 19)>
- <15, (14, 11, 10)>
- <16, (8, 1, 4)>
- <19, (13, 18, 12)>
