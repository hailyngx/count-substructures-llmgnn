Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 11) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 24) (22, 25) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 24) (7, 21) (21, 13) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 20) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 9) (27, 25) (27, 1) (28, 21) (28, 10) (28, 25) (26, 13) (26, 5) (26, 17) (9, 12) (9, 24) (4, 25) (11, 13) (11, 6) (20, 21) (20, 8) (20, 2) (20, 5) (29, 23) (29, 14) (8, 20) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 6) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 0) (25, 22) (25, 27) (25, 28) (25, 4) (25, 2) (5, 26) (5, 20) (5, 8) (5, 18) (0, 3) (0, 19) (0, 16) (0, 17) (16, 0) (1, 27) (1, 14) (1, 18) (6, 11) (6, 8) (2, 20) (2, 25) (2, 14) (18, 13) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 10) (14, 29) (14, 1) (14, 2) (24, 22) (24, 15) (24, 9) (10, 28) (10, 18) (10, 23) (17, 26) (17, 8) (17, 0) (23, 29) (23, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

- Node 0: {3, 19, 16, 17}
- Node 1: {27, 14, 18}
- Node 2: {20, 25, 14}
- Node 3: {15, 0, 12}
- Node 4: {25}
- Node 5: {26, 20, 8, 18}
- Node 6: {11, 8}
- Node 7: {21}
- Node 8: {20, 5, 6, 17, 19}
- Node 9: {12, 24}
- Node 10: {28, 18, 23}
- Node 11: {13, 6}
- Node 12: {3, 15, 9}
- Node 13: {22, 26, 21, 11, 18}
- Node 14: {29, 1, 2}
- Node 15: {3, 19, 12, 24}
- Node 16: {0}
- Node 17: {26, 8, 0}
- Node 18: {13, 5, 1, 10, 18}
- Node 19: {15, 8, 0}
- Node 20: {21, 5, 8, 2}
- Node 21: {13, 7, 28, 20}
- Node 22: {13, 24, 25}
- Node 23: {29, 10}
- Node 24: {22, 15, 9}
- Node 25: {27, 28, 2, 4, 22}
- Node 26: {13, 5, 17}
- Node 27: {25, 1}
- Node 28: {21, 25, 10}
- Node 29: {23, 14}

Now, let's identify the 3-star formations:

- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes {22, 26, 21}.
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes {13, 5, 1}.
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes {27, 28, 2}.

Combining these, we have a total of 3 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [3].
