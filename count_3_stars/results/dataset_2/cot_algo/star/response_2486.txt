Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 14) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 7) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 12) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 14) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {4, 12}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 12}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 9, 12}
- Node 7: {3, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {6, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 5, 11}
- Node 11: {2, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 13: {2, 5, 8, 14}
- Node 14: {7, 8, 9, 11, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 2: There are 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: There are 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: There are 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 12: There are 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 13: There are 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 14: There are 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 48

So, the final answer is: [48]

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (5, 8, 13)>
<2, (6, 12, 13)>
<2, (6, 8, 13)>
<5, (8, 10, 13)>
<8, (11, 13, 14)>
<8, (13, 14, 11)>
<12, (6, 9, 12)>
<12, (6, 12, 9)>
<13, (8, 14, 13)>
<13, (13, 14, 8)>
<14, (8, 11, 14)>
<14, (8, 14, 11)>
