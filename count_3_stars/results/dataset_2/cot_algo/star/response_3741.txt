Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 23) (5, 10) (9, 18) (9, 2) (3, 17) (3, 20) (3, 8) (15, 1) (15, 26) (18, 9) (18, 26) (18, 0) (18, 29) (22, 14) (22, 11) (22, 24) (22, 1) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 10) (27, 12) (27, 29) (0, 18) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 19) (20, 3) (20, 0) (20, 7) (20, 13) (6, 28) (6, 16) (28, 6) (28, 14) (28, 2) (13, 20) (13, 4) (13, 11) (26, 15) (26, 18) (26, 25) (16, 6) (16, 24) (16, 25) (1, 15) (1, 22) (1, 19) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 24) (8, 21) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 7) (29, 18) (29, 27) (29, 11) (4, 12) (4, 13) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 28) (2, 23) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 8) (23, 5) (23, 2) (23, 10) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 7) (7, 20) (7, 17) (7, 14) (21, 8) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 25) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 23) (11, 22) (11, 13) (11, 29) (25, 26) (25, 16) (25, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 18, 20, 17, 19
- Node 1: 15, 22, 19, 8
- Node 2: 5, 9, 28, 23
- Node 3: 17, 20, 8
- Node 4: 12, 13
- Node 5: 2, 23, 10
- Node 6: 28, 16
- Node 7: 20, 17, 14
- Node 8: 3, 1, 24, 21
- Node 9: 18, 2
- Node 10: 5, 12, 23
- Node 11: 22, 13, 29
- Node 12: 4, 27, 10
- Node 13: 20, 4, 11
- Node 14: 22, 28, 7
- Node 15: 1, 26
- Node 16: 6, 24, 25
- Node 17: 3, 0, 7
- Node 18: 9, 26, 0, 29
- Node 19: 0, 1, 25
- Node 20: 3, 0, 13, 7
- Node 21: 8
- Node 22: 14, 11, 24, 1
- Node 23: 5, 2, 10
- Node 24: 22, 16, 8
- Node 25: 26, 16, 19
- Node 26: 15, 18, 25
- Node 27: 12, 29
- Node 28: 6, 14, 2
- Node 29: 18, 27, 11

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4+4+4+1+1+4+1+1+1+1+1+1+4+1+4+4+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 31 

Therefore, the final answer is [31]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 18, 20, 17>, <0, 18, 20, 19>, <0, 17, 20, 7>, <0, 18, 29, 27>, <1, 15, 26, 18>, <1, 15, 26, 25>, <1, 22, 14, 28>, <1, 22, 14, 7>, <1, 22, 24, 16>, <1, 8, 24, 21>, <2, 5, 23, 10>, <2, 5, 23, 28>, <2, 5, 23, 2>, <2, 9, 28, 14>, <2, 9, 28, 16>, <2, 9, 28, 2>, <3, 17, 20, 7>, <4, 12, 27, 29>, <6, 28, 14, 7>, <8, 3, 17, 0>, <8, 3, 17, 7>, <8, 3, 20, 13>, <8, 1, 22, 24>, <10, 5, 23, 12>, <11, 22, 14, 28>, <11, 22, 14, 7>, <12, 4, 13, 11>, <16, 6, 28, 14>, <19, 0, 18, 26>, <20, 3, 17, 0>, <20, 3, 17, 7>
