Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 20) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 10) (22, 3) (2, 24) (2, 14) (29, 7) (29, 24) (14, 2) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 27) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 1) (27, 17) (27, 12) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 25) (8, 26) (18, 26) (18, 28) (6, 12) (6, 28) (6, 21) (28, 18) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 0) (28, 24) (23, 5) (23, 7) (23, 10) (10, 22) (10, 17) (10, 23) (10, 7) (26, 8) (26, 18) (26, 28) (26, 16) (0, 28) (0, 7) (7, 29) (7, 23) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 15) (3, 22) (3, 21) (3, 19) (21, 6) (21, 3) (21, 19) (11, 5) (11, 25) (19, 3) (19, 21) (19, 25) (19, 16) (16, 4) (16, 26) (16, 19) (16, 20) (1, 12) (1, 20) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 23) (5, 11) (9, 13) (9, 25) (9, 20) (25, 4) (25, 11) (25, 19) (25, 9) (25, 15) (20, 13) (20, 16) (20, 1) (20, 9) (15, 7) (15, 25) (24, 2) (24, 29) (24, 28) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {28, 7}
Node 1: {20, 12}
Node 2: {24, 14}
Node 3: {22, 21, 19}
Node 4: {5, 16, 25}
Node 5: {17, 23, 11, 4}
Node 6: {12, 28, 21}
Node 7: {0, 29, 10, 15, 23}
Node 8: {26}
Node 9: {13, 25, 20}
Node 10: {22, 17, 23, 7}
Node 11: {5, 25}
Node 12: {27, 6, 1}
Node 13: {22, 20, 9}
Node 14: {2}
Node 15: {7, 25}
Node 16: {4, 26, 19, 20}
Node 17: {5, 23, 27}
Node 18: {26, 28}
Node 19: {3, 21, 25, 16}
Node 20: {13, 16, 1, 9}
Node 21: {3, 6, 19}
Node 22: {13, 10, 3}
Node 23: {5, 7, 10}
Node 24: {28, 2, 29}
Node 25: {4, 11, 19, 9, 15}
Node 26: {8, 16, 28}
Node 27: {17, 12}
Node 28: {6, 18, 24, 0, 26}
Node 29: {7, 24}

Nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 10, Node 12, Node 13, Node 16, Node 17, Node 19, Node 20, Node 21, Node 22, Node 23, Node 25, Node 26, Node 27, Node 28

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of the above nodes:

Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 61

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [61].
