Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 10) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 15) (7, 13) (6, 14) (6, 18) (6, 11) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 17) (8, 16) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 16) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 13) (1, 0) (1, 15) (1, 19) (15, 4) (15, 1) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 0) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 19) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 12) (16, 18) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 16) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {11, 13, 18, 1}
Node 1: {0, 15, 19}
Node 2: {17, 12, 13}
Node 3: {11, 10, 16}
Node 4: {17, 15, 19}
Node 5: {9, 11, 10}
Node 6: {14, 18, 11}
Node 7: {13}
Node 8: {17, 16}
Node 9: {5, 14}
Node 10: {5, 14, 3}
Node 11: {5, 6, 3, 0}
Node 12: {14, 2, 16, 19}
Node 13: {7, 2, 0}
Node 14: {9, 6, 12, 10}
Node 15: {4, 1}
Node 16: {8, 3, 12, 18}
Node 17: {8, 4, 2}
Node 18: {6, 0, 16}
Node 19: {4, 1, 12}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:

Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.

Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.

Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.

Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <11, (5, 6, 3)>, <11, (5, 6, 0)>, <11, (5, 3, 0)>, <11, (6, 3, 0)>.

Adding them up, we get a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
