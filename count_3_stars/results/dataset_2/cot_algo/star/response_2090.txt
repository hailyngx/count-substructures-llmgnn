Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (14, 6) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 10) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {7, 10, 11, 4, 8}
Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 10}
Node 2: {7, 11, 12, 13}
Node 3: {1, 6, 8, 9}
Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 9, 10}
Node 5: {1, 4, 6, 13}
Node 6: {3, 5, 12, 14}
Node 7: {0, 2, 8, 13}
Node 8: {0, 3, 7, 11}
Node 9: {3, 4, 12, 13}
Node 10: {0, 1, 4, 12}
Node 11: {0, 2, 8}
Node 12: {2, 6, 9, 10, 13}
Node 13: {2, 5, 7, 9, 12}
Node 14: {6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars. 

Node 0, Node 4, Node 12, and Node 13 each have 5 neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them:

For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Now, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the final answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 10, 12)>
<0, (4, 10, 13)>
<1, (4, 10, 12)>
<1, (4, 10, 13)>
<4, (0, 10, 12)>
<4, (0, 10, 13)>
<12, (0, 4, 10)>
<12, (0, 4, 13)>
<13, (0, 4, 10)>
<13, (0, 4, 12)>
