Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 29) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 25) (19, 26) (19, 27) (26, 19) (26, 22) (26, 12) (21, 13) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 6) (28, 14) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 11) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 24) (22, 12) (22, 3) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 28) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (17, 29) (29, 13) (29, 17) (29, 27) (18, 27) (18, 25) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 24) (5, 10) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 25) (1, 6) (1, 20) (1, 16) (7, 10) (7, 20) (7, 23) (16, 1) (16, 25) (16, 15) (4, 22) (4, 5) (4, 11) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 4) (12, 2) (12, 26) (12, 22) (12, 14) (15, 2) (15, 16) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 27) (20, 23) (27, 19) (27, 29) (27, 18) (27, 20) (9, 0) (9, 3) (24, 22) (24, 5) (25, 2) (25, 0) (25, 18) (25, 10) (25, 16) (23, 7) (23, 20) (3, 22) (3, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 14, 25}
- Node 1: {6, 16, 20}
- Node 2: {12, 14, 15, 25}
- Node 3: {9, 22}
- Node 4: {5, 11, 14, 22}
- Node 5: {4, 10, 13, 24}
- Node 6: {1, 11, 13, 28}
- Node 7: {10, 20, 23}
- Node 8: {13}
- Node 9: {0, 3}
- Node 10: {5, 7, 25}
- Node 11: {4, 6, 14}
- Node 12: {2, 14, 22, 26}
- Node 13: {5, 6, 8, 21, 29}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 4, 11, 12, 28}
- Node 15: {2, 16}
- Node 16: {1, 15, 25}
- Node 17: {29}
- Node 18: {25, 27}
- Node 19: {26, 27}
- Node 20: {1, 7, 23, 27}
- Node 21: {13, 28}
- Node 22: {3, 4, 12, 24, 26}
- Node 23: {7, 20}
- Node 24: {5, 22}
- Node 25: {0, 2, 10, 16, 18}
- Node 26: {12, 19, 22, 27}
- Node 27: {18, 19, 20, 26, 29}
- Node 28: {6, 14, 21}
- Node 29: {13, 17, 27}

Now, let's find the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 8, 17, 18, 21, 24, 28
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 9, 15, 20
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 10, 16
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 11

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 9 3-stars each
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 4 3-stars each
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 1 3-star each
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: 1 3-star each

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [87].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, 9, 25>
- <3, 9, 22>
- <7, 10, 20>
- <8, 13, 21>
- <17, 27, 29>
- <18, 25, 27>
- <21, 13, 28>
- <24, 5, 22>
- <28, 14, 21>
- <1, 16, 20>
- <5, 4, 24>
- <9, 3, 22>
- <10, 5, 25>
- <16, 1, 15>
- <2, 12, 26>
- <4, 22, 12>
- <6, 6, 28>
- <11, 4, 14>
