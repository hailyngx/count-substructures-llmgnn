Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 11, 12, 13, 2}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 11}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 10: {2, 8, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 8, 1}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 6, 11}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 6, 10}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 6 and Node 11 have 5 neighbors each, which forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 and Node 8 have 6 neighbors each, which forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 and Node 12 have 3 neighbors each, which is not enough to form any 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 20 = 30 \), so the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
