Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 24) (11, 28) (11, 13) (11, 20) (28, 11) (28, 8) (28, 20) (8, 28) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 1) (19, 7) (19, 22) (19, 4) (19, 27) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 21) (4, 29) (16, 9) (16, 20) (21, 4) (21, 18) (21, 22) (21, 15) (5, 4) (5, 26) (5, 23) (5, 27) (26, 5) (26, 2) (1, 8) (1, 20) (1, 22) (6, 8) (10, 2) (10, 25) (10, 29) (22, 19) (22, 21) (22, 1) (22, 14) (3, 17) (3, 27) (3, 13) (17, 7) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 18) (23, 5) (23, 25) (15, 21) (14, 22) (14, 18) (20, 11) (20, 28) (20, 16) (20, 1) (2, 26) (2, 10) (2, 27) (18, 21) (18, 17) (18, 14) (24, 12) (24, 13) (24, 25) (27, 19) (27, 5) (27, 3) (27, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 24) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 29) (0, 9) (29, 4) (29, 10) (29, 0) (25, 10) (25, 23) (25, 24) (9, 16) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: [9, 13, 29]
- Node 1: [8, 20, 22]
- Node 2: [10, 26, 27]
- Node 3: [13, 17, 27]
- Node 4: [5, 19, 21, 29]
- Node 5: [4, 5, 23, 26, 27]
- Node 6: [8]
- Node 7: [12, 17, 19]
- Node 8: [1, 6, 17, 28]
- Node 9: [0, 16]
- Node 10: [2, 25, 29]
- Node 11: [13, 20, 28]
- Node 12: [7, 24]
- Node 13: [0, 3, 11, 24]
- Node 14: [18, 22]
- Node 15: [21]
- Node 16: [9, 20]
- Node 17: [3, 7, 8, 18]
- Node 18: [14, 17, 21]
- Node 19: [4, 7, 22, 27]
- Node 20: [1, 11, 16, 28]
- Node 21: [4, 15, 18, 22]
- Node 22: [1, 14, 19, 21]
- Node 23: [5, 25]
- Node 24: [12, 13, 25]
- Node 25: [10, 23, 24]
- Node 26: [2, 5]
- Node 27: [2, 3, 4, 5, 19]
- Node 28: [8, 11, 20]
- Node 29: [0, 4, 10]

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 4 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: {5, 21, 29}, {5, 22, 29}, {5, 21, 22}, {21, 22, 29}
Node 5 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: {4, 21, 27}, {4, 26, 27}, {4, 5, 26}, {4, 5, 27}, {21, 22, 29}, {21, 22, 21}, {21, 5, 22}, {21, 5, 22}, {22, 5, 29}, {21, 5, 29}
Node 9 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 13 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: {0, 24, 29}, {3, 11, 13}, {3, 17, 27}, {11, 13, 24}
Node 19 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: {7, 22, 27}, {21, 22, 27}, {21, 19, 27}, {21, 19, 22}
Node 22 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: {1, 21, 22}, {4, 21, 22}, {14, 18, 22}, {18, 21, 22}
Node 27 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: {2, 5, 27}, {3, 17, 27}, {4, 5, 27}, {19, 22, 27}, {19, 21, 27}, {21, 22, 27}, {21, 4, 27}, {21, 5, 27}, {22, 4, 27}, {22, 19, 27}
Node 29 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: {0, 4, 10}

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 33.
Therefore, the final answer is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, 21, 29>, <5, 22, 29>, <5, 21, 22>, <21, 22, 29>, <4, 21, 27>, <4, 26, 27>, <4, 5, 26>, <4, 5, 27>, <21, 22, 29>, <21, 22, 21>, <21, 5, 22>, <21, 5, 22>, <22, 5, 29>, <21, 5, 29>, <0, 24, 29>, <3, 11, 13>, <3, 17, 27>, <11, 13, 24>, <7, 22, 27>, <21, 22, 27>, <21, 19, 27>, <21, 19, 22>, <1, 21, 22>, <4, 21, 22>, <14, 18, 22>, <18, 21, 22>, <2, 5, 27>, <3, 17, 27>, <4, 5, 27>, <19, 22, 27>, <19, 21, 27>, <21, 22, 27>, <21, 4, 27>, <21, 5, 27>, <22, 4, 27>, <22, 19, 27>, <0, 4, 10>.
