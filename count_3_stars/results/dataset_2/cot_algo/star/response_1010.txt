Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:

Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <13, (18, 20, 22)>, <13, (18, 20, 24)>, <13, (18, 22, 24)>, <13, (20, 22, 24)>
Node 15 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars. <15, (1, 7, 8)>, <15, (1, 7, 19)>, <15, (1, 7, 23)>, <15, (1, 8, 19)>, <15, (1, 8, 23)>, <15, (1, 19, 23)>, <15, (7, 8, 19)>, <15, (7, 8, 23)>, <15, (7, 19, 23)>, <15, (8, 19, 23)>, <15, (1, 2, 26)>, <15, (1, 2, 28)>, <15, (1, 26, 27)>, <15, (1, 26, 29)>, <15, (1, 28, 27)>, <15, (1, 28, 29)>, <15, (27, 29, 26)>, <15, (27, 29, 28)>, <15, (26, 28, 27)>, <15, (2, 28, 26)>
Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <21, (5, 10, 12)>, <21, (5, 10, 14)>, <21, (5, 12, 14)>, <21, (10, 12, 14)>
Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <26, (0, 2, 20)>, <26, (0, 2, 27)>, <26, (0, 20, 27)>, <26, (2, 20, 27)>
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars. <1, (15, 19, 25)>, <1, (15, 19, 29)>, <1, (15, 25, 29)>, <1, (19, 25, 29)>, <1, (8, 18, 15)>, <1, (8, 18, 23)>, <1, (8, 15, 23)>, <1, (18, 15, 23)>, <1, (15, 29, 19)>, <1, (29, 27, 15)>
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <9, (15, 29, 7)>
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <10, (12, 18, 21)>, <10, (12, 18, 23)>, <10, (12, 21, 23)>, <10, (18, 21, 23)>
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <12, (14, 5, 21)>, <12, (14, 5, 23)>, <12, (14, 21, 23)>, <12, (5, 21, 23)>
Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <14, (12, 5, 21)>, <14, (12, 5, 23)>, <14, (12, 21, 23)>, <14, (5, 21, 23)>
Node 15 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars. <15, (1, 7, 8)>, <15, (1, 7, 19)>, <15, (1, 7, 23)>, <15, (1, 8, 19)>, <15, (1, 8, 23)>, <15, (1, 19, 23)>, <15, (7, 8, 19)>, <15, (7, 8, 23)>, <15, (7, 19, 23)>, <15, (8, 19, 23)>, <15, (1, 2, 26)>, <15, (1, 2, 28)>, <15, (1, 26, 27)>, <15, (1, 26, 29)>, <15, (1, 28, 27)>, <15, (1, 28, 29)>, <15, (27, 29, 26)>, <15, (27, 29, 28)>, <15, (26, 28, 27)>, <15, (2, 28, 26)>
Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <18, (8, 13, 10)>
Node 29 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars. <29, (1, 7, 15)>, <29, (1, 7, 27)>, <29, (1, 15, 27)>, <29, (7, 15, 27)>, <29, (9, 2, 28)>, <29, (9, 2, 26)>, <29, (9, 28, 26)>, <29, (2, 28, 26)>, <29, (26, 27, 2)>, <29, (27, 28, 26)>
Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <20, (0, 13, 14)>, <20, (13, 18, 14)>, <20, (13, 18, 24)>, <20, (18, 14, 24)>

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 66.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [66].
