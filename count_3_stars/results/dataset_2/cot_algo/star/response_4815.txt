Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 3, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 9, 3, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 7, 0, 2, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 7, 8, 1, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 2, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 8, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9, 4, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 4, 1, 3, 6, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 2, 3, 7, 0}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 65. 

Therefore, the final answer is [65]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, 
<3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, 
<4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, 
<8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, 
<9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>.
