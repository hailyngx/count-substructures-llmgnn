Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 9) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 12) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 10) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 0) 

Response:
From the given information, we first construct the adjacency list for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 1, 2, 13, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {7, 3, 11, 0}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 8, 10, 0}
- Node 3: {1, 11, 13, 9}
- Node 4: {7, 2, 0, 14}
- Node 5: {7, 13, 2, 10}
- Node 6: {9, 11, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 6, 2, 14}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 12}
- Node 10: {5, 2, 0, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 12: {9, 13, 0}
- Node 13: {3, 5, 12, 14, 0}
- Node 14: {4, 8, 13, 10}

Now, we can identify the nodes that are part of any 3-stars. Nodes that have 3 or more neighbors can potentially form 3-stars. Let's denote the nodes with 3 or more neighbors as possible 3-star centers:

- Node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, and 14 are the possible 3-star centers.

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed within this graph. We need to consider how many nodes each potential center is connected to and apply the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars for each potential center. 

Calculating the 3-stars for each potential center:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 64

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [64].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 1, 2, 13>
- <0, 1, 3, 13>
- <0, 1, 10, 13>
- <0, 2, 5, 10>
- <0, 2, 8, 10>
- <0, 12, 13, 10>
- <1, 3, 6, 11>
- <4, 7, 5, 13>
- <4, 7, 8, 14>
- <4, 7, 2, 8>
- <4, 7, 2, 14>
- <4, 2, 5, 10>
- <5, 7, 8, 13>
- <5, 7, 2, 10>
- <8, 7, 6, 11>
- <13, 3, 9, 12>
- <13, 5, 10, 14>
- <13, 0, 12, 14>
