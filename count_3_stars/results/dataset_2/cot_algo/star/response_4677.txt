Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 12) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {4, 11, 5}
- Node 1: neighbors {4, 9, 5, 12}
- Node 2: neighbors {7, 11, 5, 12, 14}
- Node 3: neighbors {11, 5, 8, 14}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 10, 1}
- Node 5: neighbors {6, 2, 8, 1, 0, 3}
- Node 6: neighbors {5, 12, 13}
- Node 7: neighbors {12, 2, 13}
- Node 8: neighbors {9, 10, 11, 5, 3}
- Node 9: neighbors {8, 14, 10, 1}
- Node 10: neighbors {4, 9, 11, 8, 13}
- Node 11: neighbors {10, 3, 8, 0, 2}
- Node 12: neighbors {7, 6, 2, 1}
- Node 13: neighbors {7, 6, 10}
- Node 14: neighbors {9, 3, 2}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, (6, 0, 1)>
- <5, (6, 0, 3)>
- <5, (6, 1, 12)>
- <5, (6, 1, 2)>
- <5, (6, 12, 1)>
- <5, (6, 12, 2)>
- <5, (6, 13, 10)>
- <5, (6, 2, 12)>
- <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- <5, (0, 1, 12)>
- <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- <5, (0, 4, 10)>
- <8, (9, 3, 14)>
- <8, (9, 3, 2)>
- <8, (9, 14, 2)>
- <8, (9, 14, 3)>
- <8, (9, 2, 14)>
- <8, (9, 2, 3)>
- <8, (9, 10, 1)>
- <8, (9, 10, 4)>
- <8, (9, 1, 10)>
- <8, (9, 1, 5)>
- <8, (9, 4, 10)>
- <8, (9, 4, 1)>
- <8, (9, 10, 4)>
- <8, (9, 10, 13)>
- <8, (9, 13, 10)>
- <8, (2, 10, 11)>
- <8, (2, 10, 13)>
- <8, (2, 11, 10)>
- <8, (2, 11, 7)>
