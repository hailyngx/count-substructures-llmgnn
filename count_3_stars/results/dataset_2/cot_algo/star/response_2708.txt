Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 8) (14, 16) (14, 10) (17, 13) (1, 3) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 16) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 15) (12, 8) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 10) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (15, 12) (15, 10) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 15) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 11) (18, 9) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 2) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 2) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 4) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 11) (16, 14) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 13, 11, 2
- Node 1: 3, 19
- Node 2: 3, 7, 0, 11
- Node 3: 1, 0, 16, 2
- Node 4: 6, 19, 11
- Node 5: 13, 8, 10
- Node 6: 9, 4, 8
- Node 7: 13, 2, 19, 12
- Node 8: 14, 6, 12, 5
- Node 9: 6, 18, 16
- Node 10: 14, 5, 15
- Node 11: 4, 0, 2
- Node 12: 7, 15, 8
- Node 13: 17, 7, 5, 0
- Node 14: 8, 16, 10
- Node 15: 12, 10
- Node 16: 14, 3, 9
- Node 17: 13
- Node 18: 9
- Node 19: 1, 7, 4

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <0, (3, 13, 11)>, <0, (3, 13, 2)>, <0, (13, 11, 2)>, <0, (3, 11, 2)>
  
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <2, (3, 7, 0)>, <2, (3, 7, 11)>, <2, (3, 0, 11)>, <2, (7, 0, 11)>
  
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <3, (1, 0, 16)>, <3, (1, 2, 16)>, <3, (0, 2, 16)>, <3, (1, 2, 0)>
  
- Node 4: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 5: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 6: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <7, (13, 19, 2)>, <7, (13, 19, 12)>, <7, (13, 2, 12)>, <7, (19, 2, 12)> 

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <8, (6, 12, 5)>, <8, (6, 12, 8)>, <8, (6, 5, 8)>, <8, (12, 5, 8)> 

- Node 9: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 10: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
  <12, (7, 15, 8)>, <12, (7, 15, 10)>, <12, (7, 8, 10)>, <12, (15, 8, 10)>

- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
  <13, (7, 5, 0)>, <13, (7, 5, 10)>, <13, (7, 0, 10)>, <13, (5, 0, 10)>

- Node 14: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 16: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Now we sum up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [24].
