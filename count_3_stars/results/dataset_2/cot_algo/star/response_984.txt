Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighborhood of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 12, 2
Node 1 neighbors: 11, 4, 0
Node 2 neighbors: 4, 8, 7, 14, 11, 0
Node 3 neighbors: 9, 13, 12, 8, 4
Node 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 2, 13
Node 5 neighbors: 8, 7
Node 6 neighbors: 9, 7, 13
Node 7 neighbors: 6, 12, 11, 2, 5
Node 8 neighbors: 3, 4, 2, 5, 14
Node 9 neighbors: 6, 14, 3, 12
Node 10 neighbors: 12, 14
Node 11 neighbors: 1, 7, 2
Node 12 neighbors: 9, 3, 7, 10, 14, 0
Node 13 neighbors: 6, 3, 4
Node 14 neighbors: 9, 8, 12, 2, 10

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 forms 15 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 3 3-stars
- Node 7 forms 6 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 6 3-stars
- Node 12 forms 10 3-stars
- Node 14 forms 2 3-stars

Summing these up: 15 + 3 + 6 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 2 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of 46 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 8, 14)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (6, 11, 12)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 6, 14)>, <12, (7, 10, 14)>, <2, (7, 11, 14)>.

So, the final answer is [46].
