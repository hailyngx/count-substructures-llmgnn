Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 5) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 10) (17, 3) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 18) (2, 11) (2, 7) (18, 10) (18, 12) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 7) (5, 16) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 15) (19, 14) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 15) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 19) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 13) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 13) (3, 17) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can construct the following adjacency list for each node:

- Node 0: 11, 4, 13
- Node 1: 5, 6, 9, 4
- Node 2: 11, 7
- Node 3: 17, 9, 4
- Node 4: 1, 3, 0
- Node 5: 16, 14, 19, 15
- Node 6: 11, 1, 13
- Node 7: 2, 12, 19
- Node 9: 1, 3, 13
- Node 10: 17, 12, 18
- Node 11: 0, 16, 6, 12, 2
- Node 12: 11, 10, 18, 7
- Node 13: 6, 9, 0
- Node 14: 19, 5
- Node 15: 16, 5, 19
- Node 16: 11, 15, 5
- Node 17: 10, 3
- Node 18: 10, 12
- Node 19: 14, 7, 5, 15

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1, 5, and 19 have 4 neighbors each, so they each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Node 0, 6, 13, and 4 have 3 neighbors each, so they each form 1 3-star.

In total, there are \( 3*4 + 4*1 = 16 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [16], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 5, 15>
<1, 5, 19>
<1, 5, 16>
<1, 19, 7>
<5, 15, 19>
<5, 15, 16>
<5, 16, 11>
<5, 16, 15>
<1, 5, 14>
<1, 9, 3>
<1, 9, 13>
<5, 19, 14>
<5, 19, 7>
<5, 15, 16>
<1, 6, 13>
<0, 4, 13>
