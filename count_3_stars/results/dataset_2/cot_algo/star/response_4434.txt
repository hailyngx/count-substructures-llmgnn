Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 2, 7
- Node 1: 7, 6, 9, 0
- Node 2: 4, 8, 9, 0
- Node 3: 4, 0, 6, 9, 8
- Node 4: 2, 7, 3
- Node 5: 6, 0
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5, 0
- Node 7: 4, 0, 8, 1
- Node 8: 7, 3, 2, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 2, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9: <3, 0, 6>, <3, 0, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <1, 7, 4>, <3, 9, 1>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 8, 2>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 8, 7>, <8, 7, 4>, <1, 9, 2>, <1, 9, 3>, <1, 0, 7>, <1, 6, 5>, <6, 5, 0>, <6, 5, 3>, <6, 0, 1>, <6, 0, 3>, <6, 0, 5>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <9, 2, 4>, <9, 2, 8>, <9, 2, 3>, <9, 2, 1>, <9, 8, 7>, <9, 8, 3>
  
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 10 + 4 + 32 = 66. So, the final answer is [66].
