Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 12) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 14) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors - 9, 13, 2
- Node 1: Neighbors - 9, 3, 2, 5, 8
- Node 2: Neighbors - 1, 0, 7, 12, 13
- Node 3: Neighbors - 6, 1, 8
- Node 4: Neighbors - 6, 8, 13, 11
- Node 5: Neighbors - 1, 12
- Node 6: Neighbors - 7, 10, 3, 4
- Node 7: Neighbors - 6, 11, 14, 2
- Node 8: Neighbors - 1, 3, 4, 14, 10, 12
- Node 9: Neighbors - 11, 10, 1, 0
- Node 10: Neighbors - 6, 9, 8, 14
- Node 11: Neighbors - 9, 4, 7, 12
- Node 12: Neighbors - 8, 5, 2, 14, 11
- Node 13: Neighbors - 4, 0, 2
- Node 14: Neighbors - 8, 7, 12, 10

Calculating the 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors which is less than 3, so no 3-stars are formed.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 62

Therefore, the final answer is [62].
