Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 8) (15, 27) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 15) (27, 16) (27, 23) (25, 3) (25, 15) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 16) (26, 19) (26, 8) (26, 7) (19, 26) (19, 24) (19, 6) (19, 9) (24, 19) (24, 14) (24, 2) (7, 26) (7, 20) (7, 23) (7, 2) (13, 4) (13, 29) (13, 0) (17, 0) (17, 12) (4, 13) (4, 22) (4, 5) (12, 17) (12, 20) (6, 1) (6, 19) (6, 11) (22, 4) (22, 16) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 24) (14, 11) (14, 20) (21, 0) (21, 9) (21, 5) (21, 29) (2, 1) (2, 24) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 28) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 14) (0, 13) (0, 17) (0, 21) (9, 19) (9, 21) (9, 2) (9, 10) (16, 27) (16, 1) (16, 22) (16, 29) (18, 10) (18, 29) (5, 4) (5, 21) (5, 10) (29, 15) (29, 13) (29, 21) (29, 16) (29, 18) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 5) (10, 28) (8, 3) (8, 26) (28, 2) (28, 10) (23, 27) (23, 7) 

Response:
We need to determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:
1. Node 0: Neighbors {13, 17, 21}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {2, 6, 16}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {1, 7, 9, 24, 28}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {8, 25}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {5, 13, 22}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {4, 10, 21}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {1, 11, 19}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {2, 7, 20, 23}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {3, 26}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {2, 9, 19, 10, 21}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {5, 9, 18, 28}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {6, 14}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {17, 20}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {0, 4, 29}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {11, 20, 24}
16. Node 15: Neighbors {25, 27, 29}
17. Node 16: Neighbors {1, 22, 27, 29}
18. Node 17: Neighbors {0, 12}
19. Node 18: Neighbors {10, 29}
20. Node 19: Neighbors {6, 9, 24, 26}
21. Node 20: Neighbors {7, 12, 14}
22. Node 21: Neighbors {0, 5, 9, 29}
23. Node 23: Neighbors {7, 27}
24. Node 24: Neighbors {2, 14, 19}
25. Node 25: Neighbors {3, 15}
26. Node 26: Neighbors {8, 19, 7}
27. Node 27: Neighbors {15, 16, 23}
28. Node 28: Neighbors {2, 10}
29. Node 29: Neighbors {13, 15, 16, 18, 21}

Now we'll check each node that has three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 0, Node 21, and Node 29 have exactly 3 neighbors, so each forms 1 3-star.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from Node 0) + 1 (from Node 21) + 1 (from Node 29) = 3

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 13, 21>
<21, 5, 29>
<21, 9, 29>
