Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, and Node 9 each have 6 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 20 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 68 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [68], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>
