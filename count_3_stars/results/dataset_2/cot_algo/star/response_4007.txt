Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 12) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 1) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 3) 

Response:
First, we need to find the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges. Then, we will determine the number of 3-stars in the graph.

1. Node 0: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 10, 14}.
2. Node 1: Neighbors {2, 9, 12, 13}.
3. Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 10}.
4. Node 3: Neighbors {2, 6, 7, 12, 14}.
5. Node 4: Neighbors {6, 8, 10, 11, 14}.
6. Node 5: Neighbors {0, 8, 9, 13}.
7. Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 12}.
8. Node 7: Neighbors {3, 12, 13}.
9. Node 8: Neighbors {4, 5, 9, 11}.
10. Node 9: Neighbors {1, 5, 8, 14}.
11. Node 10: Neighbors {0, 2, 4}.
12. Node 11: Neighbors {4, 8, 12}.
13. Node 12: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7, 11}.
14. Node 14: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 9}.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 5: \binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 8: \binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 9: \binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 12: \binom{5}{3} = 10$
- Node 14: \binom{4}{3} = 4$

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 26.

Therefore, there are 26 3-stars in the given graph. Putting this number inside brackets gives us the final answer: [26].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, 8, 9, 14>, <5, 9, 13, 1>, <5, 8, 4, 11>, <8, 4, 10, 0>, <8, 4, 11, 12>, <9, 5, 13, 1>, <9, 8, 4, 11>, <9, 8, 11, 12>, <12, 1, 2, 3>, <12, 6, 0, 3>, <14, 0, 3, 6>, <14, 4, 11, 12>.
