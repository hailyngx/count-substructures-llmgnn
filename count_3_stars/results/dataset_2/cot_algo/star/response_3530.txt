Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (16, 19) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 17) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 12) (10, 4) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 13) (2, 1) (2, 13) (18, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 19) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 8) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 7) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 14) (19, 16) (19, 9) (19, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 14) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 9, 12, 17}
- Node 2: {1, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 13, 14, 15}
- Node 4: {0, 10, 18}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 17}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 19}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 7, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 12, 15, 19}
- Node 10: {4}
- Node 11: {14}
- Node 12: {1, 9, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 7, 13, 15, 17}
- Node 14: {3, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 15: {3, 9, 13}
- Node 16: {19}
- Node 17: {1, 5, 13}
- Node 18: {4}
- Node 19: {6, 9, 16}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 9, 17)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 13, 15)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 17)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 6, 13)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 12, 15)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (3, 7, 15)>, <13, (1, 2, 17)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
