Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, we will create the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

As we found 20 3-stars from node 0 and 10 3-stars from nodes 2 and 3 each, the total number of 3-stars is [20 + 10 + 10] = [40]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (6, 7, 5)>
