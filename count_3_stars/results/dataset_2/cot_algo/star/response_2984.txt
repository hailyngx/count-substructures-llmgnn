Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 6) (16, 28) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 15) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 13) (1, 26) (1, 2) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 22) (26, 1) (26, 10) (26, 27) (26, 4) (21, 8) (21, 18) (28, 16) (28, 13) (28, 23) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 25) (5, 4) (13, 15) (13, 28) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 18) (25, 5) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 2) (27, 26) (27, 25) (27, 23) (19, 14) (19, 12) (22, 17) (22, 14) (22, 0) (29, 10) (29, 25) (29, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 25) (7, 15) (7, 29) (7, 9) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 22) (14, 6) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 14) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 9) (20, 18) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 26) (4, 5) (0, 22) (0, 12) (0, 8) (18, 21) (18, 13) (18, 20) (23, 28) (23, 27) (8, 11) (8, 21) (8, 12) (8, 0) 

Response:
The graph contains 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's analyze the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {22, 12, 8}
Node 1: Neighbors {26, 2}
Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 25}
Node 3: Neighbors {16, 15, 14, 6}
Node 4: Neighbors {26, 5}
Node 5: Neighbors {13, 2, 25, 4}
Node 6: Neighbors {11, 3, 14}
Node 7: Neighbors {15, 29, 9}
Node 8: Neighbors {11, 21, 12, 0}
Node 9: Neighbors {16, 7, 12}
Node 10: Neighbors {17, 26, 29}
Node 11: Neighbors {8, 6}
Node 12: Neighbors {13, 19, 0, 8, 9}
Node 13: Neighbors {15, 28, 5, 18, 12}
Node 14: Neighbors {3, 19, 22, 6}
Node 15: Neighbors {16, 3, 7, 13}
Node 16: Neighbors {3, 28, 9, 15}
Node 17: Neighbors {10, 22}
Node 18: Neighbors {21, 13, 20}
Node 19: Neighbors {14, 12}
Node 20: Neighbors {18}
Node 21: Neighbors {8, 18}
Node 22: Neighbors {17, 14, 0}
Node 23: Neighbors {28, 27}
Node 25: Neighbors {5, 27, 29}
Node 26: Neighbors {1, 10, 27, 4}
Node 27: Neighbors {26, 25, 23}
Node 28: Neighbors {16, 13, 23}
Node 29: Neighbors {10, 25, 7}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes forming 3-stars:
- Node 2 (with 3 neighbors): \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5 (with 4 neighbors): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8 (with 4 neighbors): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12 (with 5 neighbors): \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13 (with 5 neighbors): \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15 (with 4 neighbors): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16 (with 4 neighbors): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25 (with 4 neighbors): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26 (with 4 neighbors): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].

Unique 3-stars:
- <2, (1, 5, 25)>
- <5, (2, 13, 25)>
- <8, (11, 12, 21)>
- <12, (9, 13, 19)>
- <13, (3, 15, 28)>
- <15, (3, 13, 16)>
- <16, (3, 15, 28)>
- <25, (2, 5, 27)>
- <26, (4, 10, 27)>
