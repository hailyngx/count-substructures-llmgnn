Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 22) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 6) (7, 21) (7, 26) (7, 5) (7, 17) (21, 7) (21, 12) (21, 25) (12, 21) (27, 14) (27, 9) (27, 13) (5, 7) (5, 18) (5, 22) (6, 16) (24, 22) (24, 2) (26, 7) (26, 8) (26, 4) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 20) (17, 25) (20, 17) (20, 8) (20, 4) (20, 10) (10, 20) (10, 9) (15, 9) (2, 16) (2, 24) (2, 22) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 24) (22, 2) (22, 0) (25, 21) (25, 17) (25, 29) (0, 22) (0, 3) (0, 23) (3, 0) (3, 23) (3, 29) (3, 18) (1, 28) (1, 4) (14, 27) (14, 19) (9, 11) (9, 27) (9, 10) (9, 15) (9, 23) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 28) (8, 26) (8, 20) (8, 29) (4, 26) (4, 20) (4, 1) (4, 13) (13, 27) (13, 4) (13, 29) (29, 25) (29, 3) (29, 8) (29, 13) (28, 1) (28, 18) (23, 0) (23, 3) (23, 9) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will follow the steps to find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Step 1: Create an adjacency list from the given edges:
- Node 0: {22, 3, 23}
- Node 1: {28, 4}
- Node 2: {16, 24, 22}
- Node 3: {0, 23, 18, 29}
- Node 4: {26, 20, 1, 13}
- Node 5: {7, 18, 22}
- Node 6: {16}
- Node 7: {21, 26, 5, 17}
- Node 8: {26, 20, 29}
- Node 9: {11, 27, 10, 15, 23}
- Node 10: {20, 9}
- Node 11: {16, 9, 17}
- Node 12: {21}
- Node 13: {27, 4, 29}
- Node 14: {27, 19}
- Node 15: {9}
- Node 16: {11, 22, 2, 19}
- Node 17: {11, 7, 20, 25}
- Node 18: {5, 3, 28}
- Node 19: {16, 14}
- Node 20: {17, 8, 4, 10}
- Node 21: {7, 12, 25}
- Node 22: {16, 5, 24, 2, 0}
- Node 23: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 24: {22, 2}
- Node 25: {21, 17, 29}
- Node 26: {7, 8, 4}
- Node 27: {14, 9, 13}
- Node 28: {1, 18}
- Node 29: {25, 3, 8, 13}

Step 2: Identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Nodes: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 16, 17, 20, 22, 25, 26, 29

Step 3: Calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
Total number of 3-stars: [26]

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (0, 18, 23)>
<4, (1, 13, 29)>
<5, (7, 17, 21)>
<7, (17, 20, 25)>
<9, (11, 15, 23)>
<11, (9, 16, 17)>
<16, (2, 19, 22)>
<17, (7, 20, 25)>
<20, (4, 10, 17)>
<22, (0, 2, 24)>
<25, (17, 21, 29)>
<26, (4, 7, 8)>
<29, (13, 25, 3)>
