Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 2, 3, 1}
- Node 1: {9, 4, 7, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 8, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 0}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 0, 1}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 2, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 1, 7}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 38 3-stars, so the final answer is [38].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 2)>
<0, (4, 6, 1)>
<0, (4, 2, 3)>
<0, (4, 3, 1)>
<0, (6, 2, 3)>
<1, (9, 7, 8)>
<1, (9, 7, 4)>
<1, (9, 7, 1)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 1)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<8, (7, 2, 3)>
<8, (7, 2, 1)>
<8, (4, 2, 1)>
<8, (4, 2, 3)>
<8, (4, 3, 1)>
<9, (6, 1, 2)>
<9, (6, 1, 7)>
<9, (6, 2, 5)>
<9, (2, 5, 3)>
