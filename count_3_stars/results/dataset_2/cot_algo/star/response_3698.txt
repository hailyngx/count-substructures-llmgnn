Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 9) (16, 18) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 6) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 0) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 13) (17, 3) (17, 14) (17, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 5) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 13) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 13) (9, 11) (9, 0) (18, 16) (18, 1) (18, 8) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 18) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 19) (1, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: {1, 7, 9, 15}
- Node 1: {0, 14, 18, 19}
- Node 2: {10, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {6, 10, 15, 17}
- Node 4: {7, 12}
- Node 5: {6, 12, 17, 19}
- Node 6: {3, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 4}
- Node 8: {10, 14, 18}
- Node 9: {0, 11}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 8, 11}
- Node 11: {9, 10}
- Node 12: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 13: {2, 14, 19}
- Node 14: {1, 8, 13, 17}
- Node 15: {0, 3, 16}
- Node 16: {15, 18}
- Node 17: {3, 5, 14}
- Node 18: {1, 8, 16}
- Node 19: {1, 5, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (forming a 3-star):

- Node 2: {10, 12, 13} -> <2, (10, 12, 13)>
- Node 5: {6, 12, 17, 19} -> <5, (6, 12, 17)>
- Node 8: {10, 14, 18} -> <8, (10, 14, 18)>
- Node 14: {1, 8, 13, 17} -> <14, (1, 8, 13)>
  
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
