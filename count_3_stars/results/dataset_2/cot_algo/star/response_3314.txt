Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 26) (9, 14) (0, 3) (0, 24) (27, 15) (27, 24) (27, 10) (6, 16) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 21) (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 29) (15, 12) (15, 28) (23, 26) (23, 21) (2, 22) (2, 12) (2, 25) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 21) (11, 25) (4, 22) (4, 20) (4, 17) (18, 3) (18, 26) (18, 1) (18, 29) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 18) (20, 4) (20, 29) (20, 19) (29, 15) (29, 18) (29, 20) (29, 16) (29, 10) (19, 20) (19, 28) (19, 1) (10, 27) (10, 29) (10, 21) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 11) (21, 10) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 12) (22, 25) (12, 15) (12, 2) (12, 22) (12, 24) (12, 28) (7, 17) (24, 0) (24, 27) (24, 12) (24, 17) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 16) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 24) (17, 28) (28, 15) (28, 19) (28, 12) (28, 17) (25, 2) (25, 11) (25, 22) (16, 6) (16, 29) (16, 14) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 19) 

Response:
To start, we will determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 24}
- Node 1: {15, 18, 19}
- Node 2: {12, 22, 25}
- Node 3: {0, 11, 18}
- Node 4: {17, 20, 22}
- Node 5: {26}
- Node 6: {16}
- Node 7: {17}
- Node 8: {13, 14}
- Node 9: {14}
- Node 10: {21, 27, 29}
- Node 11: {3, 21, 25}
- Node 12: {2, 15, 22, 24, 28}
- Node 13: {8, 21}
- Node 14: {8, 9, 16}
- Node 15: {1, 12, 27, 28, 29}
- Node 16: {6, 14, 29}
- Node 17: {4, 7, 24, 28}
- Node 18: {1, 3, 26, 29}
- Node 19: {1, 20, 28}
- Node 20: {4, 19, 29}
- Node 21: {10, 11, 13, 23}
- Node 22: {2, 4, 12, 25}
- Node 23: {21, 26}
- Node 24: {0, 12, 17, 27}
- Node 25: {2, 11, 22}
- Node 26: {5, 18, 23}
- Node 27: {10, 15, 24}
- Node 28: {12, 17, 19}
- Node 29: {15, 18, 20, 16, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 61

Therefore, the final answer is [61].

The unique 3-stars found are:
