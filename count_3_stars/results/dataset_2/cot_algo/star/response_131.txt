Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 5}
Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 8, 9}
Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6, 7}
Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 8}
Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 9}
Node 8: Neighbors {2, 5, 6}
Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7}

Next, we identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors. We will calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes.

For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
