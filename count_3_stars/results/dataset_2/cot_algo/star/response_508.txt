Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 9) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 5) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 8, 12}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 7: {6, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 10, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {1, 7, 9, 11, 13, 5}
- Node 12: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 13: {3, 10, 11}
- Node 14: {2, 5, 6, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 6 neighbors, can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: 6 neighbors, can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 90

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [90].
