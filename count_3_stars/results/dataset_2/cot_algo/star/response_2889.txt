Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 13) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 15) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 15) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 16) (12, 18) (12, 8) (16, 18) (16, 15) (16, 2) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 0) (7, 11) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 7) (2, 14) (2, 16) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 3, 19}
- Node 1: {5, 14, 17}
- Node 2: {14, 16}
- Node 3: {4, 18, 0}
- Node 4: {9, 18, 13, 17, 3}
- Node 5: {6, 19, 1, 11}
- Node 6: {5, 14, 0}
- Node 7: {11}
- Node 8: {11, 12}
- Node 9: {4, 15, 13}
- Node 10: {15}
- Node 11: {5, 8, 7}
- Node 12: {18, 8}
- Node 13: {9, 4, 17, 15}
- Node 14: {6, 1, 2}
- Node 15: {9, 19, 13, 10, 16}
- Node 16: {18, 15, 2}
- Node 17: {4, 1, 13}
- Node 18: {4, 16, 12, 3}
- Node 19: {5, 0, 15}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9, Node 13, Node 15, Node 16, Node 18, Node 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 37

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [37].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <3, (4, 18, 17)>
- <4, (9, 13, 17)>
- <5, (6, 1, 11)>
- <6, (5, 14, 0)>
- <13, (9, 4, 17)>
- <15, (9, 19, 13)>
- <18, (4, 16, 3)>
