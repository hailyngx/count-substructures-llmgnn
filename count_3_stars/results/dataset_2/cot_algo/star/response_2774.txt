Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 6) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 10) (6, 13) (11, 9) (11, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 4) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:

1. For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3. For node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
4. For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
5. For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
7. For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \([10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [24]\).

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (5, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 10)>
<8, (1, 13, 12)>
<9, (13, 11, 14)>
<13, (8, 7, 6)>
<14, (0, 4, 10)>
