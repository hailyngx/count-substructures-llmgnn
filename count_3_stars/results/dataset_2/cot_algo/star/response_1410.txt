Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 8) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 12) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 8) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 2) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 12) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 7, 10, 8
Node 1: 3, 4, 8, 7
Node 2: 6, 3, 10, 5, 13
Node 3: 1, 11, 14, 2, 5
Node 4: 1, 10, 14
Node 5: 3, 14, 2, 12
Node 6: 7, 2, 12, 13
Node 7: 6, 9, 1, 0, 13, 8
Node 8: 1, 11, 0, 7, 12
Node 9: 7, 12
Node 10: 0, 4, 2
Node 11: 3, 14, 8, 12
Node 12: 6, 9, 11, 5, 8
Node 13: 6, 7, 2
Node 14: 3, 11, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 71

Therefore, the final answer is: [71]
