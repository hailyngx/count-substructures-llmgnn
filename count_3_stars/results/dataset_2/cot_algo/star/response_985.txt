Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 14) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 8, 7, 14}
- Node 1: {9, 4, 12}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 14, 7}
- Node 3: {6, 7, 4}
- Node 4: {9, 1, 3, 10, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 3, 11, 0}
- Node 7: {3, 11, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {10, 11, 5, 0, 12}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 2, 10, 1}
- Node 10: {9, 11, 8, 4}
- Node 11: {6, 10, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {1, 11, 8}
- Node 13: {5, 14}
- Node 14: {5, 0, 2, 13}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed in this graph:

- Node 0: [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star
  - <0, (6, 8, 14)>

- Node 2: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
  - <2, (9, 4, 14)>
  - <2, (9, 4, 7)>
  - <2, (4, 14, 7)>
  - <2, (9, 14, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 = 5

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
