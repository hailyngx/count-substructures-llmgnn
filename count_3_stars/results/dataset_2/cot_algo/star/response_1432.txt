Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 6, 9, 3}
- Node 1: {4, 9, 8, 2, 5}
- Node 2: {6, 5, 1}
- Node 3: {7, 6, 8, 0}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 9, 5, 1}
- Node 5: {4, 2, 1}
- Node 6: {7, 9, 3, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 1, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: It has exactly 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is formed.
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [33].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <4, 7, 0>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 4, 2>
- <1, 9, 6>
- <1, 9, 0>
- <1, 5, 2>
- <3, 7, 0>
- <6, 7, 0>
- <6, 7, 9>
- <6, 9, 0>
- <6, 3, 8>
- <6, 3, 0>
- <9, 4, 5>
- <9, 4, 8>
- <9, 4, 1>
- <9, 6, 2>
- <9, 6, 0>
- <9, 1, 2>
