Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 5, 7, 4
- Node 2: 6, 8, 4
- Node 3: 6, 7, 4
- Node 4: 6, 2, 9, 3, 1
- Node 5: 8, 1, 0, 7
- Node 6: 7, 3, 2, 4
- Node 7: 5, 6, 8, 9, 3, 1
- Node 8: 5, 2, 9, 0, 7
- Node 9: 8, 4, 7, 0

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
  <4, (6, 2, 9)>, <4, (6, 3, 1)>, <4, (6, 1, 5)>, <4, (2, 9, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 1)>, <4, (2, 1, 5)>, <4, (9, 3, 7)>, <4, (9, 1, 5)>, <4, (3, 1, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>

- Node 7: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
  <7, (6, 8, 5)>, <7, (6, 9, 0)>, <7, (6, 3, 1)>, <7, (6, 1, 5)>, <7, (8, 9, 0)>, <7, (8, 3, 1)>, <7, (8, 1, 5)>, <7, (9, 3, 0)>, <7, (9, 1, 5)>, <7, (3, 1, 5)>, <7, (5, 1, 8)>, <7, (5, 0, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 2)>, <7, (5, 9, 4)>, <7, (0, 9, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 1)>, <7, (0, 8, 2)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (4, 1, 8)>, <7, (4, 2, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 20 = 30, so the final answer is [30].
