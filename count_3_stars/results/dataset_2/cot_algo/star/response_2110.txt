Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 27) (2, 29) (2, 27) (2, 28) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 26) (29, 25) (29, 22) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 23) (6, 8) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 23) (25, 2) (25, 29) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 10) (15, 23) (20, 21) (20, 13) (20, 16) (11, 3) (11, 28) (11, 17) (28, 2) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 19) (21, 20) (21, 13) (21, 18) (14, 26) (14, 13) (26, 29) (26, 14) (4, 12) (4, 24) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 22) (12, 8) (1, 25) (7, 29) (7, 28) (7, 27) (7, 17) (7, 8) (13, 20) (13, 21) (13, 14) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 7) (24, 4) (24, 18) (0, 12) (0, 22) (23, 6) (23, 3) (23, 15) (16, 20) (16, 22) (16, 19) (18, 21) (18, 24) (18, 10) (10, 25) (10, 18) (22, 29) (22, 12) (22, 0) (22, 16) (27, 9) (27, 2) (27, 7) (19, 28) (19, 16) (17, 11) (17, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {12, 22}
- Node 1: {25}
- Node 2: {29, 27, 28, 25}
- Node 3: {25, 11, 23}
- Node 4: {12, 24}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 23, 8}
- Node 7: {29, 28, 27, 17, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 12, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 27}
- Node 10: {25, 18}
- Node 11: {3, 28, 17}
- Node 12: {4, 0, 22, 8}
- Node 13: {20, 21, 14}
- Node 14: {26, 13}
- Node 15: {23}
- Node 16: {20, 22, 19}
- Node 17: {11, 7}
- Node 18: {21, 24, 10}
- Node 19: {28, 16}
- Node 20: {21, 13, 16}
- Node 21: {20, 13, 18}
- Node 22: {29, 12, 0, 16}
- Node 23: {6, 3, 15}
- Node 24: {4, 18}
- Node 25: {2, 29, 3, 1, 10}
- Node 26: {29, 14}
- Node 27: {9, 2, 7}
- Node 28: {2, 11, 7, 19}
- Node 29: {2, 26, 7, 25, 22}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 22: 4 neighbors
- Node 25: 5 neighbors
- Node 29: 5 neighbors

For each of these nodes with three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars in the graph = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 45

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [45], and the unique 3-stars found are as follows:
- <2, (29, 7, 25)>
- <2, (29, 7, 27)>
- <2, (29, 7, 28)>
- <2, (29, 25, 1)>
- <3, (25, 11, 23)>
- <7, (29, 28, 11)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- <12, (12, 0, 22)>
- <25, (29, 7, 25)>
- <25, (29, 7, 27)>
- <25, (29, 7, 28)>
- <25, (29, 25, 1)>
- <29, (2, 26, 29)>
- <29, (2, 7, 29)>
- <29, (2, 25, 29)>
- <29, (7, 27, 29)>
- <29, (7, 28, 29)>
