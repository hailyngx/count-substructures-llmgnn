Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 26) (5, 22) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (2, 14) (2, 21) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 10) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 28) (22, 5) (22, 23) (22, 11) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 27) (10, 17) (10, 29) (10, 15) (10, 1) (12, 27) (12, 28) (12, 15) (27, 23) (27, 12) (27, 0) (7, 29) (7, 0) (7, 16) (0, 23) (0, 27) (0, 7) (28, 29) (28, 13) (28, 12) (4, 24) (4, 20) (4, 11) (3, 17) (21, 2) (21, 6) (21, 24) (15, 10) (15, 12) (15, 26) (15, 11) (19, 8) (19, 25) (19, 1) (19, 6) (26, 5) (26, 15) (26, 25) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 7) (16, 25) (6, 14) (6, 21) (6, 19) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 18) (24, 8) (24, 4) (24, 21) (24, 20) (20, 4) (20, 24) (11, 22) (11, 4) (11, 15) (11, 18) (25, 23) (25, 19) (25, 26) (25, 16) (18, 1) (18, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {7, 23, 27}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {10, 18, 19}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {6, 14, 21}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {10, 17}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {11, 20, 24}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {22, 26}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {14, 19, 21}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {0, 16, 29}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {13, 16, 19, 24}
10. Node 10: Neighbors {1, 15, 17, 29}
11. Node 11: Neighbors {4, 15, 18, 22}
12. Node 12: Neighbors {15, 27, 28}
13. Node 13: Neighbors {8, 28}
14. Node 14: Neighbors {2, 6, 17}
15. Node 15: Neighbors {10, 11, 12, 26}
16. Node 16: Neighbors {7, 8, 23, 25}
17. Node 17: Neighbors {3, 10, 14}
18. Node 19: Neighbors {1, 6, 8, 25}
19. Node 20: Neighbors {4, 24}
20. Node 21: Neighbors {2, 6, 24}
21. Node 22: Neighbors {5, 11, 23}
22. Node 23: Neighbors {0, 16, 22, 25, 27}
23. Node 24: Neighbors {4, 8, 20, 21}
24. Node 25: Neighbors {19, 23, 25, 26}
25. Node 26: Neighbors {5, 15, 25}
26. Node 27: Neighbors {0, 12, 23}
27. Node 28: Neighbors {7, 12, 13, 29}
28. Node 29: Neighbors {7, 10, 28}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: {3, 5, 6, 7, 13, 18, 20, 22}
Number of 3-stars:
- Node 3: 1
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 1
- Node 13: 1
- Node 18: 1
- Node 20: 1
- Node 22: 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [8].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (10, 17, 29)>, <5, (22, 26, 15)>, <6, (14, 2, 21)>, <7, (0, 16, 29)>, 
<13, (8, 28, 7)>, <18, (1, 11, 22)>, <20, (4, 24, 21)>, <22, (5, 11, 23)>.
