Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 16) (17, 6) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 3) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (3, 18) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 13) (9, 8) (9, 3) (19, 15) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 13) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 13) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 16) (16, 10) (16, 5) (16, 4) (13, 11) (13, 15) (13, 6) (13, 1) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 16) 

Response:
The central node and its neighbors in this graph are as follows:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {12, 13, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 8, 15, 18}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 9, 18}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5, 10, 14, 16}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 10, 16}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 13, 14, 17}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 12, 15}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 9, 11}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 10: Neighbors {4, 5, 16}
- Node 11: Neighbors {8, 12, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 6, 11, 12, 15}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 15: Neighbors {2, 7, 13, 19}
- Node 16: Neighbors {4, 5, 10}
- Node 17: Neighbors {6}
- Node 18: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 19: Neighbors {15}

Applying the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula to nodes with three or more neighbors, we find that the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, 4, 18>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 9, 18>
- <4, 5, 16>
- <6, 13, 15>
- <7, 12, 15>
- <7, 13, 15>
- <7, 13, 15>
- <8, 9, 11>
- <12, 13, 15>
- <13, 15, 19>
- <1, 13, 14>
- <1, 12, 14>
- <1, 12, 13>
- <1, 12, 13>
- <4, 14, 16>
- <4, 10, 16>
- <10, 5, 16>
- <3, 6, 13>
- <6, 14, 17>
