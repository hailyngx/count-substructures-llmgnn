Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 8) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 13) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 2) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 12, 14, 7}
- Node 1: {9, 13, 10, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 10, 14, 12, 3}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 6, 14, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 11, 4, 3}
- Node 6: {8, 14, 7, 3}
- Node 7: {8, 6, 0, 1}
- Node 8: {11, 0, 6, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 1}
- Node 10: {13, 1, 2}
- Node 11: {5, 8}
- Node 12: {13, 0, 14, 2}
- Node 13: {12, 4, 1, 10}
- Node 14: {6, 0, 3, 12, 2}

Now, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors and count the 3-stars:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 14: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]

Total number of 3-stars: 4+4+10+10+4+4+10+4+4+10 = 64

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 8, 11>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 13>, <1, 10, 13>, <2, 3, 12>, <2, 3, 14>, <2, 12, 14>, <3, 6, 14>, <8, 11, 5>, <8, 11, 0>
