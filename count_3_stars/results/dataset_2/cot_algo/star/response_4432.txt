Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 8) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 17) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 4) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 10) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 4) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 6) (7, 9) (7, 12) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 18) (19, 8) (19, 0) (0, 16) (0, 19) (1, 9) (1, 4) (6, 10) (6, 13) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 13) (2, 4) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 18) (13, 4) (4, 14) (4, 15) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 neighbors: 16, 19
- Node 1 neighbors: 4, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 4
- Node 3 neighbors: 10, 12, 15
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 13, 14
- Node 5 neighbors: 8, 11, 17
- Node 6 neighbors: 10, 13
- Node 7 neighbors: 9, 12
- Node 8 neighbors: 5, 9, 16, 18, 19
- Node 9 neighbors: 1, 7, 8
- Node 10 neighbors: 3, 6, 15, 17
- Node 11 neighbors: 5, 16
- Node 12 neighbors: 3, 7, 13, 16
- Node 13 neighbors: 4, 6, 12, 18
- Node 14 neighbors: 4, 17, 18
- Node 15 neighbors: 3, 10, 4
- Node 16 neighbors: 0, 8, 11, 12
- Node 17 neighbors: 5, 10, 14
- Node 18 neighbors: 8, 13, 14
- Node 19 neighbors: 0, 8

Now, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-star structures and count the total number of 3-stars.

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <4, (1, 2, 13)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <8, (5, 16, 18)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <13, (4, 6, 18)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
