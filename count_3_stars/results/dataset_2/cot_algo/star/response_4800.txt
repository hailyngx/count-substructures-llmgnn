Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 17) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (0, 16) (0, 14) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (4, 14) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 7) (17, 15) (17, 1) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 8) (19, 5) (13, 1) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 10) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 14) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (16, 11, 12)>
<1, (15, 5, 17)>
<2, (14, 18, 5)>
<6, (2, 10, 7)>
<7, (6, 1, 10)>
<8, (2, 9, 10)>
<10, (3, 6, 7)>
<11, (16, 9, 12)>
<12, (11, 16, 14)>
<14, (0, 12, 4)>
<15, (1, 9, 17)>
<16, (11, 0, 12)>
