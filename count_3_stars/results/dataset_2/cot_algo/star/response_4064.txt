Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 16) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 7) (17, 3) (17, 4) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 15) (18, 10) (18, 19) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 2) (3, 17) (3, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (15, 16) (15, 6) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 14) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 15) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 16) (14, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: {1, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 1 neighbors: {0, 2}
- Node 2 neighbors: {1, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 3 neighbors: {6, 17}
- Node 4 neighbors: {11, 14, 17, 19}
- Node 5 neighbors: {7, 9, 19}
- Node 6 neighbors: {3, 8, 10, 15}
- Node 7 neighbors: {0, 5, 13, 14}
- Node 8 neighbors: {6, 10}
- Node 9 neighbors: {2, 5, 13, 14}
- Node 10 neighbors: {6, 8, 16, 18}
- Node 11 neighbors: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 12 neighbors: {2}
- Node 13 neighbors: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 14 neighbors: {4, 7, 9, 16}
- Node 15 neighbors: {6, 16}
- Node 16 neighbors: {10, 14, 15}
- Node 17 neighbors: {3, 4}
- Node 18 neighbors: {10, 19}
- Node 19 neighbors: {4, 5, 18}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 5, 9, 10, and 14 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 13, and 16 have 3 neighbors each.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 4 neighbors (5, 9, 10, 14): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For nodes with 3 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 13, 16): \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 7 = 11 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (7, 9, 19)>, <9, (5, 13, 14)>, <10, (6, 8, 16)>, <14, (7, 9, 16)>, <0, (1, 7, 13)>, <2, (1, 9, 11)>, <4, (11, 14, 17)>, <6, (3, 8, 10)>, <7, (0, 5, 13)>, <13, (0, 7, 9)>, <16, (10, 14, 15)>
