Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 9
Node 1: 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 8
Node 3: 0, 5, 7, 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
Node 5: 2, 3, 8, 9
Node 6: 1, 4, 8
Node 7: 1, 3
Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 6
Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
Node 6: No 3-stars formed as it has less than 3 neighbors 
Node 7: No 3-stars formed as it has less than 3 neighbors 
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
Node 9: No 3-stars formed as it has less than 3 neighbors 

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [40]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
