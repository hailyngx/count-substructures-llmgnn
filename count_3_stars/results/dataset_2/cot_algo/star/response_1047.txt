Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 10) (22, 7) (15, 14) (15, 9) (15, 28) (27, 0) (27, 21) (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 9) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 29) (18, 1) (7, 22) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 25) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 26) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 24) (26, 4) (26, 25) (26, 16) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 21) (19, 4) (19, 5) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 21) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 23) (1, 18) (1, 14) (1, 29) (3, 2) (3, 28) (3, 23) (28, 15) (28, 0) (28, 3) (28, 10) (28, 20) (29, 18) (29, 1) (21, 27) (21, 5) (21, 8) (21, 20) (21, 11) (20, 28) (20, 21) (16, 26) (16, 8) (16, 9) (24, 14) (24, 25) (25, 12) (25, 26) (25, 24) (17, 18) (17, 4) (23, 9) (23, 3) (23, 10) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 23) (11, 8) (11, 21) 

Response:
First, let's start by listing the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {9, 27, 28}
- Node 1: {14, 18, 29}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 18}
- Node 3: {2, 9, 23, 28}
- Node 4: {17, 18, 19, 22, 26}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 19, 21}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 12, 22}
- Node 8: {11, 16, 21}
- Node 9: {0, 15, 16, 23}
- Node 10: {22, 23, 28}
- Node 11: {8, 21}
- Node 12: {7, 25}
- Node 13: {22}
- Node 14: {1, 15, 24}
- Node 15: {9, 14, 28}
- Node 16: {8, 9, 26}
- Node 17: {4, 18}
- Node 18: {1, 2, 4, 17, 29}
- Node 19: {4, 5}
- Node 20: {21, 28}
- Node 21: {5, 8, 11, 20, 27}
- Node 22: {4, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 23: {3, 9, 10}
- Node 24: {14, 25}
- Node 25: {12, 24, 26}
- Node 26: {4, 16, 25}
- Node 27: {0, 21}
- Node 28: {0, 3, 10, 15, 20}
- Node 29: {1, 18}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, Node 9, Node 15, Node 16, Node 18, Node 21, and Node 28 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 16 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 18 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [59]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 9, 28>
<2, 7, 18>
<4, 17, 18>
<5, 7, 21>
<18, 21, 28>
