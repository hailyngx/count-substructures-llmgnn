Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 10) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 10) (14, 11) (7, 3) (7, 2) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 11) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 8, 11}.
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 13, 14}.
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 7}.
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 7, 9}.
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 12}.
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 13, 14}.
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 8}.
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3}.
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 10}.
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 4, 11, 12}.
- Node 10: Neighbors {4, 8, 13, 14}.
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 9, 14}.
- Node 12: Neighbors {4, 9, 13, 14}.
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 5, 10, 12}.
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 5, 10, 11, 12}.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {4, 13, 14}.
- Node 4 forms one 3-star with its neighbors {9, 10, 12}.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {13, 10, 14}.
- Node 8 forms one 3-star with its neighbors {4, 6, 10}.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {11, 12, 14}.
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {13, 12, 14}.
- Node 12 forms one 3-star with its neighbors {13, 10, 14}.

Since each 3-star is counted twice considering different central nodes, we divide the total count by 2. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 7. 

Thus, the final number to be put inside brackets is [7].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <1, 4, 13, 14>
- <4, 9, 10, 12>
- <5, 10, 12, 13>
- <8, 4, 6, 10>
- <9, 11, 12, 14>
