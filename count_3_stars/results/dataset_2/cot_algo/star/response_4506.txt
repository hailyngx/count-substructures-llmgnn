Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 0) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 4) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 13) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 7, 8, 14
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 9, 11
- Node 2: 4, 8, 10, 12
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 2, 12, 13
- Node 5: 1, 8, 11, 13
- Node 6: 1, 7, 9, 10, 13
- Node 7: 0, 6, 11, 12, 13
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 10
- Node 9: 1, 6, 8, 10, 13
- Node 10: 2, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14
- Node 11: 1, 5, 7, 10
- Node 12: 2, 4, 7
- Node 13: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 14: 0, 10

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \(C(6, 3) = 20\) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars.
Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \(C(6, 3) = 20\) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 116.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [116].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 7, 6>, <0, 7, 12>, <0, 8, 2>, <0, 8, 3>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 10, 6>, <0, 10, 9>, <0, 14, 10>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 9, 13>, <2, 10, 8>, <3, 8, 5>, <4, 12, 7>, <4, 13, 5>, <4, 13, 6>, <5, 7, 13>, <5, 8, 11>, <6, 7, 11>, <6, 7, 13>, <6, 9, 13>, <7, 11, 10>, <8, 9, 10>, <8, 9, 13>, <10, 11, 7>.
