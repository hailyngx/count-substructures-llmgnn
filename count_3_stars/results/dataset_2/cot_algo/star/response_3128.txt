Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (10, 4) (10, 0) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 12) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 12) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 2) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {8, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 9, 11}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 13}
- Node 3: {4, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 5, 12}
- Node 6: {2, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {4, 9, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 9, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 4}
- Node 11: {1, 8, 14}
- Node 12: {5, 6, 8, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 14: {0, 4, 7, 9, 11, 12}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors (forming 1 3-star each):
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 6
- Node 10
- Node 11
- Node 13

Nodes with more than 3 neighbors (forming multiple 3-stars):
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 14: inom{5}{3}= 10 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 1 + 10 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) + 10 (Node 8) + 4 (Node 9) + 4 (Node 12) + 10 (Node 14) = 40

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (8, 9, 14)> <1, (2, 4, 9)> <1, (4, 9, 11)> <2, (1, 5, 13)> <4, (1, 7, 14)> <4, (3, 7, 14)> <4, (10, 14, 0)> <4, (10, 14, 1)> <4, (10, 14, 7)> <4, (7, 14, 0)> <8, (9, 12, 14)> <8, (9, 13, 14)> <8, (11, 13, 14)> <8, (11, 14, 12)> <9, (8, 14, 12)> <12, (5, 6, 14)> <12, (6, 8, 14)>
