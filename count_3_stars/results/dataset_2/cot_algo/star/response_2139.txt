Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (14, 15) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (18, 9) (18, 12) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 1) (0, 17) (0, 13) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 19) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 3) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 8) (15, 10) (10, 4) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 6) (6, 16) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 13, 17
- Node 1: 6, 12, 17, 19
- Node 2: 6, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 10, 16, 19
- Node 4: 3, 7, 10, 12
- Node 5: 3, 11, 19
- Node 6: 1, 2, 10, 16
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 9, 13, 15
- Node 9: 2, 8, 17, 18
- Node 10: 3, 4, 6, 15
- Node 11: 5, 16
- Node 12: 1, 4, 18
- Node 13: 0, 8
- Node 14: 15
- Node 15: 8, 10, 14, 16
- Node 16: 3, 6, 11, 15
- Node 17: 0, 1, 9
- Node 18: 9, 12
- Node 19: 1, 3, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each
- So, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 8 \)

In this graph, the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 12, 19)>, <2, (6, 9, 17)>, <6, (1, 10, 16)>, <8, (13, 15, 9)>, <9, (2, 17, 18)>, <10, (3, 4, 15)>, <11, (5, 16, 3)>, <19, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
