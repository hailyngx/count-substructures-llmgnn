Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 8) (10, 3) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 5, 2, 3, 1}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 11, 0, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 13, 14, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 5, 0, 10, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 9, 7, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 4, 0, 3, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 2, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 10, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8, 4, 11, 13, 0}
- Node 10: Neighbors {8, 3}
- Node 11: Neighbors {9, 1, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {8, 11, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {9, 7, 2, 3, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {5, 2, 1, 12, 13}

Now, let's check which nodes can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13 have 5 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of 49 3-stars in the given graph. 

Inside brackets: [49]
