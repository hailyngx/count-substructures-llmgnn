Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 18) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 14) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 29) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 7) (3, 25) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 16) (12, 27) (12, 16) (12, 21) (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 19) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 4) (26, 17) (4, 27) (4, 26) (16, 25) (16, 12) (16, 28) (28, 16) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 1) (14, 27) (14, 24) (6, 24) (6, 22) (24, 14) (24, 6) (24, 17) (24, 1) (24, 2) (8, 5) (8, 28) (8, 0) (8, 22) (19, 13) (19, 23) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 21) (10, 26) (10, 1) (10, 23) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 24) (2, 7) (0, 28) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 1) (20, 9) (20, 18) (20, 22) (21, 12) (21, 11) (21, 23) (29, 5) (23, 19) (23, 10) (23, 21) (23, 17) (17, 26) (17, 24) (17, 23) (1, 28) (1, 24) (1, 10) (1, 0) (22, 6) (22, 8) (22, 20) (18, 15) (18, 20) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {28, 8, 11, 1}
Node 1: {28, 24, 10, 0}
Node 2: {5, 3, 24, 7}
Node 3: {25, 2}
Node 4: {27, 26}
Node 5: {9, 2, 8, 29}
Node 6: {24, 22}
Node 7: {9, 11, 2}
Node 8: {5, 28, 0, 22}
Node 9: {5, 20, 7}
Node 10: {26, 1, 23}
Node 11: {13, 7, 0, 21}
Node 12: {27, 16, 21}
Node 13: {26, 11, 19}
Node 14: {27, 24}
Node 15: {18}
Node 16: {25, 12, 28}
Node 17: {26, 24, 23}
Node 18: {15, 20}
Node 19: {13, 23}
Node 20: {9, 18, 22}
Node 21: {12, 11, 23}
Node 22: {6, 8, 20}
Node 23: {19, 10, 21, 17}
Node 24: {14, 6, 17, 1, 2}
Node 25: {3, 16}
Node 26: {13, 10, 4, 17}
Node 27: {12, 4, 14}
Node 28: {16, 8, 0, 1}
Node 29: {5}

Next, we identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-star configurations:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, Node 8, Node 9, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 16, Node 17, Node 20, Node 21, Node 23, Node 24, Node 26, and Node 28

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-star configurations:

The total number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{17}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3}\)

Calculating the above expression gives a total of 136 3-star configurations.

Therefore, the final answer is [136], and below are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 1, 28>, <0, 11, 21>, <0, 11, 28>, <0, 21, 28>, <1, 10, 24>, <1, 24, 28>, <2, 5, 24>, <2, 7, 24>, <2, 24, 7>, <2, 24, 24>, <4, 14, 27>, <4, 14, 24>, <4, 26, 27>, <4, 26, 24>, <4, 27, 14>, <5, 8, 28>, <5, 8, 29>, <5, 9, 29>, <8, 20, 22>, <10, 13, 26>, <11, 13, 21>, <13, 19, 23>, <16, 25, 28>, <17, 23, 24>, <17, 23, 26>, <17, 24, 23>, <21, 23, 26>
