Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 12) (4, 12) (4, 9) (18, 16) (17, 3) (17, 8) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 14) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 16) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 6) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 11) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 19) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 9) (16, 6) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (11, 15) (11, 5) (11, 6) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 13) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 12) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 14) (5, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: 7  
2: 7, 12, 6  
3: 17, 13, 12  
4: 12, 9  
5: 11  
6: 10, 16, 2, 11, 14  
7: 1, 0, 16, 2, 13  
8: 17, 0, 14  
9: 4, 10, 16  
10: 9, 15, 6  
11: 15, 5, 6  
12: 3, 4, 2, 19  
13: 3, 0, 7, 14  
14: 8, 6, 13  
15: 10, 19, 11  
16: 18, 7, 9, 6  
17: 3, 8  
18: 16  
19: 0, 15, 12  

Now, let's identify the nodes with at least three neighbors:

2, 3, 6, 7, 12, 13, 16  

For these nodes, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

\[ \text{{Number of 3-stars}} = \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (7, 12, 6)>, <3, (17, 13, 0)>, <6, (10, 16, 2)>, <7, (0, 16, 2)>, <12, (4, 19, 2)>, <13, (0, 7, 14)>, <16, (9, 6, 18)>.
