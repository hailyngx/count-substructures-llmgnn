Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Since the graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can start by creating the adjacency list for each node:

Node 0: 6, 3, 4, 2
Node 1: 6, 9, 5
Node 2: 8, 5, 0
Node 3: 7, 0, 8
Node 4: 6, 9, 8, 0, 5
Node 5: 1, 4, 8, 2, 7
Node 6: 1, 4, 8, 0
Node 7: 9, 3, 8, 5
Node 8: 6, 3, 4, 2, 5, 7
Node 9: 4, 1, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-star patterns:

Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up all 3-stars, we have a total of 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 45 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [45], and the unique 3-star patterns are:
<4, (6, 8, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (6, 4, 5)>
<0, (6, 3, 4)>
<1, (6, 9, 5)>
