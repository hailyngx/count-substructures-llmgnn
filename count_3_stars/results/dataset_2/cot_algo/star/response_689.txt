Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 14) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 2) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges based on the nodes:

Node 0: {3, 7, 5, 14}
Node 1: {9, 3, 2, 10}
Node 2: {9, 1, 8, 5, 4}
Node 3: {1, 7, 13, 0}
Node 4: {6, 2}
Node 5: {10, 11, 12, 0, 2}
Node 6: {7, 11, 12, 4}
Node 7: {6, 3, 12, 0}
Node 8: {10, 11, 2, 12}
Node 9: {2, 14, 1, 13}
Node 10: {1, 11, 8, 12, 5}
Node 11: {6, 10, 5, 8}
Node 12: {6, 10, 8, 7, 5}
Node 13: {9, 3, 14}
Node 14: {9, 13, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 12

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars is [48], and the unique 3-stars are:
