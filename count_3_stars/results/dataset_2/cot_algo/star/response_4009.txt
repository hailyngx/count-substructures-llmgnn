Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 11) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 3) (9, 16) (9, 13) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 10) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 8) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 11) (0, 8) (0, 16) (16, 9) (16, 0) (16, 2) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 4) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 10) (11, 15) (11, 4) (11, 19) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 18) (18, 1) (18, 10) (18, 17) (17, 5) (17, 18) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 16}
- Node 1: {15, 18, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 16, 6, 10}
- Node 3: {15, 9, 12, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 12, 11, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 17}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 8, 2}
- Node 7: {6, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 19, 0, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 16, 13}
- Node 10: {7, 2, 18, 13}
- Node 11: {15, 4, 19}
- Node 12: {3, 15, 4}
- Node 13: {9, 7, 10}
- Node 15: {3, 1, 12, 11}
- Node 16: {9, 0, 2}
- Node 17: {5, 18}
- Node 18: {1, 10, 17}
- Node 19: {8, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1 forms 3-stars: <1, (15, 18, 8)>
- Node 2 forms no 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 3-stars: <3, (15, 9, 12)>, <3, (15, 4, 12)>
- Node 4 forms 3-stars: <4, (3, 12, 15)>, <4, (3, 12, 4)>
- Node 6 forms no 3-star.
- Node 8 forms no 3-star.
- Node 9 forms no 3-star.
- Node 10 forms no 3-star.
- Node 11 forms no 3-star.
- Node 12 forms no 3-star.
- Node 13 forms no 3-star.
- Node 15 forms no 3-star.
- Node 16 forms no 3-star.
- Node 17 forms no 3-star.
- Node 18 forms no 3-star.
- Node 19 forms no 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 4. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
