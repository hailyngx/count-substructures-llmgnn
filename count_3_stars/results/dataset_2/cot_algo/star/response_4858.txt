- Node 13: {10, 26, 3}
- Node 14: {19}
- Node 15: {21, 19, 29}
- Node 16: {17, 4, 18}
- Node 17: {10, 16, 24, 22, 18}
- Node 18: {17, 5, 16}
- Node 19: {15, 5, 14, 27}
- Node 20: {0, 1}
- Node 21: {7, 9, 15}
- Node 22: {17, 0, 7}
- Node 23: {7, 5, 12}
- Node 24: {17, 4, 25}
- Node 25: {27, 24}
- Node 26: {10, 13, 12}
- Node 27: {10, 8, 19, 25}
- Node 28: {2, 8, 7}
- Node 29: {15, 3}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + 0 + 1 + \binom{5}{3} + 0 + \binom{4}{3} + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + \binom{4}{3} = 46 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (7, 11, 29)>, <5, (12, 6, 23)>, <7, (21, 28, 22)>, <8, (6, 11, 27)>, <10, (13, 26, 27)>, <11, (9, 3, 6)>, <21, (9, 15, 7)>, <17, (22, 24, 18)>, <19, (14, 27, 5)>.
