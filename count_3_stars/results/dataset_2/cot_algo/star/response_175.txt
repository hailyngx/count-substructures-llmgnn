Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 8
Node 2: 0, 6, 7
Node 3: 1, 5, 9
Node 4: 0, 7, 9
Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 7, 8
Node 6: 1, 2, 5, 7
Node 7: 2, 4, 6, 9
Node 8: 0, 1, 5
Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 5, and Node 7 each have 6 neighbors.
- Node 6 and Node 9 each have 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 and Node 3 each have 3 neighbors.

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 60 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 6>, 
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 5>, 
<0, 1, 3>, 
<0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 6>, 
<0, 8, 3>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 8, 3>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 6>, 
<0, 8, 3>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 3>, 
<0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, 
<0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, 
<7, 6, 5>, <7, 6, 5>, <7, 6, 5>, <7, 6, 5>, <7, 6, 1>, <7, 6, 1>, 
<7, 6, 1>, <7, 6, 1>, <7, 6, 9>, <7, 6, 9>, <7, 6, 9>, <7, 6, 9>, 
<7, 6, 2>, <7, 6, 2>, <7, 6, 2>, <7, 6, 2>, <7, 6, 4>, <7, 6, 4>, 
<7, 6, 4>, <7, 6, 4>, <7, 6, 0>, <7, 6, 0>, <7, 6, 0>, <7, 6, 0>
