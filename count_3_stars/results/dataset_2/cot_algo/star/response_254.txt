Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 12) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6, 8, 14}
- Node 1: {10, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {7, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 10}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 10: {1, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 11: {1, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {2, 4, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {6, 10, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5 creates the 3-star with leaves 0, 3, and 14. So, we have <5, (0, 3, 14)>.
- Node 12 creates the 3-star with leaves 4, 7, and 11. So, we have <12, (4, 7, 11)>.
- Node 14 has exactly 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 2, and 4. So, we have <14, (1, 2, 4)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3. Therefore, the final answer is [3].
