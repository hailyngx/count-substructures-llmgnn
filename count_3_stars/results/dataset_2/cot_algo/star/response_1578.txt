Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 19) (7, 4) (7, 5) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 16) (9, 4) (9, 2) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 11) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 19) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 18) (3, 8) (11, 17) (11, 8) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 14) (15, 0) (15, 5) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (16, 6) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 18) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 14) (19, 4) (19, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 14) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {12, 15}
- Node 1: {6, 10, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 9, 12, 19}
- Node 3: {8}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 9, 19}
- Node 5: {7, 8, 14, 15}
- Node 6: {1, 13, 16}
- Node 7: {4, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5, 11, 18}
- Node 9: {2, 4}
- Node 10: {1, 14, 17}
- Node 11: {8, 17}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 18}
- Node 13: {6, 14, 17}
- Node 14: {1, 5, 10, 13, 18}
- Node 15: {0, 5}
- Node 16: {6}
- Node 17: {10, 11, 13, 12}
- Node 18: {8, 12, 14}
- Node 19: {2, 4}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 8, Node 12, Node 14, Node 17

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
1. Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
2. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
5. Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
6. Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
7. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 43

Therefore, the final answer is [43], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 4, 19)>
<5, (7, 5, 15)>
<8, (2, 8, 18)>
<12, (0, 12, 18)>
<14, (1, 5, 10)>
<17, (10, 13, 17)>
