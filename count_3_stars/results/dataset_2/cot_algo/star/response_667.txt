Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 17) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 10) (0, 16) (0, 1) (0, 6) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 10) (18, 19) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 6) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (11, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 4) (14, 1) (2, 9) (2, 1) (17, 12) (6, 15) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 19) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 16) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we need to find the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph.

First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 16}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 9, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 9}
- Node 3: {8, 15, 19}
- Node 4: {7, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {8, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 7, 15, 19}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 7, 15}
- Node 10: {4, 5, 16}
- Node 11: {7}
- Node 12: {7, 8, 16, 17}
- Node 13: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 14: {1, 4}
- Node 15: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 16: {0, 10, 12}
- Node 17: {12}
- Node 18: {19}
- Node 19: {3, 6, 18}

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors can form 3-stars.
- Nodes forming 3-stars: 0, 3, 4, 6

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 6>
<3, 8, 19>
<4, 7, 11>
<4, 7, 14>
<4, 10, 16>
<6, 7, 15>
<6, 7, 19>
<6, 15, 19>
<6, 7, 12>
<7, 9, 15>
