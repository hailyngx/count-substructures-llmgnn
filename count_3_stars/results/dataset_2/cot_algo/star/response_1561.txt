Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 16) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 18) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 18) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 19) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 17) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 2) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 2) (2, 16) (2, 12) (2, 9) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 14) (14, 13) (14, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 4) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 10) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 5) (10, 19) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 13) (17, 5) (17, 15) (17, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {7, 15, 9}
- Node 1: {16, 18, 8}
- Node 2: {16, 12, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 19, 18}
- Node 4: {6, 17}
- Node 5: {13, 17, 10, 16}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 15, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 11, 6, 19}
- Node 8: {1, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 11}
- Node 10: {5, 19}
- Node 11: {7, 9, 8}
- Node 12: {2}
- Node 13: {5, 14, 18}
- Node 14: {13, 8}
- Node 15: {0, 16, 6, 17}
- Node 16: {1, 5, 15, 2}
- Node 17: {5, 15, 4}
- Node 18: {1, 3, 13}
- Node 19: {3, 7, 10}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 13, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
- \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 (Node 0)
- \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 (Node 1)
- \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 (Node 3)
- \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 (Node 5)
- \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 (Node 6)
- \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 (Node 7)
- \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 (Node 8)
- \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 (Node 9)
- \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 (Node 13)
- \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 (Node 15)
- \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 (Node 16)
- \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 (Node 17)
- \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 (Node 18)
- \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 (Node 19)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is [34].

Unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 7, 15>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <0, 15, 16>
- <1, 8, 11>
- <1, 13, 18>
- <1, 16, 2>
- <3, 6, 19>
- <5, 10, 19>
- <5, 13, 17>
- <5, 16, 15>
- <6, 15, 17>
- <7, 11, 9>
- <7, 15, 6>
- <8, 11, 14>
- <13, 14, 8>
- <16, 2, 12>
- <17, 4, 6>
- <17, 5, 15>
- <18, 13, 3>
- <19, 3, 7>
