Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 16) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 17) (11, 29) (11, 20) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 7) (22, 27) (22, 21) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 20) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 13) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 28) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 12) (4, 18) (4, 19) (17, 1) (17, 11) (17, 26) (17, 21) (7, 18) (7, 29) (7, 15) (25, 14) (0, 10) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 29) (0, 9) (23, 26) (23, 13) (26, 17) (26, 23) (26, 21) (26, 16) (29, 11) (29, 8) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 13) (9, 10) (9, 0) (14, 25) (28, 2) (28, 0) (21, 22) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 26) (15, 5) (15, 7) (19, 6) (19, 4) (19, 24) (27, 22) (27, 24) (27, 16) (12, 10) (12, 8) (24, 19) (24, 27) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 26) (16, 27) (13, 6) (13, 23) (13, 29) (13, 20) (20, 11) (20, 5) (20, 13) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, the counts of neighbors for each node are as follows:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 22 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 23 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 24 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 25 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 29 has 5 neighbors.

Now, we check for each node that has 3 or more neighbors to see if they can form a 3-star:

- Node 0 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 1 forms <1, (17, 10, 2)>.
- Node 5 forms <5, (6, 20, 15)>.
- Node 6 forms <6, (5, 13, 19)>.
- Node 7 forms <7, (18, 15, 29)>.
- Node 8 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 10 forms [3] 3-stars.
- Node 11 forms [3] 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms <13, (6, 23, 29)>.
- Node 16 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 17 forms <17, (1, 11, 26)>.
- Node 18 forms <18, (4, 7, 16)>.
- Node 19 forms <19, (4, 6, 24)>.
- Node 21 forms <21, (0, 17, 26)>.
- Node 26 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 29 forms [3] 3-stars.

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have:
- Total = [1] + [1] + [3] + [3] + [1] + [3] + [3] + [1] + [1] = [16]. 

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
