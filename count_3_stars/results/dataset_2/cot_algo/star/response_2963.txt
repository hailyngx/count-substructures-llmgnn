Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 11) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (5, 7) (5, 3) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {13, 9, 14}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 9, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 7, 12}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 7}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 6, 11}
- Node 10: {6, 11}
- Node 11: {1, 6, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 12: {3, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 8, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors where 3-stars can be formed:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, Node 10, Node 14
Nodes with 4 neighbors: Node 3, Node 9
Nodes with 5 neighbors: Node 1, Node 6, Node 8, Node 11
Nodes with 6 neighbors: Node 7, Node 12
Node 4 has only 4 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed with it.

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star each
    - Node 0: <0, (9, 13, 14)>
    - Node 2: <2, (1, 9, 13)>
    - Node 5: <5, (3, 7, X)> (There are no further connections for node 5)
    - Node 10: <10, (6, 11, X)> (There are no further connections for node 10)
    - Node 14: <14, (0, 4, 8)>
    
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars each
    - Node 3: <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (7, 11, 12)>, <3, (7, 12, X)>
    - Node 9: <9, (1, 6, 11)>, <9, (1, 9, X)>, <9, (2, 6, 11)>, <9, (6, 10, 11)>
    
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars each
    - Node 1: <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 11, 12)>, <1, (8, 11, 12)>, <1, (8, 12, 13)>, <1, (9, 11, X)>
    - Node 6: <6, (7, 9, 11)>, <6, (9, 10, 11)>, <6, (9, 11, X)>, <6, (9, X, 11)>, <6, (10, 11, 6)>
    - Node 8: <8, (1, 12, 13)>, <8, (1, 13, X)>, <8, (12, 13, X)>, <8, (13, X, 8)>, <8, (13, X, 12)>
    - Node 11: <11, (6, 7, 9)>, <11, (6, 10, 9)>, <11, (6, 10, X)>, <11, (7, 10, 11)>, <11, (9, 10, 11)>
    
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars each
    - Node 7: <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 11, 12)>, <7, (4, 6, 7)>, <7, (4, 7, X)>, <7, (6, 12, 7)>
    - Node 12: <12, (3, 7, 8)>, <12, (3, 8, 13)>, <12, (7, 8, 12)>, <12, (7, 13, 12)>, <12, (8, 13, 12)>

Now, sum up the total number of unique 3-stars: 
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 82

Therefore, the final answer is [82].
