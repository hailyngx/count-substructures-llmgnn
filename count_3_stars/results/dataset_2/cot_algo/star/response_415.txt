Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 9) (15, 24) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 8) (4, 1) (4, 29) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 10) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 0) (22, 16) (22, 0) (22, 3) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 8) (20, 24) (25, 20) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 24) (28, 10) (29, 4) (29, 28) (29, 13) (29, 5) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 27) (8, 20) (8, 2) (8, 9) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 9) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 11) (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 26) (1, 4) (1, 20) (1, 12) (17, 13) (6, 18) (6, 21) (21, 6) (21, 13) (21, 23) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 19) (13, 29) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 16) (23, 26) (23, 21) (23, 14) (14, 23) (14, 12) (16, 22) (16, 13) (16, 5) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 10) (3, 7) (3, 22) (3, 0) (0, 18) (0, 22) (0, 3) (0, 5) (10, 7) (10, 28) (10, 12) (24, 15) (24, 20) (24, 28) (5, 29) (5, 16) (5, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}.

Let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 18, 22}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 12, 20}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 8, 15}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 22}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 29}
- Node 5: {0, 16, 29}
- Node 6: {18, 21}
- Node 7: {3, 10}
- Node 8: {2, 9, 20, 27}
- Node 9: {8, 15, 19}
- Node 10: {7, 12, 28}
- Node 11: {19, 26, 28}
- Node 12: {1, 10, 14}
- Node 13: {16, 17, 21, 29}
- Node 14: {12, 23}
- Node 15: {2, 9, 24, 27}
- Node 16: {5, 13, 22}
- Node 17: {13}
- Node 18: {0, 6, 19}
- Node 19: {9, 11, 18, 26}
- Node 20: {1, 8, 24, 25}
- Node 21: {6, 13, 23}
- Node 22: {0, 3, 16}
- Node 23: {14, 21, 26}
- Node 24: {15, 20, 28}
- Node 25: {20}
- Node 26: {19, 23, 11}
- Node 27: {8, 15}
- Node 28: {10, 11, 24, 29}
- Node 29: {4, 5, 13, 28}

Nodes 0, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 15, 19, 20, 24, 26, 28, and 29 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For each of these nodes, we have \( \binom{n}{3} \) 3-stars, where n is the number of neighbors the node has.

Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 12 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (3, 5, 22)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 29)>
- <8, (2, 9, 20)>
- <9, (8, 15, 19)>
- <10, (7, 12, 28)>
- <15, (2, 9, 27)>
- <19, (9, 11, 26)>
- <20, (8, 24, 25)>
- <24, (15, 20, 28)>
- <26, (11, 19, 23)>
- <28, (10, 11, 29)>
