Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 7, 8
- Node 4: 2, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 8 have 4 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, 1, 6>
- <2, 1, 8>
- <5, 2, 9>
- <7, 3, 9>
- <8, 4, 6>
- <8, 4, 7>
- <8, 4, 9>
- <8, 6, 7>
- <8, 6, 9>
- <8, 7, 9>
