Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 1) (4, 8) (4, 14) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 9, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 13}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {8, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 6, 10}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {0, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 7, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 6}
- Node 14: {0, 4, 6, 9}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 68

Therefore, the final result is [68], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 1, 10>
<0, 1, 11>
<0, 1, 14>
<0, 5, 11>
<0, 5, 12>
<0, 9, 12>
<0, 9, 14>
<0, 10, 12>
<0, 11, 14>
<1, 5, 12>
<1, 5, 13>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 11>
<2, 3, 12>
<2, 5, 12>
<5, 11, 12>
<6, 7, 13>
<6, 8, 13>
<6, 14, 9>
<6, 7, 10>

<12, 9, 14>
