Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
Since the graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can start by finding the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {6, 3}
- Node 1: {9, 8, 2}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 6, 8, 1}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 4, 7, 8, 0}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 7, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 6, 2}
- Node 8: {4, 3, 1, 2}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 3, 1}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 49 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [49].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <9, (5, 6, 3)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>
