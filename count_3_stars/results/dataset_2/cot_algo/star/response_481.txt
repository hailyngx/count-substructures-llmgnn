Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 2) (15, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 17) (17, 11) (17, 0) (17, 19) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 18) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 7) (18, 13) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 4) (8, 14) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 4) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 0) (16, 19) (5, 14) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 19) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 18) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated using the formula \( \sum_{\text{node n has 3 or more neighbors}} \binom{deg(n)}{3} \).

Let's start by determining the degrees of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 1
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 1
- Node 9 has degree 4
- Node 10 has degree 2
- Node 11 has degree 4
- Node 12 has degree 3
- Node 13 has degree 3
- Node 14 has degree 3
- Node 15 has degree 1
- Node 16 has degree 1
- Node 17 has degree 3
- Node 18 has degree 4
- Node 19 has degree 4

Now, we check nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 3-star combinations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1, 3-star combinations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2, 3-star combinations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7, 3-star combinations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9, 3-star combinations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11, 3-star combinations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18, 3-star combinations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19, 3-star combinations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 38 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (9, 17, 4)>
- <1, (3, 2, 12)>
- <2, (3, 1, 18)>
- <7, (10, 18, 19)>
- <9, (6, 13, 18)>
- <11, (1, 10, 17)>
- <18, (11, 2, 7)>
- <19, (7, 16, 14)>
