Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 10) (26, 23) (26, 2) (26, 20) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 22) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 22) (7, 2) (7, 13) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 20) (21, 18) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 8) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 29) (12, 22) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 25) (4, 8) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 24) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 21) (20, 26) (20, 21) (6, 10) (6, 28) (6, 18) (6, 19) (28, 6) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 24) (23, 26) (23, 5) (23, 15) (23, 16) (29, 12) (29, 28) (1, 11) (1, 24) (1, 13) (16, 28) (16, 23) (16, 19) (3, 14) (3, 21) (25, 10) (25, 27) (5, 12) (5, 23) (2, 26) (2, 7) (22, 17) (22, 7) (22, 12) (15, 14) (15, 23) (15, 13) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 6) (19, 16) (24, 8) (24, 28) (24, 1) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 15) (18, 21) (18, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {7, 14, 21, 3}
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {11, 24, 13}
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {14, 21, 15}
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {10, 28, 18, 19}
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {21, 0, 2, 13, 22}
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {11, 4, 24, 1}
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {9, 6, 11, 25}
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: {10, 1, 19, 8}
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: {27, 5, 22, 19, 29}
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {17, 0, 3, 15}
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: {28, 23, 19}
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: {11, 6, 12, 16}
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors: {7, 0, 20, 18, 3}
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: {17, 7, 12}
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: {26, 5, 15, 16}
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors: {8, 1, 28}
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: {23, 2, 20}
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: {6, 29, 24, 16}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each such node:
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 3-stars formed = 9
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 3-stars formed = 10
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
