Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a visual representation of the graph:

```
   1 -- 2
   | \/ |
   |/\  |
   5 -- 0
    \   /
     \ /
      3
      |
      8
      |
      7
      |
      4
      |
      6
      |
      9
```

Next, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 7

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 2 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 4 and Node 5 also have 5 neighbors, so they can form 10 3-stars each.

Adding them up, we get a total of 40 3-stars from the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 4, 5>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 9>
