Response:
Applying the method described earlier, let's find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.

- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 11, 2, 19, 15.
    - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 16, 27, 14.
    - 1 3-star

    - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 7, 28, 25.
    - 1 3-star
    
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 23, 22.
    - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

- Node 18 has 2 neighbors: 26, 12. (Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star)

- Node 22 has 1 neighbor: 7. (Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star)

- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 23, 9, 21, 0.
    - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 20, 24, 5.
    - 1 3-star
    
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 8, 13. (Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star)

- Node 20 has 3 neighbors: 1, 17, 10.
    - 1 3-star
    
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 20, 21, 2.
    - 1 3-star
    
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors: 8, 10, 25, 29.
    - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 16, 27, 10, 5, 3.
    - inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 27, 17, 2, 3.
    - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 14, 24, 6.
    - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 15, 3, 6, 28.
    - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 7, 19, 3, 14.
    - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 9, 17, 3, 25.
    - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

- Node 12 has 1 neighbor: 18. (Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star)

- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 26, 0, 29.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 51.  
So, the answer is [51].
