Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 52 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
