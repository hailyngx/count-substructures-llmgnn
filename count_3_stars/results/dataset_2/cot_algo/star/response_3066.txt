Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 17) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 5) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 13) (4, 9) (18, 19) (18, 13) (18, 8) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 1) (8, 12) (8, 18) (8, 19) (19, 18) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 1) (16, 7) (16, 0) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 9) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 2) (2, 19) (2, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 17) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 18) (13, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighborhood sets for each node:

Node 0: {3, 14, 16, 9}
Node 1: {10, 19, 2}
Node 2: {1, 19}
Node 3: {15, 0, 13, 12}
Node 4: {9}
Node 5: {6, 14}
Node 6: {5}
Node 7: {16, 11, 14}
Node 8: {12, 18, 19}
Node 9: {0, 4, 11, 17}
Node 10: {15, 12, 1}
Node 11: {7, 9, 13, 17}
Node 12: {3, 10, 8}
Node 13: {3, 14, 18, 11}
Node 14: {7, 5, 0, 13}
Node 15: {3, 10, 17}
Node 16: {7, 0}
Node 17: {15, 11, 9}
Node 18: {19, 13, 8}
Node 19: {18, 8, 1, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to see if they form any 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
= \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \)
= \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 \)
= 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 3, 14>, <3, 15, 17>, <7, 11, 13>, <7, 11, 17>, <7, 16, 0>, <7, 16, 14>, <9, 11, 17>, <9, 11, 13>, <9, 11, 17>, <9, 11, 13>, <10, 15, 17>, <12, 3, 10>, <13, 14, 18>, <13, 14, 11>, <13, 18, 11>, <14, 0, 3>, <14, 0, 13>, <14, 13, 18>, <15, 3, 17>, <18, 8, 19>
