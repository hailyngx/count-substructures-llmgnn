Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 23) (9, 19) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 25) (12, 23) (17, 29) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 21) (29, 17) (29, 0) (29, 18) (26, 16) (28, 16) (28, 24) (24, 28) (24, 20) (15, 22) (15, 13) (15, 4) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 27) (19, 9) (19, 17) (19, 22) (19, 11) (23, 9) (23, 12) (23, 0) (23, 27) (8, 10) (8, 11) (4, 15) (4, 13) (0, 29) (0, 23) (0, 16) (0, 21) (16, 26) (16, 28) (16, 0) (16, 14) (11, 19) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 16) (14, 11) (22, 15) (22, 19) (22, 3) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 22) (3, 20) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 25) (5, 12) (5, 25) (5, 27) (25, 9) (25, 12) (25, 2) (25, 5) (20, 24) (20, 3) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 27) (27, 10) (27, 23) (27, 5) (27, 21) (27, 18) (18, 29) (18, 27) (13, 15) (13, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are as follows: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Based on the given edges, we can determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {29, 23, 16, 21}
- Node 2: {17, 11, 25}
- Node 3: {6, 7, 22, 20}
- Node 4: {15, 13}
- Node 5: {12, 25, 27}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 10, 3}
- Node 7: {6, 12, 3}
- Node 8: {10, 11}
- Node 9: {6, 25, 19, 23}
- Node 10: {6, 8, 27}
- Node 11: {19, 8, 14, 2}
- Node 12: {7, 5, 25, 23}
- Node 13: {15, 4}
- Node 14: {16, 11}
- Node 15: {22, 13, 4}
- Node 16: {26, 28, 0, 14}
- Node 17: {29, 19, 2, 21}
- Node 18: {29, 27}
- Node 19: {9, 17, 22, 11}
- Node 20: {24, 3}
- Node 21: {17, 0, 27}
- Node 22: {15, 19, 3}
- Node 23: {9, 12, 0, 27}
- Node 24: {28, 20}
- Node 25: {12, 5, 2, 9}
- Node 26: {16}
- Node 27: {10, 23, 5, 21, 18}
- Node 28: {16, 24}
- Node 29: {17, 0, 18}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19, 22, 23, 27, 29

There are 15 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, so we need to consider the combinations of 3 neighbors for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: [comb(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 2: [comb(3, 3)] = 1
- Node 3: [comb(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 5: [comb(3, 3)] = 1
- Node 6: [comb(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 9: [comb(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 10: [comb(3, 3)] = 1
- Node 11: [comb(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 12: [comb(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 15: [comb(3, 3)] = 1
- Node 16: [comb(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 17: [comb(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 19: [comb(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 22: [comb(3, 3)] = 1
- Node 23: [comb(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 27: [comb(5, 3)] = 10
- Node 29: [comb(3, 3)] = 1

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 46

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, 21, 27>, <0, 21, 29>, <0, 23, 27>, <0, 23, 29>, <2, 11, 17>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 22>, <3, 7, 12>, <3, 22, 5>, <5, 12, 25>, <6, 7, 12>, <6, 9, 25>, <6, 10, 27>, <6, 19, 9>, <9, 12, 25>, <9, 19, 17>, <9, 19, 22>, <10, 6, 27>, <11, 14, 16>, <11, 14, 2>, <11, 19, 8>, <12, 23, 27>, <15, 13, 4>, <16, 14, 11>, <16, 14, 16>, <16, 14, 2>, <17, 19, 21>, <18, 27, 29>, <19, 11, 8>, <19, 22, 15>, <19, 22, 3>, <22, 19, 3>, <25, 2, 5>, <25, 5, 12>, <25, 5, 27>, <27, 18, 29>
