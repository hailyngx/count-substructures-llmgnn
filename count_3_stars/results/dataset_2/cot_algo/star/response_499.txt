Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 26) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 22) (16, 18) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 2) (21, 20) (21, 19) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 17) (3, 23) (7, 15) (7, 22) (7, 26) (25, 11) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 13) (26, 11) (26, 1) (26, 7) (26, 22) (22, 16) (22, 7) (22, 26) (9, 27) (4, 27) (4, 24) (4, 29) (4, 17) (27, 9) (27, 4) (27, 20) (0, 28) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 12) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 15) (19, 21) (19, 18) (19, 12) (6, 24) (6, 17) (6, 2) (24, 4) (24, 0) (24, 6) (17, 3) (17, 25) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 23) (5, 11) (5, 23) (5, 12) (5, 10) (23, 3) (23, 17) (23, 5) (13, 25) (13, 12) (28, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 14) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 12) (14, 2) (15, 7) (15, 18) (20, 21) (20, 27) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 8) (29, 4) (29, 0) (29, 8) (10, 5) (10, 8) 

Response:
The first step is to create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 28, 24, 29, 12
Node 1 neighbors: 3, 26, 2
Node 2 neighbors: 1, 6, 14
Node 3 neighbors: 1, 25, 17, 23
Node 4 neighbors: 27, 24, 29, 17
Node 5 neighbors: 11, 23, 12, 10
Node 6 neighbors: 24, 17, 2
Node 7 neighbors: 15, 22, 26
Node 8 neighbors: 10, 29, 12
Node 9 neighbors: 27
Node 10 neighbors: 5, 8
Node 11 neighbors: 16, 5, 26, 25
Node 12 neighbors: 0, 19, 5, 13, 8
Node 13 neighbors: 25, 12
Node 14 neighbors: 2
Node 15 neighbors: 7, 18
Node 16 neighbors: 11, 22, 18
Node 17 neighbors: 3, 25, 4, 6, 23
Node 18 neighbors: 16, 19, 15
Node 19 neighbors: 21, 18, 12
Node 20 neighbors: 21, 27
Node 21 neighbors: 20, 19
Node 22 neighbors: 16, 7, 26
Node 23 neighbors: 3, 17, 5
Node 24 neighbors: 4, 0, 6
Node 25 neighbors: 11, 3, 17, 13
Node 26 neighbors: 11, 1, 7, 22
Node 27 neighbors: 9, 4, 20
Node 28 neighbors: 0
Node 29 neighbors: 4, 0, 8

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 17, 18, 22, 25, 26, 27, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 51 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].

Unique 3-stars found: <0, (12, 24, 29)>, <1, (3, 26, 2)>, <3, (1, 25, 17)>, <4, (27, 24, 29)>, <5, (11, 23, 12)>, <6, (24, 17, 2)>, <11, (16, 5, 26)>, <12, (0, 19, 5)>, <12, (0, 5, 13)>, <12, (0, 5, 8)>, <17, (3, 25, 13)>, <17, (4, 6, 23)>, <18, (16, 19, 15)>, <25, (11, 13, 12)>, <25, (3, 13, 12)>, <25, (3, 17, 13)>, <25, (3, 17, 5)>, <26, (11, 7, 22)>.
