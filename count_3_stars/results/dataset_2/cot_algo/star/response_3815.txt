Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 7) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 0) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 13) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 12) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 12) 

Response:
From the given graph, we can construct the following neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {11, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 13, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 10, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 9: {13, 14}
- Node 10: {7, 8, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 13}
- Node 12: {1, 5, 7, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 8, 9, 10}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star
Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star
Node 6 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star
Node 7 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star
Node 8 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 9 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star
Node 10 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star
Node 11 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 12 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star
Node 13 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 14 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 50 3-stars.
Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 8, 14)>, <0, (11, 13, 14)>, <0, (2, 8, 14)>, <0, (3, 11, 14)>, <0, (0, 8, 14)>, <1, (11, 13, 14)>, <2, (0, 4, 13)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (4, 6, 10)>, <8, (4, 6, 14)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <13, (1, 11, 12)>, <13, (9, 12, 14)>, <13, (11, 12, 1)>, <13, (12, 1, 9)>, <14, (8, 10, 0)>.
