Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: \( \{1, 4, 5, 9\} \)
- Node 1: \( \{0, 4, 5, 6\} \)
- Node 2: \( \{3, 5, 6, 9\} \)
- Node 3: \( \{2, 7, 8, 9\} \)
- Node 4: \( \{0, 1, 6, 9\} \)
- Node 5: \( \{0, 1, 2, 8, 9\} \)
- Node 6: \( \{1, 2, 4, 7, 8\} \)
- Node 7: \( \{3, 6, 9\} \)
- Node 8: \( \{3, 5, 6, 9\} \)
- Node 9: \( \{0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8\} \)

Calculating the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 7: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 44\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 9, 8)>, <5, (8, 2, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 2)>, <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (9, 8, 2)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 8, 7)>, <6, (7, 1, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 1)>
