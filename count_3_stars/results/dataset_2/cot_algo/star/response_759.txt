Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 7, 8}

Next, we will identify the 3-stars. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors can potentially form 3-stars.

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with {2, 4, 7} and {2, 7, 9} -> 2 3-stars
- Node 2 forms 3-star with {0, 4, 8} -> 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 3-star with {0, 3, 8} -> 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 3-star with {2, 6, 7} -> 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 3-star with {3, 5, 7} -> 1 3-star
- Node 7 forms 3-star with {0, 5, 9} -> 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms 3-star with {4, 9, 2} -> 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms 3-star with {0, 7, 6} -> 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 2, 4, 7>
- <0, 2, 7, 9>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <4, 3, 8>
- <5, 2, 6, 7>
- <6, 3, 7>
- <7, 0, 5, 9>
- <8, 4, 9>
- <9, 0, 7, 6>
