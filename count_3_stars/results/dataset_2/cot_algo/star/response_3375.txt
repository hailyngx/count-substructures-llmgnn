Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 9) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 14) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 14) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7, 8, 11
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 12, 14
- Node 3: 6, 9, 13
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 8, 11
- Node 6: 3, 12, 14
- Node 7: 1, 8, 10, 13, 14
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 11, 12, 13
- Node 10: 0, 7
- Node 11: 1, 5, 9
- Node 12: 2, 6, 9
- Node 13: 3, 7, 9, 14
- Node 14: 2, 6, 7, 13

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 6 neighbors, can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 86

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [86].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 14>, <2, 5, 14>, <3, 6, 12>, <3, 6, 14>, <3, 9, 12>, <3, 9, 13>, <7, 13, 14>
