Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 15) (12, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 19) (8, 17) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 3) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 9) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 0) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 17) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 9) (16, 1) (11, 2) (11, 18) (14, 2) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 10) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 11) (10, 7) (10, 9) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 19) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 4) 

Response:
Using the information provided, we can first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 9, 15, 18}
- Node 1: {9, 15, 16}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 9, 19}
- Node 5: {3, 13, 17}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 13}
- Node 7: {6, 10, 12, 18}
- Node 8: {17, 19}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {7, 9}
- Node 11: {2, 18}
- Node 12: {7, 9, 15}
- Node 13: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 14: {2}
- Node 15: {0, 1, 12}
- Node 16: {1}
- Node 17: {5, 8, 19}
- Node 18: {0, 7, 11}
- Node 19: {4, 8, 17}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

- For Node 0, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 12, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 13, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 15, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 17, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 18, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 19, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 31\).

Therefore, the final answer is [31], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

1. <0, 4, 9, 18>
2. <2, 3, 4, 14>
3. <3, 4, 5, 13>
4. <7, 9, 10, 12>
5. <9, 10, 12, 1>
6. <13, 3, 5, 6>
7. <0, 12, 15>
8. <17, 8, 19>
9. <18, 0, 7>
