Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {5, 3, 8}
Node 1: {5, 9, 3, 6}
Node 2: {9, 4, 7, 8}
Node 3: {4, 7, 1, 0}
Node 4: {7, 8, 2, 3}
Node 5: {9, 6, 8, 1, 0}
Node 6: {5, 1}
Node 7: {9, 4, 3, 2}
Node 8: {5, 9, 4, 2, 0}
Node 9: {5, 8, 2, 1, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
<Node 5, (1, 6, 9)>, <Node 5, (0, 6, 1)>, <Node 5, (0, 6, 9)>, <Node 5, (0, 1, 9)>, <Node 5, (0, 6, 9)>, <Node 5, (1, 8, 9)>, <Node 5, (0, 8, 9)>, <Node 5, (1, 8, 0)>, <Node 5, (1, 8, 6)>, <Node 5, (6, 8, 9)>

Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
<Node 9, (1, 2, 7)>, <Node 9, (1, 4, 7)>, <Node 9, (2, 4, 7)>, <Node 9, (3, 7, 1)>, <Node 9, (1, 2, 4)>, <Node 9, (2, 4, 8)>, <Node 9, (8, 4, 7)>, <Node 9, (1, 7, 3)>, <Node 9, (1, 4, 8)>, <Node 9, (3, 7, 4)>

Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
<Node 8, (0, 2, 9)>, <Node 8, (0, 4, 8)>, <Node 8, (2, 4, 8)>, <Node 8, (2, 7, 8)>, <Node 8, (4, 7, 8)>, <Node 8, (0, 2, 4)>, <Node 8, (0, 7, 8)>, <Node 8, (0, 4, 2)>, <Node 8, (0, 7, 2)>, <Node 8, (2, 4, 7)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
