Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 7) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 6) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 13) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 5) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {3, 5, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {7, 10, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 3, 12, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 1, 10, 11}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {7, 8, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {2, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {6, 9, 11}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {5, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {3, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 12}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 10 forms 3-star(s) with the following sets of neighbors: <10, (2, 5, 6)>, <10, (3, 5, 6)>, <10, (6, 12, 13)>

Node 12 forms 3-star(s) with the following sets of neighbors: <12, (4, 13, 14)>, <12, (10, 13, 14)>

Node 6 forms 3-star(s) with the following sets of neighbors: <6, (7, 13, 14)>

Node 5 forms 3-star(s) with the following sets of neighbors: <5, (1, 10, 11)>

Node 14 forms 3-star(s) with the following sets of neighbors: <14, (4, 6, 12)>, <14, (1, 6, 12)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
