Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 0) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we'll first find the neighbor sets for each node:

1. Node 0 neighbors: {6, 11, 5}
2. Node 1 neighbors: {10}
3. Node 2 neighbors: {6, 8, 13, 12, 11}
4. Node 3 neighbors: {4, 11, 14}
5. Node 4 neighbors: {6, 7, 8, 13, 3}
6. Node 5 neighbors: {7, 8, 0}
7. Node 6 neighbors: {9, 2, 8, 4, 0}
8. Node 7 neighbors: {9, 4, 14, 5}
9. Node 8 neighbors: {6, 4, 13, 2, 5}
10. Node 9 neighbors: {6, 10, 7, 12}
11. Node 10 neighbors: {9, 0, 14, 1}
12. Node 11 neighbors: {2, 3, 12, 0}
13. Node 12 neighbors: {9, 13, 2, 11, 0}
14. Node 13 neighbors: {4, 8, 12, 2}
15. Node 14 neighbors: {7, 3, 10}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

1. Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, and Node 12 each have 5 or more neighbors.
2. Each of these nodes can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. So, 8 nodes x 10 3-stars = 80 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [80].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<0, (6, 11, 5)>, <2, (6, 8, 13)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (9, 2, 8)>, <7, (9, 4, 14)>, <8, (6, 4, 13)>, <9, (6, 10, 7)>, <12, (9, 13, 2)>
