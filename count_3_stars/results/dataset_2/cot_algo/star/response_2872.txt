Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 22) (4, 23) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 17) (0, 11) (0, 1) (27, 21) (27, 24) (27, 28) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 6) (25, 12) (12, 7) (12, 25) (12, 8) (12, 23) (2, 8) (2, 17) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 22) (14, 28) (14, 29) (11, 0) (28, 27) (28, 14) (28, 13) (28, 15) (13, 28) (13, 17) (26, 18) (26, 17) (18, 26) (18, 9) (18, 23) (18, 20) (1, 0) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 16) (15, 4) (15, 28) (15, 1) (15, 22) (17, 7) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 26) (17, 9) (6, 25) (6, 24) (24, 27) (24, 6) (24, 9) (24, 5) (22, 4) (22, 8) (22, 15) (22, 10) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 24) (9, 10) (29, 8) (29, 14) (29, 1) (16, 1) (16, 21) (21, 27) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 5) (5, 24) (5, 21) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 12) (23, 18) (23, 10) (20, 18) (20, 21) (10, 3) (10, 22) (10, 9) (10, 23) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify all the nodes with their neighbors.

Node 0 neighbors: {1, 11}
Node 1 neighbors: {0, 15, 16, 29}
Node 2 neighbors: {8, 17}
Node 3 neighbors: {10, 23, 25}
Node 4 neighbors: {15, 22, 23}
Node 5 neighbors: {21, 24}
Node 6 neighbors: {24, 25}
Node 7 neighbors: {12, 17}
Node 8 neighbors: {2, 22, 29, 12}
Node 9 neighbors: {10, 17, 18, 24}
Node 10 neighbors: {3, 9, 22, 23}
Node 11 neighbors: {0}
Node 12 neighbors: {7, 8, 23, 25}
Node 13 neighbors: {17, 28}
Node 14 neighbors: {28, 29}
Node 15 neighbors: {1, 4, 22, 28}
Node 16 neighbors: {1, 21}
Node 17 neighbors: {2, 7, 9, 13, 26}
Node 18 neighbors: {9, 20, 23, 26}
Node 20 neighbors: {18, 21}
Node 21 neighbors: {5, 16, 20, 27}
Node 22 neighbors: {4, 8, 10, 15}
Node 23 neighbors: {3, 4, 10, 12, 18}
Node 24 neighbors: {5, 6, 9, 27}
Node 25 neighbors: {3, 6, 12}
Node 26 neighbors: {17, 18}
Node 27 neighbors: {21, 24, 28}
Node 28 neighbors: {13, 14, 15, 27}
Node 29 neighbors: {1, 8, 14}

Now we need to calculate the number of 3-stars with each node that has at least 3 neighbors.

For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding them together: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<8, (2, 22, 29)>
<13, (17, 28, 14)>
<21, (16, 20, 27)>
