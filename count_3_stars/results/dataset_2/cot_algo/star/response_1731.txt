Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a visual representation of the graph based on the given edges:

```
        0 -- 6 -- 8 -- 2
        |    |    |    |
        3 -- 7 -- 1 -- 5
             |    |
             4 -- 9
```

Next, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {6, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 4, 7, 6, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 1}
- Node 3: {7, 6}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 1}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 8, 7, 1, 4}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 2, 1, 9, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 and Node 7 have 6 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 4 and Node 6 have 6 neighbors each, so they can form 20 3-stars each.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 100.
Therefore, the answer is [100].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (7, 4, 6)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<6, (4, 7, 1)>
<7, (9, 4, 1)>
<8, (9, 7, 1)>
