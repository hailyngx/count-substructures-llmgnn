Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 10) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 13) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (14, 13) (14, 12) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {9, 8, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 11, 10, 2}
- Node 2: {9, 1, 10, 7}
- Node 3: {6, 1, 7, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 9, 8, 7}
- Node 5: {6, 3, 13}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 7, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {6, 3, 4, 12, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {3, 13, 4, 10, 0}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 2, 13, 0}
- Node 10: {1, 8, 11, 12, 2}
- Node 11: {1, 10}
- Node 12: {10, 7, 14}
- Node 13: {9, 8, 5, 14}
- Node 14: {13, 12}

Now we will check the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0, 3-stars: [1]
    - <0, (9, 8, 7)>
- Node 2, 3-stars: [1]
    - <2, (9, 1, 10)>
- Node 3, 3-stars: [1]
    - <3, (6, 1, 7)>
- Node 4, 3-stars: [1]
    - <4, (6, 9, 8)>
- Node 7, 3-stars: [1]
    - <7, (6, 0, 2)>
- Node 8, 3-stars: [1]
    - <8, (3, 13, 4)>
- Node 9, 3-stars: [1]
    - <9, (6, 4, 2)>
- Node 10, 3-stars: [1]
    - <10, (1, 8, 12)>
- Node 13, 3-stars: [1]
    - <13, (9, 8, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
