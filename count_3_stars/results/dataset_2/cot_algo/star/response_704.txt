Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 18) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 16) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 17) (0, 5) (0, 16) (14, 4) (14, 16) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 11) (4, 14) (4, 16) (4, 17) (18, 13) (18, 6) (18, 15) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 10) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 4) (17, 1) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 1) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 14) (16, 4) (11, 5) (11, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 19) (19, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 20 nodes and 60 edges. To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the neighbors of each node.

Node 0: neighbors {5, 16}
Node 1: neighbors {6, 10, 15, 17}
Node 2: neighbors {8, 11, 13, 17}
Node 3: neighbors {8, 9, 10, 19}
Node 4: neighbors {14, 16, 17}
Node 5: neighbors {0, 6, 9, 11}
Node 6: neighbors {1, 5, 16, 18}
Node 7: neighbors {10, 12}
Node 8: neighbors {2, 3, 13}
Node 9: neighbors {3, 5}
Node 10: neighbors {1, 3, 7}
Node 11: neighbors {2, 5}
Node 12: neighbors {7, 17}
Node 13: neighbors {2, 8, 15, 18}
Node 14: neighbors {4, 16}
Node 15: neighbors {1, 13, 18}
Node 16: neighbors {0, 4, 6, 14}
Node 17: neighbors {1, 2, 4, 12}
Node 18: neighbors {6, 13, 15}

Now, for the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13. Therefore, the final answer is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (6, 10, 15)>
<2, (8, 13, 17)>
<3, (8, 9, 10)>
<4, (14, 16, 17)>
