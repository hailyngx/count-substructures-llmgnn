Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 34, which we put inside brackets to get [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>.
