Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 11) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 9, 10}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 11}
- Node 3: {7, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {6, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 11}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 11, 12}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 5, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 8: {7, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 7, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 11: {2, 5, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {3, 6, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {11, 12}
- Node 14: {4, 7, 8, 9, 12}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 13

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{2}{3} = 0

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 5, 7>
- <1, 9, 10>
- <3, 7, 10>
- <6, 4, 12>
- <6, 11, 12>
- <6, 2, 11>
- <10, 4, 9>
- <10, 1, 3>
- <10, 9, 4>
- <10, 9, 11>
- <14, 7, 9>
