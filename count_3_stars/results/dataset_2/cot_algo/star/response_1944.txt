Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 8) (15, 11) (15, 27) (15, 26) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 14) (3, 16) (3, 5) (18, 23) (18, 17) (22, 19) (22, 21) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 23) (17, 18) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 4) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 4) (0, 6) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 21) (20, 13) (28, 0) (28, 5) (28, 25) (28, 23) (29, 20) (29, 12) (29, 14) (13, 17) (13, 20) (13, 26) (13, 25) (13, 7) (26, 15) (26, 13) (24, 14) (24, 21) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 6) (19, 22) (19, 7) (19, 12) (23, 18) (23, 10) (23, 28) (25, 28) (25, 13) (5, 3) (5, 28) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 12) (2, 15) (2, 9) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (21, 22) (21, 20) (21, 24) (12, 10) (12, 29) (12, 19) (12, 8) (14, 27) (14, 29) (14, 24) (14, 5) (14, 9) (7, 13) (7, 19) (7, 5) (7, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to analyze the neighbors of each node.

Node 0 neighbors: {20, 28, 4, 6}
Node 2 neighbors: {15, 9}
Node 3 neighbors: {16, 5}
Node 4 neighbors: {17, 0, 6}
Node 5 neighbors: {3, 28, 8, 7, 14}
Node 7 neighbors: {13, 19, 5, 9}
Node 8 neighbors: {16, 5, 12}
Node 9 neighbors: {2, 14, 7}
Node 10 neighbors: {17, 12, 23}
Node 11 neighbors: {16, 15}
Node 12 neighbors: {10, 29, 19, 8}
Node 13 neighbors: {17, 20, 26, 25, 7}
Node 14 neighbors: {27, 29, 24, 5, 9}
Node 15 neighbors: {11, 27, 26, 2}
Node 16 neighbors: {11, 3, 8}
Node 17 neighbors: {18, 10, 13, 4}
Node 19 neighbors: {22, 12, 7}
Node 20 neighbors: {0, 29, 21, 13}
Node 21 neighbors: {22, 20, 24}
Node 22 neighbors: {19, 21}
Node 23 neighbors: {18, 10, 28}
Node 24 neighbors: {14, 21, 27}
Node 25 neighbors: {28, 13}
Node 26 neighbors: {15, 13}
Node 27 neighbors: {15, 27, 14}
Node 28 neighbors: {0, 5, 25, 23}
Node 29 neighbors: {20, 12, 14}

Now, we can see that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of. Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors will form 1 3-star, while nodes with more than 3 neighbors will form \( \binom{n}{3} \) 3-stars.

Calculating this for each node, we get:
- Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 5: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 10: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 13: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 14: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 15: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 16: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 17: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 19: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 20: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 21: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 23: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 24: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 25: 2 choose 3 = 0 3-stars (no 3-star since it has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 27: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 28: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 29: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node, we have: 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 48.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].

Unique 3-stars found are:
