Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the final answer is [54].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <1, 0, 4>
- <1, 0, 8>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <3, 6, 8>
- <6, 7, 8>
