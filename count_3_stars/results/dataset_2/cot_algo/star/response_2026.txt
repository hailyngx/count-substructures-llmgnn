Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 16) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 11) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 15) (13, 18) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 0) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 3) (0, 18) (0, 16) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 10) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 15) (6, 2) (6, 15) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 0) (14, 5) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 6) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 12) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 18, 16  
Node 1: 17, 16  
Node 2: 18, 12, 19, 6  
Node 3: 11, 10  
Node 4: 5, 7, 12, 17  
Node 5: 9, 4, 14  
Node 6: 2, 15  
Node 7: 4, 11  
Node 8: 16, 17  
Node 9: 5, 11, 16  
Node 10: 3, 19, 12  
Node 11: 9, 7, 18, 3  
Node 12: 4, 2, 17, 10, 15  
Node 13: 15, 18  
Node 14: 5  
Node 15: 13, 19, 12, 6  
Node 16: 9, 8, 1, 0  
Node 17: 4, 8, 1, 12  
Node 18: 13, 2, 11, 0  
Node 19: 2, 15, 10  

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find 3-stars:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:  
Node 5: <5, (9, 4, 14)>  
Node 9: <9, (5, 11, 16)>  
Node 16: <16, (9, 8, 1)>  

Nodes with more than 3 neighbors:  
Node 2: [inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars]  
<2, (18, 12, 19)>
<2, (18, 12, 6)>
<2, (18, 19, 6)>
<2, (12, 19, 6)>

Node 4: [inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars]  
<4, (5, 7, 12)>
<4, (5, 12, 17)>
<4, (7, 12, 17)>
<4, (5, 7, 17)>

Node 12: [inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars]  
<12, (4, 17, 10)>
<12, (4, 10, 15)>
<12, (4, 17, 15)>
<12, (4, 15, 6)>
<12, (17, 10, 15)>
<12, (17, 10, 6)>
<12, (10, 15, 6)>
<12, (17, 15, 6)>
<12, (10, 15, 6)>
<12, (4, 17, 6)>

Node 18: [inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars]  
<18, (13, 2, 11)>
<18, (13, 11, 0)>
<18, (2, 11, 0)>
<18, (13, 2, 0)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [25].
