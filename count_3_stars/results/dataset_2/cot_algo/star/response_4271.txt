Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (8, 6) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 14) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 5) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 2) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 2) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {1, 4, 5}
Node 1: {0, 2, 9, 10, 12}
Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 7, 10}
Node 3: {5, 9, 10, 12}
Node 4: {0, 2, 11}
Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 13, 14}
Node 6: {7, 8, 12}
Node 7: {2, 6, 8, 10, 12}
Node 8: {6, 7, 11, 13}
Node 9: {1, 3, 14}
Node 10: {1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 14}
Node 11: {4, 8, 14}
Node 12: {1, 3, 6, 7}
Node 13: {5, 8, 14}
Node 14: {5, 9, 10, 11, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each such node:

Node 1: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 2: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 3: No 3-star formed (only 4 neighbors)
Node 5: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 7: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 8: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 10: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
Node 12: No 3-star formed (only 4 neighbors)
Node 14: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 71\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [71].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <1, 2, 10>
- <1, 2, 12>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <1, 5, 10>
- <1, 5, 12>
- <1, 9, 10>
- <1, 9, 12>
- <1, 10, 12>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <2, 5, 10>
- <2, 5, 12>
- <2, 9, 10>
- <2, 9, 12>
- <2, 10, 12>
- <7, 8, 11>
- <7, 8, 13>
- <7, 10, 14>
- <8, 11, 14>
- <10, 11, 14>
- <10, 13, 14>
