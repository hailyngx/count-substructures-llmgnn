Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 5, 6, 2, 7
Node 1: 6, 4
Node 2: 9, 6, 8, 3, 0
Node 3: 5, 9, 4, 2, 7
Node 4: 5, 9, 8, 1, 3
Node 5: 9, 4, 0, 3, 7
Node 6: 1, 7, 2, 0
Node 7: 5, 6, 0, 3
Node 8: 4, 2
Node 9: 5, 4, 2, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

For Node 0, there are 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For Node 2, there are 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For Node 3, there are 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For Node 4, there are 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For Node 5, there are 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For Node 9, there are 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 48, so the answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars found are:
