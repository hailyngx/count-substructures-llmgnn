Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges by node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars from all nodes, we have a total of 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 50 3-stars.
Therefore, the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>.
