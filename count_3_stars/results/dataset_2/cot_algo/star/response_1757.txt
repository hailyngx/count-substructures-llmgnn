Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 28) (27, 25) (27, 29) (27, 13) (4, 22) (4, 9) (7, 15) (7, 5) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 24) (3, 6) (3, 29) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 8) (29, 27) (29, 3) (29, 19) (6, 3) (6, 28) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 16) (28, 15) (28, 6) (28, 20) (13, 27) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 11) (25, 27) (25, 0) (14, 26) (14, 21) (26, 14) (26, 10) (26, 16) (22, 4) (22, 20) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 20) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 24) (5, 7) (5, 2) (24, 3) (24, 2) (24, 19) (24, 21) (18, 10) (18, 23) (18, 0) (18, 8) (23, 18) (23, 0) (9, 4) (19, 29) (19, 24) (19, 16) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 26) (16, 19) (0, 6) (0, 25) (0, 18) (0, 23) (8, 17) (8, 18) (8, 20) (20, 28) (20, 22) (20, 10) (20, 8) (11, 13) (11, 21) (11, 12) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 11) (21, 14) (21, 24) (21, 11) 

Response:
The first step is to list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 18, 23, 25}
- Node 1: {2, 3}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 24}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 29, 24}
- Node 4: {9, 22}
- Node 5: {2, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 12, 16, 28}
- Node 7: {5, 15, 17}
- Node 8: {17, 18, 20}
- Node 9: {4}
- Node 10: {18, 20, 26}
- Node 11: {12, 13, 21}
- Node 12: {6, 11, 15}
- Node 13: {11, 16, 17, 27}
- Node 14: {21, 26}
- Node 15: {7, 12, 28}
- Node 16: {6, 13, 19, 26}
- Node 17: {7, 13, 8}
- Node 18: {0, 8, 10, 23}
- Node 19: {16, 24, 29}
- Node 20: {8, 10, 22, 28}
- Node 21: {11, 14, 24}
- Node 22: {4, 20}
- Node 23: {0, 18}
- Node 24: {2, 3, 19, 21}
- Node 25: {0, 27}
- Node 26: {10, 14, 16}
- Node 27: {13, 25, 29}
- Node 28: {6, 15, 20}
- Node 29: {3, 19, 27}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms 3-stars: <3, (1, 24, 29)>, <3, (6, 24, 29)>
- Node 6 forms 3-stars: <6, (0, 16, 28)>, <6, (3, 16, 19)>, <6, (12, 16, 13)>, <6, (13, 16, 19)>, <6, (16, 19, 26)>
- Node 13 forms 3-stars: <13, (17, 16, 27)>, <13, (16, 19, 26)>
- Node 16 forms 3-stars: <16, (6, 13, 19)>, <16, (13, 19, 26)>
- Node 18 forms 3-stars: <18, (8, 20, 23)>
- Node 20 forms 3-stars: <20, (8, 22, 28)>
- Node 24 forms 3-stars: <24, (2, 19, 21)>, <24, (3, 19, 21)>, <24, (19, 21, 29)>
- Node 26 forms 3-stars: <26, (14, 16, 21)>, <26, (16, 19, 26)>

Total number of 3-stars = 17, so the answer is [17].
