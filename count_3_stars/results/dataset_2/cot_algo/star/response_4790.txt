Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 2) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 14) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, first, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

1. Node 0: {13, 14, 3, 6}
2. Node 1: {2, 10, 12, 13}
3. Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 7, 13}
4. Node 3: {0, 2, 11}
5. Node 4: {6, 10, 12}
6. Node 5: {2, 7, 8}
7. Node 6: {0, 4, 14}
8. Node 7: {2, 5, 10, 13, 14}
9. Node 8: {5, 7, 9, 10}
10. Node 9: {8, 11, 12}
11. Node 10: {1, 4, 7, 8, 11}
12. Node 11: {3, 9, 10, 12}
13. Node 12: {1, 4, 9, 11, 14}
14. Node 13: {0, 1, 2, 7, 14}
15. Node 14: {0, 6, 7, 12, 13}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Nodes 0, 1, and 2 each have more than 3 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
1. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 = 18

Therefore, the final answer is [18], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (13, 14, 3)>, <0, (13, 14, 6)>, <0, (13, 3, 6)>, <0, (14, 3, 6)>,
<1, (2, 10, 13)>, <1, (2, 12, 13)>, <1, (10, 12, 13)>, <1, (2, 10, 12)>,
<2, (5, 7, 13)>, <2, (7, 10, 13)>, <2, (5, 7, 14)>, <2, (7, 13, 14)>,
<2, (5, 8, 7)>, <2, (7, 8, 13)>, <2, (5, 8, 14)>, <2, (7, 13, 14)>,
<2, (5, 8, 10)>, <2, (7, 8, 14)>
