Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 3) (22, 14) (22, 3) (22, 21) (10, 19) (10, 23) (11, 27) (11, 4) (2, 6) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 8) (4, 11) (4, 28) (4, 5) (8, 18) (8, 28) (8, 20) (8, 27) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 19) (14, 22) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 25) (26, 13) (26, 12) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 24) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 9) (28, 4) (28, 8) (7, 16) (7, 29) (25, 14) (25, 9) (25, 29) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 23) (5, 24) (5, 3) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 9) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 21) (21, 22) (21, 16) (21, 24) (29, 7) (29, 25) (29, 27) (23, 10) (23, 5) (23, 27) (9, 17) (9, 25) (9, 19) (9, 20) (15, 18) (27, 11) (27, 8) (27, 29) (27, 23) (3, 13) (3, 22) (3, 5) (3, 20) (20, 8) (20, 9) (20, 3) (12, 0) (12, 26) (12, 24) (24, 1) (24, 5) (24, 21) (24, 12) (6, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we first need to determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 14, 16, 12, 19
- Node 1: 13, 17, 24
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 13, 22, 5, 20
- Node 4: 11, 28, 5, 19
- Node 5: 4, 19, 23, 24, 3
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 16, 29
- Node 8: 18, 28, 20, 27
- Node 9: 17, 25, 19, 20
- Node 10: 19, 23
- Node 11: 4, 27
- Node 12: 0, 26, 24
- Node 13: 1, 26, 3
- Node 14: 22, 0, 19, 25
- Node 15: 18
- Node 16: 0, 7, 21
- Node 17: 1, 18, 9
- Node 18: 15, 17, 8
- Node 19: 10, 0, 14, 5, 9, 4
- Node 20: 8, 9, 3
- Node 21: 22, 16, 24
- Node 22: 14, 3, 21
- Node 23: 10, 5, 27
- Node 24: 1, 5, 21, 12
- Node 25: 14, 9, 29
- Node 26: 13, 12
- Node 27: 11, 8, 29, 23
- Node 28: 4, 8
- Node 29: 7, 25, 27

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 5, 8, 9, 19, 24, 27

Now we apply the combinatorial calculation to find the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 19: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 24: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 27: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given 30-node graph is [50].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 12, 14>, <0, 12, 16>, <0, 12, 19>, <0, 14, 19>, <0, 16, 21>, <5, 19, 23>, <5, 19, 24>, <5, 23, 27>, <5, 24, 21>, <8, 20, 27>, <8, 27, 23>, <9, 19, 25>, <9, 19, 20>, <19, 4, 5>, <19, 4, 9>, <19, 9, 20>, <19, 9, 25>, <24, 1, 5>, <24, 1, 21>, <24, 12, 21>, <27, 11, 4>, <27, 11, 8>, <27, 23, 29>, <27, 29, 7>, <27, 29, 25>
