Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 13) (14, 7) (14, 15) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 8) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 7) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 17) (8, 9) (8, 18) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 12) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 12) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 19) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 7) (0, 17) (0, 3) (0, 18) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 4) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 9) (18, 0) (19, 15) (19, 1) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 19) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 9) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {17, 3, 18}
- Node 1: {2, 9, 4, 19}
- Node 2: {1, 13, 4}
- Node 3: {5, 0, 12}
- Node 4: {6, 2, 12, 1}
- Node 5: {6, 18, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 4}
- Node 7: {14, 10, 9}
- Node 8: {17, 9, 18}
- Node 9: {8, 1, 7, 18}
- Node 10: {17, 15, 7}
- Node 11: {16, 12}
- Node 12: {11, 13, 3, 4}
- Node 13: {16, 2, 12}
- Node 14: {7, 15}
- Node 15: {14, 10, 19}
- Node 16: {11, 13}
- Node 17: {10, 0, 8}
- Node 18: {5, 8, 9, 0}
- Node 19: {15, 1}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, 15, 18, 19
- Summing up the number of 3-stars for these nodes: \( \binom{11}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} \times 2 = 165 + 4 + 1 \times 2 = 171 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [171].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (17, 3, 18)>
- <1, (2, 9, 4)>
- <2, (1, 13, 4)>
- <3, (5, 0, 12)>
- <4, (6, 2, 12)>
- <5, (6, 18, 3)>
- <10, (17, 15, 7)>
- <12, (11, 13, 3)>
- <15, (14, 10, 19)>
- <18, (5, 8, 9)>
- <19, (15, 1)>
