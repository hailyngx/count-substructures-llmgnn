Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}

Next, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 62

Thus, the final answer is [62].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (8, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>
