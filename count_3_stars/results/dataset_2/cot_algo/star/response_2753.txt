Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 11) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 9, 13}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 7, 13, 12, 14}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 11}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {3, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 10}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 8, 14}
- Node 11: {5, 6, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 10, 11, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 8, 11
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 12

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors have 1 3-star each.
- Nodes with 4 neighbors will form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Nodes with 6 neighbors will form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each.

Total number of 3-stars:
\[ 4 \times 1 + 5 \times 4 + 4 \times 20 = 4 + 20 + 80 = 104 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [104].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
