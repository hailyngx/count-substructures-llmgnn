Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 1) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 8) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 2) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 14) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 9) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 1) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, here are the steps to find the total number of 3-stars:

1. Find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {12, 13}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 3: {10, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 10}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 9, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 6, 11}
- Node 11: {3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 9, 11}

2. Identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

3. Count the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

4. Sum up the total number of 3-stars:

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 72

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [72].

Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<2, (5, 7, 13)>, 
<3, (10, 11, 14)>, 
<4, (1, 5, 7)>, 
<9, (4, 11, 13)>, 
<11, (9, 12, 14)>, 
<13, (1, 9, 13)>, 
<1, (4, 12, 14)>, 
<6, (1, 8, 10)>
