Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 20) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 16) (2, 23) (2, 27) (29, 17) (29, 7) (20, 3) (20, 25) (20, 23) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 12) (25, 0) (25, 28) (25, 24) (28, 20) (28, 25) (28, 4) (17, 29) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 26) (7, 29) (12, 25) (12, 14) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 8) (26, 17) (26, 18) (26, 11) (26, 0) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 18) (8, 5) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 11) (5, 18) (5, 8) (5, 11) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (11, 26) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 1) (14, 12) (14, 24) (27, 2) (27, 23) (22, 16) (0, 25) (0, 17) (0, 26) (0, 4) (9, 10) (9, 16) (10, 18) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 23) (16, 15) (16, 22) (16, 9) (16, 4) (23, 2) (23, 20) (23, 27) (23, 13) (4, 28) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 16) (24, 25) (24, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {25, 17, 26, 4}
- Node 1: {6, 11, 13}
- Node 2: {23, 27}
- Node 3: {15, 20, 8}
- Node 4: {28, 0, 10, 16}
- Node 5: {18, 8, 11}
- Node 6: {1, 10}
- Node 7: {29}
- Node 8: {3, 15, 18, 5}
- Node 9: {10, 16}
- Node 10: {18, 6, 9, 4, 13}
- Node 11: {26, 19, 5, 1}
- Node 12: {25, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 10, 23}
- Node 14: {12, 24}
- Node 15: {3, 19, 16}
- Node 16: {15, 22, 9, 4}
- Node 17: {29, 0, 26, 19}
- Node 18: {26, 5, 10, 8}
- Node 19: {15, 17, 11}
- Node 20: {3, 15, 25, 23}
- Node 22: {16}
- Node 23: {2, 27, 13, 20}
- Node 24: {25, 14}
- Node 25: {20, 28, 12, 0, 24}
- Node 26: {17, 18, 11, 0}
- Node 27: {2, 23}
- Node 28: {20, 25, 4}
- Node 29: {17, 7}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with {4, 25, 26}
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with {6, 11, 13}
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with {10, 16, 28}
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with {5, 15, 18}
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with {13, 16, 18}
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with {16, 19, 20}
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with {9, 15, 22}
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with {19, 26, 29}
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with {10, 11, 26}
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with {15, 17, 26}
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with {23, 25, 28}

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find there are 10 of them. Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
