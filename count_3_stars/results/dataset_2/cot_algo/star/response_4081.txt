Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 5) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 7) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 19) (13, 18) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 6) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 9) (12, 5) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (1, 6) (1, 11) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 9) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 1) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 19) (18, 13) (18, 7) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 16) (16, 14) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 14, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 1: {6, 11}
- Node 2: {5, 19, 16}
- Node 3: {15, 0}
- Node 4: {5, 16, 6}
- Node 5: {15, 4, 12, 19, 2}
- Node 6: {13, 4, 1}
- Node 7: {17, 18, 9}
- Node 8: {11, 0}
- Node 9: {15, 7, 19}
- Node 10: {0, 16}
- Node 11: {8, 0, 1}
- Node 12: {5}
- Node 13: {19, 18, 6}
- Node 14: {17, 0, 16, 19}
- Node 15: {3, 9, 5}
- Node 16: {14, 4, 10, 2}
- Node 17: {14, 7}
- Node 18: {13, 7}
- Node 19: {14, 13, 5, 2, 9}

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 5: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 14: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 16: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 19: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 28

Therefore, the final answer is [28], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, (15, 4, 19)>
- <5, (15, 12, 19)>
- <5, (4, 12, 19)>
- <5, (4, 6, 19)>
- <5, (4, 1, 19)>
- <5, (4, 6, 1)>
- <5, (4, 1, 2)>
- <5, (12, 1, 19)>
- <5, (12, 1, 2)>
- <5, (6, 1, 19)>
- <14, (17, 0, 19)>
- <14, (17, 16, 19)>
- <14, (0, 16, 19)>
- <14, (0, 16, 2)>
- <16, (14, 4, 2)>
- <16, (14, 4, 10)>
- <16, (14, 10, 2)>
- <16, (4, 10, 2)>
- <19, (13, 5, 2)>
- <19, (13, 5, 9)>
- <19, (13, 2, 9)>
- <19, (5, 2, 9)>
- <19, (5, 2, 14)>
- <19, (5, 9, 14)>
- <19, (2, 9, 14)>
- <19, (16, 2, 14)>
- <19, (16, 2, 4)>
- <19, (16, 14, 4)>
