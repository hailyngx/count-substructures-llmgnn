Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8
Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6
Node 2: 7, 8, 9
Node 3: 0, 1, 7, 9
Node 4: 1, 5, 7, 9
Node 5: 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 6: 0, 1, 5
Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9
Node 8: 0, 2, 5
Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, Node 9

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars involving that node:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (7, 9, 5)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (9, 2, 5)>
