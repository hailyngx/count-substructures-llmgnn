Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 7) (5, 3) (5, 27) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 11) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 28) (18, 25) (18, 1) (21, 0) (21, 12) (21, 25) (21, 17) (28, 18) (28, 13) (28, 15) (20, 29) (20, 1) (29, 20) (29, 10) (11, 4) (11, 23) (11, 22) (23, 11) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 24) (23, 27) (14, 26) (14, 8) (14, 2) (26, 23) (26, 14) (26, 3) (8, 14) (8, 24) (8, 25) (7, 9) (1, 18) (1, 20) (1, 16) (1, 0) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 13) (17, 21) (17, 23) (17, 12) (24, 23) (24, 8) (24, 10) (24, 2) (0, 21) (0, 1) (0, 22) (19, 3) (3, 5) (3, 26) (3, 19) (3, 10) (10, 29) (10, 24) (10, 3) (13, 6) (13, 28) (13, 16) (22, 11) (22, 0) (22, 15) (25, 18) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 2) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 24) (2, 25) (12, 21) (12, 17) (27, 5) (27, 23) (15, 6) (15, 28) (15, 22) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 21, 22
- Node 1: 0, 16, 18, 20
- Node 2: 4, 14, 24, 25
- Node 3: 5, 10, 19, 26
- Node 4: 2, 6, 11, 16, 18
- Node 5: 3, 27
- Node 6: 4, 13, 15
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 14, 24, 25
- Node 9: 7
- Node 10: 3, 24, 29
- Node 11: 4, 22, 23
- Node 12: 17, 21
- Node 13: 6, 16, 28
- Node 14: 2, 8, 26
- Node 15: 6, 15, 22, 28
- Node 16: 1, 4, 13
- Node 17: 12, 21, 23
- Node 18: 1, 4, 16, 25, 28
- Node 19: 3
- Node 20: 1, 29
- Node 21: 0, 12, 17, 25
- Node 22: 0, 11, 15
- Node 23: 11, 17, 24, 26, 27
- Node 24: 2, 8, 10, 23, 25
- Node 25: 1, 18, 21, 24, 28
- Node 26: 2, 3, 14, 23
- Node 27: 3, 5, 23
- Node 28: 13, 15, 18, 25
- Node 29: 10, 20

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (3-stars: 1) 
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (3-stars: 1) 
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (3-stars: 1) 
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (3-stars: 5) 
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (3-stars: 1) 
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (3-stars: 1) 
- Node 10: 3 neighbors (3-stars: 1) 
- Node 11: 3 neighbors (3-stars: 1) 
- Node 13: 3 neighbors (3-stars: 1) 
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (3-stars: 1) 
- Node 15: 4 neighbors (3-stars: 1) 
- Node 16: 5 neighbors (3-stars: 5) 
- Node 17: 3 neighbors (3-stars: 1) 
- Node 18: 5 neighbors (3-stars: 5) 
- Node 21: 4 neighbors (3-stars: 1) 
- Node 23: 5 neighbors (3-stars: 5) 
- Node 24: 5 neighbors (3-stars: 5) 
- Node 25: 5 neighbors (3-stars: 5) 
- Node 26: 4 neighbors (3-stars: 1) 
- Node 28: 4 neighbors (3-stars: 1) 

Total number of 3-stars: [35]

Unique 3-stars: <1, (4, 18, 25)>, <2, (14, 24, 25)>, <3, (5, 10, 19)>, <4, (6, 11, 16)>, <6, (13, 15, 28)>, <8, (14, 24, 25)>, <10, (3, 24, 29)>, <11, (4, 22, 23)>, <13, (6, 16, 28)>, <15, (6, 15, 28)>, <16, (1, 4, 13)>, <18, (1, 4, 16)>, <23, (11, 17, 24)>, <24, (2, 8, 10)>, <25, (1, 18, 21)>.
