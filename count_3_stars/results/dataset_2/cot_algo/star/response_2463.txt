Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (26, 21) (26, 11) (26, 16) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 7) (3, 24) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 23) (20, 24) (25, 20) (25, 19) (25, 8) (25, 12) (25, 24) (10, 11) (10, 27) (10, 23) (11, 26) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 22) (0, 20) (0, 6) (0, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (28, 12) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 25) (8, 2) (8, 29) (17, 29) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 4) (29, 20) (29, 8) (29, 17) (29, 5) (21, 26) (21, 3) (21, 27) (16, 26) (16, 17) (16, 12) (4, 6) (4, 17) (22, 11) (22, 27) (12, 1) (12, 25) (12, 28) (12, 16) (12, 24) (18, 9) (18, 23) (18, 5) (18, 13) (15, 17) (15, 19) (19, 25) (19, 15) (19, 27) (7, 3) (7, 14) (14, 7) (23, 20) (23, 10) (23, 18) (24, 3) (24, 20) (24, 25) (24, 12) (27, 10) (27, 21) (27, 22) (27, 19) (5, 29) (5, 18) (13, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:

1: {3, 11, 12}
2: {0, 6, 8}
3: {1, 7, 21, 24}
4: {6, 17}
5: {18, 29}
6: {0, 2, 4}
7: {3, 14}
8: {2, 25, 29}
9: {18}
10: {11, 23, 27}
11: {1, 10, 22, 26}
12: {1, 16, 24, 25, 28}
13: {18}
14: {7}
15: {17, 19}
16: {12, 17, 26}
17: {4, 15, 16, 29}
18: {5, 9, 13}
19: {15, 25, 27}
20: {0, 23, 24, 25, 29}
21: {3, 26, 27}
22: {11, 27}
23: {10, 18, 20}
24: {3, 12, 20, 25}
25: {8, 12, 19, 20, 24}
26: {11, 16, 21}
27: {10, 19, 21, 22}
28: {12}
29: {5, 8, 17, 20}

There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors.
Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 34
