Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 17) (8, 3) (8, 0) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 18) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 11) (18, 13) (18, 5) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 0) (17, 15) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 5) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 6) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 16) (11, 2) (11, 4) (19, 3) (19, 9) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 12) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 16) (10, 14) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 14) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 9) (9, 19) (9, 16) (14, 2) (14, 10) (14, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {8, 1, 12}
Node 1: {15, 5, 0}
Node 2: {14, 7, 11}
Node 3: {15, 19, 8}
Node 4: {12, 11, 6}
Node 5: {18, 1, 17, 14, 10}
Node 6: {4, 7, 10, 16}
Node 7: {13, 2, 6}
Node 8: {3, 0}
Node 9: {19, 16}
Node 10: {6, 5, 16, 14}
Node 11: {2, 4}
Node 12: {17, 0, 4}
Node 13: {17, 7, 18}
Node 14: {2, 5, 10}
Node 15: {3, 1, 17}
Node 16: {6, 10, 9}
Node 17: {15, 13, 12, 5}
Node 18: {13, 5}
Node 19: {3, 9}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 5: 10 3-stars
Node 10: 1 3-star
Node 12: 1 3-star
Node 13: 1 3-star
Node 14: 1 3-star
Node 15: 1 3-star
Node 17: 1 3-star

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (15, 5, 17)>
<5, (1, 15, 17)>
<5, (17, 10, 14)>
<5, (1, 17, 14)>
<5, (1, 17, 10)>
<5, (17, 10, 14)>
<5, (10, 14, 2)>
<5, (17, 14, 2)>
<5, (10, 16, 6)>
<5, (10, 14, 16)>
<10, (5, 16, 6)>
<12, (17, 0, 4)>
<13, (17, 7, 18)>
<14, (5, 10, 16)>
<15, (3, 1, 17)>
<17, (15, 13, 12)>
