Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes can be represented as follows: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.

Now we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

For Node 1:
<1, (0, 4, 6)> (as 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6)
<1, (3, 4, 9)> (as 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9)
<1, (4, 6, 9)> (as 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9)

For Node 2:
<2, (0, 3, 6)> (as 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6)
<2, (3, 5, 7)> (as 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7)
<2, (2, 5, 9)> (as 2 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9)

For Node 3:
<3, (1, 2, 5)> (as 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5)
<3, (1, 5, 7)> (as 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7)
<3, (2, 5, 7)> (as 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7)

For Node 4:
<4, (1, 5, 9)> (as 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9)
<4, (1, 6, 9)> (as 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9)
<4, (5, 6, 7)> (as 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7)

For Node 6:
<6, (1, 4, 9)> (as 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9)
<6, (2, 4, 9)> (as 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9)
<6, (2, 5, 7)> (as 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7)

For Node 9:
<9, (1, 4, 6)> (as 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6)
<9, (3, 4, 7)> (as 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7)
<9, (3, 6, 7)> (as 9 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7)

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 15, so the final answer is [15].
