First, let's organize the edges by their starting nodes:

- Node 0: (0, 14), (0, 13)
- Node 1: (1, 12), (1, 27)
- Node 2: (2, 12), (2, 10), (2, 19), (2, 24)
- Node 3: (3, 12), (3, 29), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 18)
- Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 28), (4, 10), (4, 23)
- Node 5: (5, 11), (5, 17), (5, 3)
- Node 6: (6, 29), (6, 8), (6, 24), (6, 3)
- Node 7: (7, 21), (7, 12), (7, 14), (7, 27)
- Node 8: (8, 21), (8, 6)
- Node 9: (9, 16), (9, 22), (9, 4), (9, 20)
- Node 10: (10, 15), (10, 4), (10, 2)
- Node 11: (11, 16), (11, 14), (11, 5)
- Node 12: (12, 7), (12, 2), (12, 13), (12, 3), (12, 1)
- Node 13: (13, 12), (13, 0), (13, 19)
- Node 14: (14, 11), (14, 7), (14, 0)
- Node 15: (15, 26), (15, 10)
- Node 16: (16, 11), (16, 29), (16, 9)
- Node 17: (17, 20), (17, 19), (17, 5), (17, 18)
- Node 18: (18, 17), (18, 23), (18, 3)
- Node 19: (19, 17), (19, 2), (19, 13)
- Node 20: (20, 9), (20, 17)
- Node 21: (21, 7), (21, 8)
- Node 22: (22, 26), (22, 9)
- Node 23: (23, 25), (23, 18), (23, 4)
- Node 24: (24, 6), (24, 2)
- Node 25: (25, 28), (25, 23)
- Node 26: (26, 22), (26, 28), (26, 15)
- Node 27: (27, 7), (27, 1)
- Node 28: (28, 26), (28, 4), (28, 25)
- Node 29: (29, 16), (29, 6), (29, 3)

Now, let's identify the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 5 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 2 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors
- Node 20: 2 neighbors
- Node 21: 2 neighbors
- Node 22: 2 neighbors
- Node 23: 3 neighbors
- Node 24: 2 neighbors
- Node 25: 2 neighbors
- Node 26: 3 neighbors
- Node 27: 2 neighbors
- Node 28: 3 neighbors
- Node 29: 3 neighbors

Next, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Total 3-stars = \( \sum_{i} \text{inom}(n_i, 3) \), where \( n_i \) is the number of neighbors of node i.
Total 3-stars = \( \text{inom}(4, 3) + \text{inom}(5, 3) + \text{inom}(4, 3) + \text{inom}(5, 3) + \text{inom}(4, 3) + \text{inom}(4, 3) + \text{inom}(4, 3) + \text{inom}(4, 3) + \text{inom}(4, 3) + \text{inom}(3, 3) \)

Total 3-stars = \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 45 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<11, 14, 7>
<16, 9, 4>
<7, 12, 2>
<12, 3, 19>
<9, 20, 17>
<10, 15, 26>
<15, 26, 22>
<21, 8, 6>
<20, 17, 18>
<17, 18, 3>
