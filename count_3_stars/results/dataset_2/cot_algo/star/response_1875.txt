Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighborhood set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 6}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1, 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 3, 3-stars: <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 4, 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 5, 3-stars: <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 6, 3-stars: <6, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, which we will represent as [5].
