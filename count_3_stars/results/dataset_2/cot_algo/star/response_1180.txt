Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 12) (15, 24) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 26) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 25) (7, 4) (7, 20) (7, 28) (7, 23) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 28) (22, 2) (3, 24) (3, 16) (12, 15) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 26) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 25) (21, 15) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 25) (28, 7) (28, 18) (28, 21) (28, 20) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 19) (26, 27) (26, 12) (9, 25) (10, 21) (10, 13) (8, 14) (8, 1) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 29) (16, 18) (16, 3) (16, 21) (17, 0) (17, 23) (25, 4) (25, 14) (25, 21) (25, 9) (2, 22) (2, 14) (2, 11) (6, 12) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 23) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 1) (5, 23) (5, 29) (23, 7) (23, 17) (23, 1) (23, 5) (23, 29) (29, 19) (29, 5) (29, 23) (20, 7) (20, 28) (20, 24) (24, 15) (24, 3) (24, 20) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {14, 17}
- Node 1: {8, 11, 13, 23}
- Node 2: {11, 14, 22}
- Node 3: {16, 24}
- Node 4: {7, 18, 25}
- Node 5: {23, 29}
- Node 6: {12}
- Node 7: {4, 20, 23, 28}
- Node 8: {1, 14}
- Node 9: {25}
- Node 10: {13, 21}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 19}
- Node 12: {6, 15, 26, 27}
- Node 13: {1, 10, 19}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 8, 18, 25}
- Node 15: {12, 21, 24, 27}
- Node 16: {3, 18, 21}
- Node 17: {0, 23}
- Node 18: {4, 14, 16, 28}
- Node 19: {11, 13, 29}
- Node 20: {7, 24, 28}
- Node 21: {10, 15, 16, 25, 28}
- Node 22: {2}
- Node 23: {1, 5, 7, 17, 29}
- Node 24: {3, 15, 20}
- Node 25: {4, 9, 14, 21}
- Node 26: {12, 27}
- Node 27: {12, 15, 26}
- Node 28: {7, 18, 20, 21}
- Node 29: {5, 19, 23}

Now, we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes {12, 21, 27}
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with nodes {15, 25, 28}
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with nodes {12, 15, 26}

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<15, (12, 21, 27)>
<21, (15, 25, 28)>
<27, (12, 15, 26)>
