Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 4, 3}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 3, 6, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {9, 7, 1, 0, 2}
- Node 4: {8, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 1}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 2}
- Node 7: {3, 2, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 7, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8, 3, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
- Node 2: \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 3: \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 7: \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 8: \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 9: \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 1)>
<2, (5, 6, 3)>
<2, (5, 1, 3)>
<3, (9, 1, 0)>
<3, (7, 1, 0)>
<3, (9, 6, 0)>
<3, (7, 6, 0)>
<7, (2, 1, 8)>
<8, (9, 4, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
