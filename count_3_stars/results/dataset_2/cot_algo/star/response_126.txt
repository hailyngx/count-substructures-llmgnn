Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (26, 9) (26, 14) (26, 29) (26, 17) (26, 8) (15, 27) (15, 25) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 22) (27, 13) (14, 9) (14, 26) (14, 17) (14, 18) (17, 26) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (12, 27) (12, 20) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 2) (8, 26) (8, 11) (8, 0) (28, 5) (29, 26) (29, 6) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (13, 27) (13, 5) (13, 6) (3, 9) (3, 6) (21, 19) (21, 23) (21, 22) (2, 4) (2, 22) (2, 23) (2, 7) (2, 25) (22, 27) (22, 21) (22, 2) (22, 10) (0, 8) (10, 22) (10, 16) (6, 29) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 24) (24, 6) (7, 11) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 11) (20, 12) (20, 16) (19, 4) (19, 21) (19, 16) (19, 23) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 25) (23, 21) (23, 2) (23, 19) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 20) (16, 19) (25, 15) (25, 2) (25, 18)

- Node 20 has degree 2
- Node 21 has degree 3
- Node 22 has degree 4
- Node 23 has degree 3
- Node 24 has degree 1
- Node 25 has degree 3
- Node 26 has degree 4

- Node 29 has degree 3

Now we will identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2: <2, (4, 5, 23)>, <2, (5, 7, 25)>, <2, (7, 21, 22)>, <2, (21, 22, 23)>
Node 4: <4, (2, 17, 19)>, <4, (5, 16, 18)>, <4, (16, 19, 23)>
Node 5: <5, (8, 13, 18)>, <5, (13, 16, 6)>, <5, (16, 19, 18)>
Node 6: <6, (3, 13, 29)>, <6, (13, 24, 29)>
Node 8: <8, (1, 11, 26)>
Node 9: <9, (1, 3, 14)>, <9, (3, 26, 1)>, <9, (26, 29, 14)>, <9, (14, 17, 12)>, <9, (14, 17, 18)>
Node 11: <11, (1, 7, 8)>, <11, (7, 2, 11)>
Node 13: <13, (5, 6, 27)>, <13, (6, 27, 29)>, <13, (27, 5, 22)>, <13, (27, 22, 12)>
Node 14: <14, (9, 17, 26)>, <14, (17, 26, 29)>
Node 16: <16, (5, 10, 19)>, <16, (10, 16, 20)>, <16, (19, 20, 16)>
Node 17: <17, (8, 14, 26)>, <17, (14, 17, 18)>
Node 18: <18, (5, 16, 25)>, <18, (16, 18, 19)>
Node 19: <19, (2, 16, 21)>
Node 21: <21, (19, 22, 23)>
Node 22: <22, (2, 21, 27)>
Node 26: <26, (8, 14, 29)>
Node 27: <27, (12, 13, 22)>

After identifying all the unique 3-stars, we find that there are 26 3-stars in total. 
Therefore, the final bracketed number is [26].
