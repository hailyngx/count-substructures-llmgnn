Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (14, 7) (14, 17) (17, 14) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 16) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 1) (19, 16) (1, 7) (1, 19) (1, 15) (1, 0) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 0) (12, 10) (12, 5) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 13) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 13) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 18) (0, 1) (0, 9) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7, 15, 19
- Node 2: 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5, 9, 11
- Node 4: 2, 13
- Node 5: 3, 5, 11, 12, 19
- Node 6: 7, 13, 15
- Node 7: 1, 6, 10, 14
- Node 8: 2, 16
- Node 9: 0, 3, 11
- Node 10: 7, 11, 12
- Node 11: 3, 5, 9, 10
- Node 12: 5, 10
- Node 13: 4, 6, 18
- Node 14: 7, 17
- Node 15: 1, 6, 18
- Node 16: 8, 18, 19
- Node 17: 14
- Node 18: 13, 15, 16, 19
- Node 19: 1, 5, 16, 18

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with it.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with it.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with it.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with it.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with it.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with it.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with it.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with it.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 32 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [32].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (0, 15, 19)>
- <3, (2, 11, 5)>
- <5, (3, 11, 12)>
- <7, (1, 10, 14)>
- <13, (4, 6, 18)>
- <15, (1, 6, 18)>
- <18, (13, 15, 16)>
- <19, (1, 16, 18)>
