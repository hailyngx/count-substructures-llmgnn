Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 15) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (4, 8) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (5, 15) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 10) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 9) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 10) (15, 17) (7, 16) (7, 5) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 17) (18, 14) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 9) (17, 15) (17, 7) (17, 2) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 9) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 9) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 13) 

Response:
First, let's create an adjacency list based on the given edges:

Node 0: {12}
Node 1: {3, 13, 14}
Node 2: {7, 13, 17}
Node 3: {1, 12, 14}
Node 4: {8, 14}
Node 5: {7, 15}
Node 6: {8, 10}
Node 7: {2, 5, 16, 17, 19}
Node 8: {4, 6, 11}
Node 9: {10, 13, 14, 19}
Node 10: {6, 9, 15, 16}
Node 11: {8}
Node 12: {0, 3, 13, 19}
Node 13: {1, 2, 9, 12}
Node 14: {1, 3, 4, 9, 18}
Node 15: {5, 10, 16, 17}
Node 16: {7, 10, 15}
Node 17: {2, 7, 15}
Node 18: {14}
Node 19: {7, 9, 12}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars involving each of these nodes:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 9, 14

Number of 3-stars:
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 13, 14)>
<9, (10, 13, 14)>
<9, (13, 14, 19)>
<9, (14, 19, 7)>
<14, (1, 3, 4),> 
<14, (1, 3, 9)>
<14, (1, 4, 9)>
<14, (3, 4, 9)>
<14, (4, 9, 18)>
<14, (9, 18, 14)>
