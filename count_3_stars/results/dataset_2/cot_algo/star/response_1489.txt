Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 11) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 12) (8, 15) (8, 5) (1, 16) (17, 16) (17, 0) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 16) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 18) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 7) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 18) (2, 10) (2, 19) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more readable format:

- Node 0: {17, 7, 18, 19, 6}
- Node 1: {16}
- Node 2: {10, 19}
- Node 3: {15, 7, 5}
- Node 4: {12}
- Node 5: {15, 8, 3, 10}
- Node 6: {0, 19, 18}
- Node 7: {3, 0, 16}
- Node 8: {15, 5}
- Node 9: {14, 12}
- Node 10: {15, 5, 13, 2, 14}
- Node 11: {15, 14, 13}
- Node 12: {9, 4}
- Node 13: {10, 11, 18}
- Node 14: {9, 10, 11, 18}
- Node 15: {3, 10, 8, 11, 5}
- Node 16: {1, 17, 7}
- Node 17: {16, 0}
- Node 18: {0, 6, 19, 14, 13}
- Node 19: {0, 2, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Number of 3-stars formed by each node:
    - Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
    - Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
    - Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
    - Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
    - Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Node 17: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
    - Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [39].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (6, 18, 19)>
<2, (10, 13, 14)>
<3, (5, 7, 15)>
<5, (10, 15, 11)>
<6, (0, 18, 19)>
<7, (0, 16, 3)>
<10, (13, 14, 18)>
<11, (13, 14, 15)>
<15, (10, 11, 5)>
<16, (0, 7, 17)>
