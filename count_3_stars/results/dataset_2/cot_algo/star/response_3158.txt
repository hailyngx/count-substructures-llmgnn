Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 15) (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 19) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 12) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 17) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (19, 5) (19, 9) (19, 1) (19, 17) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 19) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 4) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 0) (18, 1) (18, 10) (4, 11) (4, 15) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 15) (14, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 18, 19}
- Node 2: {7, 9, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 4: {11, 15}
- Node 5: {7, 19}
- Node 6: {3, 11, 12}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 5, 14}
- Node 8: {10, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {2, 10, 19}
- Node 10: {3, 8, 9, 14, 18}
- Node 11: {4, 6, 8, 17}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 13: {17}
- Node 14: {2, 7, 10, 15}
- Node 15: {4, 14, 16}
- Node 16: {15}
- Node 17: {11, 13, 19}
- Node 18: {1, 10}
- Node 19: {1, 5, 9, 17}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 13, 16
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 12, *)>
<4, (11, 15, *)>
<13, (17, *)>
<16, (15, *)>
