Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 19) (11, 9) (11, 15) (4, 18) (4, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (19, 10) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 0) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 16) (16, 7) (16, 14) (12, 1) (12, 10) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 17) (17, 6) (17, 15) (14, 3) (14, 16) (14, 15) (14, 13) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 15) (0, 13) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 14) (15, 0) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 0) (9, 11) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 13, 15, 19
- Node 1: 3, 12
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 14
- Node 4: 13, 18
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 8, 17, 18
- Node 7: 2, 18, 16, 8
- Node 8: 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 11
- Node 10: 12, 18, 19
- Node 11: 9, 15
- Node 12: 1, 10
- Node 13: 0, 4, 14, 19
- Node 14: 3, 13, 15, 16
- Node 15: 0, 11, 14, 17
- Node 16: 7, 14
- Node 17: 6, 15
- Node 18: 4, 6, 7, 10, 19
- Node 19: 0, 10, 13, 18

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 5 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors

Next, we calculate the number of unique 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 15: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 18: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 19: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get:

\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

And the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 5, 13>
- <0, 5, 15>
- <0, 5, 19>
- <0, 13, 14>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <2, 3, 14>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <7, 8, 16>
- <7, 8, 18>
- <7, 16, 14>
- <7, 16, 18>
- <8, 6, 18>
- <13, 14, 15>
- <13, 14, 19>
- <13, 15, 17>
- <14, 15, 16>
- <15, 17, 6>
- <18, 4, 6>
- <18, 4, 7>
- <18, 4, 19>
- <18, 6, 7>
- <18, 6, 10>
- <18, 7, 16>
- <18, 7, 19>
- <18, 10, 12>
- <18, 10, 19>
- <18, 10, 4>
- <18, 10, 6>
- <19, 0, 13>
- <19, 0, 15>
- <19, 0, 18>
- <19, 0, 5>
