Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 4) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {3, 6, 8}. <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {4, 5, 7}. <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {1, 6, 9}. <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {0, 5, 9}. <7, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
