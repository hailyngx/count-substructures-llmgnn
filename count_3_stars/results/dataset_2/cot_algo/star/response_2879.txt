Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 3) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 9) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 14}
- Node 1: {8, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 11, 12, 13, 5}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {3, 9, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 5: {2, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 4, 9, 11}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {2, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 4, 8, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 8, 9, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes forming 3-stars:
- Node 1: \(C(4,3) = 4\)
- Node 2: \(C(6,3) = 20\)
- Node 4: \(C(5,3) = 10\)
- Node 7: \(C(5,3) = 10\)
- Node 8: \(C(4,3) = 4\)
- Node 9: \(C(5,3) = 10\)
- Node 10: \(C(4,3) = 4\)
- Node 11: \(C(5,3) = 10\)
- Node 13: \(C(4,3) = 4\)
- Node 14: \(C(5,3) = 10\)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 82

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [82].

List of unique 3-stars:
- <2, (3, 7, 11)>
- <4, (3, 9, 10)>
- <7, (2, 6, 11)>
- <8, (1, 13, 14)>
- <9, (1, 4, 14)>
- <10, (1, 4, 11)>
- <13, (2, 8, 11)>
- <14, (1, 9, 12)>
