Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
Given the edge list provided, we can create the following adjacency list for the graph:

1: {14, 6, 4}

2: {6, 7, 4}

3: {0, 6, 10}

4: {14, 2, 1, 11, 10}

5: {9, 12, 11}

6: {14, 2, 1, 10, 3, 12}

7: {8, 13, 14, 2, 11}

8: {13, 10, 12, 7}

9: {5, 11, 0, 12}

10: {8, 6, 3, 12, 4}

11: {5, 9, 7, 12, 4}

12: {5, 9, 8, 6, 11, 10}

13: {8, 7}

14: {6, 1, 7, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1: Has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
<1, (14, 6, 4)>

2. Node 2: Has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
<2, (6, 7, 4)>

3. Node 3: Has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
<3, (0, 6, 10)>

4. Node 4: Has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<4, (14, 2, 1)>, <4, (14, 2, 11)>, <4, (14, 2, 10)>, <4, (14, 1, 11)>, <4, (14, 1, 10)>, <4, (14, 11, 10)>, <4, (2, 1, 11)>, <4, (2, 1, 10)>, <4, (2, 11, 10)>, <4, (1, 11, 10)>

5. Node 5: Has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
<5, (9, 12, 11)>

6. Node 6: Has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
<6, (14, 10, 12)>, <6, (14, 3, 12)>, <6, (14, 10, 3)>, <6, (14, 10, 4)>, <6, (14, 6, 1)>, <6, (14, 6, 2)>, <6, (14, 6, 4)>, <6, (14, 1, 2)>, <6, (14, 1, 4)>, <6, (14, 2, 4)>, <6, (10, 3, 12)>, <6, (10, 3, 4)>, <6, (10, 12, 4)>, <6, (3, 12, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 10)>, <6, (2, 4, 10)>, <6, (6, 1, 2)>, <6, (6, 1, 4)>, <6, (6, 2, 4)>

7. Node 7: Has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<7, (8, 13, 14)>, <7, (8, 2, 11)>, <7, (8, 2, 10)>, <7, (8, 7, 13)>, <7, (8, 7, 11)>, <7, (8, 7, 14)>, <7, (13, 2, 11)>, <7, (13, 2, 10)>, <7, (2, 11, 14)>, <7, (7, 11, 14)>

8. Node 8: Has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
<8, (13, 7, 14)>

9. Node 9: Has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<9, (5, 11, 12)>, <9, (5, 11, 9)>, <9, (5, 11, 7)>, <9, (11, 12, 7)>

10. Node 10: Has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<10, (6, 3, 12)>, <10, (6, 3, 4)>, <10, (6, 12, 4)>, <10, (3, 12, 4)>, <10, (1, 2, 4)>, <10, (1, 4, 14)>, <10, (2, 4, 14)>, <10, (6, 1, 2)>, <10, (6, 1, 4)>, <10, (6, 2, 4)>

11. Node 11: Has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<11, (5, 7, 11)>, <11, (7, 12, 4)>, <11, (7, 12, 11)>, <7, (12, 4, 11)>, <11, (4, 10, 12)>, <11, (4, 10, 11)>, <11, (10, 12, 11)>, <11, (4, 12, 10)>, <11, (4, 12, 11)>, <11, (10, 12, 11)>

12. Node 12: Has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
<12, (5, 8, 9)>, <12, (8, 6, 10)>, <12, (6, 11, 4)>, <12, (8, 6, 12)>, <12, (6, 11, 10)>, <12, (6, 11, 4)>, <12, (8, 10, 12)>, <12, (6, 10, 4)>, <12, (6, 4, 11)>, <12, (6, 4, 10)>, <12, (6, 11, 10)>, <12, (6, 11, 4)>, <12, (10, 4, 11)>, <12, (10, 4, 6)>, <12, (10, 11, 4)>, <12, (10, 11, 6)>, <12, (4, 11, 6)>, <12, (4, 6, 10)>, <12, (4, 6, 11)>, <12, (11, 10, 6)>

13. Node 13: Has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

14. Node 14: Has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<14, (6, 1, 4)>, <14, (2, 7, 4)>, <14, (6, 2, 4)>, <14, (1, 7, 4)>

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we have a total of 82 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [82].
