Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 42
Therefore, the final answer is [42].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 5, 7)>
