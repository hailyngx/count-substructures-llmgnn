Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 4) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 4) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 10) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {6, 7, 9, 11, 8}
- Node 2: {9, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 14}
- Node 5: {4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 6, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {1, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 10}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 11}
- Node 14: {4, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with {7, 9, 11}
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with {1, 4, 14}

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <6, (7, 9, 11)> and <9, (1, 4, 14)>.
