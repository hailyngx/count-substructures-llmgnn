Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 26) (11, 2) (16, 11) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 14) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 23) (21, 18) (21, 25) (21, 22) (5, 11) (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 10) (18, 21) (18, 12) (22, 21) (22, 17) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 4) (25, 21) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 28) (25, 24) (13, 26) (13, 12) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 28) (27, 12) (27, 14) (27, 3) (27, 23) (0, 11) (0, 20) (0, 3) (15, 9) (6, 25) (6, 7) (28, 25) (28, 12) (26, 11) (26, 13) (26, 10) (29, 1) (29, 20) (29, 24) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 7) (23, 21) (23, 27) (2, 11) (2, 19) (10, 9) (10, 26) (10, 4) (10, 14) (3, 27) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 4) (17, 9) (17, 22) (17, 3) (17, 4) (14, 1) (14, 27) (14, 10) (14, 3) (7, 6) (7, 19) (24, 25) (24, 29) (4, 20) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {11, 20, 3}
- Node 1: {21, 29, 14, 19}
- Node 2: {11, 19}
- Node 3: {27, 0, 17, 14, 4}
- Node 4: {20, 10, 3, 17}
- Node 5: {11, 9}
- Node 6: {25, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 19}
- Node 9: {5, 15, 17, 10}
- Node 10: {9, 26, 4, 14}
- Node 11: {16, 0, 5, 26, 2}
- Node 12: {18, 13, 27, 28}
- Node 13: {26, 12}
- Node 14: {1, 27, 10, 3}
- Node 15: {9}
- Node 16: {11}
- Node 17: {9, 22, 3, 4}
- Node 18: {21, 12}
- Node 19: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 20: {25, 0, 29, 4}
- Node 21: {1, 23, 18, 25, 22}
- Node 22: {21, 17}
- Node 23: {21, 27}
- Node 24: {25, 29}
- Node 25: {21, 20, 6, 28, 24}
- Node 26: {11, 13, 10}
- Node 27: {12, 14, 3, 23}
- Node 28: {25, 12}
- Node 29: {1, 20, 24}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0, 3 neighbors: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1, 4 neighbors: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3, 5 neighbors: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 4, 4 neighbors: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9, 4 neighbors: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 10, 4 neighbors: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 11, 5 neighbors: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 12, 4 neighbors: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 14, 4 neighbors: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 17, 4 neighbors: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 20, 4 neighbors: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 21, 5 neighbors: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 25, 5 neighbors: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 27, 4 neighbors: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 29, 3 neighbors: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 70

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].
