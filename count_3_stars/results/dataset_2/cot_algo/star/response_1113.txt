Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 10) (8, 11) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: Neighbors {12, 1, 2, 5, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {12, 6, 9, 0}
- Node 2: Neighbors {12, 5, 9, 3, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 2, 14, 13, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 7, 2, 0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 1, 14, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {10, 12, 6, 14, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {10, 11}
- Node 9: Neighbors {10, 1, 2, 3, 13}
- Node 10: Neighbors {11, 8, 7, 13, 9}
- Node 11: Neighbors {10, 8}
- Node 12: Neighbors {7, 2, 0, 1}
- Node 13: Neighbors {10, 6, 3, 14, 0}
- Node 14: Neighbors {7, 6, 3, 13}

Node 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13 all have 3 or more neighbors, so we will count the number of 3-stars they form.

- Node 0 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 74

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [74].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 14)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (5, 10, 12)>, <9, (1, 2, 10)>, <10, (7, 9, 13)>, <13, (3, 7, 10)>.
