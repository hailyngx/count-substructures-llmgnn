Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 8) (4, 16) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 6) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 7) (18, 2) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (19, 9) (19, 14) (15, 4) (15, 14) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 2) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 15) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {6, 8, 11}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 6, 10}
- Node 2: {13, 18}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 15, 16}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 8, 10}
- Node 7: {5, 13, 12, 18}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 17}
- Node 9: {14, 19}
- Node 10: {1, 5, 6, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 5, 16, 17}
- Node 12: {3, 7, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 7, 10}
- Node 14: {12, 15, 19}
- Node 15: {4, 14}
- Node 16: {4, 11}
- Node 17: {8, 11}
- Node 18: {2, 7}
- Node 19: {9, 14}

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph:
Node 1, 5, 10, 13, and 14 each have 5 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 20

Therefore, the final answer is [20] and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 10)>, <5, (1, 7, 10)>, <10, (1, 5, 13)>, <13, (2, 7, 10)>, <14, (12, 15, 19)>.
