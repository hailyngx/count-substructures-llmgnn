The edges are as follows: (12, 24) (12, 29) (27, 10) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 26) (16, 28) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 25) (28, 16) (28, 13) (28, 10) (28, 15) (7, 9) (25, 16) (25, 22) (25, 21) (0, 16) (0, 21) (0, 29) (0, 23) (5, 17) (5, 3) (26, 4) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 29) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 14) (23, 0) (23, 13) (11, 24) (24, 12) (24, 4) (24, 11) (24, 13) (24, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (17, 5) (17, 19) (17, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 17) (29, 12) (29, 0) (29, 18) (29, 21) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 24) (2, 1) (2, 14) (20, 8) (20, 22) (20, 10) (21, 25) (21, 0) (21, 29) (21, 9) (9, 7) (9, 21) (9, 15) (9, 13) (15, 28) (15, 18) (15, 9) (22, 16) (22, 25) (22, 20) (14, 19) (14, 1) (14, 2) (8, 6) (8, 20) (10, 27) (10, 28) (10, 1) (10, 20) (13, 28) (13, 23) (13, 24) (13, 1) (13, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {16, 21, 23}
- Node 1: {2, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 14, 24}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 17}
- Node 4: {19, 24, 26}
- Node 5: {3, 17}
- Node 6: {3, 8}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {6, 20}
- Node 9: {7, 13, 15, 21}
- Node 10: {1, 20, 27, 28}
- Node 11: {24}
- Node 12: {24, 29}
- Node 13: {1, 9, 23, 24, 28}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 19}
- Node 15: {9, 18, 28}
- Node 16: {0, 22, 25, 28}
- Node 17: {3, 5, 19}
- Node 18: {15, 19, 29}
- Node 19: {4, 14, 17, 18}
- Node 20: {8, 10, 22}
- Node 21: {0, 9, 25, 29}
- Node 22: {16, 20, 25}
- Node 23: {0, 13}
- Node 24: {2, 4, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 25: {16, 21, 22}
- Node 26: {4}
- Node 27: {10}
- Node 28: {10, 13, 15, 16}
- Node 29: {0, 12, 18, 21}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 33 \).

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [33], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 16, 21, 23>
- <1, 2, 10, 13>
- <1, 2, 13, 14>
- <1, 9, 13, 15>
- <9, 13, 15, 28>
- <16, 22, 25>
- <19, 21, 25, 29>
