Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (14, 17) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 2) (8, 11) (8, 2) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 7) (5, 15) (6, 19) (6, 4) (0, 11) (0, 9) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (18, 19) (18, 15) (7, 16) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 9) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 9) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 19) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 9}
- Node 1: {11, 17, 12, 10}
- Node 2: {8, 17, 7}
- Node 3: {16, 13, 4, 10}
- Node 4: {6, 3}
- Node 5: {15}
- Node 6: {19, 4}
- Node 7: {16, 13, 2, 12, 10}
- Node 8: {11, 2}
- Node 9: {0, 12, 19}
- Node 10: {7, 1, 3}
- Node 11: {16, 1, 0, 8}
- Node 12: {7, 1, 9}
- Node 13: {17, 3, 7, 19}
- Node 14: {17, 15}
- Node 15: {14, 18, 5}
- Node 16: {11, 7, 3}
- Node 17: {14, 1, 13, 2}
- Node 18: {15, 19}
- Node 19: {13, 6, 18, 9}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors that can form a 3-star: 1, 3, 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 31

Therefore, the final answer is [31], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (11, 17, 12)>
<3, (16, 13, 4)>
<7, (16, 13, 2)>
<11, (16, 1, 0)>
<13, (17, 3, 19)>
<15, (14, 18, 5)>
<17, (14, 1, 13)>
<19, (13, 6, 18)>
