Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 6) (3, 25) (3, 4) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 29) (25, 10) (10, 25) (10, 11) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 14) (11, 5) (8, 23) (8, 28) (8, 17) (23, 11) (23, 8) (4, 3) (4, 12) (6, 13) (6, 22) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 12) (28, 8) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 1) (18, 19) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 29) (12, 19) (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 5) (1, 0) (14, 11) (14, 26) (14, 7) (14, 16) (26, 14) (26, 21) (24, 27) (7, 14) (7, 27) (19, 18) (19, 12) (19, 2) (19, 0) (29, 25) (29, 12) (0, 28) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 17) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 15) (21, 26) (21, 15) (21, 17) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 1) (27, 24) (27, 7) (27, 20) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 15) (17, 8) (17, 0) (17, 21) (9, 10) (20, 27) (15, 2) (15, 21) (15, 16) 

Response:
First, let's clarify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 17, 19, 28}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 28}
- Node 2: {3, 13, 15, 16, 19}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 25}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 12}
- Node 5: {1, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {1, 12, 13, 22, 28}
- Node 7: {14, 20, 27}
- Node 8: {17, 23, 28}
- Node 9: {10}
- Node 10: {9, 11, 25}
- Node 11: {5, 10, 14, 23}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 6, 19, 29}
- Node 13: {2, 6, 16, 22}
- Node 14: {7, 11, 16, 26}
- Node 15: {2, 16, 21}
- Node 16: {2, 13, 14, 15}
- Node 17: {0, 8, 21, 28}
- Node 18: {19}
- Node 19: {0, 2, 12, 18}
- Node 20: {7, 27}
- Node 21: {15, 17, 26}
- Node 22: {6, 13}
- Node 23: {8, 11}
- Node 24: {27}
- Node 25: {3, 10, 29}
- Node 26: {14, 21}
- Node 27: {7, 20, 24}
- Node 28: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 29: {12, 25}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 6, Node 8, Node 12, and Node 28 have 4 neighbors.
- Node 3, Node 5, Node 10, Node 11, Node 13, Node 14, Node 16, Node 17, Node 19, Node 25, and Node 21 have 3 neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{7}{3} + \binom{11}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \)

Number of 3-stars = 35 + 165 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4
Number of 3-stars = 208

So, the total number of 3-stars is [208].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 17, 28)>
- <1, (0, 5, 28)>
- <2, (3, 15, 16)>
- <6, (1, 12, 28)>
- <8, (17, 21, 28)>
- <12, (4, 5, 29)>
- <28, (0, 1, 6)>
