Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {5, 9, 6}
- Node 1: {9, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 1, 3, 8, 4}
- Node 3: {7, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 1, 6, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 2, 4, 0, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {9, 2}
- Node 9: {8, 4, 1, 7, 0}

Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars involving these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 59, so the final answer is [59].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (5, 9, 6)>
- <1, (9, 2, 4)>
- <1, (9, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (5, 1, 4)>
- <2, (5, 3, 8)>
- <2, (5, 4, 0)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 7, 3)>
- <4, (5, 1, 6)>
- <4, (5, 2, 6)>
- <4, (5, 0, 6)>
- <4, (9, 1, 7)>
- <4, (9, 4, 7)>
- <5, (6, 4, 0)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 7, 3)>
- <5, (4, 9, 1)>
- <5, (4, 1, 7)>
- <6, (5, 7, 4)>
- <6, (0, 7, 3)>
- <6, (4, 9, 1)>
- <6, (4, 1, 7)>
- <7, (5, 9, 1)>
- <7, (5, 4, 1)>
- <7, (9, 4, 1)>
- <9, (8, 2, 4)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (7, 3, 2)>
