Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 12, 8, 13, 6
Node 1: 7, 2, 14, 6
Node 2: 8, 1, 6, 14
Node 3: 9, 7, 12
Node 4: 7, 11, 6
Node 5: 13, 10, 14
Node 6: 4, 2, 0, 14, 1
Node 7: 4, 3, 11, 13, 1
Node 8: 9, 2, 10, 0
Node 9: 8, 11, 10, 3, 13
Node 10: 5, 9, 8
Node 11: 4, 9, 7, 12
Node 12: 0, 11, 3
Node 13: 5, 9, 7, 0, 14
Node 14: 5, 2, 6, 1, 13

Now, we will identify the 3-stars:

Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 13, 10, 14. That forms one 3-star: <5, (13, 10, 14)>
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 8, 11, 10, 3, 13. That forms 10 3-stars: 
<9, (8, 11, 10)>, <9, (8, 11, 3)>, <9, (8, 11, 13)>, <9, (8, 10, 3)>, <9, (8, 10, 13)>, <9, (8, 3, 13)>, <9, (11, 10, 3)>, <9, (11, 10, 13)>, <9, (11, 3, 13)>, <9, (10, 3, 13)>
Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 5, 9, 7, 0, 14. That forms 10 3-stars: 
<13, (5, 9, 7)>, <13, (5, 9, 0)>, <13, (5, 9, 14)>, <13, (5, 7, 0)>, <13, (5, 7, 14)>, <13, (5, 0, 14)>, <13, (9, 7, 0)>, <13, (9, 7, 14)>, <13, (9, 0, 14)>, <13, (7, 0, 14)>

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 = 21

Therefore, the final answer is [21].
