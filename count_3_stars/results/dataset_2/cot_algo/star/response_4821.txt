Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 8) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 4) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 6) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 11, 13
Node 1: 0, 6, 11, 14
Node 2: 6, 10, 12, 14
Node 3: 5, 7, 8, 9, 10
Node 4: 0, 9, 11
Node 5: 3, 6
Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 5, 12, 13
Node 7: 3, 8, 9
Node 8: 3, 7, 10, 13
Node 9: 3, 4, 7, 12
Node 10: 2, 3, 8, 11, 14
Node 11: 0, 1, 4, 10, 13
Node 12: 2, 6, 9
Node 13: 0, 6, 8, 11
Node 14: 1, 2, 10

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each:

Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 6: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 11: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 80

Therefore, the final answer is [80], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 11>
<0, 1, 13>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 14>
<0, 11, 13>
<0, 11, 4>
<0, 11, 6>
<0, 13, 6>
<1, 10, 14>
<1, 11, 10>
<2, 10, 14>
<3, 9, 12>
<3, 9, 7>
<3, 10, 8>
<6, 12, 9>
