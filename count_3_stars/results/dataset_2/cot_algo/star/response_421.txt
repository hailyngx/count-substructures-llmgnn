Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 24) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 23) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 29) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 24) (27, 20) (14, 4) (17, 1) (17, 11) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 15) (6, 23) (8, 9) (23, 9) (23, 6) (23, 29) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 13) (12, 5) (12, 7) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 24) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 7) (3, 2) (11, 17) (11, 2) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 4) (25, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 25) (22, 27) (22, 28) (22, 10) (16, 5) (16, 21) (16, 13) (16, 18) (21, 16) (21, 19) (21, 18) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 22) (24, 5) (24, 27) (24, 6) (24, 7) (24, 1) (4, 14) (4, 25) (15, 6) (26, 25) (26, 29) (20, 27) (29, 0) (29, 23) (29, 26) (13, 7) (13, 16) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 21) (28, 22) (28, 19) (19, 1) (19, 21) (19, 28) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 9, 27, 10, 29
- Node 1: 17, 10, 24, 19, 18
- Node 2: 5, 3, 11, 25
- Node 3: 7, 2
- Node 4: 14, 25
- Node 5: 9, 2, 12, 24, 16
- Node 6: 9, 24, 15, 23
- Node 7: 12, 25, 3, 24, 13
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8, 23, 0
- Node 10: 0, 1, 22
- Node 11: 17, 2
- Node 12: 5, 7
- Node 13: 7, 16
- Node 14: 4
- Node 15: 6
- Node 16: 5, 21, 13, 18
- Node 17: 1, 11
- Node 18: 1, 16, 21
- Node 19: 1, 21, 28
- Node 20: 27
- Node 21: 16, 19, 18
- Node 22: 27, 28, 10
- Node 23: 9, 6, 29
- Node 24: 5, 27, 6, 7, 1
- Node 25: 7, 26, 4, 2
- Node 26: 25, 29
- Node 27: 0, 22, 24, 20
- Node 28: 22, 19
- Node 29: 0, 23, 26

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9, Node 10, Node 16, Node 18, Node 21, Node 22, Node 24, Node 25, Node 27, Node 29

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes. Since these nodes have three or more neighbors, they can potentially form 3-stars.
Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors, we compute the number of possible 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 64

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [64]. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (9, 27, 10)>
<1, (17, 19, 18)>
<2, (5, 3, 25)>
<5, (9, 12, 24)>
<6, (9, 24, 23)>
<7, (12, 25, 13)>
<9, (5, 6, 23)>
<10, (0, 1, 22)>
<16, (5, 21, 18)>
<18, (1, 21, 19)>
<21, (16, 19, 18)>
<22, (27, 28, 10)>
<24, (5, 27, 6)>
<25, (7, 26, 4)>
<27, (0, 22, 20)>
<29, (23, 26, 0)>
