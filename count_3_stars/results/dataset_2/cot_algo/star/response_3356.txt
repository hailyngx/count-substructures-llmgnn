Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 8) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 19) (26, 3) (26, 27) (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 28) (27, 26) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 16) (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 6) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 12) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 2) (25, 17) (25, 20) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (19, 26) (19, 21) (19, 6) (22, 2) (22, 16) (16, 27) (16, 22) (16, 28) (16, 12) (28, 15) (28, 16) (28, 8) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 28) (2, 14) (2, 20) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 4) (18, 11) (18, 7) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 24) (24, 6) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 23) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 23) (5, 4) (23, 9) (23, 12) (23, 5) (23, 29) (7, 18) (7, 13) (29, 23) (1, 2) (1, 4) (21, 27) (21, 19) (3, 26) (3, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (13, 7) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {15, 20, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {14, 20, 22, 4}
- Node 3: {26, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 1}
- Node 5: {10, 0, 23, 4}
- Node 6: {17, 0, 19, 24}
- Node 7: {18, 13}
- Node 8: {9, 15, 11, 28}
- Node 9: {26, 8, 23}
- Node 10: {11, 5}
- Node 11: {10, 18, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {11, 23, 16}
- Node 13: {7, 3}
- Node 14: {17, 2}
- Node 15: {27, 0, 8, 28}
- Node 16: {27, 22, 28, 12}
- Node 17: {14, 25, 6}
- Node 18: {11, 7}
- Node 19: {26, 21, 6}
- Node 20: {25, 0, 2}
- Node 21: {27, 19}
- Node 22: {2, 16}
- Node 23: {9, 12, 5, 29}
- Node 24: {6}
- Node 25: {17, 20}
- Node 26: {9, 19, 3, 27}
- Node 27: {26, 15, 21, 16}
- Node 28: {15, 16, 8}
- Node 29: {23}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they can form:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9, Node 11, Node 12, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 20, Node 26, and Node 27 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 20 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 27 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [49].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (15, 20, 4)>, <0, (15, 5, 4)>, <0, (15, 20, 6)>, <0, (15, 5, 6)>, <0, (20, 2, 4)>, <0, (20, 2, 6)>, <0, (2, 14, 4)>, <0, (2, 14, 6)>, <2, (14, 17, 6)>, <4, (2, 14, 1)>, <5, (10, 23, 4)>, <6, (17, 19, 6)>, <8, (9, 15, 11)>, <8, (15, 28, 8)>, <8, (9, 8, 15)>, <8, (15, 27, 8)>, <9, (26, 9, 23)>, <11, (10, 11, 8)>, <11, (11, 18, 8)>, <11, (8, 11, 12)>, <15, (27, 15, 28)>, <16, (27, 16, 28)>, <16, (27, 22, 16)>, <16, (27, 16, 12)>, <17, (14, 17, 6)>, <20, (25, 20, 0)>, <26, (9, 26, 19)>, <26, (19, 21, 6)>, <27, (26, 27, 15)>, <27, (16, 27, 1)>.
