Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 1) (20, 22) (15, 7) (15, 18) (3, 11) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 6) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (21, 3) (21, 22) (21, 29) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 1) (17, 12) (17, 2) (18, 15) (18, 23) (18, 29) (19, 25) (19, 7) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 8) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (14, 27) (14, 28) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 22) (2, 17) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 25) (5, 0) (5, 10) (23, 18) (23, 12) (23, 9) (16, 13) (16, 9) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 24) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 23) (9, 16) (9, 27) (26, 27) (26, 12) (29, 21) (29, 18) (29, 10) (24, 7) (24, 12) (12, 17) (12, 23) (12, 26) (12, 24) (27, 14) (27, 9) (27, 26) (27, 8) (27, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 25) (8, 1) (8, 27) (8, 22) (25, 19) (25, 2) (25, 4) (25, 22) (22, 20) (22, 21) (22, 28) (22, 8) (22, 25) (10, 5) (10, 29) (10, 27) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 5, 1
Node 1: 0, 13, 6, 8
Node 2: 17, 6, 9, 25
Node 3: 11, 21, 28, 6
Node 4: 11, 13, 25
Node 5: 0, 10
Node 6: 3, 1, 2
Node 7: 15, 19, 24
Node 8: 1, 27, 22
Node 9: 11, 2, 23, 16, 27, 10
Node 10: 5, 29, 27
Node 11: 3, 9, 4
Node 12: 17, 23, 26, 24
Node 13: 16, 4, 1
Node 14: 27, 28
Node 15: 7, 18
Node 16: 13, 9
Node 17: 12, 2
Node 18: 15, 23, 29
Node 19: 25, 7
Node 20: 22
Node 21: 3, 22, 29
Node 22: 20, 21, 28, 8, 25
Node 23: 18, 12, 9
Node 24: 7, 12
Node 25: 19, 2, 4, 22
Node 26: 27, 12
Node 27: 14, 9, 26, 8, 10
Node 28: 3, 22, 14
Node 29: 21, 18, 10

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 51

Therefore, the final answer is [51]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (6, 8, 13)>
<2, (17, 25, 9)>
<3, (11, 21, 28)>
<4, (11, 13, 25)>
<9, (11, 16, 27)>
<12, (17, 23, 26)>
<13, (4, 1, 16)>
<15, (7, 18, 24)>
<18, (15, 23, 29)>
<22, (8, 25, 28)>
<27, (8, 10, 14)>
