Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 8) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 4) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 13) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 1) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 9) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {10, 4, 2}
- Node 1: {7, 6, 2, 5, 10, 4}
- Node 2: {7, 3, 1, 0, 5}
- Node 3: {11, 6, 9, 2, 8}
- Node 4: {11, 1, 0, 10, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 6: {7, 3, 1}
- Node 7: {12, 6, 14, 2, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 12, 3}
- Node 9: {3, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 0, 4}
- Node 11: {3, 14, 9, 13, 4}
- Node 12: {7, 13, 14, 8}
- Node 13: {12, 11, 9}
- Node 14: {7, 12, 11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

The total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 73 \), so the answer is [73].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (7, 10, 4)>, 
<3, (11, 9, 13)>, 
<4, (11, 1, 10)>, 
<7, (12, 14, 8)>, 
<11, (14, 9, 13)>.
