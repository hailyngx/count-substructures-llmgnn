Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars each node is part of:

- Node 1 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 10 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 13 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 15 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 16 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 17 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 21 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 27 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 28 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get:

\[ [4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1] = [60] \]

Therefore, there are 60 unique 3-stars in this graph.
