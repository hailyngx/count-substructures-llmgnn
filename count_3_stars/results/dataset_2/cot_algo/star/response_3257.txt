Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 7, 8}

Now, we can calculate the 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
