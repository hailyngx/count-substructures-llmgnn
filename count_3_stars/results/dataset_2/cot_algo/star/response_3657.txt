Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 6) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 10, 11
- Node 2: 10, 11, 13
- Node 3: 6, 7, 8, 11, 13
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6, 9, 11
- Node 5: 1, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14
- Node 6: 3, 4, 8, 14
- Node 7: 3, 9, 12
- Node 8: 3, 6, 9, 14
- Node 9: 0, 4, 7, 8, 11
- Node 10: 1, 2
- Node 11: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 12: 5, 7, 14
- Node 13: 2, 3, 5
- Node 14: 5, 6, 8, 12

Next, we'll identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, Node 9, Node 11, Node 14

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 74

Therefore, the final answer is [74], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (4, 5, 11)>
- <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- <5, (1, 11, 13)>
- <9, (4, 7, 11)>
- <11, (1, 5, 9)>
- <14, (6, 8, 12)>
