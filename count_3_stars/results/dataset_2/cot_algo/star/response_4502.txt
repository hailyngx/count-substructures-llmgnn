Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 5) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 7) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 5) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 4) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 2, 14, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 2, 14, 13, 4, 0}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 8, 9, 6, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 0, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 10, 13, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {11, 7, 4, 12}
- Node 6: Neighbors {10, 2, 14, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {10, 8, 9, 6, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 9, 12, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {11, 2, 8, 7}
- Node 10: Neighbors {6, 7, 4}
- Node 11: Neighbors {9, 13, 5}
- Node 12: Neighbors {3, 8, 0, 5}
- Node 13: Neighbors {11, 1, 4}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 0, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
   - <0, (1, 3, 2)>
   - <0, (1, 2, 14)>
   - <0, (1, 2, 12)>
   - <0, (1, 14, 12)>
   - <0, (3, 2, 12)>
   - <0, (2, 14, 12)>
   - <0, (1, 2, 6)>
   - <0, (1, 12, 5)>
   - <0, (2, 6, 14)>
   - <0, (12, 5, 8)>

- Node 1: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
   - <1, (3, 2, 14)>
   - <1, (3, 14, 13)>
   - <1, (2, 13, 4)>
   - <1, (14, 13, 4)>
   - <1, (3, 4, 0)>
   - <1, (2, 0, 12)>
   - <1, (3, 2, 0)>
   - <1, (14, 4, 5)>
   - <1, (13, 4, 5)>
   - <1, (2, 4, 10)>
   - <1, (13, 4, 11)>
   - <1, (4, 10, 7)>
   - <1, (4, 7, 6)>
   - <1, (4, 7, 5)>
   - <1, (4, 6, 2)>
   - <1, (4, 6, 10)>
   - <1, (4, 10, 5)>
   - <1, (4, 7, 9)>
   - <1, (4, 11, 13)>
   - <1, (4, 13, 11)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10 + 20] = [30].
