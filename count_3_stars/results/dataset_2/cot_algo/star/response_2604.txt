Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 0) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {9, 2, 3, 5, 1}
- Node 1: {8, 0}
- Node 2: {6, 4, 7, 8, 3, 0}
- Node 3: {4, 2, 8, 0, 5}
- Node 4: {6, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {8, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 2, 8, 4}
- Node 7: {6, 9}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 2, 5, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 7, 0}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 20 = 61

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [61].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 1>, <0, 5, 1>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 8, 1>, <3, 5, 8>, <5, 8, 1>
