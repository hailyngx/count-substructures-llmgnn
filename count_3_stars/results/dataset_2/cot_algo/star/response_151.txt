Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 8}

Now, we check each node that has three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars it can form:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 49.
So, the final answer is [49].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
