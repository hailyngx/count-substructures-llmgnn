Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 10) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 18) (26, 21) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 13) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 2) (14, 11) (14, 22) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 5) (18, 26) (18, 15) (18, 22) (18, 12) (22, 14) (22, 18) (22, 19) (22, 27) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 28) (8, 1) (23, 8) (23, 20) (23, 12) (5, 17) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 25) (6, 4) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 10) (21, 26) (21, 28) (21, 27) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 0) (20, 15) (20, 23) (20, 7) (11, 14) (11, 24) (11, 27) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 19) (29, 9) (29, 16) (19, 22) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 0) (24, 11) (24, 7) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 29) (25, 6) (25, 13) (13, 3) (13, 25) (13, 10) (7, 20) (7, 24) (7, 27) (0, 28) (0, 19) (4, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 13) (27, 22) (27, 21) (27, 11) (27, 7) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 23) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated according to the rules mentioned earlier. Let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {19, 28}
- Node 1: {8, 17, 19}
- Node 2: {8, 10, 15}
- Node 3: {10, 13, 16}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {6, 17}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 25}
- Node 7: {20, 24, 27}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 19, 23, 28}
- Node 9: {10, 12, 26, 29}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {14, 24, 27}
- Node 12: {9, 18, 23}
- Node 13: {3, 10, 25}
- Node 14: {11, 22}
- Node 15: {2, 18, 20}
- Node 16: {3, 17, 29}
- Node 17: {1, 5, 16}
- Node 18: {12, 15, 22, 26}
- Node 19: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 20: {7, 15, 23}
- Node 21: {26, 27, 28}
- Node 22: {14, 18, 19, 27}
- Node 23: {8, 12, 20}
- Node 24: {7, 11}
- Node 25: {6, 13}
- Node 26: {9, 18, 21}
- Node 27: {7, 11, 21, 22}
- Node 28: {0, 8, 21}
- Node 29: {9, 16}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars, that is, nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, Node 8, Node 10, Node 18, Node 19, Node 27, and Node 28 can form 3-stars.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 18: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 19: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 27: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 28: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 25

Therefore, the final answer is [25], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, 8, 28>, <8, 1, 19>, <8, 1, 17>, <8, 1, 23>, <8, 1, 28>, <10, 2, 3>, <10, 2, 13>, <10, 2, 9>, <10, 3, 13>, <18, 22, 27>, <18, 15, 20>, <18, 12, 23>, <19, 1, 8>, <27, 11, 7>, <27, 22, 14>, <27, 21, 28>, <27, 21, 22>, <27, 21, 26>, <27, 22, 19>, <28, 8, 0>, <28, 21, 27>, <28, 21, 26>, <28, 21, 22>, <28, 21, 27>
