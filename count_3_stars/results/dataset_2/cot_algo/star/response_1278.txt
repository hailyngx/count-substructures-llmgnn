Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 15) (0, 24) (0, 2) (27, 24) (27, 20) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 21) (22, 23) (22, 15) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 25) (23, 28) (2, 0) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 2) (18, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 17) (28, 23) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 4) (28, 10) (21, 3) (21, 28) (11, 17) (11, 29) (19, 5) (19, 24) (19, 13) (19, 20) (9, 2) (9, 29) (9, 10) (29, 11) (29, 9) (29, 25) (29, 4) (7, 18) (7, 16) (7, 15) (16, 7) (26, 23) (26, 8) (15, 0) (15, 22) (15, 7) (15, 25) (17, 6) (17, 11) (20, 27) (20, 19) (20, 14) (20, 10) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 14) (24, 0) (24, 27) (24, 19) (24, 25) (25, 23) (25, 29) (25, 15) (25, 24) (8, 1) (8, 26) (8, 12) (14, 20) (14, 13) (14, 10) (4, 5) (4, 28) (4, 29) (10, 28) (10, 9) (10, 20) (10, 14) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:

- Node 0: {2, 15, 24}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 9, 13, 18}
- Node 3: {1, 21}
- Node 4: {5, 28, 29}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 6, 19}
- Node 6: {5, 17, 28}
- Node 7: {15, 16, 18}
- Node 8: {1, 12, 26}
- Node 9: {2, 10, 29}
- Node 10: {4, 14, 20, 28}
- Node 11: {17, 29}
- Node 12: {8}
- Node 13: {2, 14, 19}
- Node 14: {10, 13, 20}
- Node 15: {0, 7, 22, 25}
- Node 16: {7}
- Node 17: {6, 11}
- Node 18: {2, 7}
- Node 19: {5, 13, 14, 20, 24}
- Node 20: {10, 14, 19, 27}
- Node 21: {3, 28}
- Node 22: {15, 23}
- Node 23: {22, 25, 26, 28}
- Node 24: {0, 19, 25, 27}
- Node 25: {15, 24, 29}
- Node 26: {8, 23}
- Node 27: {20, 24}
- Node 28: {4, 6, 10, 21, 23}
- Node 29: {4, 9, 11, 25}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each such node: 

- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 0
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{10}{3} = 281$

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [281].
