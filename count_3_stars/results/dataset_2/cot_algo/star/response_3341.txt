Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 13) (17, 18) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 12) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 8) (7, 5) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 12) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 16) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 4) (19, 13) (19, 10) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 10) (6, 13) (6, 12) (11, 18) (11, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 15) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 5) (10, 16) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 10) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the neighbor set for each node. Then, we will determine if any 3-stars are formed with each node.

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {8}
- Node 1: {3, 8, 12}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 10, 16}
- Node 3: {1, 12}
- Node 4: {2, 9, 14, 15}
- Node 5: {7, 10, 11}
- Node 6: {12, 13}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 10}
- Node 9: {4, 12, 16}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 8, 10, 19}
- Node 11: {5, 18}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 6, 9, 15}
- Node 13: {6, 14, 17, 19}
- Node 14: {4, 13, 15}
- Node 15: {12, 14}
- Node 16: {2, 9, 10, 18}
- Node 17: {13, 18}
- Node 18: {11, 13, 16, 17}
- Node 19: {10, 13}

Now, let's count the 3-stars:
- Node 1, 2, 4 form a 3-star: <1, (2, 4)>
- Node 2, 8, 10 form a 3-star: <2, (8, 10)>
- Node 2, 4, 16 form a 3-star: <2, (4, 16)>
- Node 4, 9, 12 form a 3-star: <4, (9, 12)>
- Node 10, 16, 19 form a 3-star: <10, (16, 19)>

The total number of 3-stars is [5].
