Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50. Placing this final number inside brackets gives us the answer: [50].

Unique 3-stars in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (2, 7, 9)>
