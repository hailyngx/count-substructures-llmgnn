Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 2) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 10) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 12) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the 3-stars formed.

### Node 0:
Neighborhood: 6, 8, 12, 5

### Node 1:
Neighborhood: 3, 14, 10, 13, 8

### Node 2:
Neighborhood: 9, 11, 4, 13

### Node 3:
Neighborhood: 9, 1, 7, 13, 5, 4

### Node 4:
Neighborhood: 3, 11, 2

### Node 5:
Neighborhood: 3, 12, 0, 10

### Node 6:
Neighborhood: 7, 8, 0

### Node 7:
Neighborhood: 6, 3, 11, 10

### Node 8:
Neighborhood: 6, 1, 14, 0

### Node 9:
Neighborhood: 2, 10, 3

### Node 10:
Neighborhood: 9, 1, 14, 7, 5

### Node 11:
Neighborhood: 7, 4, 2

### Node 12:
Neighborhood: 14, 5, 0

### Node 13:
Neighborhood: 1, 3, 2, 12

### Node 14:
Neighborhood: 1, 8, 12, 10

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors that can form 3-stars: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:

\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \]

\[ = 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 \]

Total 3-stars: 81

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [81]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (6, 8, 12)>
- <1, (3, 14, 10)>
- <3, (9, 1, 7)>
- <5, (3, 12, 0)>
- <6, (7, 8, 0)>
- <7, (6, 3, 11)>
- <8, (6, 1, 14)>
- <10, (9, 1, 14)>
- <12, (14, 5, 0)>
- <13, (1, 3, 2)>
- <14, (1, 8, 10)>
