Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (15, 11) (15, 12) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 2) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 1) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 8) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 0) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 1) (12, 16) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 6) (6, 12) (6, 14) (14, 6) (14, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 2) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 19) (1, 14) (1, 0) (18, 12) (18, 0) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 13, 1, 18}
- Node 1: {10, 5, 19, 14, 0}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {10, 2, 5}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 13, 1}
- Node 6: {12, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 2}
- Node 8: {17, 5, 0}
- Node 9: {16, 17, 2}
- Node 10: {3, 17, 1}
- Node 11: {16, 19, 15}
- Node 12: {16, 15, 17, 18, 6}
- Node 13: {5, 19, 0}
- Node 14: {6, 1}
- Node 15: {11, 12}
- Node 16: {11, 12, 9}
- Node 17: {10, 12, 9, 8}
- Node 18: {12, 0}
- Node 19: {11, 13, 1}

Now, let's identify nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 19: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is [29], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (10, 5, 19)>, <1, (10, 5, 14)>, <1, (10, 19, 14)>, <1, (5, 19, 14)>,
<5, (3, 8, 13)>, <5, (3, 1, 13)>, <5, (8, 1, 13)>, <5, (3, 1, 19)>,
<12, (16, 15, 17)>, <12, (16, 15, 18)>, <12, (16, 17, 18)>, <12, (15, 17, 18)>,
<17, (10, 12, 9)>, <17, (10, 12, 8)>, <17, (10, 9, 8)>, <17, (12, 9, 8)>,
<19, (11, 13, 1)>
