Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 11) (4, 18) (7, 23) (7, 13) (7, 8) (3, 20) (25, 20) (25, 21) (20, 3) (20, 25) (20, 24) (20, 6) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 29) (22, 1) (23, 7) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 12) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 24) (2, 11) (29, 22) (29, 14) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 10) (6, 20) (6, 5) (6, 18) (0, 11) (14, 29) (14, 27) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 16) (13, 26) (13, 7) (13, 12) (24, 20) (24, 23) (24, 2) (24, 17) (16, 18) (16, 17) (16, 27) (28, 19) (10, 26) (10, 5) (10, 21) (10, 8) (21, 25) (21, 10) (21, 15) (12, 23) (12, 13) (12, 8) (1, 22) (1, 11) (1, 8) (11, 26) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 28) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 27) (17, 24) (17, 16) (17, 19) (15, 23) (15, 5) (15, 21) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 1) (27, 14) (27, 16) (27, 19) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {11}
- Node 1: {8, 11, 22}
- Node 2: {5, 11, 22, 24}
- Node 3: {20}
- Node 4: {18}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 10, 15}
- Node 6: {5, 18, 20}
- Node 7: {8, 13, 23}
- Node 8: {1, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {26}
- Node 10: {5, 8, 10, 21, 26}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 2, 19, 26}
- Node 12: {8, 13, 23}
- Node 13: {7, 12, 26}
- Node 14: {27, 29}
- Node 15: {5, 15, 21, 23}
- Node 16: {17, 18, 27}
- Node 17: {16, 19, 24}
- Node 18: {4, 6, 16}
- Node 19: {11, 16, 19, 27, 28}
- Node 20: {3, 6, 20, 24, 25}
- Node 21: {10, 15, 21, 25}
- Node 22: {1, 2, 23, 29}
- Node 23: {7, 12, 15, 22, 24}
- Node 24: {17, 20, 23}
- Node 25: {20, 21}
- Node 26: {9, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 27: {14, 16, 19}
- Node 28: {19}
- Node 29: {14, 22}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1, Node 11, and Node 26 can form a 3-star.
- Node 2, Node 11, and Node 26 can form a 3-star.
- Node 5, Node 10, and Node 26 can form a 3-star.
- Node 8, Node 10, and Node 26 can form a 3-star.
- Node 8, Node 12, and Node 23 can form a 3-star.
- Node 15, Node 21, and Node 23 can form a 3-star.
- Node 16, Node 17, and Node 27 can form a 3-star.
- Node 19, Node 27, and Node 28 can form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, 11, 26>, <2, 11, 26>, <5, 10, 26>, <8, 10, 26>, <8, 12, 23>, <15, 21, 23>, <16, 17, 27>, <19, 27, 28>.
