Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 neighbors: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2 neighbors: 6, 8
- Node 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 8
- Node 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5 neighbors: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 9 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with neighbors (1, 6, 8), (1, 6, 9), (1, 8, 9), (6, 8, 9) -> Total: 4
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with neighbors (0, 6, 8), (0, 6, 9), (6, 8, 9) -> Total: 3
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with neighbors (5, 6, 9) -> Total: 1
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with neighbors (1, 8, 9), (1, 3, 7), (1, 4, 7), (2, 8, 0), (3, 7, 9), (4, 7, 9), (5, 8, 9) -> Total: 7
- Node 8 forms 3-stars with neighbors (0, 5, 9), (1, 3, 7), (2, 6, 0), (3, 6, 7), (4, 5, 9) -> Total: 5
- Node 9 forms 3-stars with neighbors (0, 4, 5), (0, 4, 7), (4, 5, 7) -> Total: 3

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 3 + 1 + 7 + 5 + 3 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)> 
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 8, 0)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (2, 6, 0)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
