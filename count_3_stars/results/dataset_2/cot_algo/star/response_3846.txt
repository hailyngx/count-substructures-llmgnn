Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 9
Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 6
Node 2: 0, 1, 5
Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 7, 8
Node 5: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
Node 6: 1, 3, 8
Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 8
Node 8: 4, 5, 6, 7
Node 9: 0, 3, 5

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: No 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46

Therefore, the final answer is [46] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>.
