Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 5) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 19) (17, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 16) (8, 11) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 19) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 6) (5, 15) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 16) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 19) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 0) (6, 1) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 9) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 9) (19, 14) (16, 8) (16, 13) (14, 19) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 5, 6, 7, 12
Node 1: 2, 6, 9, 10
Node 2: 1, 7
Node 3: 6, 15, 18
Node 4: 10, 17, 18, 19
Node 5: 0, 11, 13, 15
Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 18
Node 7: 0, 2, 12, 18
Node 8: 11, 16
Node 9: 1, 11, 19
Node 10: 1, 4, 13
Node 11: 5, 8, 9
Node 12: 0, 7
Node 13: 5, 10, 16
Node 14: 19
Node 15: 3, 5
Node 16: 8, 13
Node 17: 4, 19
Node 18: 3, 4, 6, 7
Node 19: 4, 9, 14, 17

Next, we can identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 18, 19

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars centered at that node:

Number of 3-stars centered at node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars centered at node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars centered at node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars centered at node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars centered at node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars centered at node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Number of 3-stars centered at node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Number of 3-stars centered at node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars centered at node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get:
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 24 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, 10, 17, 18>, <5, 0, 11, 13>, <6, 0, 1, 18>, <7, 0, 2, 12>, <10, 1, 13, 16>, <11, 5, 8, 9>, <13, 5, 10, 16>, <18, 3, 4, 6>, <19, 4, 9, 17>
