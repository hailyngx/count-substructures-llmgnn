Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 12) (2, 27) (29, 9) (29, 24) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 27) (21, 10) (21, 5) (4, 18) (4, 5) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 25) (18, 1) (26, 18) (26, 6) (26, 17) (28, 17) (28, 27) (10, 21) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 20) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 8) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 20) (9, 29) (9, 8) (0, 15) (0, 16) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 13) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 6) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (11, 17) (11, 20) (23, 25) (23, 6) (3, 7) (3, 19) (1, 18) (1, 0) (1, 20) (1, 14) (1, 5) (20, 10) (20, 8) (20, 11) (20, 1) (17, 26) (17, 28) (17, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 25) (25, 18) (25, 16) (25, 23) (25, 13) (25, 24) (24, 29) (24, 25) (24, 27) (27, 2) (27, 7) (27, 28) (27, 24) (14, 12) (14, 1) (5, 21) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 1) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 3) (6, 26) (6, 16) (6, 23) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 15, 1, 19, 13, 16
- Node 1: 18, 0, 20, 14, 5
- Node 2: 12, 27
- Node 3: 7, 19
- Node 4: 18, 5
- Node 5: 21, 4, 10, 1
- Node 6: 26, 16, 23
- Node 7: 3, 19, 27
- Node 8: 10, 15, 9, 20
- Node 9: 29, 8
- Node 10: 21, 15, 8, 5, 20
- Node 11: 17, 20
- Node 12: 2, 13, 14
- Node 13: 0, 12, 25
- Node 14: 12, 1
- Node 15: 10, 0, 8
- Node 16: 6, 25
- Node 17: 26, 28, 11
- Node 18: 4, 26, 25, 1
- Node 19: 7, 0, 3
- Node 20: 10, 8, 11, 1
- Node 21: 5, 10
- Node 23: 6, 25
- Node 24: 29, 25, 27
- Node 25: 18, 16, 23, 13, 24
- Node 26: 18, 6, 17
- Node 27: 2, 7, 28, 24
- Node 28: 17, 27
- Node 29: 9, 24

Next, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 1, 5, 8, 10, 12, 13, 18, 25, and 27 have 5 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars per node
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars per node

Summing these up, we get a total of 140 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [140]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, 1, 20>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 19>, <0, 1, 14>, <0, 15, 8>, <1, 5, 10>, <1, 5, 21>, <1, 18, 4>, <1, 18, 25>, <1, 18, 26>, <5, 10, 21>, <5, 10, 1>, <5, 21, 10>, <5, 21, 4>, <8, 9, 20>, <8, 9, 29>, <8, 9, 27>, <8, 15, 10>, <8, 15, 0>, <8, 10, 20>, <8, 10, 5>, <10, 21, 5>, <10, 21, 4>, <10, 21, 15>, <10, 5, 1>, <12, 13, 14>, <18, 25, 16>, <18, 25, 23>, <20, 11, 17>, <25, 24, 27>.
