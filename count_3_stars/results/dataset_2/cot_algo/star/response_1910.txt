Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 6, 9, 4, 7, 3
Node 1 neighbors: 9, 5, 7
Node 2 neighbors: 9, 3
Node 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 5, 2, 0, 7
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 3
Node 5 neighbors: 6, 4, 8, 1, 3
Node 6 neighbors: 5, 7, 0
Node 7 neighbors: 6, 9, 8, 0, 3, 1
Node 8 neighbors: 5, 7, 3
Node 9 neighbors: 2, 1, 7, 0

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 8
Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
For nodes 1, 2, 6, 8: 1 3-star each
Total = 4

Nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
For nodes 0, 3, 5, 7, 9: inom{k}{3}, where k is the number of neighbors
For node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20
For node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 7: inom{6}{3} = 20
For node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
Total = 64

Adding them up:
Total = 4 (from nodes with 3 neighbors) + 64 (from nodes with more than 3 neighbors) = 68

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 7, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
