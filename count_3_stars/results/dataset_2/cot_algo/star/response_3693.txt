Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 28) (27, 26) (20, 15) (20, 8) (20, 9) (25, 13) (25, 2) (15, 20) (15, 26) (15, 8) (28, 0) (28, 27) (28, 29) (28, 2) (29, 28) (29, 18) (29, 3) (22, 24) (26, 27) (26, 15) (9, 20) (9, 13) (9, 23) (3, 29) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 19) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 18) (23, 17) (23, 13) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (16, 3) (16, 21) (16, 8) (21, 0) (21, 27) (21, 16) (17, 23) (18, 29) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 19) (18, 24) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 10) (19, 6) (1, 12) (1, 24) (2, 25) (2, 28) (8, 20) (8, 15) (8, 16) (8, 24) (24, 22) (24, 18) (24, 1) (24, 8) (24, 7) (7, 24) (13, 25) (13, 9) (13, 23) (5, 4) (5, 10) (10, 19) (10, 5) (10, 14) (14, 19) (14, 10) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are:  
Node 0 with 4 neighbors  
Node 3 with 4 neighbors  
Node 8 with 4 neighbors  
Node 9 with 4 neighbors  
Node 11 with 4 neighbors  
Node 12 with 3 neighbors  
Node 13 with 4 neighbors  
Node 15 with 3 neighbors  
Node 18 with 5 neighbors  
Node 19 with 5 neighbors  
Node 20 with 3 neighbors  
Node 21 with 3 neighbors  
Node 23 with 5 neighbors  
Node 24 with 5 neighbors  
Node 25 with 2 neighbors  
Node 26 with 3 neighbors  
Node 27 with 4 neighbors  
Node 28 with 4 neighbors  
Node 29 with 3 neighbors  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with more than 3 neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60 \)  

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].  

Listing the unique 3-stars:

<3, 18, 23>  
<8, 15, 16>  
<9, 13, 23>  
<11, 18, 23>  
<12, 4, 6>  
<13, 9, 23>  
<18, 3, 29>  
<19, 10, 14>  
<20, 15, 26>  
<21, 16, 8>  
<23, 9, 13>  
<24, 1, 12>  
<25, 2>  
<27, 21, 28>  
<28, 29, 2>
