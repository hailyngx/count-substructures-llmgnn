Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 0) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (6, 2) (6, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 8, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 10}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 6, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 12: {0, 10, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 3}
- Node 14: {2, 8, 9, 10, 12}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (9, 10, 13)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 5, 14)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star: <10, (1, 9, 14)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star: <14, (2, 8, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is 5, so the final answer is [5].
