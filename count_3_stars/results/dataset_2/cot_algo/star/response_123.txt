Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 0) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (12, 5) (12, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 14) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 6, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 5, 11}
- Node 7: {5, 8, 10}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {10, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 12: {5, 9}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 3, 8, 9, 10}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 10: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 11: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 14: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 80\)

Therefore, the final answer is [80], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 5, 14)>
- <1, (3, 4, 14)>
- <3, (0, 5, 14)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <8, (4, 7, 14)>
- <10, (2, 9, 14)>
- <11, (6, 8, 13)>
- <14, (0, 8, 9)>
