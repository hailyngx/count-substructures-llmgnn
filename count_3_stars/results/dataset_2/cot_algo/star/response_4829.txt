Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (4, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by examining each node and its neighbors. As you mentioned, we need to find nodes with at least 3 neighbors to potentially form a 3-star. 

Here is the breakdown for each node:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 5, 2, 8, 3, 5. Thus, it can form 1 3-star. <0, (5, 2, 8)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 6, 2, 4, 7. Thus, it can form 1 3-star. <1, (6, 2, 4)>
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 5, 2, 8, 0, 7. Thus, it can form 1 3-star. <3, (5, 2, 8)>
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 6, 0, 4, 3, 7. Thus, it can form 1 3-star. <5, (6, 0, 4)>
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 6, 9, 5, 8, 1, 3. Thus, it can form 1 3-star. <7, (6, 9, 5)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3. Thus, it can form 1 3-star. <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 6, 5, 1. Thus, it can form 1 3-star. <4, (6, 5, 1)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 5, 1, 7, 4. Thus, it can form 1 3-star. <6, (5, 1, 7)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 9, 0, 3, 7. Thus, it can form 1 3-star. <8, (9, 0, 3)>
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 8, 7. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [9].
