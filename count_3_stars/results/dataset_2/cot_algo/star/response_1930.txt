Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 24) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 25) (9, 15) (9, 10) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 29) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 15) (3, 25) (3, 24) (25, 9) (25, 14) (25, 3) (25, 22) (8, 23) (8, 20) (23, 8) (23, 29) (21, 28) (21, 18) (28, 21) (28, 26) (28, 20) (22, 25) (22, 4) (22, 16) (26, 28) (11, 13) (11, 29) (11, 15) (20, 17) (20, 8) (20, 28) (10, 9) (10, 19) (4, 22) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 17) (16, 22) (16, 12) (16, 19) (2, 5) (2, 24) (24, 5) (24, 3) (24, 2) (24, 1) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 15) (7, 27) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 6) (18, 21) (18, 27) (18, 29) (18, 13) (27, 7) (27, 18) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 15) (1, 12) (1, 24) (1, 0) (1, 13) (19, 14) (19, 10) (19, 16) (29, 14) (29, 23) (29, 11) (29, 18) 

Response:
First, we'll create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 neighbors: 5, 1, 6
- Node 1 neighbors: 12, 24, 0, 13
- Node 2 neighbors: 5, 24
- Node 3 neighbors: 25, 24
- Node 4 neighbors: 22, 6
- Node 5 neighbors: 9, 2, 24, 0
- Node 6 neighbors: 4, 0, 15
- Node 7 neighbors: 15, 27
- Node 8 neighbors: 23, 20
- Node 9 neighbors: 5, 25, 15, 10
- Node 10 neighbors: 9, 19
- Node 11 neighbors: 13, 29, 15
- Node 12 neighbors: 16, 1
- Node 13 neighbors: 11, 18, 1
- Node 14 neighbors: 17, 19, 29, 25
- Node 15 neighbors: 9, 17, 11, 7, 6
- Node 16 neighbors: 17, 22, 12, 19
- Node 17 neighbors: 14, 20, 16, 15
- Node 18 neighbors: 21, 27, 29, 13
- Node 19 neighbors: 14, 10, 16
- Node 20 neighbors: 17, 8, 28
- Node 21 neighbors: 28, 18
- Node 22 neighbors: 25, 4, 16
- Node 23 neighbors: 8, 29
- Node 24 neighbors: 5, 3, 2, 1
- Node 25 neighbors: 9, 14, 3, 22
- Node 26 neighbors: 28
- Node 27 neighbors: 7, 18
- Node 28 neighbors: 21, 26, 20
- Node 29 neighbors: 14, 23, 11, 18

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 5: <5, (9, 2, 24)>, <5, (9, 0, 24)>
- Node 9: <9, (5, 25, 15)>, <9, (5, 25, 10)>
- Node 14: <14, (17, 19, 29)>, <14, (17, 25, 29)>
- Node 15: <15, (9, 17, 11)>, <15, (9, 17, 6)>, <15, (9, 11, 7)>, <15, (17, 11, 6)>
- Node 16: <16, (17, 22, 12)>, <16, (17, 22, 19)>, <16, (17, 12, 19)>
- Node 17: <17, (14, 20, 16)>, <17, (14, 20, 15)>, <17, (20, 16, 15)>
- Node 18: <18, (21, 27, 29)>, <18, (21, 27, 13)>, <18, (21, 29, 13)>, <18, (27, 29, 13)>
- Node 19: <19, (14, 10, 16)>, <19, (14, 16, 29)>, <19, (10, 16, 29)>
- Node 24: <24, (5, 3, 2)>, <24, (5, 3, 1)>, <24, (5, 2, 1)>
- Node 25: <25, (9, 14, 3)>, <25, (9, 14, 22)>, <25, (9, 3, 22)>, <25, (14, 3, 22)>
- Node 29: <29, (14, 23, 11)>, <29, (14, 23, 18)>, <29, (14, 11, 18)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we find that there are [23] 3-stars in the graph.
