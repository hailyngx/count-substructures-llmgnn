Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 13) (15, 16) (15, 3) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 11) (2, 10) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 3) (13, 7) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 1) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 17) (1, 18) (1, 9) (1, 7) (6, 16) (6, 14) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 19) (14, 6) (14, 10) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (9, 1) (9, 4) (12, 18) (12, 10) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 12) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8, 17}
- Node 1: {7, 9, 18}
- Node 2: {10, 11}
- Node 3: {13, 15, 17}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 9, 10}
- Node 5: {4, 7}
- Node 6: {14, 16}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 7, 16}
- Node 9: {1, 4}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {2, 16, 18, 19}
- Node 12: {10, 18}
- Node 13: {3, 7}
- Node 14: {6, 10}
- Node 15: {3, 16}
- Node 16: {6, 8, 11, 15}
- Node 17: {0, 3, 18, 19}
- Node 18: {1, 11, 12, 17, 19}
- Node 19: {11, 17, 18}

Now, let's identify the nodes which have at least 3 neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <4, (0, 9, 10)>, <4, (0, 9, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 10)>, <4, (9, 5, 10)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <7, (1, 8, 13)>, <7, (1, 13, 5)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (8, 13, 5)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <10, (2, 4, 12)>, <10, (2, 4, 14)>, <10, (4, 12, 14)>, <10, (12, 14, 2)>
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <11, (16, 18, 19)>, <11, (16, 18, 11)>, <11, (16, 19, 11)>, <11, (18, 19, 11)>
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <17, (0, 18, 19)>, <17, (0, 18, 17)>, <17, (0, 19, 17)>, <17, (18, 19, 17)>
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <18, (1, 11, 19)>, <18, (1, 11, 17)>, <18, (1, 19, 17)>, <18, (11, 19, 17)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 27

Therefore, the final number to put inside brackets is [27].
