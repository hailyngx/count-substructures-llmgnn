Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 2) (4, 5) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 6) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 3) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 9) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 18) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 6) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (14, 3) (14, 5) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 18) (9, 10) (9, 2) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 9) (6, 3) (6, 19) (6, 8) (6, 18) (18, 12) (18, 0) (18, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 15, 18}
- Node 1: {3, 17, 19}
- Node 2: {7, 9, 13, 16}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 14, 17}
- Node 4: {5}
- Node 5: {4, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 8, 18, 19}
- Node 7: {2, 16, 19}
- Node 8: {6, 10}
- Node 9: {2, 10}
- Node 10: {8, 9, 15}
- Node 11: {0, 12, 13, 16, 17}
- Node 12: {5, 11, 18}
- Node 13: {2, 11}
- Node 14: {3, 5}
- Node 15: {0, 10, 19}
- Node 16: {2, 7, 11}
- Node 17: {1, 3, 11}
- Node 18: {0, 6, 12}
- Node 19: {1, 6, 7, 15}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  
The total number of 3-stars is 10, so we represent this as [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<11, (0, 12, 13)>
<11, (0, 12, 16)>
<11, (0, 13, 16)>
<11, (12, 13, 16)>
<11, (16, 0, 12)>
<11, (16, 0, 13)>
<11, (16, 2, 7)>
<11, (16, 7, 19)>
<11, (16, 11, 13)>
<11, (16, 11, 17)>
