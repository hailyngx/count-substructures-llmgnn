Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 17) (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 7) (14, 5) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 0) (10, 3) (10, 4) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 6) (7, 9) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 19) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 18) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 18) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 2) (19, 12) (19, 4) (19, 16) (6, 11) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 4) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 19) (4, 1) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 15) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 16) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 15, 17}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 16}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 8, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {10}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 10, 13, 19}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 9, 14, 16}
- Node 6: Neighbors {11}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 14, 18}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 10: Neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 11: Neighbors {6, 13, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 13, 19}
- Node 13: Neighbors {4, 11, 12, 18}
- Node 14: Neighbors {5, 8, 11, 17}
- Node 15: Neighbors {0, 17, 18}
- Node 16: Neighbors {1, 5, 18, 19}
- Node 17: Neighbors {0, 14, 15}
- Node 18: Neighbors {8, 13, 15, 16}
- Node 19: Neighbors {4, 12, 16}

Nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 33

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (4, 5, 16)>
<1, (2, 5, 16)>
<1, (2, 4, 16)>

<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 12)>
<2, (8, 12, 19)>
<4, (10, 13, 19)>
<4, (1, 13, 19)>
<4, (1, 10, 19)>
<4, (1, 10, 13)>
<5, (9, 14, 16)>

<13, (11, 12, 18)>

<19, (12, 16, 19)>
