Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 23) (3, 26) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (27, 21) (27, 11) (27, 16) (7, 15) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 14) (21, 27) (21, 7) (21, 4) (21, 18) (22, 19) (22, 4) (22, 6) (23, 3) (23, 11) (23, 6) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 20) (10, 29) (11, 0) (11, 27) (11, 23) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 18) (2, 10) (2, 29) (2, 9) (29, 10) (29, 2) (1, 15) (1, 26) (1, 5) (1, 28) (26, 3) (26, 1) (5, 1) (5, 25) (5, 24) (6, 22) (6, 23) (4, 21) (4, 22) (4, 20) (18, 21) (18, 13) (16, 27) (16, 7) (16, 28) (16, 20) (28, 1) (28, 16) (28, 9) (28, 12) (28, 25) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 28) (17, 3) (17, 8) (25, 5) (25, 28) (19, 22) (19, 12) (14, 7) (14, 8) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 28) (12, 19) (20, 10) (20, 4) (20, 16) (24, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: {10, 11}
Node 1: {15, 26, 5, 28}
Node 2: {10, 29, 9}
Node 3: {15, 17, 23, 26, 12}
Node 4: {21, 22, 20}
Node 5: {1, 25, 24}
Node 6: {22, 23}
Node 7: {15, 21, 16, 14}
Node 8: {13, 14, 17, 12}
Node 9: {15, 2, 28}
Node 10: {0, 2, 20, 29}
Node 11: {0, 27, 23}
Node 12: {3, 8, 28, 19}
Node 13: {8, 18}
Node 14: {7, 8}
Node 15: {3, 1, 7, 9}
Node 16: {27, 7, 28, 20}
Node 17: {3, 8}
Node 18: {21, 13}
Node 19: {22, 12}
Node 20: {10, 4, 16}
Node 21: {27, 7, 4, 18}
Node 22: {19, 4, 6}
Node 23: {3, 11, 6}
Node 24: {5}
Node 25: {5, 28}
Node 26: {1, 3}
Node 27: {21, 11, 16}
Node 28: {1, 16, 9, 12, 25}
Node 29: {10, 2}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 15, 17, and 23: <3, (15, 17, 23)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 15, 21, and 16: <7, (15, 21, 16)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 2, 20, and 29: <10, (2, 20, 29)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 8, 28, and 19: <12, (8, 28, 19)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 7, and 9: <15, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 27, 7, and 28: <16, (27, 7, 28)>
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 27, 7, and 18: <21, (27, 7, 18)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 19, 4, and 6: <22, (19, 4, 6)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars found, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
