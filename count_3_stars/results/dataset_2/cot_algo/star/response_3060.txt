Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 2, 3}
- Node 1: {6, 5, 2, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 5, 0, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {8, 0, 2}
- Node 4: {9, 8, 0, 5, 2}
- Node 5: {4, 2, 1, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 8}
- Node 7: {9, 8, 1}
- Node 8: {6, 4, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 2, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \(4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 46\).
Thus, the final answer is [46], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 5, 2>, <1, 6, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 2, 7>, <2, 9, 4, 5>, <2, 9, 4, 0>, <2, 9, 4, 1>, <2, 9, 5, 0>, <2, 9, 5, 1>, <4, 9, 2, 5>, <4, 9, 2, 0>, <4, 9, 2, 1>, <4, 8, 5, 2>, <4, 8, 0, 2>, <4, 0, 5, 2>, <5, 4, 2, 0>, <5, 4, 2, 1>.
