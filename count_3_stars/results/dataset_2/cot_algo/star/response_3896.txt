Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 18) (10, 15) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 13) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 6) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 6) (9, 10) (9, 18) (13, 17) (13, 11) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 19) (18, 11) (19, 10) (19, 18) (19, 0) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 11) (14, 16) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 16) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 12) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 0) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 6) (5, 3) (5, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {15, 6, 19}
- Node 1: {7, 3, 15, 12}
- Node 2: {4, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 12, 18}
- Node 4: {7, 2, 11}
- Node 5: {3, 11}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 15, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 1}
- Node 8: {2, 16, 6}
- Node 9: {10, 18}
- Node 10: {15, 19, 9}
- Node 11: {4, 13, 18, 5, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 16}
- Node 13: {17, 11}
- Node 14: {11, 16}
- Node 15: {1, 10, 0, 6}
- Node 16: {8, 14, 12}
- Node 17: {13}
- Node 18: {3, 9, 19, 11}
- Node 19: {10, 0, 18}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 1
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 1
Nodes with 6 neighbors: 4
Nodes with 7 neighbors: None

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (7, 3, 15)>
<2, (4, 8, 16)>
<3, (1, 5, 12)>
<4, (7, 2, 11)>
<6, (7, 8, 15)>
<6, (7, 6, 0)>
<6, (8, 16, 12)>
<6, (15, 10, 0)>
<11, (4, 13, 18)>
<11, (4, 5, 14)>
<11, (18, 13, 5)>
<12, (1, 3, 16)>
<15, (1, 10, 0)>
<15, (7, 6, 0)>
<16, (8, 14, 12)>
<18, (3, 9, 19)>
<18, (3, 11, 14)>
<18, (19, 0, 15)>
<18, (19, 10, 9)>
<19, (0, 6, 15)>
