Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 26) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 28) (16, 4) (16, 9) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 5) (27, 10) (27, 9) (27, 8) (10, 27) (10, 20) (8, 27) (8, 23) (8, 28) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 25) (15, 0) (15, 20) (15, 9) (20, 11) (20, 10) (20, 15) (20, 3) (1, 18) (26, 11) (26, 17) (13, 12) (13, 25) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 8) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 21) (2, 22) (2, 3) (2, 4) (22, 5) (22, 2) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 18) (6, 12) (17, 0) (17, 26) (17, 6) (17, 12) (14, 23) (14, 6) (14, 18) (25, 23) (25, 13) (9, 16) (9, 27) (9, 15) (9, 12) (9, 24) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 9) (21, 19) (21, 29) (21, 24) (18, 1) (18, 6) (18, 14) (3, 20) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 29) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 29) (24, 9) (24, 21) (29, 5) (29, 21) (29, 3) (29, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {15, 17, 5}
- Node 1: {18}
- Node 2: {22, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {20, 5, 2, 29}
- Node 4: {16, 2, 29}
- Node 5: {0, 19, 22, 29, 3}
- Node 6: {17, 14, 18, 12}
- Node 8: {27, 23, 28}
- Node 9: {16, 27, 15, 12, 24}
- Node 10: {27, 20}
- Node 11: {16, 28, 26, 20}
- Node 12: {13, 6, 17, 9}
- Node 13: {12, 25}
- Node 14: {23, 6, 18}
- Node 15: {0, 20, 9}
- Node 16: {11, 28, 4, 9}
- Node 17: {0, 26, 6, 12}
- Node 18: {1, 6, 14}
- Node 19: {5, 21}
- Node 20: {11, 10, 15, 3}
- Node 21: {19, 29, 24}
- Node 22: {5, 2}
- Node 23: {8, 14, 25}
- Node 24: {9, 21}
- Node 25: {23, 13}
- Node 26: {11, 17}
- Node 27: {10, 9, 8}
- Node 28: {16, 11, 8}
- Node 29: {5, 21, 3, 4}

Now we can identify the number of 3-stars centered at each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [1]
  <0, (15, 17, 5)>

- Node 5: [1]
  <5, (0, 19, 22)>

- Node 9: [1]
  <9, (16, 27, 15)>

- Node 12: [1]
  <12, (13, 6, 17)>

- Node 14: [1]
  <14, (23, 6, 18)>

- Node 16: [1]
  <16, (11, 28, 4)>

- Node 17: [1]
  <17, (0, 26, 6)>

- Node 20: [1]
  <20, (11, 10, 15)>

- Node 21: [1]
  <21, (19, 29, 24)>

- Node 27: [1]
  <27, (10, 9, 8)>

- Node 28: [1]
  <28, (16, 11, 8)>

So, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [10].
