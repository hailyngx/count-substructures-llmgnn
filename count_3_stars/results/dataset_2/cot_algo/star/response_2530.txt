Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 4) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 6) (4, 16) (4, 9) (4, 17) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 12) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 12) (17, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 9) (15, 5) (15, 6) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 19) (6, 15) (10, 13) (10, 0) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 18) (7, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 7) (18, 16) (18, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {8, 10, 14, 2}
Node 1 neighbors: {14, 6, 12}
Node 2 neighbors: {0}
Node 3 neighbors: {7, 6}
Node 4 neighbors: {16, 9, 17}
Node 5 neighbors: {19, 15, 7}
Node 6 neighbors: {13, 1, 3, 19, 15}
Node 7 neighbors: {3, 5, 18, 9}
Node 8 neighbors: {11, 13, 0}
Node 9 neighbors: {4, 14, 19, 7}
Node 10 neighbors: {13, 0}
Node 11 neighbors: {16, 8}
Node 12 neighbors: {16, 14, 1}
Node 13 neighbors: {16, 8, 10, 6}
Node 14 neighbors: {0, 9, 12}
Node 15 neighbors: {5, 6}
Node 16 neighbors: {11, 12, 13, 18, 4, 18}
Node 17 neighbors: {4}
Node 18 neighbors: {16, 7}
Node 19 neighbors: {5, 6, 9}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Nodes 0, 6, 13, and 14 have 4 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the possible 3-stars:

\[ inom{4}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{3}{3} = 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 25 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 10, 14)>
<6, (13, 15, 19)>
<13, (8, 10, 6)>
<14, (0, 9, 12)>
<16, (11, 12, 18)>
<16, (11, 12, 4)>
<16, (11, 12, 18)>
<16, (13, 18, 4)>
<16, (13, 18, 4)>
