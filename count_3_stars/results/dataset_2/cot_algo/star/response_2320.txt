Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 8

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50, so the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>
