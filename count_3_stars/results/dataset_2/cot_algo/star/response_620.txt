Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 16) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 1) (2, 5) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 4) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 12) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 17) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 19) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 16) (19, 18) (19, 1) (19, 3) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (15, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (0, 10) (0, 4) (11, 9) (11, 7) (3, 19) (3, 10) (3, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 17) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 10, 4
- Node 1: 8, 13, 7, 19
- Node 2: 5, 18, 10, 4
- Node 3: 19, 10, 14
- Node 4: 2, 0
- Node 5: 9, 2
- Node 6: 9, 18, 16
- Node 7: 9, 12, 11, 1
- Node 8: 13, 14, 15, 1
- Node 9: 5, 6, 11, 7
- Node 10: 2, 0, 3
- Node 11: 9, 7
- Node 12: 18, 7, 17
- Node 13: 8, 17, 16, 1
- Node 14: 8, 3
- Node 15: 8
- Node 16: 6, 13, 17
- Node 17: 13, 12, 16
- Node 18: 6, 2, 19, 12
- Node 19: 18, 1, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 13, 18, 19

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 29 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [29].

And the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (8, 13, 19)>
- <2, (5, 18, 10)>
- <7, (9, 11, 12)>
- <8, (13, 15, 1)>
- <9, (5, 6, 11)>
- <13, (8, 16, 17)>
- <18, (6, 19, 12)>
- <19, (1, 3, 18)>
