Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 8) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 13) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 12) 

Response:
With the given graph information, we can determine the number of 3-stars in the graph by following the steps outlined earlier.

First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 10, 14, 8, 2}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 3, 11}
- Node 2: {6, 0, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 11, 7, 14, 10, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 11, 13}
- Node 5: {9, 1, 4, 0, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 0}
- Node 7: {3, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {3, 10, 0, 12}
- Node 9: {5, 1}
- Node 10: {3, 11, 0, 8, 7}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 10, 4}
- Node 12: {2, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {4, 7, 14, 2, 12}
- Node 14: {5, 3, 0, 13}

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- Node 13: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: \(20 + 20 + 10 = 50\)

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 8, 14)>, <3, (1, 10, 11)>, <13, (2, 12, 14)>
