Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 18) (16, 9) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 15) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 15) (9, 12) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (17, 19) (17, 12) (17, 15) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 10) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 17) (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 14) (12, 9) (12, 17) (10, 19) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 13) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 4) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 0) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
From the given edges, we can create the following adjacency list:

- Node 0: [8, 2, 4]
- Node 1: [5, 6, 2, 13]
- Node 2: [7, 1, 0]
- Node 4: [11, 10, 0]
- Node 5: [19, 18, 1, 15]
- Node 6: [14, 13, 1]
- Node 7: [8, 10, 2]
- Node 8: [11, 0, 7]
- Node 9: [11, 16, 15, 12]
- Node 10: [19, 7, 14, 4, 13]
- Node 11: [9, 8, 4]
- Node 12: [9, 17]
- Node 13: [1, 6, 10]
- Node 14: [6, 18, 10]
- Node 15: [5, 9, 17]
- Node 16: [18, 9]
- Node 17: [19, 12, 15]
- Node 18: [16, 5, 14]
- Node 19: [5, 17, 10]

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars based on the provided graph:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of 20 3-stars in the graph. 
Hence, the answer is [20]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, 1, 6, 13>
- <9, 11, 8, 4>
- <10, 7, 14, 13>
- <15, 5, 17>
- <18, 16, 5>
