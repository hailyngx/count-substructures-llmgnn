Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 7, 8}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 53.  
So, the final answer is [53].  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (1, 3, 8)>  
<1, (0, 4, 8)>  
<3, (0, 5, 7)>  
<4, (1, 5, 6)>  
<5, (2, 3, 8)>  
<7, (1, 6, 8)>  
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
