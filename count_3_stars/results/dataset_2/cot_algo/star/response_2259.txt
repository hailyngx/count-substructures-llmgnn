Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 14) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 6) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: {9, 14}
- Node 1 neighbors: {4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 3}
- Node 2 neighbors: {5, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 3 neighbors: {1, 8}
- Node 4 neighbors: {1, 5, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 5 neighbors: {9, 13, 4, 11, 2, 10}
- Node 6 neighbors: {1, 8, 12}
- Node 7 neighbors: {1, 4}
- Node 8 neighbors: {1, 3, 4, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 9 neighbors: {0, 2, 5, 11, 12}
- Node 10 neighbors: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 11 neighbors: {1, 5, 9, 14}
- Node 12 neighbors: {8, 9, 14, 13, 6}
- Node 13 neighbors: {2, 4, 5, 12}
- Node 14 neighbors: {0, 2, 11, 12}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 12: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 35 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 109

So, the final answer is [109], and the unique 3-stars found inside <> are:
<1, (4, 6, 11)>, <1, (4, 7, 10)>, <1, (4, 8, 12)>, <1, (4, 8, 6)>, <1, (4, 8, 10)>, <1, (6, 8, 12)>, <1, (7, 4, 8)>, <1, (7, 4, 6)>, <1, (7, 4, 10)>, <1, (8, 4, 6)>, <1, (8, 4, 10)>, <2, (5, 13, 14)>, <4, (1, 5, 13)>, <4, (1, 5, 2)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 10)>, <4, (1, 8, 6)>, <4, (1, 8, 10)>, <4, (5, 11, 13)>, <4, (5, 11, 2)>, <4, (5, 13, 12)>, <5, (11, 13, 2)>, <5, (9, 11, 13)>, <5, (9, 11, 2)>, <8, (1, 6, 12)>, <8, (1, 8, 10)>, <8, (3, 6, 12)>, <8, (3, 8, 12)>, <8, (4, 6, 12)>, <8, (4, 8, 12)>, <8, (6, 12, 13)>, <8, (8, 12, 14)>, <9, (11, 12, 14)>, <9, (12, 13, 14)>, <9, (12, 14, 2)>, <9, (12, 14, 6)>, <9, (9, 11, 13)>, <9, (9, 11, 2)>, <9, (9, 12, 2)>, <12, (6, 12, 13)>, <12, (6, 12, 14)>, <12, (6, 8, 12)>, <12, (8, 12, 14)>
