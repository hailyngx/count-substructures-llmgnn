Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (3, 5) (3, 2) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 1) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 13) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 13) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 9, 10}
- Node 1: {10, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 12}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 7, 12}
- Node 6: {8, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5, 9, 14}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 11: {1, 6, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 6, 7, 11, 13}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14 have 5 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they can form.
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 13 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is:

1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 41

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- <7, (2, 5, 14)>
- <9, (2, 7, 12)>
- <11, (1, 6, 14)>
- <14, (1, 6, 11)>
