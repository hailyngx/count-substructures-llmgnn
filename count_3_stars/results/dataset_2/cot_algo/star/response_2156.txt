Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 3: 0, 1, 2
Node 4: 0, 2, 8
Node 5: 0, 1, 2
Node 6: 1, 7
Node 7: 0, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 7
Node 9: 1, 2, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 54 \) 3-stars. 

So, the final answer is [54], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
