Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 14) (16, 10) (3, 15) (3, 1) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 7) (8, 11) (8, 19) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 14) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (17, 19) (17, 18) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 0) (18, 17) (18, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 0) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 9) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 13) (12, 10) (2, 0) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 19) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 7
Node 1: 3, 7, 14
Node 2: 0
Node 3: 1, 15
Node 4: 0, 10, 18, 19
Node 5: 0, 7, 15
Node 6: 0
Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 10
Node 8: 11, 19
Node 9: 11, 13, 15, 19
Node 10: 4, 7, 12, 16
Node 11: 8, 9, 14, 16
Node 12: 10
Node 13: 9, 15, 14
Node 14: 1, 11, 13, 16
Node 15: 3, 5, 9, 13
Node 16: 10, 11, 14
Node 17: 18, 19
Node 18: 4, 17
Node 19: 4, 8, 9, 17

Now, let's identify nodes with at least 3 neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 9, 16, 18, 19
Number of 3-stars formed by nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4

Therefore, the final number [4] is placed inside brackets. Additionally, the unique 3-stars found are:
<9, 11, 13>
<16, 10, 14>
<18, 4, 17>
<19, 8, 9>
