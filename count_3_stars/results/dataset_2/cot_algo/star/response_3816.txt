Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 6, 5, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 3, 5, 4, 8
- Node 2: Neighbors are 6, 5, 0, 8
- Node 3: Neighbors are 6, 1, 0, 8
- Node 4: Neighbors are 6, 9, 1, 8
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 2, 0
- Node 6: Neighbors are 9, 3, 2, 4, 0
- Node 7: Neighbor is 0
- Node 8: Neighbors are 9, 1, 3, 4, 2
- Node 9: Neighbors are 6, 8, 4, 0

Next, we determine the number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier. Nodes with three or more neighbors can potentially form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 = 40, which we put inside brackets to get [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (5, 2, 3)>
- <0, (6, 2, 4)>
- <0, (6, 3, 9)>
- <0, (6, 4, 9)>
- <0, (6, 5, 1)>
- <6, (4, 0, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- <6, (2, 0, 4)>
- <6, (2, 0, 3)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (9, 0, 3)>
- <6, (9, 0, 4)>
- <6, (9, 3, 8)>
- <6, (3, 0, 8)>
- <6, (3, 2, 8)>
- <6, (4, 0, 8)>
- <6, (4, 2, 8)>
- <6, (0, 3, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 2)>
- <8, (1, 3, 0)>
- <8, (3, 0, 4)>
