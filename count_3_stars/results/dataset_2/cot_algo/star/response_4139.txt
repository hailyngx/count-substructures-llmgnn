Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 0) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 6) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 12) (7, 11) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 12) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 6) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) 

Response:
Since the given graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges, we can start by constructing the adjacency list representation of the graph:

```plaintext
0: [5, 3, 6]
1: [2, 5, 14, 9, 12]
2: [8, 1, 13]
3: [13, 7, 0, 12]
4: [11, 8, 5, 6]
5: [4, 8, 13, 1, 0]
6: [10, 4, 13, 0, 12]
7: [11, 3]
8: [10, 4, 2, 5]
9: [13, 14, 1]
10: [11, 6, 12, 8]
11: [10, 7, 12, 4]
12: [10, 11, 14, 3, 1, 6]
13: [2, 5, 3, 9, 6]
14: [1, 9, 12]
```

Now, let's find the unique 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 12, and 8: <10, (6, 12, 8)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 12, and 7: <11, (4, 12, 7)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 10, and 11: <12, (6, 10, 11)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 9, and 5: <13, (3, 9, 5)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 14, and 9: <1, (2, 14, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, and 13: <5, (4, 8, 13)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 12, and 4: <6, (10, 12, 4)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 9, and 12: <14, (1, 9, 12)>

Since each of these 3-stars is unique, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
