Response:
Based on the given information, we can determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 16, 24, 5
- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 14, 27
- Node 2 has neighbors: 29, 1, 9, 10
- Node 3 has neighbors: 14, 26, 24
- Node 4 has neighbors: 21
- Node 5 has neighbors: 29, 0, 23, 15
- Node 6 has neighbors: 13, 22
- Node 7 has neighbors: 20
- Node 8 has neighbors: 13, 23, 9, 12
- Node 9 has neighbors: 2, 8, 19, 24
- Node 10 has neighbors: 2, 29, 23, 26
- Node 11 has neighbors: 16, 15
- Node 12 has neighbors: 8
- Node 13 has neighbors: 8, 26, 6
- Node 14 has neighbors: 17, 3, 1, 20
- Node 15 has neighbors: 11, 17, 5
- Node 16 has neighbors: 11, 18, 0
- Node 17 has neighbors: 14, 15
- Node 18 has neighbors: 16, 20, 25
- Node 19 has neighbors: 27
- Node 20 has neighbors: 14, 21, 7, 18
- Node 21 has neighbors: 23, 20, 4
- Node 22 has neighbors: 27, 6
- Node 23 has neighbors: 8, 5, 21, 10, 24
- Node 24 has neighbors: 0, 23, 28, 9, 3
- Node 25 has neighbors: 26, 18
- Node 26 has neighbors: 13, 10, 25, 3
- Node 27 has neighbors: 22, 28, 1, 19
- Node 28 has neighbors: 27, 24
- Node 29 has neighbors: 2, 5, 10

Now, we can identify the nodes with at least three neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars from each of these nodes:
- total 3-stars = \( \sum_{i} inom{d_i}{3} \), where \( d_i \) is the degree of node i

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0:  \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2:  \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5:  \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8:  \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9:  \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 24: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 26: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 

\[ 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 47 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [47].
