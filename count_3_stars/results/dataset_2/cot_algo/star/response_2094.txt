Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 6}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars are:
  - <6, (2, 4, 9)>
  - <6, (2, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (4, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (2, 4, 7)>

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars are:
  - <9, (1, 2, 3)>
  - <9, (1, 2, 6)>
  - <9, (1, 3, 6)>
  - <9, (2, 3, 6)>

In total, there are 8 3-stars: [8].
