Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 18) (1, 16) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (18, 14) (18, 17) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 11) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 8) (19, 11) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 9) (0, 19) (0, 13) (11, 15) (11, 19) (5, 17) (5, 3) (5, 2) (16, 4) (16, 1) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 19) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 0) (6, 19) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

1: 16, 13
2: 5, 9
3: 7, 12, 5, 8
4: 7, 13, 16
5: 3, 2, 17
6: 19
7: 4, 3, 9
8: 3, 10, 15, 12
9: 7, 10, 19, 2
10: 17, 9, 8, 15
11: 19, 15
12: 14, 3, 8
13: 4, 1, 0
14: 17, 18, 12, 15
15: 14, 10, 8, 11
16: 4, 1
17: 14, 10, 18, 5
18: 14, 17
19: 11, 6, 0, 9
0: 19, 13

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 4: [1 3-star]
Node 7: [1 3-star]
Node 14: [1 3-star]
Node 17: [1 3-star]
Node 3: [1 3-star]
Node 10: [1 3-star]
Node 8: [1 3-star]
Node 15: [1 3-star]
Node 12: [1 3-star]
Node 13: [1 3-star]
Node 9: [1 3-star]
Node 19: [1 3-star]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [12].

Unique 3-stars:
<4, 7, 9>
<7, 4, 3>
<14, 12, 15>
<17, 14, 18>
<3, 7, 12>
<10, 17, 9>
<8, 15, 10>
<15, 14, 11>
<12, 14, 8>
<13, 0, 1>
<9, 7, 19>
<19, 11, 15>
