Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 11) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 6) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 0) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 7) (5, 19) (5, 2) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 19) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 8) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 6) (16, 0) (16, 9) (16, 6) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 16) (18, 3) (18, 14) (18, 11) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 16) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 18) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 16, 6}
- Node 1: {15, 14, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 10}
- Node 3: {9, 18, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {19, 2}
- Node 6: {17, 7, 0, 16, 2}
- Node 7: {12, 6, 19, 10}
- Node 8: {0, 1}
- Node 9: {3, 15, 16}
- Node 10: {7, 2}
- Node 11: {15, 0, 18}
- Node 12: {14, 4, 7}
- Node 13: {14, 4, 19}
- Node 14: {18, 1, 12, 13}
- Node 15: {1, 9, 11}
- Node 16: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 17: {6}
- Node 18: {3, 14, 11}
- Node 19: {7, 5, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 18, Node 19

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars formed: 
1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 8, 1>
- <3, 9, 15>
- <6, 16, 0, 2>
- <7, 12, 19>
- <9, 3, 15>
- <12, 4, 13>
- <13, 4, 19>
- <14, 1, 12, 13>
- <15, 1, 11>
- <16, 0, 6>
- <18, 3, 14>
- <19, 7, 5>
