Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 8, 11}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 13, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 8, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 9, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 6, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {10, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 6, 8}
- Node 14: Neighbors {5, 7, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes 6 and 13 each have 5 neighbors, so they can potentially form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars each.
Nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 14 each have 4 neighbors, so they can potentially form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars each.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [40].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
- <6, (0, 8, 13)>
- <13, (5, 6, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 8, 11)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (3, 13, 14)>
- <8, (1, 6, 14)>
- <10, (0, 6, 9)>
- <14, (5, 7, 8)>
