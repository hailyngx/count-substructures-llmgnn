Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 16) (8, 18) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) (0, 17) (0, 6) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 12) (10, 4) (10, 16) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 17) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 11) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 18) (5, 4) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 19) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 6) (17, 19) (3, 14) (3, 9) (16, 8) (16, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 17) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 3) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 11) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 6, 17
- Node 1: 7, 9, 13, 14, 15
- Node 2: 4, 5, 17
- Node 3: 9, 14
- Node 4: 2, 5, 10
- Node 5: 2, 4
- Node 6: 0, 12, 14, 17, 19
- Node 7: 1, 11, 13
- Node 8: 16, 18
- Node 9: 1, 3, 11
- Node 10: 4, 16
- Node 11: 7, 9, 12, 18
- Node 12: 6, 11, 15
- Node 13: 1, 7, 19
- Node 14: 1, 3, 6, 18
- Node 15: 1, 12
- Node 16: 8, 10
- Node 17: 0, 2, 6, 19
- Node 18: 8, 11, 14
- Node 19: 6, 17, 13

Node 1, Node 4, Node 6, and Node 11 each have 5 neighbors, forming 10 3-stars each. 

So the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 \]

Thus, the final answer is [40]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 7, 13>, <1, 9, 11>, <1, 13, 19>, <1, 14, 18>, <1, 15, 12>, <4, 2, 5>, <4, 5, 10>, <6, 0, 17>, <6, 12, 11>, <6, 14, 18>.
