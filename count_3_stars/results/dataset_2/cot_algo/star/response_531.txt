Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 5) (16, 12) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (14, 17) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 19) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (6, 16) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 7) (15, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 19) (19, 17) (19, 1) (19, 8) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 12) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 0) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 0) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 7) (0, 12) (0, 18) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {12, 18}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 19}
- Node 2: {7, 9, 10, 15}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 16}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 19}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 9, 18}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 11: {5, 10}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 16}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 18}
- Node 14: {8, 17}
- Node 15: {2}
- Node 16: {6, 12}
- Node 17: {14, 19}
- Node 18: {0, 9, 13}
- Node 19: {1, 8, 17}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 60

Therefore, the final answer is [60] and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (4, 7, 19)>, <2, (7, 9, 10)>, <4, (1, 6, 12)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 10)>, <9, (2, 5, 18)>, <10, (2, 6, 8)>, <12, (0, 4, 16)>, <13, (3, 4, 18)>, <18, (0, 9, 13)>, <19, (1, 8, 17)>
