Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 4) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 15) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 13) (3, 10) (3, 16) (11, 6) (11, 2) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 8) (8, 19) (8, 9) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (18, 14) (18, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 2) (15, 7) (15, 5) (10, 3) (10, 13) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 16) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 18) (2, 17) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 16) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: 9, 4, 16
2: 17, 7, 11, 16
3: 10, 16
4: 17, 12, 0, 1
5: 12, 19, 15
6: 11, 19, 13
7: 14, 12, 16, 15, 2
8: 19, 9
9: 12, 8, 1
10: 3, 13
11: 6, 2
12: 7, 4, 5, 9
13: 6, 10
14: 17, 18, 7
15: 7, 5
16: 7, 3, 1, 2
17: 14, 0, 2, 4
18: 14, 0
19: 5, 6, 8

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9, Node 12, Node 16, Node 17, and Node 19.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up these 3-star calculations:

\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 34 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<2, (7, 16, 17)>, <4, (0, 1, 17)>, <5, (12, 15, 19)>, <6, (11, 13, 19)>, <7, (12, 14, 15)>, <16, (1, 2, 7)>
