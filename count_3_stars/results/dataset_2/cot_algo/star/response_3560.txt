Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 13) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (2, 8, 10)>
<9, (7, 12, 13)>
<4, (0, 7, 14)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 11, 13)>
<11, (3, 8, 10)>
<13, (0, 8, 12)>
