Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {9, 3, 8, 5, 2}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {9, 3, 0, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 0, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {6, 9, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 8, 0, 2}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {3, 8, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 7, 5, 0}
- Node 9: {4, 2, 0}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 8, Node 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 0 = 64

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 2)>, <0, (3, 8, 5)>, <0, (3, 8, 2)>, <0, (5, 8, 2)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 4)>, <1, (3, 8, 4)>, <1, (5, 8, 4)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 0)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 0, 5)>, <2, (3, 0, 8)>, <2, (3, 8, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 4)>, <3, (1, 8, 4)>, <3, (5, 8, 4)>, <3, (5, 4, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 8, 5)>, <5, (1, 8, 4)>, <5, (1, 8, 4)>, <5, (1, 8, 4)>, <5, (1, 8, 4)>, <5, (8, 4, 1)>
