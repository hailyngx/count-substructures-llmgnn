Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of unique 3-stars formed: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44 \)

So, the final answer is [44] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 2, 8)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
