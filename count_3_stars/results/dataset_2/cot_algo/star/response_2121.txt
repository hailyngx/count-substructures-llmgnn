Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 11) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (2, 14) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 9) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 9) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are:
\[ V = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\} \]

We can determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 2: {14}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {8, 12}
- Node 6: {3, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 5, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 14: {2, 7, 8}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: 1 (\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), but we only count unique 3-stars once)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: 1
- Node 12: 1
- Node 13: 1

Adding these up, we have a total of 44 unique 3-stars:
\[ [44] \]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 10>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 10>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 10>, <1, 8, 10>,
<3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 13>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 13>, <3, 7, 10>, <4, 6, 13>, <4, 8, 13>, <4, 9, 13>, <6, 7, 11>, <7, 9, 14>,
<8, 9, 11>, <8, 9, 13>, <8, 11, 12>, <8, 12, 13>, <9, 10, 11>, <9, 11, 12>, <9, 11, 13>, <9, 11, 14>, <9, 12, 13>,
<10, 11, 12>, <10, 11, 13>
