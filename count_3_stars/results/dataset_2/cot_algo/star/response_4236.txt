Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 13) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 3) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 10) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 14) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 2) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 13) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 14, 1}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 6, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 9, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors {4, 8, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 12: Neighbors {3, 7, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {2, 7, 10}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 7, 12}
  
Now, let's determine the number of 3-star configurations:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 58.
Hence, the final answer is [58], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (4, 11, 13)>
- <4, (2, 9, 10)>
- <5, (0, 7, 11)>
- <7, (5, 11, 14)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
- <14, (1, 7, 12)>
