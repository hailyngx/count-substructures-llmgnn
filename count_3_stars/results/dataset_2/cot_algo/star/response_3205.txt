Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {1, 9}
Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 5, 8}
Node 2: {4, 6, 9}
Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 9}
Node 4: {1, 2, 8}
Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
Node 7: {5, 9}
Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph. From the neighbors list above, we can see that nodes 1, 5, 8, and 9 have 5 or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 50 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [50] and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
