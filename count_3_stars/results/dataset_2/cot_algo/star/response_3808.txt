Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 1) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 13) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors = {13}
- Node 1: neighbors = {9, 7, 2, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors = {7, 12, 8, 1}
- Node 3: neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 14, 6}
- Node 4: neighbors = {5, 11, 6}
- Node 5: neighbors = {9, 12, 4, 3, 10, 14}
- Node 6: neighbors = {12, 3, 4}
- Node 7: neighbors = {10, 11, 12, 3, 2, 1}
- Node 8: neighbors = {10, 2, 3, 1}
- Node 9: neighbors = {5, 14, 1}
- Node 10: neighbors = {5, 11, 8, 7}
- Node 11: neighbors = {10, 14, 7, 4}
- Node 12: neighbors = {5, 7, 2, 13, 6}
- Node 13: neighbors = {12, 14, 0}
- Node 14: neighbors = {5, 9, 11, 3, 13}

Now we will count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing these up, we get a total of 88 3-stars. Therefore, the final count is [88].
