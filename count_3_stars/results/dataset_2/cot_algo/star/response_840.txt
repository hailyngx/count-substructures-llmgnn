Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 14) (1, 4) (21, 1) (21, 0) (21, 9) (21, 15) (2, 29) (2, 12) (29, 1) (29, 2) (29, 14) (29, 3) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 26) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (22, 11) (22, 5) (23, 0) (23, 20) (23, 9) (0, 21) (0, 7) (0, 23) (20, 23) (20, 3) (20, 11) (26, 4) (26, 13) (18, 16) (18, 12) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 27) (3, 29) (3, 20) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 22) (11, 20) (11, 3) (11, 19) (5, 22) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 11) (19, 5) (25, 24) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 16) (12, 24) (12, 14) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 10) (10, 16) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 14) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 15) (9, 21) (9, 23) (14, 1) (14, 29) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 7) (8, 17) (8, 14) (8, 24) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 8) (15, 21) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 28) (28, 15) (27, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {21, 7, 23}
- Node 1: {21, 29, 14, 4}
- Node 2: {29, 12}
- Node 3: {29, 20, 11, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 16, 26}
- Node 5: {22, 19, 15}
- Node 6: {3, 17, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 17, 14, 24}
- Node 9: {21, 23}
- Node 10: {16}
- Node 11: {22, 20, 3, 19}
- Node 12: {2, 18, 16, 24, 14}
- Node 13: {26, 16, 27}
- Node 14: {1, 29, 12, 6, 8}
- Node 15: {21, 5, 17, 28}
- Node 16: {4, 18, 13, 12, 10}
- Node 17: {6, 8, 15}
- Node 18: {12, 16}
- Node 19: {11, 5}
- Node 20: {23, 3, 11}
- Node 21: {1, 0, 9, 15}
- Node 22: {11, 5}
- Node 23: {0, 20, 9}
- Node 24: {25, 12, 8}
- Node 25: {24}
- Node 26: {4, 13}
- Node 27: {13}
- Node 28: {15}

Now let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (21, 29, 14)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 7, 16)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (7, 17, 14)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (2, 18, 16)>
- Node 14 forms two 3-stars: <14, (1, 29, 12)> and <14, (6, 8, 12)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (21, 5, 17)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star: <16, (4, 18, 12)>
- Node 21 forms a 3-star: <21, (1, 0, 15)>
- Node 24 forms a 3-star: <24, (8, 25, 12)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
