Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 9) (12, 0) (12, 6) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 2) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 13) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 18) (15, 14) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 14) (18, 16) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 17) (17, 3) (17, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 6) (6, 12) (6, 8) (14, 15) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 16) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 9) (13, 19) (13, 16) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4, 12, 3, 10
- Node 1: 2, 14, 9
- Node 2: 11, 5, 17, 16, 1
- Node 3: 11, 17, 0, 8
- Node 4: 19, 0
- Node 5: 11, 19, 2
- Node 6: 12, 8
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 3, 10, 6
- Node 9: 7, 11, 1
- Node 10: 0, 8, 18
- Node 11: 3, 9, 5, 2
- Node 12: 0, 6
- Node 13: 19, 16
- Node 14: 15, 18, 1, 16
- Node 15: 14
- Node 16: 18, 2, 14, 13
- Node 17: 3, 2
- Node 18: 19, 10, 14, 16
- Node 19: 4, 5, 18, 13

Now, we can identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 14, Node 16, Node 18, and Node 19

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [36], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 12, 3)>, <2, (11, 5, 17)>, <3, (11, 17, 0)>, <5, (11, 19, 2)>, <8, (3, 10, 6)>, <9, (7, 11, 1)>, <10, (0, 8, 18)>, <11, (3, 9, 5)>, <14, (15, 18, 1)>, <16, (18, 2, 13)>, <18, (19, 10, 14)>, <19, (4, 18, 13)>.
