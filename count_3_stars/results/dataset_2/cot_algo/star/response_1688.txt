Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 3) (11, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 0) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 1) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 0) 

Response:
The central idea is to figure out which nodes are neighbors to each node. Let's first list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 12, 13
Node 1: 0, 7, 9, 10, 14
Node 2: 5, 6, 12, 14
Node 3: 5, 9, 11, 12, 14
Node 4: 8, 10, 13
Node 5: 2, 3, 7, 12
Node 6: 2, 10, 13, 14
Node 7: 1, 5, 11, 14
Node 8: 4, 13
Node 9: 1, 3, 12, 13
Node 10: 1, 4, 6, 12
Node 11: 3, 7, 14
Node 12: 0, 3, 5, 9, 10
Node 13: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 14: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 11

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 12, and 14. 
For these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives us a total of 50 3-stars: [50].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, 10, 14>, <1, 9, 12>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 10>, <1, 7, 11>, <1, 12, 14>, <1, 14, 11>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 0, 12>, 
<3, 5, 14>, <3, 9, 12>, <3, 11, 14>, <3, 9, 1>, <3, 5, 2>, <3, 12, 0>, <3, 12, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 2, 14>, <3, 0, 12>, 
<12, 10, 1>, <12, 9, 1>, <12, 10, 4>, <12, 9, 5>, <12, 3, 5>, <12, 0, 1>, <12, 0, 3>, <12, 5, 7>, <12, 4, 10>, <12, 3, 9>, 
<14, 7, 1>, <14, 5, 2>, <14, 7, 11>, <14, 2, 6>, <14, 1, 0>, <14, 1, 9>, <14, 3, 5>, <14, 3, 2>, <14, 6, 2>, <14, 11, 7>
