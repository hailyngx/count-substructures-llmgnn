Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 3) (4, 12) (4, 19) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 12) (17, 13) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 19) (3, 13) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 15) (15, 9) (15, 1) (15, 11) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 1) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 16) (7, 9) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 10) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 16) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will follow the steps outlined earlier to find the total number of 3-stars formed and list the unique 3-stars.

1. Find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {12, 10, 14}
- Node 1: {15, 10, 12, 17}
- Node 2: {11, 8, 13}
- Node 3: {13}
- Node 4: {19, 12}
- Node 5: {16, 9}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {2, 13, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {5, 14, 11, 7, 15}
- Node 10: {0, 8, 1, 14, 16}
- Node 11: {2, 14, 9, 15}
- Node 12: {8, 0, 1, 4}
- Node 13: {8, 3, 2, 17}
- Node 14: {0, 11, 9, 10}
- Node 15: {1, 11, 9}
- Node 16: {5, 17, 19, 10}
- Node 17: {13, 1, 16, 19}
- Node 19: {16, 4, 17}

Based on the neighbor sets, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars. Nodes 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, and 17 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

2. Calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars are:
<9, 15, 11>
<9, 5, 16>
<9, 14, 11>
<9, 14, 10>
<9, 11, 2>
<10, 0, 14>
<10, 1, 14>
<10, 16, 17>
<10, 16, 5>
<11, 14, 9>
<11, 15, 9>
<11, 15, 1>
<11, 9, 5>
<14, 9, 5>
<16, 5, 9>
<16, 17, 19>
<16, 17, 1>
<16, 10, 0>
<17, 16, 5>
<17, 16, 10>
