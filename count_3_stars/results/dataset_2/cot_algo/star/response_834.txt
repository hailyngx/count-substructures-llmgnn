Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 56 = 103

Therefore, the final answer is [103], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>
