Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 3) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 4) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 0) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 7) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 14) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 13) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {5, 12, 13, 7}
- Node 2: {11, 5, 12, 14, 4}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 9, 12, 0}
- Node 4: {2, 0, 14, 13}
- Node 5: {11, 2, 1, 3, 14}
- Node 6: {11, 7, 3}
- Node 7: {6, 8, 9, 1, 14}
- Node 8: {14, 0, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 13, 12}
- Node 10: {11, 13}
- Node 11: {10, 5, 6, 2}
- Node 12: {9, 2, 3, 1}
- Node 13: {10, 9, 1, 4}
- Node 14: {5, 8, 2, 7, 4}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, Node 9, Node 12, and Node 14 have three or more neighbors.

Now, for each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 66

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [66].

Unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (5, 12, 13)>
- <2, (11, 5, 14)>
- <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (2, 0, 14)>
- <5, (11, 2, 14)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <9, (3, 7, 13)>
- <12, (9, 2, 3)>
- <14, (5, 8, 7)>
