Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 19) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 2) (1, 17) (1, 13) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 5) (5, 17) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 18) (18, 13) (18, 9) (19, 0) (19, 7) (6, 17) (9, 18) (9, 7) (9, 12) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 15) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 3) (16, 10) (16, 4) (16, 17) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 7) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {8, 14, 19, 13, 3}
- Node 1: neighbors {17, 13}
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 14, 3}
- Node 3: neighbors {10, 0, 7, 2}
- Node 4: neighbors {8, 2, 16, 15}
- Node 5: neighbor {17}
- Node 6: neighbor {17}
- Node 7: neighbors {19, 9, 3, 15}
- Node 8: neighbors {4, 15, 0}
- Node 9: neighbors {18, 7, 12}
- Node 10: neighbors {11, 3, 16}
- Node 11: neighbors {10, 12}
- Node 12: neighbors {11, 17, 13, 9}
- Node 13: neighbors {0, 1, 12, 18}
- Node 14: neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 15: neighbors {4, 8, 7}
- Node 16: neighbors {10, 4, 17}
- Node 17: neighbors {1, 6, 16, 12, 5}
- Node 18: neighbors {13, 9}
- Node 19: neighbors {0, 7}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star
- Node 10 can form 1 3-star
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16 can form 1 3-star
- Node 17 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 40 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 13>, <0, 3, 19>, <0, 7, 13>, <0, 7, 19>, <0, 13, 19>, <4, 8, 15>, <4, 8, 2>, <4, 8, 15>, <4, 15, 7>, <4, 15, 8>, <7, 9, 12>, <12, 9, 13>, <17, 5, 6>, <17, 5, 12>, <17, 5, 16>, <17, 5, 1>, <17, 6, 12>, <17, 6, 16>, <17, 6, 5>, <17, 6, 1>, <17, 12, 13>, <17, 12, 16>, <17, 12, 5>, <17, 12, 6>, <17, 16, 5>, <17, 16, 12>, <17, 16, 17>, <17, 16, 10>, <19, 0, 7>, <19, 0, 13>
