Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (15, 3) (15, 23) (15, 14) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 22) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 22) (1, 3) (1, 25) (1, 28) (22, 14) (22, 17) (22, 4) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 28) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 21) (27, 11) (27, 26) (27, 19) (8, 9) (20, 0) (20, 11) (20, 10) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 25) (18, 2) (18, 19) (6, 28) (6, 4) (28, 1) (28, 23) (28, 6) (28, 26) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 29) (11, 14) (11, 27) (11, 20) (11, 29) (5, 13) (5, 25) (5, 4) (5, 16) (13, 5) (26, 27) (26, 28) (26, 25) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 16) (4, 22) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (19, 27) (19, 18) (19, 7) (19, 21) (16, 0) (16, 5) (16, 9) (25, 1) (25, 2) (25, 5) (25, 26) (21, 12) (21, 19) (7, 19) (7, 10) (24, 23) (10, 12) (10, 20) (10, 7) (10, 29) (29, 14) (29, 0) (29, 11) (29, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {20, 4, 16, 29}
- Node 1: {3, 25, 28}
- Node 2: {18, 9, 25}
- Node 3: {15, 1, 21}
- Node 4: {22, 12, 6, 0, 5}
- Node 5: {13, 25, 4, 16}
- Node 6: {28, 4}
- Node 7: {19, 10}
- Node 8: {9}
- Node 9: {8, 2, 16}
- Node 10: {12, 20, 7, 29}
- Node 11: {14, 27, 20, 29}
- Node 12: {4, 10, 21}
- Node 13: {5}
- Node 14: {15, 17, 11, 22, 29}
- Node 15: {3, 14, 23}
- Node 16: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 17: {14, 22}
- Node 18: {2, 19}
- Node 19: {27, 18, 21, 7}
- Node 20: {0, 11, 10}
- Node 21: {12, 19}
- Node 22: {14, 17, 4}
- Node 23: {15, 24, 28}
- Node 24: {23}
- Node 25: {1, 2, 5, 26}
- Node 26: {27, 28, 25}
- Node 27: {11, 26, 19}
- Node 28: {1, 23, 6, 26, 25}
- Node 29: {14, 0, 11, 10}

It can be observed that nodes 0, 4, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 22, 25, and 29 have 3 or more neighbors, hence forming potential 3-stars. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 20, 4, 16>
- <4, 6, 12, 22>
- <10, 11, 20, 29>
- <11, 14, 22, 29>
- <14, 15, 17, 22>
- <15, 23, 28, 14>
- <16, 0, 9, 5>
- <22, 4, 12, 14>
- <25, 1, 2, 5>
- <29, 0, 10, 11>
