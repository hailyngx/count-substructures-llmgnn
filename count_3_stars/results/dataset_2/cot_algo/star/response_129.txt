Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 5, 7, 8, and 9 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 50. 
Thus, the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
- <8, (3, 5, 7)>
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>
