Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 15) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 1) (17, 10) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 6) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 18) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 6) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 13) (4, 19) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 0) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 18) (0, 6) (0, 18) (0, 19) (19, 4) (19, 0) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will first calculate the number of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3 neighbors (6, 18, 19)
Node 1: 3 neighbors (5, 6, 14)
Node 2: 3 neighbors (4, 9, 16)
Node 3: 2 neighbors (6, 7)
Node 4: 2 neighbors (2, 19)
Node 5: 3 neighbors (1, 9, 18)
Node 6: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 13)
Node 7: 5 neighbors (3, 7, 8, 13, 16)
Node 8: 5 neighbors (7, 12, 13, 14, 15)
Node 9: 3 neighbors (2, 5, 15)
Node 10: 3 neighbors (15, 17, 18)
Node 11: 2 neighbors (14, 16)
Node 12: 2 neighbors (8, 13)
Node 13: 5 neighbors (6, 7, 8, 12, 15)
Node 14: 3 neighbors (1, 8, 11)
Node 15: 4 neighbors (9, 10, 13, 15)
Node 16: 3 neighbors (2, 7, 11)
Node 17: 1 neighbor (10)
Node 18: 4 neighbors (0, 5, 7, 10)
Node 19: 2 neighbors (0, 4)

Now, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 13, and Node 18 each have 4 or more neighbors. 
Using the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 13 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 18 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<6, (0, 1, 13)>
<6, (0, 3, 13)>
<6, (1, 3, 13)>
<6, (1, 13, 14)>
<7, (3, 13, 18)>
<7, (3, 8, 13)>
<7, (13, 15, 18)>
<7, (16, 11, 14)>
<8, (7, 12, 13)>
<8, (7, 13, 14)>
<8, (12, 13, 15)>
<8, (13, 14, 15)>
<13, (6, 7, 15)>
<13, (7, 12, 15)>
<13, (7, 15, 18)>
<13, (8, 12, 15)>
<18, (0, 7, 10)>
<18, (5, 7, 10)>
<18, (7, 10, 18)>
<18, (9, 10, 15)>
