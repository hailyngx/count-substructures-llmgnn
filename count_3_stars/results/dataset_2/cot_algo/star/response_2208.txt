Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 5}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 5}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 5: 10C3 = 120
- Node 3: 4C3 = 4
- Node 7: 5C3 = 10
- Node 8: 4C3 = 4
- Node 4: 4C3 = 4
- Node 0: 5C3 = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 120 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 152

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [152], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (7, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (8, 3, 5)>
<0, (8, 5, 7)>
