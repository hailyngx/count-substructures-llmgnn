- Node 4: 3, 15, 24
- Node 5: 6, 19, 26
- Node 6: 5, 13, 21, 12
- Node 7: 3, 20, 28
- Node 8: 0, 9, 16, 20
- Node 9: 8, 27
- Node 10: 11, 20
- Node 11: 10, 14, 23, 24, 29
- Node 12: 6, 23

- Node 19: 5, 18
- Node 20: 7, 8, 10
- Node 21: 6, 17, 28
- Node 22: 15
- Node 23: 11, 12, 24
- Node 24: 4, 11, 14, 23
- Node 25: 17
- Node 26: 3, 5
- Node 27: 2, 9
- Node 28: 3, 7, 13, 15, 21
- Node 29: 11, 14

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 16 has 2 additional neighbors (total: 3). Possible 3-stars: \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0
- Node 3 has 1 additional neighbor (total: 4). Possible 3-stars: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 6 has 1 additional neighbor (total: 4). Possible 3-stars: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 8 has 1 additional neighbor (total: 4). Possible 3-stars: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 11 has 2 additional neighbors (total: 5). Possible 3-stars: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- Node 13 has 1 additional neighbor (total: 4). Possible 3-stars: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 14 has 2 additional neighbors (total: 5). Possible 3-stars: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- Node 15 has 1 additional neighbor (total: 4). Possible 3-stars: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 17 has 1 additional neighbor (total: 4). Possible 3-stars: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 21 has 1 additional neighbor (total: 4). Possible 3-stars: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 24 has 1 additional neighbor (total: 4). Possible 3-stars: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 28 has 2 additional neighbors (total: 5). Possible 3-stars: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].
