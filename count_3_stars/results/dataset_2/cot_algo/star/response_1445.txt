Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 14) (15, 18) (15, 8) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 0) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 1) (17, 19) (1, 17) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 13) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 12) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 16) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 16) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 11) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 5) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {6, 4, 10, 16}
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {7, 2, 0, 13}
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {3, 4, 14, 5, 14}
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: {15, 9, 13, 11, 15}
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {8, 12, 11, 8}
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: {6, 9, 16, 19}
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors: {13, 17, 5, 14, 12}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (15, 9, 13)>
<19, (13, 17, 14)>
