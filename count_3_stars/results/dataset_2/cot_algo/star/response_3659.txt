Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 18) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 12) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 13) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 11) (13, 2) (13, 18) (7, 6) (7, 5) (16, 5) (16, 18) (0, 10) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 16) (11, 5) (11, 1) (12, 10) (12, 5) (19, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {10}
- Node 1: {4, 11, 15}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {2, 9, 15}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 8, 15}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 11, 12, 16}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 10, 17}
- Node 7: {5, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 9, 15, 18}
- Node 9: {3, 8, 18}
- Node 10: {0, 6, 12, 17}
- Node 11: {1, 5}
- Node 12: {5, 10}
- Node 13: {2, 18}
- Node 14: {2, 17, 19}
- Node 15: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 16: {5, 18}
- Node 17: {6, 10, 14}
- Node 18: {8, 9, 13, 16}
- Node 19: {14}

Nodes 0, 14, and 19 have less than 3 neighbors, so they do not participate in forming 3-stars.

For the remaining nodes with 3 or more neighbors, let's count the number of 3-stars for each of them:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 37

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [37]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 11, 15)>, <2, (3, 13, 14)>, <2, (4, 13, 14)>, <2, (13, 14, 17)>, <2, (13, 14, 18)>, <3, (2, 9, 15)>, <4, (1, 8, 15)>, <4, (2, 8, 15)>, <4, (8, 15, 18)>, <5, (6, 11, 12)>, <5, (6, 11, 16)>, <5, (6, 12, 16)>, <5, (11, 12, 16)>, <6, (7, 10, 17)>, <8, (4, 9, 15)>, <9, (3, 8, 18)>, <10, (6, 12, 17)>, <15, (1, 8, 15)>, <17, (10, 14, 17)>, <18, (13, 16, 18)>.
