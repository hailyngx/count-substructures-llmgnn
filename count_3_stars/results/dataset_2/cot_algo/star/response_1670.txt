Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 5) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

1: {3, 5, 9, 11}
2: {4, 6, 9, 10}
3: {1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}
4: {2, 7}
5: {1, 3, 10, 11, 13}
6: {0, 2, 3, 12, 14}
7: {3, 4, 9}
8: {3, 9, 10}
9: {1, 2, 7, 8, 0}
10: {2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 14}
11: {0, 1, 5, 10, 12}
12: {6, 11, 13, 14}
13: {5, 12}
14: {6, 10, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: Already has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up:

\[ 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 53 \]

So, there are a total of 53 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [53], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 5, 11>
<1, 9, 11>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 10>
<2, 9, 10>
<3, 5, 10>
<3, 5, 11>
<3, 8, 10>
<3, 10, 11>
<5, 11, 13>
<6, 11, 14>
<6, 12, 14>
