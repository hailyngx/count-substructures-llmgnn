Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {7, 8}

Next, we identify which nodes can form 3-stars:

- Node 1 and Node 3 have 4 neighbors each, so they can each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 and Node 8 have 4 neighbors each, so they can each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5, Node 6, and Node 7 have 4 neighbors each, so they can each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 16, so we represent this as [16].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>
