Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 4, 7, 9, 6, 1}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 9, 7, 3, 0}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 7, 6, 1}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 8, 0, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4, 0, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 3, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 8, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 4, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 8, 2, 1, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 53

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [53].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 5, 4, 3>
- <1, 5, 3, 7>
- <3, 5, 0, 1>
- <4, 5, 0, 8>
- <0, 5, 1, 9>
- <0, 5, 1, 7>
- <0, 5, 3, 1>
- <0, 5, 3, 6>
- <0, 1, 9, 6>
- <0, 1, 9, 8>
- <0, 1, 7, 8>
