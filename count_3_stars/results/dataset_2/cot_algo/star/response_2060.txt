Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 8, 2}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 0, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 0}
- Node 4: {6, 8, 2, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 8}
- Node 8: {9, 1, 4, 7, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 7}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 48 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

Unique 3-stars found: 
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
