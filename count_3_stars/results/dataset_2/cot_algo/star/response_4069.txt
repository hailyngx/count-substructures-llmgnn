Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 6) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 13) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 14) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 9) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 9) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 10, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 9, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 11, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 10, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 4, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {6, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 7, 9}
- Node 13: Neighbors {7, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {9, 10, 13}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 13: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Summing up the number of 3-stars from each node: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 57

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [57]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <0, (9, 10, 12)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- <2, (7, 9, 12)>
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- <4, (2, 9, 10)>
- <6, (1, 3, 11)>
- <6, (3, 11, 13)>
- <7, (2, 5, 13)>
- <7, (5, 12, 13)>
- <9, (0, 12, 14)>
- <9, (2, 4, 13)>
- <9, (4, 13, 14)>
- <9, (9, 12, 14)>
- <10, (4, 11, 14)>
- <10, (10, 11, 14)>
- <13, (7, 9, 14)>
