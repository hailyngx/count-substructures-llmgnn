Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 15) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 3) (1, 17) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 14) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 12) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 15) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 19) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 15) (19, 0) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 15) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 15) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 14) (13, 10) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 7, 19}
- Node 1: {5, 17}
- Node 2: {5, 10}
- Node 3: {6, 9, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 18}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 10, 15, 18}
- Node 8: {15}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 18}
- Node 10: {2, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {16, 17, 18, 13, 15}
- Node 13: {10, 12}
- Node 14: {3, 10, 15}
- Node 15: {7, 8, 12, 14, 16}
- Node 16: {11, 12, 15, 17}
- Node 17: {1, 12, 16}
- Node 18: {4, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 19: {0}

Now, let's identify nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 24 3-stars, so the answer is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <12, (16, 15, 17)>
- <15, (7, 12, 14)>
- <16, (11, 15, 17)>
- <16, (12, 15, 17)>
