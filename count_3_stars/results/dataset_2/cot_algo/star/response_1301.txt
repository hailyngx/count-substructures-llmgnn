Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 3) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 12) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 3) (13, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 9, 4, 11, 3, 12
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 9, 14, 2, 10
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 7, 11, 14, 3, 1
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 7, 8, 0, 13, 2
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 5, 7, 8, 0, 11
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 6, 4, 10
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 5, 9, 12
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 4, 3, 2, 8
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 4, 7, 12, 3
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 6, 10, 1, 0
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 5, 9, 1
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 4, 14, 0, 2
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 6, 8, 0, 1, 13
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors: 3, 12
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 8, 11, 1, 2

Now, let's calculate the total number of unique 3-stars formed in this graph:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<0, (9, 4, 11)>, <0, (9, 4, 3)>, <0, (9, 4, 12)>, <0, (9, 11, 3)>, <0, (9, 11, 12)>,
<0, (9, 3, 12)>, <0, (4, 11, 3)>, <0, (4, 11, 12)>, <0, (4, 3, 12)>, <0, (11, 3, 12)>

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<1, (9, 14, 2)>, <1, (9, 14, 10)>, <1, (9, 2, 10)>, <1, (14, 2, 10)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<2, (7, 11, 14)>, <2, (7, 11, 3)>, <2, (7, 11, 1)>, <2, (7, 14, 3)>, <2, (7, 14, 1)>,
<2, (7, 3, 1)>, <2, (11, 14, 3)>, <2, (11, 14, 1)>, <2, (11, 3, 1)>, <2, (14, 3, 1)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<3, (7, 8, 0)>, <3, (7, 8, 13)>, <3, (7, 0, 13)>, <3, (8, 0, 13)>,
<3, (0, 13, 12)>, <3, (7, 0, 12)>, <3, (7, 8, 12)>, <3, (8, 0, 12)>,
<3, (8, 13, 12)>, <3, (0, 13, 12)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 11)>, <4, (5, 7, 0)>, <4, (5, 7, 3)>, <4, (5, 8, 11)>,
<4, (5, 8, 0)>, <4, (5, 8, 3)>, <4, (5, 11, 0)>, <4, (5, 11, 3)>, <4, (5, 0, 3)>

- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<12, (6, 8, 0)>, <12, (6, 8, 1)>, <12, (6, 8, 13)>, <12, (6, 0, 1)>, <12, (6, 0, 13)>,
<12, (6, 1, 13)>, <12, (8, 0, 1)>, <12, (8, 0, 13)>, <12, (8, 1, 13)>, <12, (0, 1, 13)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].
