Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 11) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 14) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we first need to identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 6, 12}
- Node 10: {1, 4, 5, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 13}
- Node 12: {2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 13: {0, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {3, 10, 13}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph by counting the number of sets of 3 neighbors each node has:

- Node 4 has exactly 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, forming 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, forming 10 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 30 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [30]. 

The unique 3-star configurations are:

<4, (5, 8, 12)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<12, (2, 4, 9)>
