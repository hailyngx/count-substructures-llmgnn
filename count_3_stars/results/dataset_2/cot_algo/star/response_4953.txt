Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 15) (9, 21) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 11) (26, 16) (12, 27) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 7) (15, 9) (15, 22) (20, 13) (20, 24) (20, 11) (7, 27) (21, 9) (21, 28) (21, 18) (28, 21) (28, 6) (28, 5) (28, 10) (28, 25) (6, 28) (6, 17) (6, 18) (2, 19) (2, 10) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 10) (13, 26) (13, 20) (13, 16) (13, 0) (19, 12) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 29) (17, 6) (17, 0) (25, 28) (25, 22) (24, 20) (24, 8) (24, 14) (11, 26) (11, 20) (11, 14) (14, 24) (14, 11) (14, 22) (14, 1) (14, 23) (1, 14) (1, 29) (1, 16) (1, 18) (29, 19) (29, 1) (29, 5) (0, 13) (0, 17) (0, 3) (3, 0) (5, 28) (5, 29) (5, 23) (23, 14) (23, 5) (22, 15) (22, 25) (22, 14) (16, 26) (16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 4) (10, 28) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 4) (18, 21) (18, 6) (18, 1) (18, 16) (4, 16) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {13, 17, 3}
- Node 1: {14, 16, 18, 29}
- Node 2: {8, 10, 19}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {10, 16}
- Node 5: {23, 28, 29}
- Node 6: {17, 18, 28}
- Node 7: {12, 27}
- Node 8: {2, 10, 19, 24}
- Node 9: {15, 21, 26}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 8, 28}
- Node 11: {14, 20, 26}
- Node 12: {7, 19, 27}
- Node 13: {0, 16, 20, 26}
- Node 14: {1, 11, 22, 23}
- Node 15: {9, 22}
- Node 16: {1, 4, 13, 18, 26}
- Node 17: {0, 6}
- Node 18: {1, 6, 16, 21}
- Node 19: {2, 8, 12, 29}
- Node 20: {11, 13, 24}
- Node 21: {9, 18, 28}
- Node 22: {14, 15, 25}
- Node 23: {5, 14}
- Node 24: {8, 20}
- Node 25: {22, 28}
- Node 26: {9, 11, 13, 16}
- Node 27: {7, 12}
- Node 28: {5, 6, 10, 21, 25}
- Node 29: {1, 5, 19}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 1, 10, 16, 18, 19, 28 can each form a 3-star because they have 4 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = \binom{1}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{16}{3} + \binom{18}{3} + \binom{19}{3} + \binom{28}{3} = 0 + 120 + 560 + 816 + 969 + 3276 = 5741 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5741].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, 16, 18>
<10, 4, 8>
<16, 1, 18>
<18, 1, 16>
<19, 2, 29>
<28, 5, 25>
