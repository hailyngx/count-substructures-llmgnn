Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 16) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 13) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 18) (8, 19) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 15) (13, 10) (13, 17) (19, 8) (19, 16) (19, 12) (16, 3) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 18) (16, 2) (6, 10) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 12) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 14) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 18) (18, 1) (18, 17) (18, 16) (18, 12) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 14, 15, 16}
- Node 1: {3, 18}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 11, 16}
- Node 3: {1, 16}
- Node 4: {11, 17}
- Node 5: {2, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {10}
- Node 7: {2, 9, 11}
- Node 8: {19}
- Node 9: {0, 7, 14}
- Node 10: {6, 13, 17}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 12: {5, 18, 19}
- Node 13: {10, 17}
- Node 14: {0, 9, 15}
- Node 15: {0, 14, 17}
- Node 16: {0, 2, 3, 18, 19}
- Node 17: {4, 10, 13, 15, 18}
- Node 18: {1, 12, 16, 17}
- Node 19: {8, 12, 16}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 42 \).

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
