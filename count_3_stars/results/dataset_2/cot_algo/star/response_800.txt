Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 12) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 2) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 13) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 10) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes that have at least 3 neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 59

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [59].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 8, 14>, <0, 8, 13>, <0, 13, 11>, <0, 13, 1>, <2, 1, 12>, <2, 1, 13>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 10>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 10>, <2, 7, 10>, <2, 12, 1>, <2, 12, 1>, <4, 5, 11>, <4, 5, 11>, <4, 7, 2>, <4, 7, 10>, <4, 7, 10>, <4, 9...
