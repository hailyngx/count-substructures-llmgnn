Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph by checking each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 6: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 35 + 10 = 45
Thus, the final answer is [45].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (7, 9, 8)>
<9, (8, 6, 9)>
