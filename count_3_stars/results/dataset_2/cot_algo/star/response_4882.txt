Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 5, 9, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 0, 6, 9, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 0, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 1, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3}
- Node 7: {0, 9, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 1, 3, 2, 9, 5}
- Node 9: {7, 1, 3, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 60

Therefore, the final answer is [60]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>
