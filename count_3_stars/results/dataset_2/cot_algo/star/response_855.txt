Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 6) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 0) (6, 14) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
  1 -- 2
 /|   /|
0 |  3 |
|  |/  |
5--4---7
| /|  /|
| 8|10 |
|/ |/  |
  9--13
   |  
   11-12
   |
   14
```

Now let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

From the given edges, we can construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 9, 13, 11, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 11, 2, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 8, 12, 11}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 7, 3, 11}
- Node 5: {12, 4, 0, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 14}
- Node 7: {5, 4, 10, 8, 14}
- Node 8: {7, 13, 2, 12}
- Node 9: {4, 10, 0}
- Node 10: {7, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {4, 1, 13, 2, 0, 12}
- Node 12: {5, 8, 2, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {8, 11, 0}
- Node 14: {7, 1, 6}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 92 \). 

Therefore, the final answer is [92].
