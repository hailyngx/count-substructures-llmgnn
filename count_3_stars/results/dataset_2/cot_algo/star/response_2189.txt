Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 16) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (17, 19) (17, 18) (17, 11) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 19) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 4) (0, 19) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 15) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 10) (15, 2) (15, 16) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 13) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (16, 9) (16, 2) (16, 1) (16, 15) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 18) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 3) (18, 10) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 3) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 13) (13, 11) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {4, 19}
- Node 1: {2, 10, 16}
- Node 2: {1, 15, 16}
- Node 3: {7, 8, 18, 19}
- Node 4: {0, 9}
- Node 5: {12, 14}
- Node 6: {8, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {3, 11, 19}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 10}
- Node 9: {4, 16}
- Node 10: {1, 8, 18}
- Node 11: {7, 13, 14, 17, 18}
- Node 12: {5, 6, 14}
- Node 13: {6, 11}
- Node 14: {5, 11, 12}
- Node 15: {2, 16}
- Node 16: {1, 2, 9, 15}
- Node 17: {11, 18, 19}
- Node 18: {3, 10, 11, 17}
- Node 19: {0, 3, 7, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 8, Node 11, Node 12, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, and Node 19 have at least three neighbors.

For the nodes listed above, we need to calculate the number of unique 3-stars they participate in:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].
The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 10, 16>
- <2, 1, 16>
- <3, 7, 18>
- <8, 3, 10>
- <11, 7, 18>
- <12, 5, 14>
- <16, 1, 2>
- <17, 11, 19>
- <18, 3, 10>
- <19, 3, 7>
