Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (10, 15) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 12) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 19) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 19) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 12) (1, 7) (1, 17) (15, 10) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (12, 17) (12, 2) (3, 7) (3, 13) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 14) (6, 16) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (18, 16) (18, 14) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 6, 14, 19}
- Node 1: {7, 17}
- Node 2: {0, 10, 12}
- Node 3: {7, 13}
- Node 4: {7, 8}
- Node 5: {8, 9, 11}
- Node 6: {0, 7, 14, 16}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 9, 16}
- Node 9: {5, 8}
- Node 10: {2, 15}
- Node 11: {5, 16, 17, 19}
- Node 12: {2, 17}
- Node 13: {3, 16, 17}
- Node 14: {0, 6, 18, 19}
- Node 15: {10}
- Node 16: {6, 8, 11, 13, 18}
- Node 17: {1, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 18: {14, 16}
- Node 19: {0, 11, 14}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars around those nodes:

- Node 0, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13, 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star
- Node 14, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16, 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17, 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19, 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 36 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 6, 14)>
- <0, (2, 6, 19)>
- <0, (2, 14, 19)>
- <0, (6, 14, 19)>
- <6, (7, 14, 16)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 6, 17)>
- <7, (4, 6, 14)>
- <8, (4, 5, 16)>
- <8, (4, 9, 16)>
- <8, (5, 9, 16)>
- <8, (5, 11, 16)>
- <11, (5, 16, 17)>
- <13, (3, 16, 17)>
- <14, (6, 18, 19)>
- <16, (11, 13, 17)>
- <16, (11, 13, 18)>
- <16, (11, 17, 18)>
- <16, (13, 17, 18)>
- <17, (1, 12, 13)>
- <17, (11, 12, 13)>
- <17, (11, 13, 18)>
- <17, (12, 13, 18)>
