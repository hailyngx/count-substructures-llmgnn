Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 3) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 5) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 1) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 10) (16, 17) (16, 0) (16, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 12) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 8) (11, 18) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 17) (2, 4) (2, 10) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 6) (3, 14) (3, 18) (9, 14) (9, 12) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 12) (10, 18) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 9) (12, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 16}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {4, 10, 17}
- Node 3: {14, 18}
- Node 4: {2, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 15, 16}
- Node 7: {0, 10, 15, 19}
- Node 8: {6, 14, 17}
- Node 9: {12, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 5, 7, 18}
- Node 11: {18}
- Node 12: {1, 9, 15, 19}
- Node 13: {5}
- Node 14: {3, 8, 9, 17}
- Node 15: {6, 7, 12}
- Node 16: {0, 6, 17}
- Node 17: {2, 8, 14, 16}
- Node 18: {3, 10, 11}
- Node 19: {7, 12}

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Only nodes with 3 or more neighbors can form 3-stars. Nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, and 17 meet this criterion.

Calculating 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 3: \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0 3-stars
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 10: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 14: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 15: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 16: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 17: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 26

Therefore, the final answer is [26], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 16>, <6, 1, 10>, <6, 1, 12>, <6, 7, 15>, <8, 6, 17>, <8, 14, 17>, <10, 1, 12>, <10, 2, 18>, <10, 5, 13>, <10, 5, 7>, <14, 8, 17>, <14, 9, 12>, <14, 9, 17>, <15, 7, 12>, <16, 0, 6>, <17, 2, 8>, <17, 2, 16>, <17, 8, 14>, <18, 3, 10>, <18, 10, 11>, <6, 15, 12>, <7, 0, 1>, <10, 1, 2>, <10, 7, 15>, <17, 14, 9>, <17, 16, 0>, <19, 7, 12>
