Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 8) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 12) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 9) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 8) (8, 15) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 9) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 12) (4, 9) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 11) (6, 0) (6, 16) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 16) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 13) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 14) (16, 9) (5, 10) (11, 17) (11, 12) (11, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 7, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 16, 9}
- Node 2: {18, 1}
- Node 3: {15, 0, 14}
- Node 4: {17, 19, 12, 9}
- Node 5: {10}
- Node 6: {0, 16}
- Node 7: {0, 14, 8}
- Node 8: {15, 10, 7, 19, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 19, 4, 16, 13}
- Node 10: {17, 8, 5}
- Node 11: {17, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {18, 4, 11}
- Node 13: {9, 11}
- Node 14: {3, 7, 8, 16}
- Node 15: {3, 8}
- Node 16: {1, 6, 14, 9}
- Node 17: {10, 11, 4}
- Node 18: {2, 12}
- Node 19: {8, 4, 9}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 and Node 16 do not have 3 or more neighbors to form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].
