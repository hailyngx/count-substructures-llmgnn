Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 7
Node 1: 2, 5, 6
Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 8
Node 3: 0, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 4: 2, 3, 7, 8
Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 8, 9
Node 6: 0, 1, 8, 9
Node 7: 0, 3, 4
Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Node 9: 3, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

Nodes 0, 3, and 8 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form 10 3-stars each.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors but only forms 1 3-star.
Nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9 have 4 neighbors each, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 31

Therefore, the answer is [31], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (8, 6, 9)>
