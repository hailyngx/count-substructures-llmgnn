Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 26) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 23) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 23) (17, 7) (22, 14) (22, 23) (22, 16) (23, 14) (23, 17) (23, 22) (23, 3) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 27) (15, 19) (15, 4) (20, 4) (29, 12) (29, 11) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 12) (26, 6) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 18) (3, 23) (3, 11) (3, 28) (11, 29) (11, 3) (11, 25) (11, 2) (28, 8) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 1) (18, 8) (18, 26) (4, 15) (4, 20) (4, 27) (27, 13) (27, 4) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 25) (7, 5) (25, 11) (25, 7) (25, 24) (21, 6) (21, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 24) (16, 10) (24, 17) (24, 25) (24, 16) (10, 16) (10, 19) (19, 15) (19, 10) (1, 13) (1, 28) (1, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 21) (12, 14) (12, 29) (12, 0) 

Response:
The total number of nodes is 30, and the total number of edges is 90. 

Now let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- First, we need to identify the neighbors for each node:  

1. Node 0: {14, 16, 12}
2. Node 1: {13, 28, 5}
3. Node 2: {9, 11, 21}
4. Node 3: {23, 11, 28}
5. Node 4: {15, 20, 27}
6. Node 5: {7, 1}
7. Node 6: {9, 21, 26}
8. Node 7: {17, 9, 25}
9. Node 8: {13, 26, 18}
10. Node 9: {6, 2, 7}
11. Node 10: {16, 19}
12. Node 11: {29, 3, 25, 2}
13. Node 12: {14, 29, 0}
14. Node 13: {8, 26, 27, 1}
15. Node 14: {17, 0, 22, 12, 23}
16. Node 15: {19, 4}
17. Node 16: {22, 0, 24, 10}
18. Node 17: {14, 24, 23, 7}
19. Node 18: {8, 26}
20. Node 19: {10, 15}
21. Node 20: {4}
22. Node 21: {6, 2}
23. Node 22: {14, 23, 16}
24. Node 23: {14, 17, 22, 3}
25. Node 24: {17, 25, 16}
26. Node 25: {11, 7, 24}
27. Node 26: {13, 6, 28, 18}
28. Node 27: {13, 4}
29. Node 28: {8, 26, 3, 1}
30. Node 29: {11, 12}

- Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
2. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
3. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
5. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
6. Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
7. Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
8. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
9. Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
10. Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
11. Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
12. Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
13. Node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is 37, so the final answer is [37].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (11, 25, 28)>, <7, (9, 17, 25)>, <13, (1, 26, 27)>, <13, (8, 26, 27)>, <14, (0, 22, 23)>, <14, (12, 22, 23)>, <14, (17, 22, 23)>, <14, (22, 23, 24)>, <16, (0, 22, 23)>, <16, (14, 22, 23)>, <16, (22, 23, 24)>, <16, (22, 23, 24)>
