Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 9, 4, 7, 3, 2
- Node 1: 5, 4, 3, 2
- Node 2: 9, 1, 3, 0
- Node 3: 9, 4, 1, 6, 2, 0
- Node 4: 5, 0, 1, 3
- Node 5: 9, 1, 4
- Node 6: 7, 3, 8
- Node 7: 9, 0, 6, 8
- Node 8: 7, 6
- Node 9: 5, 2, 3, 7, 0

Next, we identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 9, and Node 7 have 5 neighbors each.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the final answer is [54], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (0, 7, 5)>
- <7, (0, 9, 8)>
