Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 9) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 4) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 4) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 4) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 2) (12, 9) (12, 6) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 4) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 10, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 11, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 11}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 5, 9, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 7, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 4, 5}
- Node 11: Neighbors {3, 4, 7, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 6, 9}
- Node 13: Neighbors {6, 7, 11}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}

Now, we'll check for each node if it has three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for that node:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 86 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [86].
