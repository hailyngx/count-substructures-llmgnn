Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 6) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 5) (18, 2) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 0) (3, 11) (3, 4) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 17) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 7) (17, 13) (17, 1) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 4) (15, 16) (8, 5) (8, 9) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 14) (12, 1) (12, 4) (0, 9) (0, 6) (16, 15) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 15) (7, 19) (14, 4) (19, 4) (19, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {9, 6}
- Node 1: {11, 17, 12, 7}
- Node 2: {18, 7}
- Node 3: {11, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 15, 12, 19, 14}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 13, 8, 18}
- Node 6: {5, 10, 0}
- Node 7: {11, 2, 1, 15, 19}
- Node 8: {5, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 10, 0}
- Node 10: {9, 11, 15, 6}
- Node 11: {10, 3, 7, 1, 13}
- Node 12: {1, 4}
- Node 13: {5, 11, 17}
- Node 14: {4}
- Node 15: {10, 7, 4, 16}
- Node 16: {15}
- Node 17: {13, 1}
- Node 18: {5, 2}
- Node 19: {4, 7}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:

For Node 5: Total neighbors = 5, so we can form [\( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10] 3-stars. The 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 6, 13)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<5, (9, 6, 18)>
<5, (9, 13, 8)>
<5, (9, 13, 18)>
<5, (9, 8, 18)>
<5, (6, 13, 8)>
<5, (6, 13, 18)>
<5, (6, 8, 18)>
<5, (13, 8, 18)>

Since Node 5 has exactly 5 neighbors, it forms 10 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
