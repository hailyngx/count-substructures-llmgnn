Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 10) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 10) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (6, 1) (6, 14) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 9, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {6, 7, 10}
- Node 2: {0, 8, 10}
- Node 3: {4, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 5: {4, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 2, 5, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 4, 8, 13}
- Node 12: {3, 7, 13}
- Node 13: {3, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 5, 6, 9}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, Node 12 don't have 3 or more neighbors so they cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 1: Only 1 possible 3-star: <1, 6, 14>.
- Node 3: Has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, 4, 12>, <3, 4, 13>, <3, 12, 13>, <4, 12, 13>.
- Node 4: Has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <4, 8, 9>, <4, 8, 11>, <4, 9, 11>, <8, 9, 11>, <4, 8, 7>, <4, 9, 7>, <4, 11, 7>, <8, 9, 7>, <8, 11, 7>, <9, 11, 7>.
- Node 7: Has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <7, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 12>, <7, 9, 12>, <8, 9, 12>.
- Node 8: Has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <8, 4, 7>, <8, 4, 9>, <8, 4, 11>, <8, 7, 9>, <8, 7, 11>, <8, 9, 11>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 11>, <4, 9, 11>, <7, 9, 11>.
- Node 9: Has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <9, 4, 7>, <9, 4, 8>, <9, 4, 14>, <9, 7, 8>, <9, 7, 14>, <9, 8, 14>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 14>, <4, 8, 14>, <7, 8, 14>.
- Node 10: Has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <10, 0, 13>, <10, 0, 5>, <10, 0, 2>, <10, 0, 11>, <10, 13, 5>, <10, 13, 11>, <10, 5, 2>, <10, 5, 11>, <10, 2, 11>, <0, 5, 11>.
- Node 11: Has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <11, 0, 13>, <11, 0, 4>, <11, 0, 8>, <11, 13, 4>.
- Node 13: Has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <13, 3, 10>, <13, 3, 11>, <13, 3, 12>, <13, 10, 11>.
- Node 14: Has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <14, 3, 5>, <14, 3, 6>, <14, 3, 9>, <14, 5, 6>, <14, 5, 9>, <14, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 9>.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 57 3-stars in the graph.

Hence, the final answer is [57].
