Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 8, 4, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 3, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 7, 1, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 7, 1, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 7, 0}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 2, 0, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 7, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9, 4, 3, 6, 2, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 3, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 4, 3, 7, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 5, Node 7, Node 9

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars 
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars 

Total number of 3-stars: 4 (from Node 5) + 20 (from Node 7) + 20 (from Node 9) = 44
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

Unique 3-stars found: <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (6, 7, 5)>, <9, (6, 7, 4)>, <9, (0, 7, 5)>, <9, (0, 7, 4)>.
