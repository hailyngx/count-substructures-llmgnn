Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 27) (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 10) (17, 20) (17, 12) (17, 5) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 28) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 24) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 12) (7, 18) (7, 26) (21, 24) (28, 29) (28, 3) (28, 13) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 25) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 23) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 26) (8, 22) (22, 6) (22, 8) (22, 5) (13, 28) (13, 26) (13, 15) (26, 7) (26, 18) (26, 8) (26, 13) (26, 1) (20, 14) (20, 17) (20, 12) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 1) (3, 28) (19, 2) (19, 11) (23, 14) (23, 18) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 20) (0, 6) (0, 11) (1, 10) (1, 26) (1, 16) (1, 27) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 22) (5, 25) (25, 2) (25, 4) (25, 5) (15, 13) (15, 24) (27, 9) (27, 1) (24, 10) (24, 21) (24, 15) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 11}
- Node 1: {10, 16, 26, 27}
- Node 2: {8, 19, 25, 29}
- Node 3: {28}
- Node 4: {5, 18, 25}
- Node 5: {4, 17, 22, 25}
- Node 6: {0, 12, 22}
- Node 7: {18, 26}
- Node 8: {2, 9, 16, 22, 26}
- Node 9: {8, 27}
- Node 10: {1, 11, 14, 16, 24}
- Node 11: {0, 10, 12, 19}
- Node 12: {6, 11, 17, 20}
- Node 13: {15, 26, 28}
- Node 14: {10, 20, 23}
- Node 15: {13, 24}
- Node 16: {1, 8, 10}
- Node 17: {5, 12, 20}
- Node 18: {4, 7, 23, 26}
- Node 19: {2, 11}
- Node 20: {12, 14, 17}
- Node 21: {24}
- Node 22: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 23: {14, 18}
- Node 24: {10, 15, 21}
- Node 25: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 26: {1, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 27: {1, 9}
- Node 28: {3, 13, 29}
- Node 29: {2, 28}

After analyzing the neighbor sets, the nodes with at least 3 neighbors that form 3-stars are: 1, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16, 26.

Now, let's calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 16: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 26: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 37

Therefore, the final answer is [37], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 10, 16>
- <1, 10, 27>
- <1, 16, 26>
- <1, 24, 15>
- <8, 9, 27>
- <8, 16, 10>
- <8, 16, 26>
- <8, 22, 6>
- <8, 26, 7>
- <8, 26, 13>
- <8, 26, 1>
- <10, 11, 0>
- <10, 11, 12>
- <10, 11, 19>
- <10, 16, 1>
- <10, 16, 26>
- <11, 0, 6>
- <11, 12, 6>
- <11, 12, 17>
- <11, 19, 2>
- <12, 6, 22>
- <12, 17, 20>
- <12, 20, 14>
- <16, 1, 27>
- <16, 8, 2>
- <16, 10, 1>
- <16, 26, 1>
- <26, 1, 16>
- <26, 1, 27>
- <26, 7, 18>
- <26, 8, 2>
- <26, 8, 22>
- <26, 13, 15>
- <26, 13, 28>
- <26, 18, 4>
- <26, 18, 7>
- <26, 18, 23>
