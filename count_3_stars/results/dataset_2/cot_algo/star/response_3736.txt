Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 15) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 3) (10, 6) (10, 13) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 11) (3, 19) (3, 17) (3, 16) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 11) (11, 0) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 17) (7, 18) (7, 14) (7, 15) (7, 13) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 7) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 12) (1, 19) (1, 4) (16, 2) (16, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 17, 11}
- Node 1: Neighbors {19, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 16, 15}
- Node 3: Neighbors {19, 17, 16}
- Node 4: Neighbors {14, 9, 1}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 10, 15}
- Node 7: Neighbors {18, 14, 15, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 19, 17}
- Node 9: Neighbors {18, 0, 4, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors {6, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 19, 9, 17}
- Node 12: Neighbor {13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {10, 7, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {7, 4}
- Node 15: Neighbors {2, 18, 6, 7}
- Node 16: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 17: Neighbors {0, 8, 3, 11}
- Node 18: Neighbors {9, 15, 7}
- Node 19: Neighbors {8, 11, 1, 3}

Now, we will check for each node that has three or more neighbors to see if they can form a 3-star:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars
- Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <3, (19, 17, 11)>, <3, (19, 17, 16)>, <3, (17, 11, 0)>, <3, (17, 11, 19)>
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <7, (18, 15, 14)>, <7, (18, 15, 13)>, <7, (18, 15, 6)>, <7, (15, 14, 4)>
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <9, (18, 4, 11)>, <9, (18, 4, 9)>, <9, (18, 4, 0)>, <9, (4, 11, 0)>
- Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 15: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <15, (18, 7, 15)>, <15, (18, 7, 6)>, <15, (18, 7, 14)>, <15, (7, 6, 13)>
- Node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <17, (19, 11, 0)>, <17, (19, 11, 17)>, <17, (19, 11, 3)>, <17, (11, 0, 17)>
- Node 18: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 19: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <19, (11, 4, 1)>, <19, (11, 3, 1)>, <19, (4, 1, 19)>, <19, (11, 0, 3)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].
