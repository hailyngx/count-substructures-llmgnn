Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 0) (22, 12) (18, 22) (18, 6) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 26) (23, 11) (23, 7) (23, 24) (23, 27) (26, 8) (26, 2) (26, 16) (26, 0) (1, 20) (1, 14) (1, 19) (17, 25) (17, 3) (17, 28) (11, 23) (11, 6) (11, 29) (11, 25) (10, 8) (10, 21) (10, 20) (21, 10) (21, 9) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 16) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 6) (25, 17) (25, 11) (25, 0) (16, 26) (16, 4) (16, 5) (24, 23) (24, 5) (24, 15) (3, 17) (3, 20) (7, 23) (29, 8) (29, 11) (29, 27) (20, 1) (20, 10) (20, 3) (20, 9) (27, 23) (27, 29) (2, 26) (2, 19) (9, 21) (9, 4) (9, 20) (9, 15) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 0) (28, 17) (28, 5) (15, 24) (15, 9) (15, 14) (5, 16) (5, 24) (5, 28) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 15) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 13) (0, 22) (0, 26) (0, 25) (0, 19) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 13, 22, 26, 25, 19
- Node 1: 20, 14, 19
- Node 2: 26, 19
- Node 3: 17, 20
- Node 4: 9, 14, 16
- Node 5: 16, 24, 28
- Node 6: 18, 11, 12
- Node 7: 23
- Node 8: 10, 29, 26
- Node 9: 21, 4, 20, 15
- Node 10: 8, 21, 20
- Node 11: 23, 6, 29, 25
- Node 12: 22, 14, 6
- Node 13: 22, 0
- Node 14: 1, 4, 12, 15
- Node 15: 9, 24, 14
- Node 16: 26, 4, 5
- Node 17: 3, 25, 28
- Node 18: 6, 22
- Node 19: 1, 2, 0
- Node 20: 1, 10, 3, 9
- Node 21: 10, 9
- Node 22: 13, 18, 12, 0
- Node 23: 11, 7, 24, 27
- Node 24: 23, 5, 15
- Node 25: 17, 11, 0
- Node 26: 8, 2, 16, 0
- Node 27: 23, 29
- Node 28: 17, 5
- Node 29: 8, 11, 27

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form unique 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 11, and Node 22 have 5, 4, and 4 neighbors respectively, so they can form inom{5}{3} = 10, inom{4}{3} = 4, and inom{4}{3} = 4 unique 3-stars.
- Node 9 and Node 12 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form inom{4}{3} = 4 unique 3-stars.

Add the total number of unique 3-stars:
10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].
