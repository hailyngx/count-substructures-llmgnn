Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 16) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 19) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 18) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 19) (2, 11) (2, 4) (18, 17) (6, 10) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 16) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 19) (13, 17) (13, 15) (0, 17) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 12) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 19) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 8) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 15) (7, 15) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 6) (8, 12) (8, 15) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 12, 16, 17}
- Node 1: {3, 10, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 11, 19}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 16}
- Node 5: {3, 9, 10}
- Node 6: {10}
- Node 7: {15}
- Node 8: {12, 15}
- Node 9: {5, 11, 14, 16}
- Node 10: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 11: {2, 9, 19}
- Node 12: {0, 8, 16, 19}
- Node 13: {15, 17}
- Node 14: {1, 9, 19}
- Node 15: {7, 8, 13, 19}
- Node 16: {0, 4, 9, 12}
- Node 17: {0, 13, 18}
- Node 18: {17}
- Node 19: {2, 11, 12, 14, 15}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 3-stars: 3
- Node 4, 3-stars: 3
- Node 9, 3-stars: 3
- Node 12, 3-stars: 6
- Node 14, 3-stars: 3
- Node 15, 3-stars: 1

Total number of 3-stars: 3 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 19

Therefore, the final answer is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 12, 16>
- <4, 2, 19>
- <9, 11, 14>
- <12, 8, 15>
- <14, 1, 3>
- <15, 7, 13>
- <16, 0, 4>
