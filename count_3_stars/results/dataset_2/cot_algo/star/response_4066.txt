Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 28) (16, 15) (16, 14) (3, 0) (3, 20) (3, 9) (3, 4) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 14) (6, 26) (6, 19) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 0) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 10) (18, 1) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 14) (22, 25) (29, 0) (29, 25) (29, 21) (4, 3) (4, 13) (8, 11) (8, 28) (8, 26) (28, 16) (28, 8) (28, 23) (27, 24) (27, 20) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 13) (26, 6) (26, 18) (26, 8) (26, 14) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 29) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 17) (14, 16) (14, 15) (14, 22) (14, 26) (14, 12) (5, 11) (5, 23) (5, 12) (19, 6) (19, 17) (10, 18) (10, 21) (21, 29) (21, 10) (21, 25) (21, 24) (23, 28) (23, 5) (20, 3) (20, 27) (20, 24) (24, 27) (24, 21) (24, 20) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 5) (13, 18) (13, 4) (13, 1) (17, 7) (17, 19) (25, 22) (25, 29) (25, 21) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we start by creating a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 9, 29, 7, 12}
- Node 1: {15, 18, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 20, 9, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 13}
- Node 5: {11, 23, 12}
- Node 6: {26, 19}
- Node 7: {0, 17}
- Node 8: {11, 28, 26}
- Node 9: {3, 12, 0}
- Node 10: {18, 21}
- Node 11: {16, 5, 8}
- Node 12: {9, 0, 14, 5}
- Node 13: {18, 4, 1}
- Node 14: {16, 15, 22, 26, 12}
- Node 15: {16, 1, 14}
- Node 16: {11, 28, 15, 14}
- Node 17: {7, 19}
- Node 18: {22, 26, 10, 1, 13}
- Node 19: {6, 17}
- Node 20: {3, 27, 24}
- Node 21: {29, 10, 25, 24}
- Node 22: {18, 14, 25}
- Node 23: {28, 5}
- Node 24: {27, 21, 20}
- Node 25: {22, 29, 21}
- Node 26: {6, 18, 8, 14}
- Node 27: {24, 20}
- Node 28: {16, 8, 23}
- Node 29: {0, 25, 21}

Now, we can identify which nodes form 3-stars:

- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes {3, 9, 29} <0, (3, 9, 29)>
- Node 12: Forms a 3-star with nodes {9, 0, 14} <12, (9, 0, 14)>
- Node 14: Forms a 3-star with nodes {16, 15, 22} <14, (16, 15, 22)>
- Node 16: Forms a 3-star with nodes {11, 28, 15} <16, (11, 28, 15)>
- Node 18: Forms a 3-star with nodes {22, 25, 21} <18, (22, 25, 21)>
- Node 26: Forms a 3-star with nodes {18, 8, 14} <26, (18, 8, 14)>

The total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [5].
