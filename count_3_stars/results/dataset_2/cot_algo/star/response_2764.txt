Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 7) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 7) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 1) (3, 10) (3, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 10, 4, 6, 14, 3
- Node 1: 11, 12, 2, 7
- Node 2: 11, 13, 12, 1
- Node 3: 10, 0
- Node 4: 11, 8, 12, 0
- Node 5: 0, 14
- Node 6: 10, 12, 0
- Node 7: 14, 13, 1
- Node 8: 9, 10, 4, 14
- Node 9: 8, 14, 13, 12
- Node 10: 11, 0, 3, 6, 8, 13
- Node 11: 10, 1, 4, 2
- Node 12: 9, 4, 6, 2, 1
- Node 13: 9, 10, 2, 7
- Node 14: 5, 9, 8, 0, 7

Now let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors.

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:
For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we have:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars is 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 68, so [68].

Unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 8, 10)>, <0, (4, 10, 6)>, <0, (4, 10, 14)>, <0, (8, 10, 14)>, <0, (10, 6, 14)>, <4, (8, 10, 12)>, <4, (8, 10, 14)>, <10, (11, 13, 7)>, <10, (11, 13, 3)>, <10, (11, 4, 13)>, <10, (11, 4, 8)>, <10, (11, 4, 13)>, <10, (11, 4, 14)>, <10, (13, 7, 11)>, <10, (13, 7, 1)>, <10, (13, 7, 14)>, <10, (11, 4, 13)>, <12, (9, 6, 2)>, <12, (9, 6, 1)>, <12, (9, 6, 12)>, <12, (9, 6, 1)>, <12, (9, 6, 2)>, <12, (9, 2, 1)>, <12, (6, 2, 1)>, <12, (6, 2, 13)>, <12, (6, 2, 12)>, <12, (6...
