Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 5: 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5

There are a total of 2 unique 3-stars:
<5, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
