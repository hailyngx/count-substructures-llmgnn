Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 19) (5, 0) (9, 15) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (1, 11) (1, 3) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 13) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 2) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 8) (18, 4) (18, 10) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 17) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 19) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 15) (6, 0) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 8) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 17) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 15) (13, 4) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {16, 5, 17, 6}
- Node 1: {11, 3}
- Node 2: {16, 10, 17}
- Node 3: {11, 4, 1, 13}
- Node 4: {7, 18, 13, 14, 3}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {4, 12}
- Node 8: {10, 12, 15}
- Node 9: {15}
- Node 10: {17, 18, 19, 2, 8}
- Node 11: {16, 3, 14, 1}
- Node 12: {7, 17, 8}
- Node 13: {4, 3}
- Node 14: {11, 4, 19}
- Node 15: {9, 8, 19}
- Node 16: {11, 0, 19, 2}
- Node 17: {10, 0, 2, 12}
- Node 18: {4, 10}
- Node 19: {16, 10, 14, 15}

Now, let's identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, and 17 have 3 or more neighbors.

For the nodes above, let's calculate the number of 3-stars each can form:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <0, 16, 5, 17>, <0, 16, 6, 17>, <0, 5, 6, 17>, <16, 5, 6, 17>

2. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <2, 16, 17, 10>

3. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <3, 11, 4, 13>, <3, 11, 4, 1>, <3, 11, 13, 1>, <3, 4, 13, 1>

4. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <4, 7, 14, 13>, <4, 7, 3, 13>, <4, 7, 14, 14>, <4, 7, 3, 14>, <4, 7, 3, 13>, <4, 14, 3, 13>, <7, 14, 3, 13>, <7, 3, 3, 13>, <14, 3, 3, 13>, <7, 14, 3, 14>

5. Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <10, 17, 2, 18>, <10, 17, 2, 8>, <10, 17, 18, 8>, <10, 17, 2, 8>, <10, 2, 18, 8>, <17, 2, 18, 8>, <10, 18, 2, 8>, <17, 18, 2, 8>, <10, 17, 18, 8>, <10, 17, 2, 8>

6. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <11, 16, 14, 4>, <11, 16, 3, 4>, <11, 16, 14, 14>, <11, 16, 3, 14>

7. Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <12, 7, 17, 8>

8. Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <15, 9, 19, 8>

9. Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <16, 11, 19, 3>, <16, 11, 2, 3>, <16, 11, 19, 2>, <16, 19, 3, 2>

10. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <17, 10, 2, 12>, <17, 10, 18, 2>, <17, 10, 18, 8>, <17, 2, 12, 8>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of [33].
