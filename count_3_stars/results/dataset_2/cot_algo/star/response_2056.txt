Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 6) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 3) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 4) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 3) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 2, 7, 12, 3}
- Node 1: {7, 11, 4}
- Node 2: {8, 10, 7, 0}
- Node 3: {12, 11, 0, 10}
- Node 4: {6, 1, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 0, 14}
- Node 6: {13, 5, 10, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {2, 12, 0, 10, 1}
- Node 8: {13, 2, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {8, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {8, 6, 2, 7, 12, 3}
- Node 11: {3, 1}
- Node 12: {8, 7, 12, 0, 3}
- Node 13: {8, 9, 6}
- Node 14: {5, 9, 4}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 0: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: <6, (13, 5, 10)> and [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: <8, (13, 9, 12)> and [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 10: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 12: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 78

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [78], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (13, 5, 10)>, <8, (13, 9, 12)>.
