Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 14) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 3) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 6) (8, 9) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 17) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 19) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 14) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 6) (5, 2) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 0) (17, 12) 

Response:
This graph has multiple nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which means we can potentially form some 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 4, 7, 14, 16, 17

For node 4:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<4, (7, 10, 16)>
<4, (7, 16, 17)>
<4, (10, 16, 17)>
<4, (7, 10, 17)>

For node 7:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<7, (4, 10, 16)>
<7, (4, 16, 17)>
<7, (4, 16, 12)>
<7, (4, 16, 7)>
<7, (10, 16, 17)>
<7, (10, 16, 12)>
<7, (10, 16, 7)>
<7, (16, 17, 12)>
<7, (16, 17, 11)>
<7, (16, 12, 17)>

For node 14:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<14, (7, 15, 18)>
<14, (9, 15, 18)>
<14, (9, 14, 18)>
<14, (9, 14, 15)>
<14, (3, 15, 18)>
<14, (3, 14, 18)>
<14, (3, 14, 15)>
<14, (15, 18, 3)>
<14, (15, 18, 14)>
<14, (15, 18, 9)>

For node 16:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<16, (4, 7, 12)>
<16, (10, 7, 12)>
<16, (10, 7, 17)>
<16, (4, 7, 17)>

For node 17:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<17, (4, 7, 12)>
<17, (11, 7, 12)>
<17, (11, 7, 16)>
<17, (4, 7, 16)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
4 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 7) + 10 (from node 14) + 4 (from node 16) + 4 (from node 17) = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in the given graph.
