Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 12) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 19) (15, 19) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 19) (6, 18) (12, 18) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 11) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 12) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 11) (19, 3) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 0) (11, 12) (11, 19) (3, 17) (3, 9) (3, 19) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 5, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 3: {9, 17, 19}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 10}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 17}
- Node 6: {18}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 10}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 9, 16}
- Node 9: {3, 8, 19}
- Node 10: {4, 7, 19}
- Node 11: {12, 19}
- Node 12: {11, 13, 16, 18}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 16, 17}
- Node 15: {19}
- Node 16: {8, 12, 14, 18}
- Node 17: {3, 5, 14}
- Node 18: {6, 12, 16}
- Node 19: {3, 9, 10, 11, 15}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 8, 12, 16, and 19.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) where \( n \) is the number of neighbors for the node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 36 \), so the final answer is [36].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 2, 13>
- <0, 5, 14>
- <0, 7, 10>
- <0, 13, 2>
- <0, 14, 17>
- <2, 0, 5>
- <8, 2, 4>
- <8, 2, 13>
- <8, 4, 7>
- <8, 4, 16>
- <12, 11, 19>
- <12, 13, 0>
- <12, 13, 2>
- <12, 13, 16>
- <12, 16, 14>
- <16, 12, 18>
- <16, 12, 14>
- <16, 12, 18>
- <16, 8, 4>
- <19, 10, 4>
- <19, 10, 7>
