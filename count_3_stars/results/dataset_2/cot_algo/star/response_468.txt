Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 5) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 14) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 10) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 5) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 11, 8, 9, 12, 4
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 4, 12
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 4, 7
- Node 3: Neighbors are 9, 5, 4
- Node 4: Neighbors are 3, 9, 1, 2, 0, 5
- Node 5: Neighbors are 3, 12, 14, 7, 4, 10
- Node 6: Neighbors are 8, 14, 7
- Node 7: Neighbors are 6, 2, 10, 5
- Node 8: Neighbors are 11, 9, 6, 0
- Node 9: Neighbors are 3, 8, 4, 13, 0
- Node 10: Neighbors are 12, 7, 5
- Node 11: Neighbors are 0, 13, 8
- Node 12: Neighbors are 1, 13, 5, 10, 0
- Node 13: Neighbors are 11, 9, 12, 14, 4
- Node 14: Neighbors are 6, 13, 5

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms an <0, (11, 8, 4)> and an <0, (11, 9, 12)>.

Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms two 3-stars:
- <4, (3, 9, 1)>
- <4, (3, 9, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, so the final answer is [4].
