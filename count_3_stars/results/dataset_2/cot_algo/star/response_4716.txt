Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 27) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 23) (3, 29) (17, 29) (17, 18) (17, 21) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 25) (29, 22) (0, 3) (0, 25) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 21) (11, 24) (11, 18) (28, 27) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 19) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 21) (23, 3) (23, 25) (26, 10) (26, 8) (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 6) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 22) (24, 11) (24, 9) (24, 20) (8, 26) (8, 16) (8, 25) (8, 27) (25, 29) (25, 0) (25, 23) (25, 8) (22, 29) (22, 10) (22, 20) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 16) (9, 1) (9, 14) (9, 24) (19, 12) (19, 20) (19, 6) (27, 1) (27, 28) (27, 8) (6, 0) (6, 16) (6, 19) (6, 15) (15, 6) (15, 13) (20, 24) (20, 22) (20, 19) (20, 5) (13, 1) (13, 15) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 20) (21, 17) (21, 14) (21, 2) 

Response:
Using the given information, we can first list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 25
Node 1: 7, 9, 13, 27
Node 2: 10, 12, 21
Node 3: 4, 23, 29
Node 4: 3, 12
Node 5: 0, 7, 20
Node 6: 0, 15, 16, 19
Node 7: 1, 5
Node 8: 16, 25, 26, 27
Node 9: 1, 14, 24
Node 10: 2, 22, 26
Node 11: 18, 24
Node 12: 2, 4, 16, 19
Node 13: 1, 15
Node 14: 9, 21
Node 15: 6, 13
Node 16: 6, 8, 12, 18
Node 17: 18, 21, 29
Node 18: 11, 16, 17
Node 19: 6, 12, 20
Node 20: 5, 19, 22, 24
Node 21: 2, 14, 17
Node 22: 10, 20, 29
Node 23: 3, 25
Node 24: 9, 11, 20
Node 25: 0, 8, 23, 29
Node 26: 8, 10
Node 27: 1, 8, 28
Node 28: 27
Node 29: 3, 17, 22, 25

Next, we identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

Nodes forming 3-stars: 4, 12, 16, 25

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

4: [1]
12: [3]
16: [6]
25: [6]

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 16

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (3, 12)>
<12, (2, 16, 19)>
<16, (6, 8, 18)>
<16, (6, 12, 19)>
<16, (8, 12, 25)>
<16, (18, 21, 17)>
<25, (0, 8, 29)>
<25, (8, 29, 22)>
<25, (23, 29, 3)>
<25, (3, 29, 17)>
<25, (29, 17, 18)>
<25, (29, 22, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
