Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {1, 4, 11, 14}
Node 1: {0, 13, 14}
Node 2: {3, 9, 10, 12}
Node 3: {2, 4, 7, 12}
Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 11, 12}
Node 5: {4, 9, 10, 14}
Node 6: {8, 10, 13}
Node 7: {3, 8, 11, 14}
Node 8: {6, 7, 9, 11, 13}
Node 9: {2, 5, 7, 8}
Node 10: {2, 5, 6}
Node 11: {0, 4, 7, 8, 14}
Node 12: {2, 3, 4}
Node 13: {1, 6, 8}
Node 14: {0, 1, 5, 7, 11}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 0: inom(4, 3) = 4
Node 1: inom(2, 3) = 0
Node 2: inom(4, 3) = 4
Node 3: inom(4, 3) = 4
Node 4: inom(5, 3) = 10
Node 5: inom(4, 3) = 4
Node 7: inom(4, 3) = 4
Node 8: inom(5, 3) = 10
Node 9: inom(4, 3) = 4
Node 11: inom(5, 3) = 10
Node 14: inom(5, 3) = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 14>
<0, 4, 11>
<0, 11, 14>
<0, 4, 12>
<1, 13, 14>
<2, 3, 12>
<4, 11, 14>
<4, 12, 3>
<5, 9, 14>
<5, 10, 6>
<7, 8, 11>
<8, 13, 6>
