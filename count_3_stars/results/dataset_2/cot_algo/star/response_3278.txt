Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 8) (9, 11) (26, 9) (26, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (22, 8) (23, 21) (23, 6) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 2) (17, 1) (17, 24) (15, 25) (15, 12) (15, 28) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 28) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 21) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 1) (12, 15) (12, 7) (12, 19) (13, 26) (13, 0) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 16) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 3) (8, 9) (8, 22) (8, 20) (8, 21) (16, 1) (16, 28) (16, 27) (28, 15) (28, 20) (28, 16) (28, 2) (19, 12) (19, 3) (19, 27) (4, 21) (27, 10) (27, 16) (27, 19) (27, 24) (29, 7) (29, 6) (29, 24) (11, 9) (11, 18) (6, 23) (6, 29) (6, 25) (6, 2) (24, 17) (24, 27) (24, 29) (24, 21) (3, 5) (3, 20) (3, 18) (3, 19) (25, 15) (25, 6) (25, 2) (2, 10) (2, 28) (2, 6) (2, 25) (21, 23) (21, 14) (21, 8) (21, 4) (21, 24) 

Response:
The nodes of the given graph are: \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29\}.

After exploring the neighbor nodes for each node, we find the following nodes each node is connected to:

- Node 0: {7, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {7, 16, 17}
- Node 2: {6, 10, 25, 28}
- Node 3: {5, 18, 19, 20}
- Node 4: {21}
- Node 5: {3, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 23, 25, 29}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 12, 29}
- Node 8: {9, 20, 21, 22}
- Node 9: {8, 11, 26}
- Node 10: {2, 18, 27}
- Node 11: {9, 18}
- Node 12: {7, 15, 19}
- Node 13: {0, 26}
- Node 14: {0, 21}
- Node 15: {12, 25, 28}
- Node 16: {1, 27, 28}
- Node 17: {1, 24}
- Node 18: {3, 10, 19}
- Node 19: {3, 12, 18, 27}
- Node 20: {3, 8, 28}
- Node 21: {4, 8, 14, 24}
- Node 22: {8}
- Node 23: {6, 21}
- Node 24: {17, 21, 27, 29}
- Node 25: {6, 15, 2}
- Node 26: {9, 13}
- Node 27: {10, 16, 19, 24}
- Node 28: {2, 15, 16, 20}
- Node 29: {6, 7, 24}

Now, applying the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Nodes {0, 7, 14}: 3-stars: <0, (7, 14)>, <7, (0, 12)>
- Nodes {1, 7, 16}: 3-stars: <1, (7, 16)>
- Nodes {2, 6, 25}: 3-stars: <2, (6, 25)>
- Nodes {3, 18, 19}: 3-stars: <3, (18, 19)>
- Nodes {7, 12, 29}: 3-stars: <7, (12, 29)>
- Nodes {8, 20, 28}: 3-stars: <8, (20, 28)>
- Nodes {9, 11, 26}: 3-stars: <9, (11, 26)>
- Nodes {12, 15, 25}: 3-stars: <12, (15, 25)>
- Nodes {19, 24, 27}: 3-stars: <19, (24, 27)>
- Nodes {21, 24, 27}: 3-stars: <21, (24, 27)>
- Nodes {24, 27, 29}: 3-stars: <24, (27, 29)>

Total number of 3-stars: [11]
