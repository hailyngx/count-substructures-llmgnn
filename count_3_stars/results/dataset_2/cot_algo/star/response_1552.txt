Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 14) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 7) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 10, 2}
- Node 1: {14, 5, 13, 7}
- Node 2: {11, 13, 7, 0}
- Node 3: {0, 14, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {11, 8, 12}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 13, 12}
- Node 6: {3, 8, 5, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 8, 2, 13, 14, 9}
- Node 8: {11, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 7}
- Node 10: {11, 0, 12}
- Node 11: {10, 8, 4, 2}
- Node 12: {10, 4, 5, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 2, 12, 7}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 6, 12, 7}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center. <1, (14, 5, 13)>, <1, (14, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 13, 7)>, <1, (13, 7, 14)>
  
- Node 3: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center. <3, (0, 14, 6)>, <3, (0, 14, 9)>, <3, (6, 9, 14)>, <3, (9, 7, 14)>
  
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center. <5, (1, 6, 13)>, <5, (1, 6, 12)>, <5, (1, 13, 12)>, <5, (6, 13, 12)>
  
- Node 6: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center. <6, (3, 8, 5)>, <6, (3, 8, 14)>, <6, (5, 14, 3)>, <6, (14, 3, 9)>
  
- Node 7: has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center. We will not list them all, to save space.
  
- Node 12: has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 12 as the center. We will not list them all, to save space.
  
Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 46

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [46].
