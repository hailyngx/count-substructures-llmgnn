Response:
Based on the given information, here are the steps to find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Create a list of neighbors for each node:
   - Node 0: {29, 18, 16, 28, 4}
   - Node 1: {24, 15, 20}
   - Node 2: {29, 18}
   - Node 3: {18, 20}
   - Node 4: {22, 0}
   - Node 5: {10, 29, 13}
   - Node 6: {27, 21, 25}
   - Node 7: {9, 17, 21, 22}
   - Node 8: {21, 10, 15}
   - Node 9: {20, 7}
   - Node 10: {8, 13, 5}
   - Node 11: {14, 17, 13}
   - Node 12: {27, 24, 28, 25, 19}
   - Node 13: {10, 11, 5}
   - Node 14: {17, 11}
   - Node 15: {8, 1}
   - Node 16: {22, 28, 0}
   - Node 17: {14, 11, 7}
   - Node 18: {2, 29, 3, 0, 23}
   - Node 19: {21, 12, 25}
   - Node 20: {26, 1, 3, 9}
   - Node 21: {7, 6, 19, 8}
   - Node 22: {26, 7, 4, 16}
   - Node 23: {18}
   - Node 24: {26, 12, 1}
   - Node 25: {12, 6, 19}
   - Node 26: {22, 24, 20}
   - Node 27: {12, 6}
   - Node 28: {12, 16, 0}
   - Node 29: {2, 5, 0}

2. Identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
   - Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
   - Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 0, 12, 18, 21, 29

3. Calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with more than 3 neighbors:
   - Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   - Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   - Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   - Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

4. Sum up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [35]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 18, 28)>, <0, (4, 18, 29)>, <0, (16, 18, 28)>, <0, (16, 18, 29)>, <0, (16, 28, 29)>, <0, (18, 28, 29)>, <12, (19, 25, 6)>, <12, (19, 21, 25)>, <12, (19, 21, 6)>, <12, (25, 27, 6)>, <18, (0, 28, 29)>, <18, (0, 4, 28)>, <18, (0, 4, 29)>, <18, (16, 28, 29)>, <21, (8, 15, 1)>, <21, (8, 15, 8)>, <21, (8, 1, 15)>, <21, (10, 13, 5)>, <29, (0, 18, 23)>
