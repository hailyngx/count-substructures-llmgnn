Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 6, 2, 9  
Node 1: 7, 6, 5, 9  
Node 2: 4, 5, 9, 0  
Node 3: 7, 6, 8  
Node 4: 7, 8, 2, 9, 0  
Node 5: 1, 8, 6, 2  
Node 6: 1, 3, 5, 0  
Node 7: 4, 3, 1, 8  
Node 8: 4, 7, 3, 5  
Node 9: 4, 1, 2, 0  

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 1 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 2 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 4 forms 4 3-stars:  
<4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 2>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 0>  
Node 5 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 6 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 8 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 9 forms 1 3-star.  

The total number of 3-stars formed is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11.  
Therefore, the final answer is [11].

Unique 3-stars found:  
<4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 2>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 0>  
<0, 4, 6>, <1, 7, 6>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 7, 8>,  
<5, 8, 6>, <6, 1, 3>, <9, 4, 1>
