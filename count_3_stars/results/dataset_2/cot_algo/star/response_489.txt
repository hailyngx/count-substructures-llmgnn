Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 18) (1, 3) (1, 25) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 13) (0, 20) (0, 29) (0, 2) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 6) (4, 18) (4, 6) (4, 15) (18, 21) (18, 4) (18, 24) (18, 17) (18, 29) (28, 22) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (26, 12) (26, 17) (6, 21) (6, 20) (6, 4) (6, 25) (8, 14) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 27) (16, 9) (16, 24) (16, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 23) (14, 24) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 25) (19, 25) (19, 23) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 27) (5, 2) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 24) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 14) (24, 5) (22, 28) (22, 5) (17, 18) (17, 26) (17, 16) (17, 12) (25, 1) (25, 6) (25, 15) (25, 19) (29, 0) (29, 18) (29, 5) (10, 13) (12, 11) (12, 26) (12, 17) (23, 7) (23, 14) (23, 19) (23, 27) (27, 20) (27, 9) (27, 2) (27, 23) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) 

Response:
Let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {2, 20, 27, 29}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 9, 25}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 5, 27}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 13}
- Node 4: neighbors {6, 15, 18}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 22, 24, 29}
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 20, 21, 25}
- Node 7: neighbors {21, 23}
- Node 8: neighbor {14}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 15, 16, 27}
- Node 10: neighbor {13}
- Node 11: neighbors {12, 13, 14}
- Node 12: neighbors {11, 17, 26}
- Node 13: neighbors {3, 10, 11}
- Node 14: neighbors {8, 11, 23, 24}
- Node 15: neighbors {4, 9, 25}
- Node 16: neighbors {9, 17, 24}
- Node 17: neighbors {12, 16, 18, 26}
- Node 18: neighbors {4, 17, 21, 24, 29}
- Node 19: neighbors {23, 25}
- Node 20: neighbors {0, 6, 27}
- Node 21: neighbors {6, 18}
- Node 22: neighbors {5, 28}
- Node 23: neighbors {7, 14, 19, 27}
- Node 24: neighbors {5, 14, 16, 18}
- Node 25: neighbors {1, 6, 15, 19}
- Node 26: neighbors {12, 17}
- Node 27: neighbors {0, 2, 9, 23}
- Node 28: neighbor {22}
- Node 29: neighbors {0, 5, 18}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars is 46, so the final answer is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 20, 27)>, <0, (2, 5, 29)>, <0, (20, 5, 29)>, <0, (20, 6, 27)>, <1, (9, 15, 25)>, <4, (6, 15, 25)>, <5, (2, 22, 29)>, <6, (4, 18, 21)>, <9, (15, 16, 27)>, <14, (11, 23, 24)>, <17, (16, 18, 24)>, <18, (17, 24, 29)>, <23, (14, 19, 27)>
