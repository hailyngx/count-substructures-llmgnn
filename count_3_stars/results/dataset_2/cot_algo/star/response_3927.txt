Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 19) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 3) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 3) (15, 4) (15, 10) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 0) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 3) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 17) (17, 12) (17, 5) (3, 18) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (2, 11) (2, 14) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 17) (5, 1) (14, 18) (14, 3) (14, 2) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated using the provided information. 

1. First, we need to find the degree of each node by counting the number of edges incident to it:

- Node 0: degree = 3
- Node 1: degree = 4
- Node 2: degree = 2
- Node 3: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 4
- Node 5: degree = 4
- Node 6: degree = 3
- Node 7: degree = 4
- Node 9: degree = 3
- Node 10: degree = 3
- Node 11: degree = 3
- Node 12: degree = 5
- Node 13: degree = 2
- Node 14: degree = 3
- Node 15: degree = 2
- Node 16: degree = 3
- Node 17: degree = 2
- Node 18: degree = 4
- Node 19: degree = 3

2. Next, we identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 19, 3}
- Node 1: {18, 19, 5}
- Node 2: {11, 14}
- Node 3: {18, 10, 0, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 18, 9, 15}
- Node 5: {7, 17, 1, 16}
- Node 6: {9, 12, 19}
- Node 7: {4, 10, 5, 13}
- Node 9: {16, 4, 6}
- Node 10: {7, 15, 3}
- Node 11: {0, 12, 2}
- Node 12: {11, 13, 16, 6, 17}
- Node 13: {7, 12}
- Node 14: {18, 3, 2}
- Node 15: {10, 4}
- Node 16: {12, 9, 5}
- Node 17: {5, 12}
- Node 18: {4, 14, 1, 3}
- Node 19: {6, 1, 0}

3. Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 4 and Node 12 have 4 neighbors, so they each contribute \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5, Node 18, Node 3, Node 7, and Node 0 have 4 neighbors, so they each contribute \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 and Node 9 have 3 neighbors, so they each contribute 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is:

\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 18 \]

So, the final answer is [18], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<4, (7, 18, 15)>
<12, (6, 13, 17)>
<5, (7, 17, 16)>
<18, (1, 3, 14)>
<3, (0, 10, 14)>
<7, (4, 5, 10)>
<0, (11, 3, 19)>
<9, (4, 6, 16)>
<1, (5, 18, 19)>
