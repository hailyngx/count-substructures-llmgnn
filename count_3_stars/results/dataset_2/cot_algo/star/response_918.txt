Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 0) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a neighbor list for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {10, 2, 8, 14, 5}
- Node 1: {6, 9, 14, 5, 12}
- Node 2: {7, 6, 13, 0}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 11}
- Node 4: {7, 5, 14, 3}
- Node 5: {0, 14, 13, 12, 1, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 2}
- Node 7: {4, 11, 2}
- Node 8: {11, 0, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 13}
- Node 10: {11, 0, 12}
- Node 11: {7, 10, 3, 13, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {10, 11, 8, 5, 1}
- Node 13: {9, 11, 2, 5}
- Node 14: {4, 0, 1, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <0, (10, 2, 8)>, <0, (10, 2, 14)>, <0, (10, 2, 5)>, <0, (10, 8, 14)>, <0, (10, 8, 5)>, <0, (10, 14, 5)>, <0, (2, 8, 14)>, <0, (2, 8, 5)>, <0, (2, 14, 5)>, <0, (8, 14, 5)>
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <1, (6, 9, 14)>, <1, (6, 9, 5)>, <1, (6, 14, 5)>, <1, (9, 14, 5)>, <1, (9, 5, 12)>, <1, (14, 5, 12)>, <1, (6, 9, 12)>, <1, (6, 14, 12)>, <1, (9, 14, 12)>, <1, (9, 5, 12)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <4, (7, 5, 14)>, <4, (7, 14, 3)>, <4, (5, 14, 3)>, <4, (7, 5, 3)>
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, forming inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars: <5, (0, 14, 13)>, <5, (0, 14, 12)>, <5, (0, 14, 1)>, <5, (0, 13, 12)>, <5, (0, 13, 1)>, <5, (0, 12, 1)>, <5, (14, 13, 12)>, <5, (14, 13, 1)>, <5, (14, 12, 1)>, <5, (0, 14, 5)>, <5, (0, 13, 5)>, <5, (0, 12, 5)>, <5, (14, 13, 5)>, <5, (14, 12, 5)>, <5, (13, 12, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (14, 1, 5)>, <5, (13, 1, 5)>, <5, (12, 1, 5)>, <5, (14, 13, 12)>
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors, forming inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars: <11,(7, 3, 13)>, <11,(7, 3, 8)>, <11,(7, 3, 12)>, <11,(7, 13, 8)>, <11,(7, 13, 12)>, <11,(7, 8, 12)>, <11,(3, 13, 8)>, <11,(3, 13, 12)>, <11,(3, 8, 12)>, <11,(7, 3, 12)>, <11,(7, 13, 12)>, <11,(7, 8, 12)>, <11,(3, 13, 12)>, <11,(7, 3, 13)>, <11,(7, 3, 13)>, <11,(3, 8, 12)>, <11,(7, 3, 8)>, <11,(3, 13, 12)>, <11,(3, 8, 12)>, <11,(7, 13, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 64, which will be shown as [64].
