Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 13) (2, 9) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 12}
- Node 2: {7, 9}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 5: {7, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 6, 12}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {4, 6, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {6, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 4, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {0, 5, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 14: {5, 8, 9, 10, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 2 (Each forms 1 3-star)
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 11
\( \Rightarrow \text{Total number of 3-stars} = \binom{11}{3} = 165 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [165].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, 10, 12>, <6, 8, 10>, <6, 8, 11>, <6, 8, 13>, <6, 10, 12>, <6, 11, 13>, <7, 8, 10>, <7, 9, 12>, <9, 10, 12>, <9, 10, 13>, <9, 11, 13>
