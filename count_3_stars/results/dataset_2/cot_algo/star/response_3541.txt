Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: No 3-star possible as it has only 4 neighbors.
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: No 3-star possible as it has only 4 neighbors.
- Node 7: No 3-star possible as it has only 4 neighbors.
- Node 9: No 3-star possible as it has only 4 neighbors.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 34 \), so the final answer is [34].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
