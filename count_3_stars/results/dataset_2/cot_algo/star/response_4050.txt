Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 11) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 10) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 10) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 2) (12, 3) (12, 11) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 7) (7, 1) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 11) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we start by identifying the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 10, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {1, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 10}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 6, 11}
- Node 10: {0, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 11: {2, 6, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 12: {3, 11}
- Node 13: {2, 4, 5, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 3, 7, 10, 13}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 68 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <2, (5, 13, 14)>
- <3, (1, 9, 14)>
- <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- <5, (2, 6, 13)>
- <7, (1, 10, 14)>
- <9, (3, 5, 6)>
- <11, (6, 7, 9)>
- <13, (2, 4, 14)>
- <14, (7, 10, 13)>
