Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 4) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 17) (11, 16) (11, 28) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 2) (14, 0) (14, 2) (17, 26) (17, 20) (17, 28) (17, 19) (1, 26) (1, 3) (1, 24) (1, 22) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 15) (3, 4) (20, 17) (20, 25) (20, 10) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 21) (25, 2) (18, 1) (18, 2) (22, 1) (22, 8) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 6) (27, 29) (27, 28) (27, 7) (2, 16) (2, 14) (2, 25) (2, 18) (0, 16) (0, 14) (15, 3) (28, 11) (28, 17) (28, 27) (28, 5) (23, 26) (23, 5) (23, 7) (23, 29) (5, 28) (5, 23) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 13) (13, 19) (13, 21) (13, 29) (21, 25) (21, 13) (21, 4) (29, 27) (29, 23) (29, 13) (8, 22) (8, 6) (24, 1) (24, 10) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 21) (7, 9) (7, 27) (7, 23) (10, 20) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 24) (6, 25) (6, 12) (6, 8) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node and then identify the number of 3-stars formed.

### Neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 14, 16}
- Node 1: {3, 18, 22, 24, 26}
- Node 2: {14, 16, 18, 25}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 15}
- Node 4: {3, 9, 21}
- Node 5: {23, 28}
- Node 6: {8, 10, 12, 25}
- Node 7: {9, 23, 27}
- Node 8: {6, 22, 25}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 26}
- Node 10: {12, 19, 20, 24}
- Node 11: {16, 28}
- Node 12: {6, 10, 16}
- Node 13: {19, 21, 29}
- Node 14: {0, 2}
- Node 15: {3}
- Node 16: {0, 2, 11, 12}
- Node 17: {19, 20, 26, 28}
- Node 18: {1, 2}
- Node 19: {10, 13, 17}
- Node 20: {10, 17, 25}
- Node 21: {4, 13, 25}
- Node 22: {1, 8}
- Node 23: {5, 7, 9, 29}
- Node 24: {1, 10}
- Node 25: {2, 6, 8, 20, 21}
- Node 26: {1, 9, 17, 23}
- Node 27: {7, 28, 29}
- Node 28: {5, 11, 17, 27}
- Node 29: {13, 23, 27}

### 3-stars found:
- <9, 4, 7>
- <26, 1, 17>
- <26, 9, 23>
- <16, 11, 28>
- <16, 2, 14>
- <16, 2, 18>
- <16, 2, 25>
- <17, 19, 28>
- <1, 3, 21>
- <10, 12, 24>
- <6, 8, 25>

Since there are 11 unique 3-stars formed, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
