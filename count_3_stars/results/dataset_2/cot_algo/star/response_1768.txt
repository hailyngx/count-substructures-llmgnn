Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 10) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (12, 9) (12, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:

Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 5
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 6
Node 12: degree 2
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3

We will now find the 3-stars in this graph.

Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <3, (0, 7, 10)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>.
Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <4, (7, 9, 11)>.
Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <7, (4, 5, 10)>, <7, (3, 4, 10)>, <7, (5, 8, 10)>.
Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <9, (1, 6, 11)>.

Adding these up, we have a total of [7] 3-stars.
