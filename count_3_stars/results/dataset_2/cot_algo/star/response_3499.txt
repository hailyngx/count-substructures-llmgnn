Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 9} - Forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 9} - Forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4} - Forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 9} - Forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 8, 9} - Forms 5C3 = 10 3-stars
Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 8} - Forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 7} - Forms 3C3 = 1 3-star
Node 7: Neighbors {5, 6, 8, 9} - Forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
Node 8: Neighbors {4, 5, 7} - Forms 3C3 = 1 3-star
Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 7} - Forms 5C3 = 10 3-stars

Adding up the total 3-stars from each node: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>
