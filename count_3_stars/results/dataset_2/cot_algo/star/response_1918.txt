Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 10) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 11) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 7) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 10) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify all nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed by each of these nodes.

Here are the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 10: Neighbors {3, 4, 13, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 9, 1}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 72 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [72], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 12>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 4, 10>, <1, 0, 12>, <1, 0, 14>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 11>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 10, 13>, <3, 10, 14>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 10, 13>, <5, 6, 7>, <7, 8, 9>
