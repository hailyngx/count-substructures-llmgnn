Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 25) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 11) (20, 15) (20, 25) (20, 12) (20, 23) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 16) (11, 25) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 13) (4, 27) (4, 24) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 26) (5, 23) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 27) (28, 11) (28, 29) (28, 17) (28, 22) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 12) (7, 29) (7, 12) (12, 20) (12, 29) (12, 7) (12, 16) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 23) (26, 8) (26, 21) (22, 28) (22, 24) (21, 3) (21, 26) (21, 27) (21, 9) (21, 14) (27, 4) (27, 6) (27, 21) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 21) (14, 0) (14, 9) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 17) (19, 1) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 17) (9, 15) (9, 21) (9, 14) (9, 18) (17, 28) (17, 18) (17, 16) (23, 20) (23, 5) (23, 13) (23, 2) (24, 4) (24, 22) (2, 4) (2, 23) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 19) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 10, 19}
- Node 2: {4, 23}
- Node 3: {8, 15, 21}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 24, 27}
- Node 5: {23}
- Node 6: {4, 13, 27}
- Node 7: {12, 29}
- Node 8: {3, 26}
- Node 9: {14, 15, 18, 21}
- Node 10: {1, 11, 16}
- Node 11: {10, 13, 25, 28}
- Node 12: {7, 16, 20, 29}
- Node 13: {6, 11, 23}
- Node 14: {0, 9, 21}
- Node 15: {3, 9, 20, 25}
- Node 16: {10, 12, 17, 18}
- Node 17: {16, 18, 28}
- Node 18: {9, 16, 17}
- Node 19: {1}
- Node 20: {15, 12, 23, 25}
- Node 21: {3, 9, 14, 15, 26, 27}
- Node 22: {24, 28}
- Node 23: {2, 5, 13, 20}
- Node 24: {4, 22}
- Node 25: {15, 20, 11}
- Node 26: {8, 21}
- Node 27: {4, 6, 21}
- Node 28: {11, 17, 22, 29}
- Node 29: {7, 12, 28}

Now, let's identify which nodes form 3-stars:
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
  <3, 8, 15>, <3, 15, 21>, <3, 8, 21>
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <4, 6, 24>, <4, 13, 27>, <4, 6, 27>, <4, 2, 23>
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <9, 14, 21>, <9, 15, 25>, <9, 15, 20>, <9, 15, 21>
- Node 10: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
  <10, 11, 16>
- Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <11, 13, 25>, <11, 13, 6>, <11, 28, 29>, <11, 17, 28>
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <12, 7, 29>, <12, 16, 20>, <12, 16, 17>, <12, 16, 18>
- Node 15: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <15, 9, 21>, <15, 20, 25>, <15, 20, 23>, <15, 9, 14>
- Node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <16, 12, 20>, <16, 12, 29>, <16, 17, 28>, <16, 17, 18>
- Node 21: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
  <21, 14, 27>, <21, 14, 9>, <21, 26, 8>, <21, 26, 27>, <21, 9, 15>, <21, 9, 14>, <21, 15, 20>, <21, 15, 25>, <21, 15, 3>, <21, 3, 8>, <21, 3, 15>, <21, 27, 4>, <21, 27, 6>, <21, 27, 21>, <21, 25, 11>, <21, 25, 15>, <21, 25, 20>, <21, 25, 11>, <21, 25, 15>, <21, 15, 3>
- Node 23: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <23, 5, 13>, <23, 5, 2>, <23, 13, 6>, <23, 13, 2>
- Node 24: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 27: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
  <27, 4, 6>
- Node 28: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <28, 17, 18>, <28, 17, 16>, <28, 22, 24>, <28, 22, 29>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 45
So, the final answer is [45].
