Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 14) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 7, 11}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 8: {6, 11}
- Node 9: {2, 7, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 12}
- Node 11: {1, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 9, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {5, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 6, 13}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0, 4, 5, 7, 10, and 12 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars each.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 * 6 = 60

Therefore, the final answer is [60]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 10, 12)>
<0, (3, 12, 10)>
<0, (1, 4, 10)>
<0, (1, 4, 12)>
<0, (1, 10, 12)>
<4, (7, 10, 12)>
<4, (0, 10, 12)>

<4, (0, 10, 12)>
<4, (1, 10, 12)>
<5, (2, 10, 13)>
<5, (2, 6, 13)>
<5, (6, 10, 13)>
<5, (2, 10, 13)>
<5, (2, 6, 13)>
<7, (1, 10, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 10)>
<7, (1, 12, 10)>
<7, (1, 4, 12)>
<7, (1, 4, 10)>
<10, (0, 12, 4)>
<10, (0, 1, 7)>

<12, (0, 4, 7)>
<12, (0, 1, 10)>
<12, (0, 1, 4)>
