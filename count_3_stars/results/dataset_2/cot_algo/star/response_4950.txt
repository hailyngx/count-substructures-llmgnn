Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 50, which we will represent as [50].

The unique 3-stars identified are:
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
