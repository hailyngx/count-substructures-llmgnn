Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 8) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 5) (17, 15) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 3) (1, 15) (1, 19) (1, 9) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 17) (19, 7) (19, 1) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 9) (2, 12) (3, 16) (3, 4) (3, 0) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 18) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 10) (18, 11) (18, 12) (18, 10) (18, 13) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 9) (13, 18) (8, 11) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<4, (5, 7, 16)>
<7, (4, 12, 19)>
<9, (13, 14, 15)>
<12, (6, 7, 18)>
<13, (9, 18, 14)>
<15, (1, 9, 17)>
<16, (5, 7, 3)>
<18, (10, 12, 13)>
