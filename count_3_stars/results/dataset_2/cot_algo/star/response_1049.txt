The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are listed below:

- Node 0: {6, 7, 29}
- Node 2: {14, 15, 23, 25}
- Node 3: {11, 17, 21, 5}
- Node 4: {8, 13, 15, 29}
- Node 5: {3, 5, 22, 25, 28, 29}
- Node 6: {0, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {0, 9, 19, 26}
- Node 8: {4, 14, 18, 20, 27}
- Node 9: {7, 9, 12, 28}
- Node 10: {6, 22}
- Node 11: {3, 6, 13, 28}
- Node 12: {9, 18}
- Node 13: {4, 11, 13, 14, 18}
- Node 14: {2, 8, 13, 17}
- Node 15: {4, 15, 18}
- Node 16: {28}
- Node 17: {14, 17, 26}
- Node 18: {8, 12, 13, 15}
- Node 19: {7, 19, 23, 29}
- Node 20: {8}
- Node 21: {3}
- Node 22: {5, 10}
- Node 23: {2, 19}
- Node 24: {26, 28}
- Node 25: {2, 5, 25}
- Node 26: {7, 14, 17, 24}
- Node 27: {8, 25}
- Node 28: {5, 9, 11, 16, 24}
- Node 29: {4, 5, 19, 29}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 10, 12, 16, 21, 24, 27, 20
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{9}{3} = 84 \)
- Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [84].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 6, 10>
- <3, 11, 21>
- <10, 22, 5>
- <12, 9, 28>
- <16, 28, 24>
- <20, 8, 27>
- <24, 26, 7>
- <27, 25, 2>
- <20, 8, 4>
- <20, 8, 18>
- <20, 8, 15>
- <20, 8, 27>
