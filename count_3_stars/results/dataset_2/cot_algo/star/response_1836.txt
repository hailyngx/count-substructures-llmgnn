Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 14) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {5, 6, 12}
Node 1: Neighbors {9, 8, 10}
Node 2: Neighbors {12, 6, 11, 14}
Node 3: Neighbors {4, 7, 6, 14}
Node 4: Neighbors {9, 13, 14, 3}
Node 5: Neighbors {9, 13, 0, 7}
Node 6: Neighbors {2, 14, 3, 0, 10}
Node 7: Neighbors {5, 11, 3, 10, 8}
Node 8: Neighbors {1, 13, 12, 7}
Node 9: Neighbors {5, 4, 1}
Node 10: Neighbors {7, 1, 6}
Node 11: Neighbors {7, 2, 12, 14}
Node 12: Neighbors {8, 2, 0, 11}
Node 13: Neighbors {4, 8, 5, 14}
Node 14: Neighbors {4, 13, 2, 6, 11, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: Does not have at least 3 neighbors.
Node 1: Does not have at least 3 neighbors.
Node 2: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars (2, 11, 14), (2, 6, 11), (2, 6, 14), (11, 12, 14)
Node 3: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars [(3, 6, 14), (3, 4, 7), (3, 6, 7), (3, 7, 11), (3, 4, 14), (3, 6, 0), (3, 6, 7), (3, 6, 14), (3, 7, 11), (3, 4, 14)]
Node 4: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars (4, 13, 14), (4, 9, 13), (4, 13, 3), (4, 14, 3)
Node 5: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars (5, 9, 13), (5, 7, 9), (5, 9, 4), (5, 13, 4)
Node 6: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars [(6, 0, 12), (6, 3, 14), (6, 3, 7), (6, 10, 7), (6, 2, 14), (6, 2, 11), (6, 2, 14), (6, 11, 14), (6, 14, 11), (6, 3, 14)]
Node 7: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars [(7, 10, 1), (7, 10, 6), (7, 11, 14), (7, 8, 13), (7, 10, 6), (7, 11, 14), (7, 8, 13), (7, 10, 6), (7, 11, 14), (7, 8, 13)]
Node 8: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars (8, 1, 13), (8, 7, 11), (8, 12, 2), (8, 13, 14)
Node 9: Does not have at least 3 neighbors
Node 10: Does not have at least 3 neighbors
Node 11: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars (11, 2, 14), (11, 7, 14), (11, 12, 14), (11, 14, 3)
Node 12: Does not have at least 3 neighbors
Node 13: Does not have at least 3 neighbors
Node 14: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars [(14, 2, 11), (14, 2, 6), (14, 2, 6), (14, 2, 11), (14, 2, 14), (14, 2, 3), (14, 11, 3), (14, 11, 2), (14, 11, 6), (14, 11, 3), (14, 11, 6), (14, 6, 3), (14, 2, 11), (14, 2, 3), (14, 2, 6), (14, 2, 11), (14, 2, 3), (14, 2, 6), (14, 2, 11), (14, 2, 3)]

Total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: 
\([4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20] = 74\) 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [74].
