Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 5, 9, 6, 8
Node 1: 4, 3, 8
Node 2: 4, 7, 6, 3, 8
Node 3: 5, 7, 1, 2
Node 4: 9, 1, 6, 2
Node 5: 0, 3, 7
Node 6: 4, 7, 2, 8, 0
Node 7: 5, 3, 6, 2, 8
Node 8: 7, 6, 1, 2, 0
Node 9: 4, 0

Next, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, and Node 8 each have 4 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of unique 3-stars they are a part of using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
