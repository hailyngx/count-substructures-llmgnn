Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 12) (17, 15) (17, 11) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 18) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 18) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (18, 12) (18, 0) (18, 5) (19, 13) (19, 2) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 5) (16, 1) (16, 4) (16, 5) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 16) (4, 6) (2, 14) (2, 10) (2, 19) (6, 11) (6, 4) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 16) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:

1. First, we need to find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 15, 18}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 12, 16}
- Node 2: {4, 10, 14, 19}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 9, 14}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 9, 14, 16}
- Node 5: {12, 15, 16, 18}
- Node 6: {4, 11}
- Node 7: {8, 12}
- Node 8: {7, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 10: {2, 11}
- Node 11: {6, 10, 17}
- Node 12: {1, 5, 7, 17, 18}
- Node 13: {19}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 15: {0, 5, 17}
- Node 16: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 17: {11, 15}
- Node 18: {0, 5, 12}
- Node 19: {2, 13}

2. Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 40 \).

So, the final answer is [40].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <1, 12, 16>
- <2, 4, 14>
- <3, 4, 14>
- <4, 5, 16>
- <5, 12, 18>
- <12, 17, 18>
- <2, 10, 19>
