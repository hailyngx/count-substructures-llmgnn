Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 19) (25, 21) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (8, 13) (8, 24) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 14) (17, 10) (17, 24) (17, 12) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 24) (18, 12) (18, 28) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 28) (15, 20) (15, 0) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 4) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 20) (21, 25) (21, 13) (21, 28) (28, 18) (28, 22) (28, 21) (28, 27) (1, 27) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 24) (0, 26) (7, 20) (7, 0) (5, 11) (19, 25) (19, 14) (19, 6) (9, 11) (9, 23) (27, 28) (27, 1) (27, 29) (16, 22) (16, 24) (16, 29) (2, 3) (2, 12) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 2) (12, 29) (23, 9) (23, 26) (26, 20) (26, 0) (26, 23) (26, 6) (24, 8) (24, 17) (24, 18) (24, 0) (24, 16) (29, 27) (29, 16) (29, 12) (14, 13) (14, 19) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 26) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {15, 7, 24, 26}
- Node 1: {27}
- Node 2: {3, 12}
- Node 3: {25, 10, 4, 2}
- Node 4: {3, 18, 20}
- Node 5: {11}
- Node 6: {11, 19, 26}
- Node 7: {20, 0}
- Node 8: {13, 24}
- Node 9: {11, 23}
- Node 10: {3, 11, 17}
- Node 11: {10, 9, 5, 6}
- Node 12: {17, 18, 2, 29}
- Node 13: {8, 21, 14}
- Node 14: {13, 19}
- Node 15: {20, 0}
- Node 16: {22, 24, 29}
- Node 17: {10, 24, 12}
- Node 18: {4, 24, 12, 28}
- Node 19: {25, 14, 6}
- Node 20: {15, 7, 26, 4}
- Node 21: {25, 13, 28}
- Node 22: {18, 16, 28}
- Node 23: {9, 26}
- Node 24: {8, 17, 18, 0, 16}
- Node 25: {3, 19, 21}
- Node 26: {20, 0, 23, 6}
- Node 27: {1, 28, 29}
- Node 28: {18, 22, 21, 27}
- Node 29: {27, 16, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: {}
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: {3, 4, 20, 26}
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: {11, 18, 24}
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: {}

Next, we'll count the number of 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0 (No 3-stars can be formed with nodes having less than 3 neighbors)
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: 0 (No 3-stars can be formed with nodes having more than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 10 = 14\)

Thus, the final answer is [14], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <3, (25, 10, 4)>
- <4, (3, 18, 20)>
- <20, (15, 7, 26, 4)>
- <24, (8, 17, 18)>
