Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 23) (18, 26) (22, 14) (22, 28) (3, 17) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 4) (25, 3) (25, 12) (25, 10) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 12) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 7) (20, 19) (20, 11) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 28) (1, 27) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 4) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 28) (6, 21) (6, 13) (21, 6) (21, 24) (15, 14) (15, 1) (15, 8) (9, 29) (9, 4) (9, 2) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 5) (29, 11) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 12) (5, 26) (5, 29) (5, 8) (5, 27) (12, 25) (12, 0) (12, 2) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 5) (16, 17) (16, 23) (16, 10) (10, 25) (10, 16) (7, 3) (7, 20) (7, 23) (11, 20) (11, 29) (27, 1) (27, 5) (4, 3) (4, 26) (4, 9) (4, 13) (24, 0) (24, 21) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 23) (28, 22) (28, 1) (28, 19) (23, 17) (23, 16) (23, 7) (23, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {12, 20, 24}
- Node 1: {2, 15, 27, 28}
- Node 2: {1, 9, 12}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 17, 25}
- Node 4: {3, 9, 13, 26}
- Node 5: {8, 26, 27, 29}
- Node 6: {13, 21}
- Node 7: {3, 20, 23}
- Node 8: {5, 15, 19}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 29}
- Node 10: {16, 25}
- Node 11: {20, 29}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 25}
- Node 13: {4, 6, 23}
- Node 14: {15, 17, 22}
- Node 15: {1, 8, 14}
- Node 16: {10, 17, 23}
- Node 17: {14, 16, 3, 23}
- Node 18: {26}
- Node 19: {8, 20, 28}
- Node 20: {0, 7, 11, 19, 29}
- Node 21: {6, 24}
- Node 22: {14, 28}
- Node 23: {7, 13, 16, 17}
- Node 24: {0, 21}
- Node 25: {3, 10, 12}
- Node 26: {4, 5, 18}
- Node 27: {1, 5}
- Node 28: {1, 19, 22}
- Node 29: {5, 9, 11, 20}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 14 forms a 3-star.
- Node 17 forms a 3-star.
- Node 20 forms a 3-star.

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars: 3

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
