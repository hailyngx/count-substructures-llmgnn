Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 19) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 15) (13, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (17, 19) (17, 4) (17, 7) (2, 10) (2, 16) (2, 7) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 1) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 0) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 19) (4, 17) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 11) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 10) (14, 7) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 19) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (19, 9) (19, 17) (19, 15) (19, 16) (19, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3}
- Node 1: {0, 10, 18}
- Node 2: {7, 10, 16}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 16}
- Node 4: {6, 17}
- Node 5: {9, 13}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 13, 19}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 6, 14, 17}
- Node 8: {18}
- Node 9: {5, 15, 19}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 14}
- Node 11: {12, 13}
- Node 12: {11, 16}
- Node 13: {5, 6, 11, 15}
- Node 14: {7, 10}
- Node 15: {9, 13, 18, 19}
- Node 16: {2, 3, 12, 19}
- Node 17: {4, 7, 19}
- Node 18: {1, 8, 15}
- Node 19: {6, 9, 15, 16, 17}

Next, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, Node 7, Node 10, Node 13, Node 15, Node 16, Node 19

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 34

So, the final answer is [34], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 10, 18)>, <7, (2, 14, 17)>, <13, (6, 11, 15)>, <15, (9, 13, 18)>, <16, (2, 12, 19)>, <19, (6, 9, 15)>, <19, (7, 16, 17)>
