Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 15) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 9) (3, 16) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (10, 12) (10, 19) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 12) (18, 4) (18, 0) (18, 12) (5, 16) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 16) (13, 5) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 19) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 18) (2, 14) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 6) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 6) (6, 14) (6, 0) (15, 16) (15, 0) (17, 8) (17, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 15, 17, 18}
- Node 1: {3, 9, 19}
- Node 2: {14}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 14, 16}
- Node 4: {11, 12, 18}
- Node 5: {7, 13, 16}
- Node 6: {0, 14}
- Node 7: {5, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 9, 14, 17, 19}
- Node 9: {1, 8, 19}
- Node 10: {12, 19}
- Node 11: {4, 16}
- Node 12: {4, 10, 18}
- Node 13: {5, 16}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 15: {0, 16}
- Node 16: {3, 5, 11, 13, 15}
- Node 17: {0, 8}
- Node 18: {0, 4, 12}
- Node 19: {1, 8, 9, 10}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 5, Node 8, Node 14, Node 16, and Node 19 have 5 neighbors.
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 9, and Node 12 have 3 neighbors.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed using the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- For the nodes with 5 neighbors, we have \(^5C_3 = 10\) 3-stars each.
- For the nodes with 3 neighbors, we have 1 3-star each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\(10 \times 7 + 4 = 74\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [74].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 3, 6, 17, 18>
- <0, 3, 14, 17, 18>
- <0, 6, 14, 17, 18>
- <0, 3, 15, 16, 17>
- <3, 8, 14, 16>
- <3, 8, 16, 19>
- <14, 16, 19>
- <5, 13, 16>
- <8, 14, 17, 19>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <4, 11, 16>
- <4, 12, 18>
- <9, 8, 19>
- <12, 10, 18>
