Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 13) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 17) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 18) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 3) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 12) (0, 16) (0, 13) (16, 0) (16, 10) (16, 15) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 13) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 18) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 1) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 5) (17, 3) (3, 5) (3, 17) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 7) (15, 9) (15, 8) (15, 16) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 14) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 18) (7, 9) (7, 1) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {16, 13}
- Node 1: {9, 11, 7}
- Node 2: {8, 12, 13, 17}
- Node 3: {5, 17}
- Node 5: {11, 17, 3}
- Node 6: {17, 13}
- Node 7: {9, 1}
- Node 8: {2, 10, 15, 18}
- Node 9: {15, 1, 7}
- Node 10: {8, 16, 18, 14}
- Node 11: {5, 12, 1}
- Node 12: {2, 19, 18, 11}
- Node 13: {6, 2, 0, 18}
- Node 14: {19, 10}
- Node 15: {9, 8, 16}
- Node 16: {0, 10, 15}
- Node 17: {6, 2, 5, 3}
- Node 18: {8, 19, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 19: {18, 14, 12}

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed: 

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 33.

Therefore, the final answer is [33]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (8, 12, 13)>
<5, (17, 3, 11)>
<8, (2, 15, 18)>
<9, (1, 7, 15)>
<10, (18, 14, 16)>
<12, (2, 18, 19)>
<13, (2, 0, 18)>
<17, (2, 3, 5)>
<18, (8, 12, 19)>
<19, (12, 14, 18)>
