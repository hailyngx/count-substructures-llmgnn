Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 16) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 5) (7, 17) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 5) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 13) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 18) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 17) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 17) (9, 13) (18, 1) (18, 13) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 17) (17, 7) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 8) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 17) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 9, 13, 19}
- Node 1: {15, 16, 9, 18}
- Node 2: {3, 12, 5}
- Node 3: {15, 2, 12, 8}
- Node 4: {11, 19, 17}
- Node 5: {7, 12, 19, 2}
- Node 7: {5, 17}
- Node 8: {3, 11, 0, 17}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 17, 13}
- Node 11: {8, 4}
- Node 12: {3, 2, 5}
- Node 13: {0, 14, 19, 9, 18}
- Node 14: {13}
- Node 15: {3, 1, 16}
- Node 16: {15, 1, 17}
- Node 17: {7, 4, 9, 16, 8}
- Node 18: {1, 13}
- Node 19: {0, 5, 4, 13}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 8, Node 9, Node 13, and Node 17 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 30 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 8, 9, 13>, <0, 8, 9, 19>, <0, 8, 13, 19>, <0, 9, 13, 19>, <1, 15, 16, 17>, <3, 12, 2, 5>, <3, 15, 1, 16>, <3, 15, 1, 18>, <3, 15, 16, 17>, <8, 11, 4, 17>, <8, 17, 9, 13>.
