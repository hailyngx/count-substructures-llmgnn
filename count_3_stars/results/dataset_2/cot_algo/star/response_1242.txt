Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 9) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 9) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 6) (2, 7) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 1) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighborhood sets for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 9, 11}
- Node 1: {7, 9, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {6, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 10, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 4, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {1, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 12: {5, 7, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 13: {5, 6}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 5, 12}

From the neighborhood sets, we identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves (9, 10, 11)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves (5, 11, 14)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves (12, 13, 14)
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves (10, 12, 14)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves (10, 12, 14)

Counting these unique 3-stars gives a total of 5 3-stars. So, the final answer is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (9, 10, 11)>
- <3, (5, 11, 14)>
- <5, (12, 13, 14)>
- <7, (10, 12, 14)>
- <9, (10, 12, 14)>
