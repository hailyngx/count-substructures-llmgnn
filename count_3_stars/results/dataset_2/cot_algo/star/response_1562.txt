Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 2, we have 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For Node 3, we have 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
For Node 8, we have 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
For Node 12, we have 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
For Node 13, we have 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
For Node 15, we have 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
For Node 16, we have 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
For Node 18, we have 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
For Node 19, we have 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
For Node 25, we have 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For Node 26, we have 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
For Node 27, we have 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
For Node 28, we have 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
For Node 29, we have 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of 47 3-stars [47].

The unique 3-stars found are:
