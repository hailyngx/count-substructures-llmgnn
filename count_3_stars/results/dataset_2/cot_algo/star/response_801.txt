Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 26) (15, 9) (15, 17) (27, 23) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 9) (2, 29) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 19) (20, 25) (20, 18) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 16) (25, 8) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 21) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 24) (11, 28) (11, 7) (11, 21) (28, 11) (28, 3) (28, 12) (24, 17) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 4) (26, 15) (26, 24) (26, 3) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 22) (9, 8) (22, 9) (22, 1) (1, 29) (1, 22) (1, 23) (1, 19) (8, 25) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 0) (13, 3) (4, 24) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (19, 29) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 21) (16, 20) (16, 25) (21, 14) (21, 11) (21, 19) (12, 28) (12, 5) (12, 18) (3, 28) (3, 26) (3, 13) (6, 29) (6, 24) (6, 8) (6, 7) (7, 29) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 6) (18, 20) (18, 14) (18, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (23, 27) (23, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: [5, 9, 13]
- Node 1: [6, 19, 22, 23, 29]
- Node 2: [7, 29]
- Node 3: [5, 13, 26, 28]
- Node 4: [24]
- Node 5: [0, 7, 10, 12, 13, 19]
- Node 6: [1, 7, 8, 24, 29]
- Node 7: [2, 5, 6, 11, 29]
- Node 8: [6, 9, 10, 25]
- Node 9: [0, 8, 15, 22]
- Node 10: [5, 8, 12]
- Node 11: [7, 21, 28]
- Node 12: [5, 10, 18, 28]
- Node 13: [0, 3, 5, 19]
- Node 14: [17, 18, 21]
- Node 15: [9, 17, 26]
- Node 16: [20, 25]
- Node 17: [14, 15, 24]
- Node 18: [12, 14, 20]
- Node 19: [1, 5, 21, 29]
- Node 20: [16, 18, 25]
- Node 21: [11, 14, 19]
- Node 22: [1, 9]
- Node 23: [1, 27]
- Node 24: [4, 6, 17, 26]
- Node 25: [8, 16, 20]
- Node 26: [3, 15, 24]
- Node 27: [23]
- Node 28: [3, 11, 12]
- Node 29: [1, 2, 6, 19]

Now, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of unique 3-stars: \(10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 75\)

Therefore, the final number of total 3-stars found is [75]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (5, 19, 29)>
- <1, (6, 19, 29)>
- <1, (7, 19, 29)>
- <1, (19, 22, 29)>
- <1, (19, 23, 29)>
- <1, (19, 29, 5)>
- <1, (19, 29, 21)>
- <5, (12, 19, 29)>
- <5, (19, 21, 29)>
- <5, (19, 23, 29)>
- <5, (19, 29, 21)>
- <6, (7, 19, 29)>
- <6, (8, 19, 29)>
- <6, (19, 24, 29)>
- <6, (19, 29, 7)>
- <7, (11, 19, 29)>
- <7, (19, 21, 29)>
- <7, (19, 29, 11)>
- <19, (21, 29, 11)>
- <24, (6, 19, 29)>
- <24, (19, 26, 29)>
- <24, (19, 29, 6)>
- <24, (19, 29, 26)>
- <29, (1, 19, 22)>
