Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 11) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 16) (6, 9) (6, 15) (7, 21) (7, 19) (7, 22) (21, 7) (21, 11) (21, 2) (22, 7) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 24) (23, 22) (23, 15) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 1) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 4) (0, 14) (20, 27) (20, 11) (14, 0) (14, 27) (14, 15) (14, 5) (24, 26) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 18) (4, 17) (4, 27) (4, 16) (27, 20) (27, 14) (27, 4) (27, 11) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 3) (19, 7) (19, 22) (19, 5) (19, 28) (15, 6) (15, 23) (15, 10) (15, 14) (25, 29) (25, 12) (18, 13) (18, 24) (28, 8) (28, 17) (28, 19) (28, 12) (12, 13) (12, 25) (12, 28) (12, 16) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 2) (3, 5) (3, 2) (1, 8) (1, 10) (2, 21) (2, 16) (2, 3) (29, 25) (11, 9) (11, 21) (11, 20) (11, 27) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

The neighbors of each node are:
0: {14}
1: {8, 10}
2: {3, 16, 21}
3: {2, 5}
4: {16, 17, 27}
5: {3, 14, 19}
6: {9, 15}
7: {19, 21, 22}
8: {1, 13, 28}
9: {6, 11, 26}
10: {1, 15, 17}
11: {9, 20, 21, 27}
12: {13, 16, 25, 28}
13: {8, 12, 18}
14: {0, 5, 15, 27}
15: {6, 10, 14, 23}
16: {2, 4, 12, 24}
17: {4, 10, 28}
18: {13, 24}
19: {5, 7, 22, 28}
20: {11, 27}
21: {2, 7, 11}
22: {7, 19, 23, 24}
23: {15, 22}
24: {16, 22, 26}
25: {12, 29}
26: {9, 24}
27: {4, 11, 14, 20}
28: {8, 17, 19, 12}
29: {25}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 24, 27, 28}

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each central node:
2: C(4, 3) = 4
4: C(3, 3) = 1
5: C(4, 3) = 4
7: C(4, 3) = 4
8: C(4, 3) = 4
9: C(3, 3) = 1
10: C(3, 3) = 1
11: C(4, 3) = 4
12: C(4, 3) = 4
13: C(3, 3) = 1
14: C(4, 3) = 4
15: C(4, 3) = 4
16: C(5, 3) = 10
17: C(3, 3) = 1
19: C(4, 3) = 4
21: C(3, 3) = 1
22: C(4, 3) = 4
24: C(4, 3) = 4
27: C(4, 3) = 4
28: C(4, 3) = 4

Total number of unique 3-stars: 52

Therefore, the final answer is [52]
