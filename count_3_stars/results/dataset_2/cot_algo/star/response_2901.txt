Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 10) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 10) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 9) (8, 14) (8, 9) (8, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 10) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 9) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {10, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 6, 11}
- Node 8: {9, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {8, 10, 11}
- Node 10: {0, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 12: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 4, 5, 10}
- Node 14: {3, 4, 5, 8, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars for each of them:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 13)>
<2, (5, 7, 13)>
<2, (6, 7, 13)>
