Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 7, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: None
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: None

For nodes with 4 neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 68

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [68], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 9, 8)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 9, 8)>, <8, (7, 9, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 9)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 9)>
