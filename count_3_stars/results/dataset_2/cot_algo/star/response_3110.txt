Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 5) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {4, 10, 13, 1, 9}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {5, 13, 4, 9, 0}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {7, 3, 12, 14}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {4, 7, 10, 11, 8, 2}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {8, 0, 1, 3}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {12, 1, 7}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {11, 13}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {5, 11, 3, 14, 2}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {4, 10, 13, 3}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {11, 14, 1, 0}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {0, 3, 8, 14}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {9, 7, 3, 6}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {5, 2}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {8, 1, 0, 6}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {9, 7, 10, 2}

Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, and 13 have 5 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

By adding up the 3-stars formed by nodes 0, 1, and 3, we get a total of 10 + 10 + 20 = 40 3-stars, which we will put inside brackets as [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (4, 7, 10)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 11)>, <3, (4, 8, 10)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 13)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 13)>, <4, (0, 8, 10)>, <4, (9, 13, 0)>
