Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 5) (1, 19) (1, 27) (21, 1) (21, 20) (21, 11) (21, 18) (21, 25) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 26) (15, 3) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (22, 23) (22, 12) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 2) (23, 29) (2, 23) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 28) (29, 23) (29, 2) (29, 27) (29, 19) (20, 21) (20, 25) (20, 26) (25, 21) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 18) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 9) (17, 15) (17, 13) (27, 1) (27, 29) (27, 25) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 24) (5, 10) (26, 3) (26, 20) (26, 10) (12, 4) (12, 22) (12, 24) (12, 9) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 26) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 16) (11, 21) (11, 8) (19, 1) (19, 29) (14, 3) (14, 4) (0, 6) (0, 28) (0, 18) (28, 2) (28, 0) (8, 22) (8, 6) (8, 11) (24, 5) (24, 12) (18, 21) (18, 25) (18, 0) (16, 6) (16, 9) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 19, 21, 27
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 23, 28, 29
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 10, 14, 15, 26
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 12, 13, 14
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 8, 16
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 12, 13, 16
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 8, 21
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 0, 21, 25
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 21, 25, 26
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 8, 12, 23
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 5, 12
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 0, 2
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 2, 19, 23, 27

The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are:
- Node 1, 27 (both have 4 neighbors)
- Node 2, 29, 25, 21, 12, 5, 3, 4 (all have 4 neighbors)
- Node 8, 14, 20, 10, 18, 9, 23, 26 (all have 3 neighbors)

There are 8 nodes with 4 or more neighbors. Hence, the total number of 3-stars is 

\[ \binom{8}{3} = 56 \]

There are different combinations of 3-stars that can be formed, as follows:
<1, 21, 27>, <2, 5, 29>, <2, 5, 21>, <2, 5, 23>, <2, 29, 27>, <2, 29, 23>, <2, 29, 19>, <2, 29, 25>, <2, 21, 25>, <2, 21, 27>, <2, 21, 23>, <2, 21, 12>, <2, 21, 3>, <2, 21, 4>, <2, 23, 27>, <2, 23, 29>, <2, 12, 29>, <21, 23, 29>, <21, 25, 27>, <21, 25, 18>, <21, 27, 25>, <21, 27, 18>, <21, 29, 19>, <29, 23, 27>, <29, 23, 19>, <29, 27, 25>, <23, 27, 29>
   
Thus, the final answer is [56].
