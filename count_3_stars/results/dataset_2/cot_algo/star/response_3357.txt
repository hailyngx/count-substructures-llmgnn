Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 17) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 18) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 13) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 19) (14, 16) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 19) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 7) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 7) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 11) (18, 16) (3, 9) (11, 9) (11, 18) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 2) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 0) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 18) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 13}
- Node 1: {6, 15, 19}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 12, 16}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 4: {8, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 17}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 7, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 15, 19}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 8, 12, 15}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 11}
- Node 10: {13}
- Node 11: {9, 18}
- Node 12: {2, 8, 18, 19}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 6, 10}
- Node 14: {16, 19}
- Node 15: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 16: {2, 14, 18}
- Node 17: {5, 18}
- Node 18: {11, 12, 16, 17}
- Node 19: {1, 7, 12, 14}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 7, 12)>
<4, (8, 5, 13)>
<5, (6, 8, 17)>
<6, (1, 7, 13)>
<7, (2, 6, 15)>
<8, (4, 5, 12)>
<12, (2, 8, 19)>
<13, (0, 4, 6)>
<15, (1, 7, 8)>
<16, (2, 14, 18)>
<18, (11, 12, 16)>
<19, (1, 12, 14)>
