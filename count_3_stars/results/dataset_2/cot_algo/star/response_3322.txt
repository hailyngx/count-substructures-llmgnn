Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 21) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 26) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 23) (4, 0) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 24) (1, 13) (1, 22) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 18) (12, 25) (12, 22) (20, 15) (20, 21) (28, 29) (28, 9) (28, 18) (29, 28) (29, 19) (26, 3) (26, 14) (26, 6) (9, 28) (9, 23) (2, 13) (2, 22) (22, 1) (22, 12) (22, 2) (22, 5) (22, 0) (14, 26) (14, 23) (14, 5) (17, 24) (17, 19) (17, 27) (25, 12) (25, 10) (21, 16) (21, 20) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 22) (0, 10) (0, 24) (10, 25) (10, 0) (10, 27) (19, 11) (19, 29) (19, 17) (6, 26) (6, 18) (24, 7) (24, 8) (24, 17) (24, 0) (23, 15) (23, 9) (23, 14) (23, 27) (5, 11) (5, 22) (5, 14) (5, 18) (18, 13) (18, 28) (18, 6) (18, 5) (27, 17) (27, 10) (27, 23) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 8, 10, 22, 24}
- Node 1: {13, 22}
- Node 2: {13, 22}
- Node 3: {7, 15, 26}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {11, 14, 18, 22}
- Node 6: {18, 26}
- Node 7: {3, 16, 24}
- Node 8: {0, 13, 24}
- Node 9: {23, 28}
- Node 10: {0, 25, 27}
- Node 11: {5, 16, 19}
- Node 12: {22, 25}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 8, 18}
- Node 14: {5, 23, 26}
- Node 15: {3, 16, 20, 23}
- Node 16: {7, 11, 15, 21}
- Node 17: {19, 24, 27}
- Node 18: {5, 6, 13, 28}
- Node 19: {11, 17, 29}
- Node 20: {15, 21}
- Node 21: {16, 20}
- Node 22: {0, 1, 2, 5, 12}
- Node 23: {14, 15, 27, 9}
- Node 24: {0, 7, 8, 17}
- Node 25: {10, 12}
- Node 26: {3, 6, 14}
- Node 27: {17, 23, 10}
- Node 28: {9, 18, 29}
- Node 29: {19, 28}

Now let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, 10: <0, (4, 8, 10)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 15, 26: <3, (7, 15, 26)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 14, 18: <5, (11, 14, 18)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 19, 24: <7, (16, 19, 24)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, 18: <13, (2, 8, 18)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 20, 23: <15, (16, 20, 23)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, 28: <18, (5, 6, 28)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 12: <22, (1, 2, 12)>
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 27, 9: <23, (14, 27, 9)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of 9 3-stars, so the final answer is [9].
