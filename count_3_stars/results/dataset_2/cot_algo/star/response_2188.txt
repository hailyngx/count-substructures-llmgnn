Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 4, 6, 9 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 2, 3 have 5 neighbors each.

For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, we can directly count the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 2 and 3 each contribute 1 3-star.

For nodes with 5 neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of using combinatorial calculation:
- For node 1, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 ways to form 3-stars.
- For node 4, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 ways to form 3-stars.
- For node 6, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 ways to form 3-stars.
- For node 9, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 ways to form 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from nodes 2 and 3) + 10 (from nodes 1, 4, 6, 9) = 11
Thus, the final answer is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (4, 9, 3)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>
