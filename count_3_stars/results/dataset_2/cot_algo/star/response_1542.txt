Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 12) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 7) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 12) (17, 7) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 6) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 9) (4, 3) (4, 16) (18, 10) (18, 0) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 9) (8, 15) (8, 14) (8, 19) (9, 12) (9, 19) (9, 11) (16, 4) (16, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (11, 0) (11, 19) (11, 9) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {18, 14, 16, 11, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 14, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {10, 5, 19, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 16}
- Node 5: Neighbors {15, 19, 2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 17, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {15, 14, 19}
- Node 9: Neighbors {12, 19, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors {15, 18, 2}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 19, 9}
- Node 12: Neighbors {3, 17, 9}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 0, 8, 13}
- Node 15: Neighbors {10, 8, 5}
- Node 16: Neighbors {4, 0}
- Node 17: Neighbors {12, 7}
- Node 18: Neighbors {10, 0}
- Node 19: Neighbors {5, 8, 11, 2, 9}

Next, we identify which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 12, Node 14, Node 15, Node 19

Now, we count the 3-stars:
- For each node with three or more neighbors, we calculate \( \text{inom}{n}{3} \) where \( n \) is the number of neighbors for that node:
  - Node 0: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Node 1: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Node 2: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 3: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Node 5: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Node 7: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Node 8: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Node 9: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Node 10: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Node 12: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Node 14: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 15: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Node 19: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 26

Therefore, the final answer is [26], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (14, 11, 13)>
- <1, (14, 7, 3)>
- <2, (6, 19, 5)>
- <3, (12, 4, 1)>
- <5, (15, 2, 19)>
- <7, (17, 1, 6)>
- <8, (15, 19, 14)>
- <9, (19, 11, 12)>
- <10, (18, 15, 2)>
- <12, (17, 9, 3)>
- <14, (8, 0, 13)>
- <15, (8, 5, 10)>
- <19, (9, 2, 5)>
