Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star structures:
- Node 4: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 4 = 24, which we should put inside brackets as [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <9, (4, 1, 5)>
- <4, (9, 6, 7)>
- <4, (9, 7, 2)>
- <4, (9, 8, 2)>
- <4, (9, 3, 7)>
- <4, (9, 8, 1)>
- <4, (9, 3, 2)>
- <4, (9, 8, 6)>
- <4, (6, 7, 2)>
- <4, (6, 8, 7)>
- <4, (7, 8, 2)>
- <7, (4, 8, 6)>
- <7, (4, 3, 2)>
- <6, (8, 7, 4)>
- <2, (7, 4, 3)>
- <5, (9, 3, 0)>
- <5, (9, 2, 0)>
- <5, (9, 3, 2)>
- <0, (3, 1, 5)>
- <0, (3, 2, 5)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 2, 9)>
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
