Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 21) (11, 15) (11, 29) (16, 0) (16, 3) (14, 18) (14, 27) (14, 2) (17, 6) (17, 24) (17, 21) (23, 8) (23, 6) (23, 27) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 20) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 15) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 25) (12, 3) (12, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 17) (6, 23) (6, 7) (6, 5) (29, 11) (29, 27) (29, 0) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 29) (0, 2) (2, 14) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 24) (9, 12) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 1) (4, 3) (18, 14) (18, 4) (18, 1) (26, 3) (26, 27) (25, 12) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 19) (27, 14) (27, 23) (27, 29) (27, 26) (27, 25) (13, 2) (13, 25) (21, 11) (21, 17) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 18) (1, 20) (1, 19) (20, 10) (20, 1) (20, 3) (24, 17) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 4) (15, 11) (15, 8) (19, 4) (19, 25) (19, 1) (3, 16) (3, 12) (3, 4) (3, 26) (3, 20) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 10, 29
- Node 1: 4, 7, 18, 19, 20
- Node 2: 0, 13, 14, 24
- Node 3: 4, 12, 16, 20, 26
- Node 4: 1, 3, 18, 19, 24
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 5, 7, 17, 23
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 15, 23, 24
- Node 9: 12
- Node 10: 0, 11, 20
- Node 11: 10, 15, 21, 29
- Node 12: 3, 9, 25
- Node 13: 2, 25
- Node 14: 2, 18, 27
- Node 15: 8, 11
- Node 16: 0, 3
- Node 17: 6, 21, 24
- Node 18: 1, 4, 14
- Node 19: 1, 4, 25
- Node 20: 1, 3, 10
- Node 21: 11, 17
- Node 23: 6, 8, 27
- Node 24: 2, 4, 8, 17
- Node 25: 12, 13, 19, 27
- Node 26: 3, 27
- Node 27: 14, 23, 25, 26, 29
- Node 29: 11, 27, 0

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors
- Node 20: 3 neighbors
- Node 24: 4 neighbors
- Node 25: 4 neighbors
- Node 27: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{0}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{11}{3} + \binom{14}{3} + \binom{17}{3} + \binom{18}{3} + \binom{19}{3} + \binom{20}{3} + \binom{24}{3} + \binom{25}{3} + \binom{27}{3} = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 165 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 214 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [214].

Some unique 3-stars found in the graph include:
- <0, 4, 29>
- <1, 4, 19>
- <2, 13, 25>
- <3, 4, 20>
- <4, 18, 24>
- <6, 7, 17>
- <11, 15, 29>
- <14, 18, 27>
- <17, 21, 24>
- <18, 1, 19>
- <19, 1, 25>
- <20, 3, 10>
- <24, 2, 4>
- <25, 12, 27>
- <27, 14, 29>
