Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 18) (15, 3) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 1) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 11) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 0) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 16) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 19) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 14) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 19) (16, 6) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 5, 7, 13
Node 1: 2, 8, 14
Node 2: 1, 8, 9, 11, 14
Node 3: 6, 13, 15, 18, 19
Node 4: 11, 12, 18
Node 5: 0, 9, 12
Node 6: 3, 12, 16
Node 7: 0
Node 8: 1, 2, 8, 10, 17
Node 9: 2, 5, 8, 9, 17, 18
Node 10: 8, 17
Node 11: 2, 4, 11, 19
Node 12: 4, 5, 6, 12, 14
Node 13: 0, 3
Node 14: 1, 2, 12, 14, 19
Node 15: 3
Node 16: 6
Node 17: 8, 9, 10, 17
Node 18: 3, 4, 9, 18
Node 19: 3, 11, 14, 19

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 82 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [82], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (6, 15, 18)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (2, 8, 17)>
<9, (5, 8, 18)>
<12, (5, 6, 14)>
<14, (1, 2, 19)>
