Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 15) (6, 19) (9, 16) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 11) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 5) (4, 19) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 15) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 15) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 18) (18, 0) (18, 5) (18, 16) (13, 2) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 4) (5, 17) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 18) (16, 9) (16, 3) (16, 18) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows: 

1: 10, 11, 14  
2: 7, 8, 11, 13, 15  
3: 5, 16, 17  
4: 19  
5: 3, 5, 12, 17, 18  
6: 15, 19  
7: 2, 8  
8: 0, 2, 7, 10  
9: 16, 19  
10: 1, 8, 10, 11  
11: 1, 2, 10, 14  
12: 0, 5, 15  
13: 2  
14: 1, 11, 17, 19  
15: 2, 6, 12  
16: 3, 9, 18  
17: 3, 5, 14  
18: 0, 5, 16  
19: 4, 6, 9, 14  

Now we'll identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed: 

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star  
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 45

Hence, the final answer is [45].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, 10, 11, 14>, 
<2, 7, 8, 11>, 
<2, 7, 8, 15>, 
<2, 11, 13, 15>, 
<2, 11, 14, 17>, 
<2, 11, 14, 19>, 
<3, 5, 17, 14>, 
<5, 12, 15, 2>, 
<5, 12, 18, 16>, 
<8, 0, 10, 1>, 
<10, 1, 11, 14>, 
<11, 2, 14, 17>, 
<14, 1, 11, 10>, 
<16, 3, 18, 5>, 
<19, 4, 6, 9>.
