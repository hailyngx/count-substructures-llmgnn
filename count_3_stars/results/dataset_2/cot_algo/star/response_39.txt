Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 3) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 13) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 12) (3, 13) (3, 9) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 14) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighboring nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 3: {9, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 11}
- Node 6: {5, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 8, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 11: {1, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {3, 10}
- Node 13: {3, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 14: {4, 6, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars by looking at nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
  - <0, (1, 4, 7)>
  - <0, (1, 4, 8)>
  - <0, (1, 7, 8)>
  - <0, (4, 7, 8)>
  
- Node 1: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
  - <1, (0, 2, 4)>
  - <1, (0, 2, 5)>
  - <1, (0, 4, 7)>
  - <1, (0, 4, 8)>
  - <1, (0, 5, 11)>
  - <1, (2, 4, 8)>
  - <1, (2, 4, 9)>
  - <1, (2, 5, 11)>
  - <1, (4, 7, 8)>
  - <1, (4, 7, 11)>
  - <1, (4, 8, 11)>
  - <1, (5, 11, 13)>
  - <1, (7, 8, 14)>
  - <1, (7, 11, 13)>
  - <1, (8, 9, 14)>
  - <1, (1, 4, 7)>
  - <1, (1, 4, 2)>
  - <1, (1, 7, 0)>
  - <1, (1, 0, 5)>
  - <1, (1, 7, 8)>
  
Similarly, we can find the 3-stars for nodes 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14.

Adding up the total number of unique 3-stars formed: 4 + 20 + 5 + 8 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 6 + 10 = 77
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [77].
