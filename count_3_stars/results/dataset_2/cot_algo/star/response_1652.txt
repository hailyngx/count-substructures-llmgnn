Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 19) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 15) (8, 7) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 19) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 15) (15, 10) (15, 14) (15, 11) (15, 7) (12, 16) (12, 19) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 5) (1, 16) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 3) (19, 12) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 5) (5, 18) (5, 16) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 10, 14}
- Node 1: {16}
- Node 2: {11, 18, 19}
- Node 3: {11, 18, 19}
- Node 4: {0, 13}
- Node 5: {7, 16, 18}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {5, 8, 13, 15}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {6, 14, 19}
- Node 10: {0, 14, 15, 17}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 13, 15}
- Node 12: {16, 19}
- Node 13: {4, 7, 11, 16}
- Node 14: {0, 9, 10, 15}
- Node 15: {7, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 16: {1, 5, 12, 13, 17}
- Node 17: {10, 16}
- Node 18: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 19: {2, 3, 9, 12}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 unique 3-stars)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star) 

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 24

Therefore, the final answer is [24], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<7, (5, 13, 15)>, <7, (5, 13, 16)>, <7, (5, 15, 16)>, <7, (13, 15, 16)>, 
<16, (1, 5, 17)>, <16, (1, 12, 17)>, <16, (1, 13, 17)>, <16, (5, 12, 17)>, <16, (5, 13, 17)>, 
<16, (12, 13, 17)>, <16, (1, 5, 13)>, <16, (1, 5, 16)>, <16, (1, 13, 16)>, <16, (1, 15, 16)>, <16, (5, 13, 15)>, 
<16, (5, 13, 16)>, <16, (5, 15, 16)>, <16, (7, 13, 15)>, <16, (7, 13, 16)>, <16, (7, 15, 16)>,
<16, (13, 15, 17)>, <16, (13, 16, 17)>, <16, (15, 16, 17)>, <16, (5, 7, 13)>
