Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 29) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 24) (9, 13) (3, 7) (3, 27) (3, 18) (15, 9) (15, 0) (15, 22) (7, 3) (21, 6) (21, 12) (21, 8) (21, 18) (20, 25) (20, 12) (20, 22) (20, 6) (25, 20) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 14) (25, 24) (8, 21) (8, 23) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 1) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 14) (13, 9) (13, 28) (6, 21) (6, 20) (6, 1) (6, 29) (6, 26) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 6) (1, 17) (17, 1) (18, 3) (18, 21) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 24) (19, 25) (19, 18) (11, 18) (27, 3) (27, 22) (27, 10) (29, 5) (29, 6) (29, 26) (29, 14) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 28) (0, 12) (28, 13) (28, 0) (28, 22) (12, 21) (12, 20) (12, 0) (4, 23) (4, 16) (22, 15) (22, 20) (22, 27) (22, 28) (26, 6) (26, 29) (24, 9) (24, 25) (24, 18) (10, 2) (10, 27) (16, 2) (16, 4) (14, 25) (14, 2) (14, 29) 

Response:
Firstly, let's create an adjacency list based on the given edges:

1: {25, 23, 6, 17}

2: {25, 10, 14, 16}

3: {7, 27, 18}

4: {23, 16}

5: {9, 29}

6: {21, 20, 1, 26, 29}

7: {3}

8: {21, 23, 0}

9: {5, 15, 24, 13}

10: {2, 27}

11: {18}

12: {21, 20, 0}

13: {9, 28}

14: {25, 2, 29}

15: {9, 0, 22}

16: {2, 4}

17: {1}

18: {3, 21, 19, 11, 24}

19: {25, 18}

20: {25, 12, 22, 6}

21: {6, 12, 8, 18}

22: {15, 20, 27, 28}

23: {8, 4, 1}

24: {9, 25, 18}

25: {20, 1, 19, 14, 24}

26: {6, 29}

27: {3, 22, 10}

28: {13, 0, 22}

29: {5, 6, 26, 14}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors (degree >= 3) and calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{1}{3}] = 0 (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 13: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 15: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 16: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 18: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 20: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 21: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 22: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 23: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 24: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 25: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 26: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 27: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 29: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Summing up all these 3-star combinations, we get: 4 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, 6, 25>
- <2, 14, 25>
- <6, 20, 25>
- <6, 21, 25>
- <6, 20, 22>
- <6, 20, 29>
- <6, 21, 29>
- <9, 15, 24>
- <18, 21, 25>
- <18, 21, 24>
- <18, 20, 25>
- <18, 20, 24>
- <18, 21, 20>
- <18, 21, 22>
- <18, 20, 22>
- <22, 26, 29>
- <22, 20, 29>
- <22, 20, 26>
