Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:

- Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 6: <6, (9, 7, 3)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 8: <8, (3, 0, 7)>
- Node 9: <9, (5, 2, 6)>

Since there are 10 nodes in total, and each of the nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, and 3 has 3 neighbors, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars as follows:

\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 

So, the final total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
