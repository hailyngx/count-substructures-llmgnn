Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 6) (1, 19) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 2) (15, 17) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 18) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 4) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 9) (16, 0) (16, 4) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 12) (4, 14) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 18) (11, 5) (11, 13) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 15) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 14) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 18) (18, 15) (18, 3) (18, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 12, 16}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 19}
- Node 2: Neighbors {10, 14, 17}
- Node 3: Neighbors {10, 17, 18}
- Node 4: Neighbors {12, 14, 16, 19}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 11}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 9, 15}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7, 13, 16}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 3, 15, 19}
- Node 11: Neighbors {5, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 4, 8, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {9, 11, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {2, 4, 18}
- Node 15: Neighbors {7, 10, 17, 18}
- Node 16: Neighbors {0, 4, 9}
- Node 17: Neighbors {2, 3, 15}
- Node 18: Neighbors {3, 14, 15}
- Node 19: Neighbors {1, 4, 10}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 4 can form a 3-star with nodes {12, 14, 19}
- Node 10 can form a 3-star with nodes {2, 15, 19}
- Node 12 can form a 3-star with nodes {4, 13, 16}
- Node 15 can form a 3-star with nodes {3, 17, 18}

Counting them up, we have a total of 4 unique 3-stars formed. Putting this in brackets gives us the final answer: [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <4, 12, 14, 19>
- <10, 2, 15, 19>
- <12, 4, 13, 16>
- <15, 3, 17, 18>
