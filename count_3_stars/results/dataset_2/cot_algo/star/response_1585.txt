Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has only 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, 
<1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, 
<4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <9, 7, 8>.
