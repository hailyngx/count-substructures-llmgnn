Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 20) (16, 21) (16, 29) (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 4) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 26) (27, 23) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (20, 11) (20, 12) (20, 8) (20, 23) (25, 6) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 12) (23, 27) (23, 20) (23, 22) (12, 15) (12, 27) (12, 20) (12, 22) (4, 15) (4, 22) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 20) (8, 19) (8, 29) (29, 16) (29, 8) (29, 9) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 24) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 7) (21, 16) (21, 6) (21, 26) (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 18) (6, 25) (6, 4) (6, 21) (6, 26) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 24) (2, 22) (2, 24) (5, 11) (5, 26) (5, 24) (26, 27) (26, 21) (26, 6) (26, 5) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 7) (0, 15) (0, 13) (14, 19) (14, 18) (24, 10) (24, 19) (24, 2) (24, 5) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 13) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighborhood set for each node:

- Node 0: {15, 13}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {22, 24}
- Node 3: {13, 8}
- Node 4: {15, 22, 6}
- Node 5: {11, 26, 24}
- Node 6: {25, 4, 21, 26}
- Node 7: {1, 17, 18, 13}
- Node 8: {3, 20, 19, 29}
- Node 9: {22, 29, 18}
- Node 10: {17, 19, 24}
- Node 11: {5, 17, 20}
- Node 12: {15, 27, 20, 22}
- Node 13: {3, 0, 7}
- Node 14: {19, 18}
- Node 15: {27, 0, 12, 4}
- Node 16: {21, 29}
- Node 17: {11, 10, 7}
- Node 18: {9, 14, 7}
- Node 19: {8, 10, 14, 24}
- Node 20: {11, 12, 8, 23}
- Node 21: {16, 6, 26}
- Node 22: {23, 9, 2, 4, 12}
- Node 23: {27, 20, 22}
- Node 24: {10, 19, 2, 5}
- Node 25: {6}
- Node 26: {5, 27, 21, 6}
- Node 27: {15, 12, 26, 23}
- Node 29: {16, 8, 9}

Next, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 10: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 11: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 12: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 15: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 17: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 18: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 19: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 20: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 22: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 24: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 26: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 27: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 29: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
<4, 22, 6>, <6, 4, 21>, <6, 4, 26>, <6, 26, 21>, <7, 17, 18>, <8, 19, 10>, <8, 19, 14>, <8, 19, 24>, <10, 17, 19>, <12, 15, 27>, <12, 15, 4>, <12, 22, 20>, <12, 22, 27>, <15, 12, 27>, <15, 4, 22>, <15, 0, 27>, <15, 0, 13>, <17, 7, 11>, <18, 14, 19>, <22, 20, 23>, <24, 2, 5>
