Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 21) (26, 9) (26, 6) (26, 8) (26, 17) (13, 25) (13, 23) (22, 19) (22, 28) (22, 0) (6, 26) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 12) (8, 26) (8, 2) (28, 22) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 14) (28, 18) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 5) (29, 11) (4, 24) (18, 28) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 21) (15, 18) (15, 20) (15, 7) (20, 15) (20, 10) (20, 16) (2, 8) (2, 1) (11, 28) (11, 29) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 21) (1, 2) (1, 0) (17, 26) (17, 6) (17, 21) (0, 22) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 23) (7, 15) (7, 0) (23, 13) (23, 11) (23, 0) (23, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (19, 22) (19, 29) (5, 29) (5, 18) (5, 23) (16, 20) (16, 24) (24, 4) (24, 16) (24, 10) (3, 14) (3, 27) (14, 6) (14, 28) (14, 3) (21, 9) (21, 18) (21, 11) (21, 17) (25, 13) (25, 10) (10, 20) (10, 12) (10, 24) (10, 25) (10, 27) (27, 3) (27, 10) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 6, 10, 11, 14, 18. 

For node 6: 
Number of combinations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<6, (26, 12, 17)>
<6, (26, 12, 14)>
<6, (26, 17, 14)>
<6, (12, 17, 14)>

For node 10:
Number of combinations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<10, (20, 24, 27)>
<10, (20, 24, 25)>
<10, (20, 27, 25)>
<10, (24, 27, 25)>
<10, (16, 24, 25)>
<10, (16, 24, 27)>
<10, (16, 25, 27)>
<10, (24, 25, 27)>
<10, (20, 24, 10)>
<10, (24, 25, 10)>

For node 11:
Number of combinations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<11, (28, 0, 21)>
<11, (28, 0, 23)>
<11, (28, 21, 23)>
<11, (0, 21, 23)>
<11, (29, 21, 11)>
<11, (29, 21, 23)>
<11, (29, 11, 23)>
<11, (21, 11, 23)>
<11, (0, 21, 11)>
<11, (0, 21, 29)>

For node 14:
Number of combinations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<14, (6, 3, 28)>

For node 18:
Number of combinations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<18, (28, 5, 15)>
<18, (28, 5, 21)>
<18, (28, 15, 21)>
<18, (5, 15, 21)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 29

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [29].
