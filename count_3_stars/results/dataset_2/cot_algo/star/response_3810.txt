Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 17) (15, 11) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 18) (19, 8) (16, 0) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 6) (2, 7) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 11) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 13) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 18) (12, 3) (12, 5) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 18) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 13) (18, 11) (17, 15) (17, 4) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 13) (4, 17) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 18) (11, 9) (9, 14) (9, 11) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {10, 12, 15}
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {0, 2, 10}
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {1, 5, 18, 19}

For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 = 5

Therefore, the final answer is [5], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<3, (10, 12, 15)>
<8, (1, 5, 18)>
<8, (1, 5, 19)>
<8, (1, 18, 19)>
<8, (5, 18, 19)>
