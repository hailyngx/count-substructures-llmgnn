Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 8, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 8, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 4, 2}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 0, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 4, 7, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 9: {5, 2, 3, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-star is formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: No 3-star is formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: No 3-star is formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: No 3-star is formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: No 3-star is formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: No 3-star is formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: No 3-star is formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: No 3-star is formed with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: No 3-star is formed with less than 3 neighbors.

The total number of 3-stars is [1].

And the unique 3-stars found are:
- <6, (0, 7, 8)>
