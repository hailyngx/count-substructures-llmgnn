Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: (1, 2, 9)
- Node 1: (0, 3, 4, 9)
- Node 2: (0, 4, 5, 6)
- Node 3: (1, 4, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 4: (1, 2, 3, 7, 9)
- Node 5: (2, 7, 8)
- Node 6: (2, 7, 8)
- Node 7: (3, 4, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 8: (3, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 9: (0, 1, 3, 4)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of 34 3-stars in this graph. 

<1, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>
