Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 22 has 5 neighbors (15, 19, 21, 27, 29). It forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors (9, 12, 15, 27). It forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors (14, 18, 21, 22, 20). It forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (2, 10, 19, 24, 25). It forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (9, 17, 19, 24). It forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (8, 21, 29). It forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 39. 

So, the final number inside brackets is [39], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<22, (15, 19, 21)>, <22, (15, 19, 27)>, <22, (15, 19, 29)>, <22, (15, 21, 27)>, <22, (15, 21, 29)>, <22, (15, 27, 29)>, <22, (19, 21, 27)>, <22, (19, 21, 29)>, <22, (19, 27, 29)>, <22, (21, 27, 29)>, <14, (9, 12, 15)>, <14, (9, 12, 27)>, <14, (9, 15, 27)>, <14, (12, 15, 27)>, <27, (14, 18, 21)>, <27, (14, 18, 22)>, <27, (14, 18, 20)>, <27, (14, 21, 22)>, <27, (14, 21, 20)>, <27, (14, 22, 20)>, <27, (18, 21, 22)>, <27, (18, 21, 20)>, <27, (18, 22, 20)>, <27, (21, 22, 20)>, <4, (2, 10, 19)>, <4, (2, 10, 24)>, <4, (2, 10, 25)>, <4, (2, 19, 24)>, <4, (2, 19, 25)>, <4, (10, 19, 24)>, <4, (10, 19, 25)>, <4, (10, 24, 25)>, <4, (19, 24, 25)>, <7, (9, 17, 19)>, <7, (9, 17, 24)>, <7, (9, 19, 24)>, <7, (17, 19, 24)>
