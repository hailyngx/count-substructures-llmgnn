- Node 3: {0, 10, 13, 19}
- Node 4: {9, 20}
- Node 5: {14, 15, 25}
- Node 6: {2, 13}
- Node 7: {19, 27, 28}
- Node 8: {17, 23, 24}
- Node 9: {4, 19, 22}
- Node 10: {3, 26}
- Node 11: {12, 24, 27}
- Node 12: {11, 22, 24, 29}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 14: {5, 19, 25}
- Node 15: {5, 15, 17, 28}
- Node 16: {20}
- Node 17: {8, 15, 18}
- Node 18: {2, 17, 29}
- Node 19: {3, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 20: {4, 16}
- Node 21: {26}
- Node 22: {9, 12, 23, 26}
- Node 23: {0, 8, 15, 22, 29}
- Node 24: {8, 11, 12}
- Node 25: {1, 5, 14, 28}
- Node 26: {10, 21, 22}
- Node 27: {0, 7, 11, 19}
- Node 28: {7, 15, 25}
- Node 29: {12, 18, 23}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [70].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (0, 13, 19)>
<5, (14, 15, 25)>
<7, (19, 27, 28)>
<8, (17, 23, 24)>
<9, (4, 19, 22)>
<12, (11, 24, 29)>
<13, (1, 3, 6)>
<14, (5, 19, 25)>
<15, (5, 17, 28)>
<17, (8, 15, 18)>
<18, (2, 17, 29)>
<19, (3, 9, 27)>
<23, (8, 15, 29)>
<25, (5, 14, 28)>
<26, (10, 22, 29)>
<27, (7, 11, 19)>
<29, (12, 18, 23)>
