Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (16, 9) (16, 19) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 28) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 19) (9, 12) (7, 11) (7, 3) (21, 5) (21, 27) (21, 26) (8, 13) (8, 25) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 8) (23, 0) (4, 24) (4, 10) (4, 2) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 17) (20, 9) (20, 18) (17, 15) (17, 3) (17, 2) (0, 23) (0, 3) (0, 25) (0, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 22) (2, 12) (22, 2) (22, 24) (22, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 28) (14, 11) (14, 28) (14, 24) (10, 4) (10, 26) (26, 21) (26, 10) (26, 25) (19, 16) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 24) (19, 1) (6, 0) (6, 25) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 0) (1, 22) (1, 19) (1, 18) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 26) (25, 6) (27, 21) (18, 15) (18, 20) (18, 1) (24, 4) (24, 22) (24, 14) (24, 19) (28, 5) (28, 12) (28, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [108].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<11, (2, 13, 14)>
<16, (5, 9, 19)>
<5, (9, 12, 13)>
<9, (5, 12, 16)>
<21, (5, 26, 27)>
<13, (5, 8, 11)>
<4, (2, 10, 24)>
<1, (18, 19, 22)>
<25, (0, 6, 26)>
<19, (9, 15, 24)>
