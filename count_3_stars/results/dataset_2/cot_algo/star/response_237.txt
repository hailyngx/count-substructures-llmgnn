Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 12) (20, 27) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 9) (25, 26) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (12, 20) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 21) (27, 20) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 2) (27, 6) (28, 29) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 18) (28, 23) (29, 10) (29, 27) (29, 28) (29, 26) (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 27) (2, 0) (21, 12) (21, 28) (21, 15) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 26) (13, 19) (26, 25) (26, 29) (26, 13) (26, 18) (18, 28) (18, 26) (18, 1) (8, 17) (8, 28) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 3) (9, 25) (9, 8) (15, 21) (16, 22) (16, 6) (7, 25) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 5) (22, 16) (22, 4) (4, 0) (4, 22) (4, 24) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 19) (24, 8) (24, 4) (11, 6) (19, 20) (19, 13) (19, 3) (6, 27) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 14) (14, 6) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 23) (5, 7) (23, 28) (23, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 4}
- Node 1: {10, 18, 23}
- Node 2: {0, 27}
- Node 3: {7, 8, 19}
- Node 4: {0, 22, 24}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {11, 14, 16, 27}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 10, 25}
- Node 8: {3, 17, 24, 28, 9}
- Node 9: {8, 25}
- Node 10: {1, 7, 17, 29}
- Node 11: {6}
- Node 12: {13, 20, 21, 27}
- Node 13: {12, 17, 19, 26}
- Node 14: {6}
- Node 15: {21}
- Node 16: {6, 22}
- Node 17: {10, 13, 8}
- Node 18: {1, 28, 26}
- Node 19: {3, 13, 20}
- Node 20: {19, 12, 25, 27}
- Node 21: {12, 15, 28}
- Node 22: {4, 16}
- Node 23: {1, 28}
- Node 24: {4, 8}
- Node 25: {20, 26, 7, 9}
- Node 26: {25, 13, 18, 29}
- Node 27: {2, 6, 12, 20, 29}
- Node 28: {18, 21, 23, 8, 29}
- Node 29: {10, 26, 27, 28}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: {0, 4, 5, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 23, 24}
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: {3, 13}
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 6, 9, 14}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Total number of 3-stars: \( \left[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} \right] = [22] \)

The unique 3-stars found are:

<3, (7, 8, 17)>
<13, (12, 19, 26)>
<1, (10, 18, 23)>
<2, (0, 27, 6)>
<6, (11, 14, 16)>
<9, (25, 26, 29)>
<14, (6, 11, 16)>
<0, (2, 4, 24)>
<4, (0, 22, 24)>
<5, (7)>
<15, (21)>
<16, (6, 22)>
<17, (8, 10, 13)>
<18, (1, 28, 26)>
<19, (3, 13, 20)>
<23, (1, 28, 23)>
<24, (4, 8, 24)>
