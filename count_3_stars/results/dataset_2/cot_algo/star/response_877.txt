Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 9, 2, 3
- Node 1: Neighbors are 5, 9, 4, 2, 7
- Node 2: Neighbors are 4, 8, 0, 1, 3
- Node 3: Neighbors are 6, 4, 8, 2, 0, 7
- Node 4: Neighbors are 5, 9, 1, 3, 2
- Node 5: Neighbors are 9, 6, 8, 1, 4
- Node 6: Neighbors are 5, 3
- Node 7: Neighbors are 3, 1
- Node 8: Neighbors are 5, 2, 3
- Node 9: Neighbors are 5, 4, 1, 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 65

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [65].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (9, 2, 3)>, <1, (5, 9, 4)>, <1, (5, 9, 2)>, <1, (5, 4, 2)>, <1, (9, 4, 2)>, <1, (4, 2, 7)>, 
<2, (4, 8, 0)>, <2, (8, 0, 3)>, <2, (8, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<3, (6, 8, 2)>, <3, (4, 8, 2)>, <3, (4, 2, 0)>, <3, (8, 2, 7)>, <3, (2, 0, 7)>, 
<4, (5, 9, 1)>, <4, (5, 1, 2)>, <4, (9, 1, 2)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, 
<5, (9, 1, 0)>
