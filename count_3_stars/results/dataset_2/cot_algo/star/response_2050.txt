Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 6) (4, 8) (4, 10) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 1, 14, 10, 2}
- Node 1: {3, 2, 10, 13, 0}
- Node 2: {1, 8, 6, 0, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 11, 10, 8}
- Node 4: {8, 10}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 7, 14}
- Node 6: {13, 2, 11}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 8, 12, 11}
- Node 8: {3, 13, 4, 2, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 7, 0}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 4, 0}
- Node 11: {3, 13, 6, 7}
- Node 12: {13, 2, 7}
- Node 13: {5, 1, 8, 12, 11, 6}
- Node 14: {5, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 5 as the center.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 8 as the center.
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so there are [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars with node 13 as the center.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 44. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].

Unique 3-stars:

- <5, 9, 13>
- <5, 7, 8>
- <5, 7, 12>
- <5, 13, 1>
- <5, 13, 12>
- <7, 5, 9>
- <7, 5, 8>
- <7, 5, 12>
- <7, 8, 4>
- <7, 8, 13>
- <7, 12, 13>
- <8, 7, 5>
- <8, 7, 13>
- <8, 7, 12>
- <8, 13, 11>
