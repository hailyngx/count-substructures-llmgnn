Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 0) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 2) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {8, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {9, 3, 11, 2, 12}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 11, 13, 5, 12}
- Node 4: {6, 11, 12, 2, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 10, 0}
- Node 6: {4, 14}
- Node 7: {10, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {13, 5, 14, 0, 12}
- Node 9: {14, 10, 1, 12}
- Node 10: {9, 7, 5, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 13, 4}
- Node 12: {9, 1, 3, 8, 4}
- Node 13: {3, 8, 11}
- Node 14: {6, 9, 8, 10, 4}

Next, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 14 have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes 1 and 12 have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars each.
- Nodes 3, 11, and 14 have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars each.
- Nodes 4, 5, 8, 9, and 10 have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 44. 

Final Answer: [44]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (9, 12, 2)>, <12, (9, 1, 3)>, <3, (1, 11, 13)>, <11, (1, 3, 13)>, <14, (9, 8, 10)>.
