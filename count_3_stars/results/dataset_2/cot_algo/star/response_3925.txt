3. For node 20: Neighbors {25, 8, 16}
4. For node 25: Neighbors {20, 28, 22}
5. For node 8: Neighbors {20, 14}
6. For node 13: Neighbor {4}
7. For node 2: Neighbors {11, 19, 7}
8. For node 18: Neighbors {5, 17}
9. For node 17: Neighbors {18, 0}
10. For node 29: Neighbors {6, 0, 5}
11. For node 21: Neighbors {24, 23}
12. For node 24: Neighbors {21, 27}
13. For node 22: Neighbors {25, 26, 14, 28}
14. For node 26: Neighbors {22, 23, 15}

20. For node 16: Neighbors {20, 4, 15}
21. For node 15: Neighbors {11, 26, 16, 0}
22. For node 1: Neighbors {28, 14}
23. For node 19: Neighbors {2, 3, 6}
24. For node 0: Neighbors {17, 29, 15, 9}
25. For node 9: Neighbors {0, 12}
26. For node 6: Neighbors {29, 23, 19, 3}
27. For node 3: Neighbors {19, 6, 12}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors that can form 3-stars are: 10, 11, 25, 20, 8, 2, 29, 22, 28, 26, 4, 27, 14, 23, 6, 16, 15, 19, 0. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed by each such node:

1. For node 10: inom{3}{3} = 1
2. For node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10
3. For node 25: inom{3}{3} = 1
4. For node 20: inom{3}{3} = 1
5. For node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0
6. For node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
7. For node 29: inom{3}{3} = 1
8. For node 22: inom{4}{3} = 4
9. For node 28: inom{3}{3} = 1
10. For node 26: inom{3}{3} = 1
11. For node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
12. For node 27: inom{3}{3} = 1
13. For node 14: inom{5}{3} = 10
14. For node 23: inom{3}{3} = 1
15. For node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
16. For node 16: inom{3}{3} = 1
17. For node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4
18. For node 19: inom{3}{3} = 1
19. For node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<10, (11, 7, 4)>, <11, (10, 14, 12)>, <11, (10, 14, 2)>, <11, (10, 2, 15)>, <25, (20, 8, 16)>, <22, (25, 26, 14)>, <22, (25, 14, 28)>, <22, (25, 14, 1)>, <22, (26, 14, 28)>, <22, (14, 28, 1)>, <4, (10, 13, 16)>, <27, (24, 7, 5)>, <14, (11, 8, 22)>, <14, (11, 8, 1)>, <14, (11, 22, 1)>, <14, (8, 22, 1)>, <23, (21, 26, 6)>, <23, (26, 15, 6)>, <6, (29, 23, 19)>, <6, (23, 19, 3)>, <15, (26, 16, 0)>, <19, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (17, 29, 15)>, <0, (29, 15, 9)>, <0, (17, 15, 9)>.
