Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first determine the neighborhood set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
Node 1: {0, 3, 7}
Node 2: {4, 8, 9}
Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 6}
Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 8}
Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
Node 7: {1, 6, 8}
Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7}
Node 9: {2, 5, 6}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 42 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42].

And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>
