Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 19) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 17) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (5, 19) (5, 14) (19, 9) (19, 5) (19, 3) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 18) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 2) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 15) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (3, 19) (3, 0) (3, 18) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 0) (16, 17) (16, 10) (1, 4) (1, 2) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 1) (15, 9) (15, 4) (14, 7) (14, 5) (18, 13) (18, 3) (10, 7) (10, 16) (10, 8) (8, 6) (8, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {9, 3}
- Node 1: {4, 2}
- Node 2: {13, 1, 17}
- Node 3: {19, 0, 18}
- Node 4: {12, 13, 1, 15}
- Node 5: {19, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 11, 12, 8}
- Node 7: {12, 10, 14, 17}
- Node 8: {6, 10}
- Node 9: {6, 15, 11, 0, 19}
- Node 10: {7, 16, 8}
- Node 11: {6, 9, 0}
- Node 12: {6, 7, 4}
- Node 13: {17, 4, 2, 18}
- Node 14: {7, 5}
- Node 15: {9, 4}
- Node 16: {17, 10}
- Node 17: {7, 13, 16, 2}
- Node 18: {13, 3}
- Node 19: {9, 5, 3}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars using the combinatorial calculation for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <6, (9, 11, 12)>
- <9, (6, 11, 0)>
- <9, (6, 15, 19)>
- <9, (11, 0, 19)>
- <9, (11, 0, 6)>
- <9, (11, 6, 19)>
- <4, (12, 13, 1)>
- <4, (12, 1, 15)>
- <4, (13, 1, 15)>
- <4, (13, 1, 18)>
- <4, (13, 1, 2)>
- <7, (12, 10, 14)>
- <7, (12, 14, 17)>
- <7, (10, 14, 17)>
- <13, (17, 2, 1)>
- <13, (17, 2, 18)>
- <13, (17, 2, 4)>
- <13, (17, 4, 18)>
- <13, (17, 4, 2)>
- <17, (7, 13, 16)>
- <17, (7, 13, 2)>
- <17, (7, 13, 4)>
- <17, (16, 10, 7)>
- <17, (16, 10, 8)>
- <17, (16, 7, 13)>
- <19, (9, 3, 0)>
- <19, (9, 3, 18)>
- <19, (9, 5, 3)>
