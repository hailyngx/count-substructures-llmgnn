Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 5, 9, 4
Node 1: 9, 3, 4
Node 2: 5, 6, 8
Node 3: 5, 6, 1, 7, 8, 4
Node 4: 1, 3, 7, 0
Node 5: 9, 6, 2, 0, 3
Node 6: 5, 7, 3, 2, 8
Node 7: 9, 6, 3, 4
Node 8: 6, 3, 2
Node 9: 5, 1, 7, 0

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 10 + 10 = 40, so we put the final number inside brackets [] as [40].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 8, 4)>
<3, (1, 8, 7)>
<3, (4, 1, 7)>
<3, (4, 1, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 1)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 1)>
<3, (4, 8, 7)>
<3, (7, 1, 4)>
<3, (7, 1, 8)>
<3, (7, 4, 1)>
<3, (7, 4, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 1)>
<3, (7, 8, 4)>
<3, (8, 1, 4)>
<3, (8, 1, 7)>
<3, (8, 4, 1)>
<3, (8, 4, 7)>
<3, (8, 7, 1)>
<3, (8, 7, 4)>
<6, (5, 0, 9)>
<6, (5, 9, 0)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 9, 5)>
<6, (9, 5, 0)>
<6, (9, 0, 5)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
<7, (2, 6, 5)>
<7, (5, 2, 6)>
<7, (5, 6, 2)>
<7, (6, 2, 5)>
<7, (6, 5, 2)>
