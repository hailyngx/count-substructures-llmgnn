Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 27) (1, 21) (1, 5) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 13) (21, 2) (14, 28) (17, 20) (17, 7) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 12) (22, 7) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 27) (13, 21) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 11) (13, 10) (15, 18) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 29) (27, 26) (27, 8) (27, 15) (27, 29) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (4, 8) (4, 28) (11, 13) (11, 28) (28, 14) (28, 4) (28, 11) (28, 5) (20, 17) (20, 29) (7, 17) (7, 22) (7, 25) (7, 3) (25, 13) (25, 7) (25, 6) (25, 24) (29, 9) (29, 15) (29, 27) (29, 20) (16, 12) (16, 24) (16, 2) (19, 15) (19, 6) (12, 18) (12, 16) (24, 9) (24, 25) (24, 16) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (6, 25) (6, 19) (6, 23) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 28) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 23) (23, 6) (23, 10) (2, 21) (2, 16) (2, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 21}
- Node 2: {10, 16, 21}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {8, 11, 28}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 28}
- Node 6: {19, 23, 25}
- Node 7: {3, 17, 22, 25}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 9, 13, 27}
- Node 9: {8, 18, 24, 26, 29}
- Node 10: {2, 13, 23}
- Node 11: {4, 13, 28}
- Node 12: {16, 18}
- Node 13: {8, 10, 11, 21, 25}
- Node 14: {28}
- Node 15: {18, 19, 27, 29}
- Node 16: {2, 12, 24}
- Node 17: {7, 20}
- Node 18: {9, 12, 15}
- Node 19: {6, 15}
- Node 20: {17, 29}
- Node 21: {1, 2, 13}
- Node 22: {7}
- Node 23: {6, 10}
- Node 24: {9, 16, 25}
- Node 25: {6, 7, 13, 24}
- Node 26: {9, 27}
- Node 27: {8, 15, 26, 29}
- Node 28: {4, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 29: {9, 15, 20, 27}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding all the 3-stars formed by each node: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars are:
<8, 9, 13>, <8, 9, 15>, <8, 9, 25>, <8, 9, 27>, <8, 13, 15>, <8, 13, 25>, <8, 13, 27>, <8, 15, 27>, <8, 27, 29>, <9, 15, 27>, <13, 15, 25>, <18, 9, 15>, <24, 9, 16>, <25, 9, 24>, <25, 7, 6>, <27, 29, 20>, <28, 4, 11>, <28, 4, 5>, <28, 5, 11>, <28, 5, 1>.
