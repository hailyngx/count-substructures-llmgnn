Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 7) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 27) (21, 26) (21, 25) (2, 23) (2, 10) (29, 16) (29, 25) (3, 15) (3, 24) (3, 10) (3, 20) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 5) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 23) (20, 3) (20, 7) (20, 22) (28, 21) (28, 26) (28, 12) (28, 13) (26, 21) (26, 28) (26, 7) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (9, 27) (25, 21) (25, 29) (27, 21) (27, 9) (27, 6) (4, 19) (4, 11) (12, 28) (12, 8) (12, 11) (19, 4) (19, 6) (22, 20) (22, 16) (22, 24) (11, 4) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 24) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 24) (6, 27) (6, 19) (7, 1) (7, 20) (7, 26) (7, 14) (7, 5) (24, 3) (24, 22) (24, 14) (24, 10) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 10) (16, 29) (16, 22) (16, 23) (23, 2) (23, 0) (23, 16) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 28) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 7) 

Response:
First we'll create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: [17, 18, 8, 23]
- Node 1: [21, 17, 13, 7]
- Node 2: [23, 10]
- Node 3: [15, 24, 10, 20]
- Node 4: [19, 11]
- Node 5: [15, 17, 7]
- Node 6: [27, 19]
- Node 7: [1, 20, 26, 14, 5]
- Node 8: [0, 12]
- Node 9: [27]
- Node 10: [2, 3, 18, 24]
- Node 11: [4, 12]
- Node 12: [28, 8, 11]
- Node 13: [1, 15, 28]
- Node 14: [7, 24]
- Node 15: [3, 18, 13, 5]
- Node 16: [29, 22, 23]
- Node 17: [1, 0, 5]
- Node 18: [15, 0, 10]
- Node 19: [4, 6]
- Node 20: [3, 7, 22]
- Node 21: [1, 28, 27, 26, 25]
- Node 22: [20, 16, 24]
- Node 23: [2, 0, 16]
- Node 24: [3, 22, 14, 10]
- Node 25: [21, 29]
- Node 26: [21, 28, 7]
- Node 27: [21, 9, 6]
- Node 28: [21, 26, 12, 13]
- Node 29: [16, 25]

Next, we'll identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 45 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 7, 26>
- <1, 7, 28>
- <1, 7, 21>
- <1, 7, 5>
- <3, 10, 24>
- <3, 10, 18>
- <3, 10, 15>
- <3, 15, 5>
- <7, 14, 24>
- <7, 14, 20>
- <7, 14, 26>
- <7, 14, 5>
- <10, 18, 15>
- <10, 18, 0>
- <10, 18, 24>
- <10, 24, 14>
- <12, 11, 4>
- <13, 15, 28>
- <16, 23, 0>
- <21, 26, 28>
- <21, 26, 7>
- <21, 26, 1>
- <21, 26, 25>

- <21, 28, 12>
- <24, 22, 14>
- <25, 29, 16>
