Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 0) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 12) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 8) (0, 12) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 11, 13, 8, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 14, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {6, 11, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 11, 7, 14, 4, 12}
- Node 4: {6, 1, 3, 14, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 10}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {6, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {6, 5, 7, 10, 0, 12}
- Node 9: {11, 0}
- Node 10: {5, 8, 12}
- Node 11: {9, 3, 0, 2, 13}
- Node 12: {3, 8, 10, 0}
- Node 13: {11, 0}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 70

Therefore, the final answer is [70].
