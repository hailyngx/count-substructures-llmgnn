Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 0) (5, 0) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 1) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 1) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 1) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 10) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we need to find the total number of 3-stars formed.

First, let's determine the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors (2, 12, 11, 5)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (8, 14, 13, 10)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (8, 12, 14, 0)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (4, 14, 10, 13)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (6, 7, 8, 3, 3)
- Node 5: 1 neighbor (0)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (9, 7, 11, 4, 13)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (6, 4, 11, 13)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (9, 4, 2, 14, 1)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (6, 8, 11, 10, 12)
- Node 10: 3 neighbors (9, 3, 1)
- Node 11: 5 neighbors (6, 9, 7, 12, 0)
- Node 12: 4 neighbors (9, 2, 0, 11)
- Node 13: 4 neighbors (6, 7, 3, 1)
- Node 14: 4 neighbors (8, 2, 3, 1)

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Nodes 4, 6, 8, 9, and 11 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 12, 13, and 14 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Total number of 3-stars = \( (5 \times 10) + (8 \times 4) = 50 + 32 = 82 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [82], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (9, 7, 11)>
<8, (9, 4, 1)>
<9, (6, 8, 11)>
<11, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 12, 11)>
<1, (8, 14, 13)>
<2, (8, 12, 14)>
<3, (4, 14, 13)>
<7, (6, 4, 13)>
<12, (9, 2, 0)>
<13, (6, 7, 1)>
<14, (8, 2, 3)>
