Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 29) (13, 7) (13, 18) (22, 5) (22, 6) (22, 1) (2, 26) (2, 15) (29, 13) (29, 17) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 24) (14, 20) (17, 29) (17, 14) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 5) (26, 2) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 3) (26, 8) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 1) (16, 4) (16, 9) (16, 19) (18, 13) (18, 26) (18, 3) (15, 2) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 25) (7, 13) (25, 15) (25, 23) (25, 4) (6, 22) (6, 14) (6, 24) (24, 14) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 21) (11, 14) (11, 20) (1, 22) (1, 28) (1, 12) (3, 26) (3, 18) (3, 27) (5, 22) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 21) (8, 10) (8, 26) (8, 5) (12, 1) (12, 21) (12, 19) (12, 23) (20, 14) (20, 11) (20, 27) (0, 19) (21, 24) (21, 5) (21, 12) (9, 28) (9, 16) (9, 15) (9, 19) (27, 24) (27, 3) (27, 20) (23, 25) (23, 12) (4, 16) (4, 25) (19, 16) (19, 12) (19, 0) (19, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {19}
- Node 1: {12, 22, 28}
- Node 2: {15, 26}
- Node 3: {18, 26, 27}
- Node 4: {16, 25}
- Node 5: {8, 10, 21, 22}
- Node 6: {14, 22, 24}
- Node 7: {13}
- Node 8: {5, 10, 26}
- Node 9: {15, 16, 19, 28}
- Node 10: {5, 8, 15}
- Node 11: {14, 20}
- Node 12: {1, 19, 21, 23}
- Node 13: {7, 18, 29}
- Node 14: {6, 11, 17, 20, 24}
- Node 15: {2, 9, 10, 25}
- Node 16: {4, 9, 19}
- Node 17: {14, 29}
- Node 18: {3, 13, 26}
- Node 19: {0, 9, 12, 16}
- Node 20: {11, 14, 27}
- Node 21: {5, 12, 24}
- Node 22: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 23: {12, 25}
- Node 24: {6, 14, 21, 27}
- Node 25: {4, 15, 23}
- Node 26: {2, 3, 8, 18, 28}
- Node 27: {3, 20, 24}
- Node 28: {1, 9, 26}
- Node 29: {13, 17}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, 12, 21>, <1, 12, 23>, <1, 12, 28>, <1, 21, 24>, <3, 13, 18>, <5, 8, 10>, <5, 8, 21>, <5, 10, 21>, <9, 15, 25>, <9, 16, 19>, <14, 17, 29>, <14, 20, 27>, <14, 24, 27>, <14, 24, 6>, <15, 25, 4>, <18, 26, 3>, <19, 16, 4>, <19, 16, 9>, <19, 9, 28>, <20, 11, 14>
