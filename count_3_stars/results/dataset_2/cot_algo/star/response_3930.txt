Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 6 neighbors

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 60. \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 9>.
