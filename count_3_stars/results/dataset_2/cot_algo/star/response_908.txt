Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 27) (4, 15) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 10) (21, 7) (21, 3) (18, 11) (18, 25) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 20) (22, 12) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 21) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 23) (12, 22) (12, 5) (27, 4) (27, 10) (27, 20) (6, 24) (6, 20) (28, 3) (28, 0) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 26) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 19) (10, 7) (10, 27) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 9) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 2) (11, 18) (11, 23) (11, 14) (11, 8) (23, 3) (23, 11) (23, 9) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 8) (2, 22) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 16) (2, 25) (20, 22) (20, 27) (20, 6) (20, 29) (29, 20) (29, 26) (25, 18) (25, 17) (25, 2) (14, 22) (14, 11) (14, 26) (14, 16) (26, 5) (26, 29) (26, 14) (26, 16) (19, 13) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 28) (24, 6) (9, 10) (9, 23) (9, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 16) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 26) (16, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {1, 7, 28}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 2: neighbors {9, 15, 16, 22, 25}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 21, 23, 28}
- Node 4: neighbors {15, 27}
- Node 5: neighbors {12, 13, 26}
- Node 6: neighbors {20, 24}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 10, 21}
- Node 8: neighbors {10, 11, 16, 17}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 10, 23}
- Node 10: neighbors {7, 9, 15, 27, 8}
- Node 11: neighbors {8, 14, 18, 23}
- Node 12: neighbors {5, 22}
- Node 13: neighbors {5, 17, 19}
- Node 14: neighbors {11, 16, 22, 26}
- Node 15: neighbors {2, 4, 10}
- Node 16: neighbors {2, 8, 14, 26}
- Node 17: neighbors {8, 13, 25}
- Node 18: neighbors {11, 25}
- Node 19: neighbor {13}
- Node 20: neighbors {6, 22, 27, 29}
- Node 21: neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 22: neighbors {2, 12, 14, 20}
- Node 23: neighbors {3, 9, 11}
- Node 24: neighbor {6}
- Node 25: neighbors {2, 17, 18}
- Node 26: neighbors {5, 14, 16, 29}
- Node 27: neighbors {4, 10, 20}
- Node 28: neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 29: neighbors {20, 26}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, 1, 6, 19, 24: <0, (1, 7, 28)>
- Node 2: <2, (9, 15, 16)>, <2, (9, 16, 25)>, <2, (15, 16, 25)>, <2, (2, 15, 25)>, <2, (2, 22, 25)>
- Node 3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12, 15, 23, 28: <3, (1, 3, 28)>
- Node 5: <5, (12, 13, 26)>, <5, (5, 13, 17)>, <5, (5, 13, 19)>, <5, (13, 17, 19)>
- Node 7, 14, 18: <7, (7, 10, 21)>, <7, (10, 15, 27)>, <7, (11, 14, 23)>, <7, (8, 11, 17)>, <7, (8, 16, 26)>
- Node 10: <10, (9, 10, 23)>
- Node 20: <20, (20, 22, 27)>, <20, (20, 22, 29)>, <20, (20, 26, 29)>
- Node 16: <16, (14, 16, 26)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
