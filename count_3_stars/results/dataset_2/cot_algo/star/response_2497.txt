Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 6) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 14) (9, 0) (9, 14) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 4, 3, 9
- Node 1: 6, 11, 12, 2
- Node 2: 4, 13, 10, 1, 14
- Node 3: 0, 14, 13, 5, 8
- Node 4: 0, 14, 2
- Node 5: 7, 3, 6, 14
- Node 6: 1, 8, 13, 11, 5
- Node 7: 11, 10, 5, 8
- Node 8: 7, 3, 13, 6, 12
- Node 9: 0, 14
- Node 10: 7, 12, 2
- Node 11: 7, 1, 6
- Node 12: 1, 8, 10, 0
- Node 13: 3, 8, 2, 6
- Node 14: 4, 3, 5, 9, 2

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to check for the formation of 3-stars. These nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 14.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [59].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 9, 14)>, <1, (6, 11, 12)>, <2, (13, 10, 14)>, <3, (8, 13, 14)>, <5, (6, 7, 14)>
