Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 9, 4, 3}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 8, 2}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 6, 1}
- Node 3: {9, 6, 7, 0}
- Node 4: {2, 8, 6, 0}
- Node 5: {6, 1, 0, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 4, 7, 3, 2}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 8, 6, 3}
- Node 8: {2, 7, 1}
- Node 9: {3, 1, 7, 0}

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 0.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 1.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 2.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 3.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 4.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 5.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 6.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 7.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star involving node 8.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 9.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 45 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [45].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <7, 8, 9>
