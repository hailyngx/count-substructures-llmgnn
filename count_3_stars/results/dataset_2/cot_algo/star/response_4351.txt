Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 1) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 5) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 5, 8, 14
Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 7, 10, 11
Node 2: 1, 3, 10
Node 3: 2, 11, 13
Node 4: 7, 9, 10, 14
Node 5: 0, 14
Node 6: 1, 10
Node 7: 1, 4
Node 8: 0, 9, 11, 12
Node 9: 4, 8, 11, 14
Node 10: 1, 4, 6, 11, 12
Node 11: 1, 3, 8, 9, 10, 12
Node 12: 8, 10, 11, 13, 14
Node 13: 3, 12, 14
Node 14: 0, 4, 5, 9, 12, 13

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors, as these are candidates for forming 3-stars:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) where n is the number of neighbors:

Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4
Node 1: 6 choose 3 = 20
Node 4: 4 choose 3 = 4
Node 8: 4 choose 3 = 4
Node 9: 4 choose 3 = 4
Node 10: 5 choose 3 = 10
Node 11: 6 choose 3 = 20
Node 12: 5 choose 3 = 10
Node 14: 6 choose 3 = 20

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 96

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [96].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 5>
<1, 4, 11>
<1, 8, 11>
<1, 9, 14>
<1, 10, 12>
<4, 7, 10>
<4, 9, 11>
<9, 11, 14>
<10, 11, 12>
<12, 13, 14>
