Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 13) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 8) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (8, 11) (8, 12) (10, 9) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 9, 10}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {11, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 9}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {3, 6, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {6, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 7}

Now let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Based on the neighbor sets, nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13 
- For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars: \( \binom{n}{3} \)
  - Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Summing these up: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 56 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].
And the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 11, 14)>
- <0, (4, 11, 14)>
- <0, (3, 4, 14)>
- <0, (4, 3, 11)>
- <2, (0, 7, 14)>
- <2, (7, 13, 14)>
- <2, (4, 7, 14)>
- <2, (4, 7, 13)>
- <2, (7, 9, 14)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <4, (3, 6, 13)>
- <4, (5, 6, 13)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <6, (8, 11, 12)>
- <6, (8, 12, 13)>
- <6, (11, 12, 13)>
- <7, (9, 13, 14)>
- <7, (5, 9, 13)>
- <7, (5, 9, 4)>
- <7, (4, 9, 13)>
- <9, (1, 10, 13)>
- <9, (1, 10, 2)>

- <12, (3, 6, 13)>
- <12, (3, 9, 13)>
