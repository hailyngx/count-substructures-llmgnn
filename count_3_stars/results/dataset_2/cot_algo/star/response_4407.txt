Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {6, 2, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (1, 3, 8)>
