Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 5) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 11) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 5) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) 

Response:
The 3-star graph can be visualized as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 10, 11, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, 6, 11, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 14, and 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 12, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 12, 13, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 11, 10, and 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 12, 1, 3, 13, and 10.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 10, 11, and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 14, 1, and 12.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 12, 1, 10, 13, and 3.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 0, 7, 9, and 5.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 1, 0, 7, and 5.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 8, 4, 6, 9, and 3.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 6.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.

For this graph, the total number of 3-stars is [14], and the unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (2, 10, 11)>
<1, (8, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 14)>
<3, (12, 6, 9)>
<4, (12, 6, 13)>
<5, (2, 8, 11)>
<6, (12, 1, 9)>
<7, (2, 10, 11)>
<8, (5, 1, 12)>
<9, (12, 1, 10)>
<10, (6, 0, 5)>
<11, (1, 0, 5)>
<12, (8, 4, 6)>
<13, (4, 9, 6)>
