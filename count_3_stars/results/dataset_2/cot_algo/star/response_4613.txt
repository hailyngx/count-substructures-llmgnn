Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 9) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 0) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 11, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7, 10, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 8, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 4, 11, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 12: Neighbors {4, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and determine the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 0: \({inom{4}{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \({inom{5}{3}} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \({inom{4}{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \({inom{5}{3}} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \({inom{5}{3}} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \({inom{4}{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 12: \({inom{4}{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 13: \({inom{5}{3}} = 10\) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars formed is \(4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 56\).

Therefore, the final answer is [56], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 13>, <9, 9, 11>, <12, 12, 13>
