Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 8) (10, 5) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 13) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 12) 

Response:
First, let's map out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 9, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {4, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 11}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {3, 5}
- Node 11: {0, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 5, 6, 11, 12}

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 5, Node 7, Node 12, and Node 14 have 5 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Each of the 5 nodes with 5 neighbors can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Total 3-stars = 5 * 10 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (2, 5, 11)>
- <0, (2, 5, 14)>
- <0, (2, 8, 11)>
- <0, (2, 8, 14)>
- <0, (2, 11, 14)>
- <5, (0, 7, 10)>
- <5, (7, 11, 14)>
- <7, (3, 4, 11)>
- <12, (1, 9, 13)>
- <12, (3, 4, 8)>
- <12, (3, 8, 12)>
- <12, (4, 6, 14)>
- <12, (6, 13, 14)>
