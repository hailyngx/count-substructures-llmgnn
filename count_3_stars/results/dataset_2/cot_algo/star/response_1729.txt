Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 8) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 11) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 3) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 15) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 19) (0, 17) (7, 3) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 11) (16, 4) (16, 13) (16, 15) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 19) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 3) (14, 1) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 1) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 12) (10, 4) (10, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (17, 5) (17, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {17}
- Node 1: {9, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {8, 11, 14, 18}
- Node 3: {6, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 4: {10, 11, 16, 19}
- Node 5: {13, 15, 17, 19}
- Node 6: {3, 10}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 18}
- Node 9: {1, 15}
- Node 10: {4, 6}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 19}
- Node 12: {1, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 12, 16, 19}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 3, 18}
- Node 15: {5, 9, 16}
- Node 16: {4, 13, 15}
- Node 17: {0, 5}
- Node 18: {2, 8, 14}
- Node 19: {4, 5, 11, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors or more: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the final answer is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 9, 12, 13>, <2, 8, 11, 18>, <3, 6, 7, 14>, <4, 10, 11, 16>, <5, 13, 15, 19>
