Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 8) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 13) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 6, 8, 10}
- Node 1: {3, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 11}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {5, 7, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 5, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {3, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 6, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13}

Now, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 9, 11, and 14: <5, (9, 11, 14)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 2, 12, and 13: <3, (2, 12, 13)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 9, 10, and 12: <14, (9, 10, 12)>

Now, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: 3, and place it inside brackets to get [3].
