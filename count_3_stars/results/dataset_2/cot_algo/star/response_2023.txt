Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 23) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 23) (2, 9) (2, 22) (29, 28) (29, 6) (29, 3) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 20) (21, 8) (0, 21) (0, 22) (0, 25) (27, 25) (27, 14) (27, 5) (8, 7) (8, 21) (8, 3) (23, 9) (23, 26) (23, 19) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 5) (28, 29) (28, 12) (28, 13) (28, 15) (4, 18) (4, 1) (18, 26) (18, 4) (19, 26) (19, 23) (19, 24) (19, 13) (15, 28) (20, 21) (20, 24) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 28) (13, 19) (11, 6) (16, 9) (16, 10) (22, 2) (22, 0) (22, 5) (1, 4) (1, 25) (1, 5) (1, 24) (6, 29) (6, 11) (12, 28) (25, 0) (25, 27) (25, 1) (25, 14) (3, 29) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 24) (24, 19) (24, 20) (24, 1) (24, 3) (14, 7) (14, 27) (14, 25) (14, 5) (5, 27) (5, 17) (5, 22) (5, 1) (5, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 21, 22, 25
- Node 1: 4, 5, 24, 25
- Node 2: 9, 22
- Node 3: 7, 8, 10, 24, 29
- Node 4: 1, 18
- Node 5: 1, 14, 17, 22, 27
- Node 6: 11, 29
- Node 7: 3, 8, 14
- Node 8: 3, 7, 21
- Node 9: 2, 16, 23
- Node 10: 3, 16, 17
- Node 11: 6
- Node 12: 28
- Node 13: 19, 21, 28
- Node 14: 5, 7, 25, 27
- Node 15: 28
- Node 16: 9, 10
- Node 17: 5, 10
- Node 18: 4, 26
- Node 19: 13, 18, 23, 24
- Node 20: 21, 24
- Node 21: 8, 13, 20, 23
- Node 22: 2, 0, 5
- Node 23: 9, 19, 26
- Node 24: 1, 3, 19, 20
- Node 25: 0, 1, 14, 27
- Node 26: 18, 19, 23
- Node 27: 5, 14, 25
- Node 28: 12, 13, 15, 29
- Node 29: 3, 6, 28

Considering the nodes with at least 3 neighbors, we have:

- Node 0: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1] 3-star
- Node 1: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4] 3-stars
- Node 3: [\( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10] 3-stars
- Node 5: [\( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10] 3-stars
- Node 7: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1] 3-star
- Node 8: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1] 3-star
- Node 9: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1] 3-star
- Node 13: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4] 3-stars
- Node 14: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4] 3-stars
- Node 19: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4] 3-stars
- Node 21: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4] 3-stars
- Node 24: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4] 3-stars
- Node 25: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4] 3-stars
- Node 26: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1] 3-star
- Node 28: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4] 3-stars
- Node 29: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1] 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
