Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 12) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 2) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 4) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {1, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 14}
- Node 5: {7, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {6, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {6, 12}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 3, 8, 12}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 6, 8, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 7, 9, 10, 13, 5}
- Node 13: {12}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 7, 8, 11}

Next, we will count the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 12: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 14: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 70

Therefore, the final answer is [70], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 10, 12)>, <3, (4, 7, 10)>, <7, (1, 12, 14)>, <10, (1, 3, 12)>, <12, (7, 10, 14)>.
