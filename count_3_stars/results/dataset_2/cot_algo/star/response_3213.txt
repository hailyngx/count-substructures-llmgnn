Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 25) (9, 24) (9, 1) (9, 12) (26, 14) (26, 10) (26, 15) (26, 7) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 23) (13, 27) (2, 16) (2, 3) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 28) (4, 5) (4, 29) (17, 16) (17, 28) (17, 27) (29, 4) (29, 19) (1, 9) (1, 22) (1, 27) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 10) (21, 14) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 11) (19, 18) (19, 29) (19, 5) (19, 22) (14, 26) (14, 21) (22, 1) (22, 19) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 7) (10, 26) (10, 3) (10, 27) (10, 23) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 24) (24, 9) (24, 3) (24, 11) (0, 3) (0, 15) (25, 9) (25, 16) (25, 12) (15, 26) (15, 0) (28, 18) (28, 17) (28, 22) (16, 2) (16, 17) (16, 25) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 25) (12, 20) (20, 12) (6, 22) (6, 23) (6, 27) (27, 13) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 10) (27, 6) (7, 26) (7, 22) (23, 13) (23, 10) (23, 6) 

Response:
First, we will calculate the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 9: {25, 24, 1, 12}
- Node 26: {14, 10, 15, 7}
- Node 8: {13, 11}
- Node 13: {8, 23, 27}
- Node 2: {16, 3}
- Node 18: {19, 11, 28}
- Node 4: {5, 29}
- Node 17: {16, 28, 27}
- Node 29: {4, 19}
- Node 1: {9, 22, 27}
- Node 3: {2, 0, 24, 10}
- Node 21: {14}
- Node 5: {4, 19, 12, 11}
- Node 19: {18, 29, 5, 22}
- Node 14: {26, 21}
- Node 22: {1, 19, 6, 28, 7}
- Node 10: {26, 3, 27, 23}
- Node 11: {8, 18, 5, 24}
- Node 24: {9, 3, 11}
- Node 0: {3, 15}
- Node 25: {9, 16, 12}
- Node 15: {26, 0}
- Node 28: {18, 17, 22}
- Node 16: {2, 17, 25}
- Node 12: {9, 5, 25, 20}
- Node 20: {12}
- Node 6: {22, 23, 27}
- Node 27: {13, 17, 1, 10, 6}
- Node 7: {26, 22}
- Node 23: {13, 10, 6}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 9, 26, 13, 18, 5, 19, 22, 27

For each of these nodes, we have \( \binom{n}{3} \) 3-stars, where n is the number of neighbors. Calculating this for each node:

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<9, 25, 24, 1>, <26, 14, 10, 15>, <13, 8, 23, 27>, <5, 4, 29, 19>, <22, 1, 19, 27>, <27, 13, 17, 1>, <22, 19, 6, 28>, <22, 19, 7, 28>, <27, 10, 23, 6>, <22, 10, 27, 6>
