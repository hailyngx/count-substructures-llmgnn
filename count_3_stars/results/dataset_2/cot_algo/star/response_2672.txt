Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 5, 4, 8, 2 (degree = 4)
Node 1 neighbors: 5, 6, 8 (degree = 3)
Node 2 neighbors: 9, 6, 7, 0 (degree = 4)
Node 3 neighbors: 5, 9, 6 (degree = 3)
Node 4 neighbors: 9, 7, 8, 0 (degree = 4)
Node 5 neighbors: 9, 1, 0, 3 (degree = 4)
Node 6 neighbors: 9, 1, 3, 2, 8 (degree = 5)
Node 7 neighbors: 4, 2 (degree = 2)
Node 8 neighbors: 9, 6, 4, 0, 1 (degree = 5)
Node 9 neighbors: 5, 9, 6, 8, 4, 2, 3 (degree = 6)

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:

For Node 6 and Node 8, both have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
For the rest of the nodes, they either have 3 or 4 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 10 = 20, so the answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
