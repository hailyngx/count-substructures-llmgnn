Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 22) (16, 27) (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 2) (27, 16) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 1) (27, 13) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 2) (25, 20) (25, 9) (25, 26) (25, 28) (25, 10) (15, 20) (17, 29) (17, 28) (17, 12) (17, 18) (29, 17) (29, 7) (29, 19) (29, 13) (24, 26) (24, 7) (26, 25) (26, 24) (9, 25) (9, 21) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 22) (8, 7) (19, 29) (19, 8) (4, 12) (4, 23) (12, 20) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 18) (21, 16) (21, 0) (21, 9) (21, 14) (5, 8) (5, 2) (14, 21) (2, 0) (2, 20) (2, 5) (2, 22) (22, 16) (22, 8) (22, 2) (22, 10) (7, 11) (7, 29) (7, 24) (7, 8) (1, 11) (1, 27) (1, 18) (28, 0) (28, 25) (28, 17) (23, 4) (6, 10) (10, 25) (10, 22) (10, 6) (18, 27) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 1) (13, 27) (13, 29) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node and then calculate the number of 3-stars formed.

Node 0 neighbors: {27, 28, 21, 2}
Node 1 neighbors: {27, 11, 18}
Node 2 neighbors: {0, 20, 5, 22}
Node 4 neighbors: {12, 23}
Node 5 neighbors: {8, 2}
Node 6 neighbors: {10}
Node 7 neighbors: {11, 29, 24, 8}
Node 8 neighbors: {11, 19, 5, 22, 7}
Node 9 neighbors: {25, 21}
Node 10 neighbors: {25, 22, 6}
Node 11 neighbors: {16, 7, 1, 8}
Node 12 neighbors: {20, 17, 4, 18}
Node 13 neighbors: {27, 29}
Node 15 neighbors: {20}
Node 16 neighbors: {11, 21, 27, 22}
Node 17 neighbors: {29, 12, 18, 28}
Node 18 neighbors: {27, 17, 12, 1}
Node 19 neighbors: {29, 8}
Node 20 neighbors: {25, 15, 2, 12}
Node 21 neighbors: {16, 27, 0, 9, 14}
Node 22 neighbors: {16, 8, 2, 10}
Node 23 neighbors: {4}
Node 24 neighbors: {26, 7}
Node 25 neighbors: {20, 9, 26, 28, 10}
Node 26 neighbors: {25, 24}
Node 27 neighbors: {16, 0, 18, 1, 13}
Node 28 neighbors: {0, 25, 17}
Node 29 neighbors: {17, 7, 19, 13}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 5: Ignored (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
Node 10: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
Node 11: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 12: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 16: Ignored (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 17: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 18: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 20: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 21: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
Node 22: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 24: Ignored (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 25: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
Node 26: Ignored (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 27: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
Node 28: Ignored (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 29: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Total number of 3-stars = 74

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [74].

The unique 3-stars are:
