Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 1) (11, 5) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 12) (10, 12) (10, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 12) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 6, 12}
- Node 1: {11, 6, 7, 9, 2}
- Node 2: {4, 3, 7, 1}
- Node 3: {13, 14, 2, 5}
- Node 4: {8, 9, 6, 2}
- Node 5: {13, 3, 11, 12, 7}
- Node 6: {4, 1, 7, 12, 0}
- Node 7: {8, 5, 1, 6, 2}
- Node 8: {13, 4, 14, 0, 7}
- Node 9: {13, 4, 1, 10}
- Node 10: {12, 9}
- Node 11: {1, 5}
- Node 12: {5, 6, 0, 10, 14}
- Node 13: {8, 5, 3, 9}
- Node 14: {8, 3, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 78 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [78].
