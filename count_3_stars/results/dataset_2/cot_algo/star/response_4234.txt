Response:
The central idea is to check each node that has three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed with that node. 

Let's go through each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 5 has 5 neighbors (9, 6, 0, 10, 7). There are 5 choose 3 = 10 ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star with node 5 as the center. Therefore, <5, (9, 6, 0)>, <5, (9, 6, 10)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 0, 10)>, <5, (9, 0, 7)>, <5, (9, 10, 7)>, <5, (6, 0, 10)>, <5, (6, 0, 7)>, <5, (6, 10, 7)>, <5, (0, 10, 7)>.

Node 9 has 5 neighbors (5, 8, 1, 7). There are 5 choose 3 = 10 ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star with node 9 as the center. Therefore, <9, (5, 8, 1)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (8, 1, 7)>, <9, (8, 1, 7)>, <9, (5, 8, 1)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (8, 1, 7)>, <9, (5, 8, 1)>.

Node 7 has 5 neighbors (5, 9, 11, 6). There are 5 choose 3 = 10 ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star with node 7 as the center. Therefore, <7, (5, 9, 11)>, <7, (5, 9, 6)>, <7, (5, 11, 6)>, <7, (9, 11, 6)>, <7, (5, 9, 11)>, <7, (5, 9, 6)>, <7, (5, 11, 6)>, <7, (9, 11, 6)>, <7, (5, 9, 11)>, <7, (5, 9, 6)>.

Node 1 has 4 neighbors (9, 3, 14, 10). There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star with node 1 as the center. Therefore, <1, (9, 3, 14)>, <1, (9, 3, 10)>, <1, (9, 14, 10)>, <1, (3, 14, 10)>.

Node 3 has 4 neighbors (4, 1, 13, 12). There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star with node 3 as the center. Therefore, <3, (4, 1, 13)>, <3, (4, 1, 12)> <3, (4, 13, 12)>, <3, (1, 13, 12)>.

Node 6 has 6 neighbors (5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 0). There are 6 choose 3 = 20 ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star with node 6 as the center. Therefore,  <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 10)>, <6, (5, 7, 11)>, <6, (5, 7, 0)>, <6, (5, 8, 10)>, <6, (5, 8, 11)>, <6, (5, 8, 0)>, <6, (5, 10, 11)>, <6, (5, 10, 0)>, <6, (5, 11, 0)>, <6, (7, 8, 10)>, <6, (7, 8, 11)>, <6, (7, 8, 0)>, <6, (7, 10, 11)>, <6, (7, 10, 0)>, <6, (7, 11, 0)>, <6, (8, 10, 11)>, <6, (8, 10, 0)>, <6, (8, 11, 0)>, <6, (10, 11, 0)>.

Node 10 has 6 neighbors (5, 1, 13, 11, 6, 0). There are 6 choose 3 = 20 ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star with node 10 as the center. Therefore, <10, (5, 1, 13)>, <10, (5, 1, 11)>, <10, (5, 1, 6)>, <10, (5, 1, 0)>, <10, (5, 13, 11)>, <10, (5, 13, 6)>, <10, (5, 13, 0)>, <10, (5, 11, 6)>, <10, (5, 11, 0)>, <10, (5, 6, 0)>, <10, (1, 13, 11)>, <10, (1, 13, 6)>, <10, (1, 13, 0)>, <10, (1, 11, 6)>, <10, (1, 11, 0)>, <10, (1, 6, 0)>, <10, (13, 11, 6)>, <10, (13, 11, 0)>, <10, (13, 6, 0)>, <10, (11, 6, 0)>.

Node 0 has 5 neighbors (5, 13, 6, 2, 12). There are 5 choose 3 = 10 ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star with node 0 as the center. Therefore, <0, (5, 13, 6)>, <0, (5, 13, 2)>, <0, (5, 13, 12)>, <0, (5, 6, 2)>, <0, (5, 6, 12)>, <0, (5, 2, 12)>, <0, (13, 6, 2)>, <0, (13, 6, 12)>, <0, (13, 2, 12)>, <0, (6, 2, 12)>.

Node 14 has 4 neighbors (1, 11, 2, 12). There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star with node 14 as the center. Therefore, <14, (1, 11, 2)>, <14, (1, 11, 12)>, <14, (1, 2, 12)>, <14, (11, 2, 12)>.

Node 12 has 3 neighbors (3, 0, 14). Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, only 1 3-star is formed with node 12 as the center. Therefore, <12, (3, 0, 14)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed with the respective central nodes, we get a total of 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 97.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [97].
