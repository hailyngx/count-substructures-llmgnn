Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 12) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 12) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 12) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 6) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 4, 10, 14, 8, 13
- Node 1: 7, 11, 12
- Node 2: 4, 10, 13
- Node 3: 9, 7, 11, 8, 12
- Node 4: 0, 6, 2
- Node 5: 8, 0, 7
- Node 6: 4, 11, 14, 8, 12
- Node 7: 5, 9, 3, 13, 1, 11
- Node 8: 5, 0, 6, 3
- Node 9: 11, 3, 7
- Node 10: 11, 0, 2, 12
- Node 11: 9, 3, 7, 1, 6, 10, 12
- Node 12: 10, 3, 1, 6
- Node 13: 7, 0, 14, 2
- Node 14: 0, 6, 13

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 35 + 4 + 4 = 112

So, the final answer is [112].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 6, 13)>, <3, (8, 9, 12)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 8, 12)>, <7, (3, 11, 13)>
