Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 5) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in the given graph.

List of unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>
