Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 8}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Summing these up, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 54. 

Therefore, the final answer is [54], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <7, (3, 5, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
