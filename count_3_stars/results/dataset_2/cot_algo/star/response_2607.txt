Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 5, 7, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms 5 3-stars: <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (2, 5, 6)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [8] 3-stars: <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>.
