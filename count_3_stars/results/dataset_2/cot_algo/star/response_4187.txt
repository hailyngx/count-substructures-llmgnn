Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 4) (17, 19) (17, 8) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 5) (7, 11) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 2) (5, 10) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 19) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 4) (2, 12) (2, 4) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 13) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 9) (9, 16) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 15) (4, 14) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 15) (15, 9) (15, 4) (18, 1) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 19) 

Response:
Given the edge list and the fact that the graph has 20 nodes, we need to determine the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: (16, 3, 4)
- Node 1: (12, 13, 18)
- Node 2: (4, 12)
- Node 3: (0, 4, 6, 14)
- Node 4: (0, 2, 9, 14, 15)
- Node 5: (6, 10, 19)
- Node 6: (3, 5, 10, 19)
- Node 7: (11)
- Node 8: (9, 14, 17)
- Node 9: (4, 8, 15, 16)
- Node 10: (5, 6, 11, 12)
- Node 11: (7, 10, 13, 16)
- Node 12: (1, 2, 10)
- Node 13: (1, 11, 19)
- Node 14: (3, 4, 8)
- Node 15: (4, 9)
- Node 16: (9, 11)
- Node 17: (8, 19)
- Node 18: (1)
- Node 19: (5, 6, 13, 17)

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 4, Node 9, and Node 14 can form 3-stars.
- Node 3, Node 6, Node 8, and Node 10 have exactly 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 (from the nodes with more than 3 neighbors) + 4 (from the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors) = 8. 

Thus, the answer is [8], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (3, 4, 15)>, 
<3, (0, 6, 14)>, 
<6, (3, 5, 19)>, 
<8, (9, 14, 17)>, 
<10, (5, 6, 12)>, 
<12, (1, 10, 2)>, 
<14, (3, 4, 8)>, 
<16, (9, 11, 13)>.
