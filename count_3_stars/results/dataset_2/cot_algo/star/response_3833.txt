Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 24) (9, 1) (26, 24) (26, 27) (26, 12) (8, 5) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 2) (0, 22) (2, 0) (2, 27) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 11) (17, 1) (17, 27) (17, 15) (24, 9) (24, 26) (24, 5) (24, 19) (6, 21) (6, 16) (21, 6) (21, 11) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 15) (22, 0) (22, 4) (22, 19) (22, 20) (25, 15) (25, 28) (25, 14) (4, 22) (4, 28) (4, 11) (12, 26) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 29) (19, 24) (19, 22) (3, 7) (3, 10) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 29) (7, 20) (7, 28) (15, 17) (15, 16) (15, 25) (29, 12) (29, 7) (29, 18) (29, 10) (11, 1) (11, 21) (11, 4) (5, 8) (5, 24) (5, 18) (5, 10) (5, 20) (20, 22) (20, 7) (20, 5) (10, 3) (10, 29) (10, 5) (10, 23) (18, 29) (18, 5) (27, 26) (27, 2) (27, 17) (27, 28) (28, 25) (28, 4) (28, 7) (28, 27) (14, 13) (14, 25) (14, 12) (14, 23) (23, 10) (23, 14) 

Response:
Based on the provided edge list, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 22}
- Node 1: {9, 17, 11}
- Node 2: {0, 27}
- Node 3: {7, 10}
- Node 4: {22, 28, 11}
- Node 5: {8, 24, 18, 10, 20}
- Node 6: {21, 16}
- Node 7: {13, 3, 29, 20, 28}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {1, 24}
- Node 10: {3, 29, 5, 23}
- Node 11: {1, 21, 4}
- Node 12: {26, 16, 14, 29}
- Node 13: {14, 7}
- Node 14: {13, 25, 12, 23}
- Node 15: {17, 16, 25}
- Node 16: {6, 12, 15}
- Node 17: {1, 27, 15}
- Node 18: {29, 5}
- Node 19: {24, 22}
- Node 20: {22, 7, 5}
- Node 21: {6, 11}
- Node 22: {0, 4, 19, 20}
- Node 23: {10, 14}
- Node 24: {9, 26, 5, 19}
- Node 25: {15, 28, 14}
- Node 26: {24, 27, 12}
- Node 27: {26, 2, 17, 28}
- Node 28: {25, 4, 7, 27}
- Node 29: {12, 7, 18, 10}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Since the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 5, 7, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29, we need to calculate how many 3-stars each of them can form:

Number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 44

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].
