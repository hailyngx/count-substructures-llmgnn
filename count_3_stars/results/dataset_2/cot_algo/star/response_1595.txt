Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 25) (1, 24) (21, 28) (21, 25) (21, 15) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (0, 10) (0, 8) (27, 12) (27, 9) (12, 4) (12, 27) (12, 10) (12, 23) (20, 3) (26, 28) (26, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 15) (8, 0) (8, 24) (8, 15) (28, 21) (28, 26) (28, 10) (22, 15) (29, 19) (18, 6) (18, 13) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 24) (5, 14) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 28) (10, 3) (16, 2) (16, 24) (24, 1) (24, 8) (24, 5) (24, 16) (3, 20) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 9) (3, 19) (17, 3) (17, 23) (17, 11) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 19) (19, 29) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 23) (6, 18) (6, 11) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 6) (9, 7) (9, 27) (9, 3) (23, 12) (23, 17) (23, 19) (15, 21) (15, 2) (15, 8) (15, 22) (15, 13) (14, 7) (14, 5) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 15) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {10, 8}
Node 1: {25, 24}
Node 2: {4, 5, 16, 15}
Node 3: {20, 10, 17, 9, 19}
Node 4: {7, 12, 11, 2}
Node 5: {26, 2, 11, 24, 14}
Node 6: {18, 11}
Node 7: {4, 14, 9, 13}
Node 8: {0, 24, 15}
Node 9: {7, 27, 3}
Node 10: {0, 12, 28, 3}
Node 11: {4, 5, 17, 6}
Node 12: {4, 27, 10, 23}
Node 13: {7, 18, 15}
Node 14: {7, 5}
Node 15: {21, 2, 8, 22, 13}
Node 16: {2, 24}
Node 17: {3, 11, 23}
Node 18: {6, 13}
Node 19: {29, 3, 25, 23}
Node 20: {3}
Node 21: {28, 25, 15}
Node 22: {15}
Node 23: {12, 17, 19}
Node 24: {1, 8, 5, 16}
Node 25: {1, 21, 19}
Node 26: {28, 5}
Node 27: {12, 9}
Node 28: {21, 26, 10}
Node 29: {19}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Node 1 forms a 3-star: 1
Node 21 forms a 3-star: 1
Node 4 forms a 3-star: 4 choose 3 = 4
Node 7 forms a 3-star: 4 choose 3 = 4
Node 12 forms a 3-star: 4 choose 3 = 4
Node 15 forms a 3-star: 5 choose 3 = 10
Node 19 forms a 3-star: 4 choose 3 = 4
Node 25 forms a 3-star: 3 choose 3 = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25].

Unique 3-stars:

<4, 7, 12>

<15, 2, 8>
<19, 29, 25>
<19, 3, 25>
<19, 3, 23>
<19, 3, 17>
