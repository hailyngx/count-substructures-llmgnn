Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 14) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 7) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 13) 

Response:
Since the graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges, we need to analyze the neighbors for each node and then identify the 3-stars.

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 11}
- Node 4: {2, 8, 11}
- Node 5: {8, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {6, 10, 14}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {2, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 5, 7, 13}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:

- Node 6: <6, (1, 9, 11)>
- Node 8: <8, (4, 5, 10)>
- Node 11: <11, (2, 4, 13)>, <11, (3, 4, 12)>
- Node 12: <12, (8, 9, 11)> 

Since each of these nodes has 3 or more neighbors, we need to calculate the total number of 3-stars:

1 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 8) + 2 (from node 11) + 1 (from node 12) = 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
