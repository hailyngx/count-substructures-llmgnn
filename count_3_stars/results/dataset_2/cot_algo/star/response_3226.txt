Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 27) (1, 22) (21, 1) (21, 20) (21, 26) (21, 17) (2, 18) (29, 13) (29, 22) (0, 16) (0, 18) (27, 1) (27, 25) (27, 14) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 22) (13, 29) (13, 8) (13, 20) (13, 9) (10, 12) (10, 9) (17, 21) (17, 8) (17, 20) (17, 3) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 4) (18, 3) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 5) (20, 21) (20, 13) (20, 17) (20, 23) (20, 5) (16, 0) (16, 28) (16, 19) (16, 5) (28, 16) (28, 3) (28, 9) (28, 7) (11, 6) (23, 20) (23, 15) (14, 27) (14, 24) (26, 21) (26, 25) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 28) (3, 19) (3, 12) (19, 4) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 22) (19, 7) (22, 1) (22, 29) (22, 8) (22, 19) (22, 7) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 3) (25, 27) (25, 26) (25, 24) (15, 23) (24, 14) (24, 25) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 28) (7, 28) (7, 19) (7, 22) (5, 4) (5, 20) (5, 16) (6, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

1: {21, 27, 22}
2: {18}
3: {17, 18, 28, 19, 12}
4: {18, 12, 19, 5}
5: {4, 20, 16}
6: {11}
7: {28, 19, 22}
8: {13, 17, 22}
9: {13, 10, 28}
10: {12, 9}
11: {6}
12: {10, 4, 3}
13: {29, 8, 20, 9}
14: {27, 24}
15: {23}
16: {0, 18, 19, 5, 28}
17: {21, 8, 20, 3}
18: {2, 0, 4, 3}
19: {4, 16, 3, 22, 7}
20: {21, 13, 17, 23, 5}
21: {1, 20, 26, 17}
22: {1, 29, 8, 19, 7}
23: {20, 15}
24: {14, 25}
25: {27, 26, 24}
26: {21, 25}
27: {1, 25, 14}
28: {16, 3, 9, 7}
29: {13, 22}

Now let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the contributions, we get: 
1 (from node 1) + 10 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) + 1 (from node 12) + 4 (from node 13) + 10 (from node 16) + 4 (from node 17) + 4 (from node 18) + 10 (from node 19) + 10 (from node 20) + 4 (from node 21) + 10 (from node 22) + 4 (from node 28) = 74

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [74].
