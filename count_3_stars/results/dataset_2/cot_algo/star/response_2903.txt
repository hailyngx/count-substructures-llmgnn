Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 24) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 15) (16, 28) (16, 12) (16, 2) (3, 23) (3, 9) (15, 11) (15, 26) (4, 7) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 24) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 24) (9, 3) (9, 6) (1, 25) (21, 26) (21, 8) (21, 29) (22, 0) (22, 24) (22, 25) (23, 3) (23, 5) (23, 19) (2, 16) (2, 24) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 13) (0, 7) (0, 22) (0, 28) (28, 16) (28, 0) (28, 13) (25, 1) (25, 22) (25, 29) (27, 29) (27, 20) (10, 12) (17, 4) (17, 26) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 10) (12, 26) (24, 11) (24, 7) (24, 6) (24, 22) (24, 2) (5, 23) (5, 18) (5, 14) (19, 11) (19, 23) (19, 29) (19, 14) (26, 15) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 12) (26, 20) (29, 21) (29, 25) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 8) (8, 21) (8, 29) (8, 20) (14, 18) (14, 5) (14, 19) (20, 27) (20, 26) (20, 8) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 28) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 7, 22, 28      
Node 1: 25      
Node 2: 16, 24      
Node 3: 9, 23      
Node 4: 7, 17      
Node 5: 14, 18, 23      
Node 6: 7, 9, 24      
Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 24      
Node 8: 20, 21, 29      
Node 9: 3, 6      
Node 10: 12      
Node 11: 13, 15, 19      
Node 12: 10, 16, 18, 26      
Node 13: 11, 18, 28      
Node 14: 5, 18, 19      
Node 15: 11, 26      
Node 16: 2, 12, 28      
Node 17: 4, 26      
Node 18: 5, 12, 13, 14      
Node 19: 11, 14, 23, 29      
Node 20: 8, 26, 27      
Node 21: 8, 26, 29      
Node 22: 0, 24, 25      
Node 23: 3, 5, 19      
Node 24: 2, 6, 7, 22      
Node 25: 1, 22, 29      
Node 26: 12, 15, 17, 20, 21      
Node 27: 20, 29      
Node 28: 16, 13, 24      
Node 29: 8, 19, 25, 27      

Now, we will look for the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 0, 7, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 26, 28, 29

Calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)   
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)   
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)   
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)   
Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Total number of 3-stars: 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 22, 28)>
<7, (0, 4, 24)>
<7, (0, 6, 24)>
<7, (4, 6, 24)>

<12, (10, 16, 26)>
<12, (10, 18, 26)>

<13, (11, 18, 28)>
<14, (5, 18, 19)>
<18, (5, 12, 14)>
<18, (5, 13, 14)>
<18, (12, 13, 28)>
<18, (13, 14, 19)>
<19, (11, 23, 29)>
<19, (14, 23, 29)>
<26, (15, 20, 21)>
<26, (17, 20, 21)>

<29, (19, 25, 27)>
