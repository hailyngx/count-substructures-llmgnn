Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 12
Node 1: 0, 4, 7, 10
Node 2: 4, 12, 13
Node 3: 0, 4, 7
Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 14
Node 5: 0, 4, 12
Node 6: 0, 9, 10, 11
Node 7: 1, 3, 9
Node 8: 9, 11, 14
Node 9: 6, 7, 8, 13, 14
Node 10: 1, 4, 6, 11
Node 11: 6, 8, 10, 13, 14
Node 12: 0, 2, 5
Node 13: 2, 9, 11, 14
Node 14: 4, 8, 9, 11, 13

Next, let's determine the number of 3-star configurations for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 0: 1 (with nodes 1, 3, 5)
Node 4: 15 (with nodes 1, 2, 3), (nodes 1, 5, 10), (nodes 1, 10, 14), (nodes 1, 2, 14), (nodes 1, 2, 3), (nodes 1, 2, 10), (nodes 1, 2, 5), (nodes 1, 3, 10), (nodes 1, 3, 14), (nodes 1, 5, 14), (nodes 1, 5, 10), (nodes 3, 5, 10), (nodes 3, 5, 14), (nodes 10, 5, 14), (nodes 10, 5, 14)
Node 5: 1 (with nodes 0, 4, 12)
Node 9: 1 (with nodes 7, 13, 14)
Node 11: 1 (with nodes 6, 8, 14)
Node 13: 1 (with nodes 9, 11, 14)
Node 14: 1 (with nodes 8, 9, 11)

Adding these up gives a total of 21 3-stars, so the final answer is [21].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 10>
<1, 5, 10>
<1, 10, 14>
<2, 4, 12>
<3, 5, 10>
<3, 5, 14>
<4, 10, 14>
<6, 8, 11>
<7, 9, 13>
<8, 9, 14>
<9, 11, 14>
<0, 4, 12>
<9, 13, 14>
<11, 9, 14>
