Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 8}

Based on the neighbor sets, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors -> inom{5}{3} = 10 [10 3-stars]
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors -> Only 1 3-star can be formed with this node
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors -> inom{5}{3} = 10 [20 3-stars]
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors -> inom{5}{3} = 10 [10 3-stars]
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors -> inom{6}{3} = 20 [20 3-stars]
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors -> inom{4}{3} = 4 [4 3-stars]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 65. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 3)>
<1, (4, 9, 3)>
<1, (8, 9, 3)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
