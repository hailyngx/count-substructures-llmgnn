Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7}

Nodes 0, 6, and 9 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form 10 3-stars each. Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form 4 3-stars each. Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total 3-stars: 10 * 3 + 6 * 4 + 1 = 30 + 24 + 1 = 55

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [55].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
