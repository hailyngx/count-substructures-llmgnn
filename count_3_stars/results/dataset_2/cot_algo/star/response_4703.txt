Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 8
Node 1: 3, 5, 8
Node 2: 0, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 3: 1, 5, 6
Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 8
Node 6: 3, 4, 7, 8
Node 7: 2, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
Node 9: 2, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 46 \) 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [46].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
