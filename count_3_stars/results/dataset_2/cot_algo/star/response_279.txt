Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 19) (10, 5) (17, 12) (17, 4) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 16) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 11) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 11) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (8, 6) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 16) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 1) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 7) (16, 15) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 3) (3, 19) (3, 7) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 11) (15, 16) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 12) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 12, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 13, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 0, 13, 12, 11}
- Node 3: Neighbors {19, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {17, 18, 11, 15}
- Node 5: Neighbors {10, 13, 1}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9, 14, 16, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {15, 7, 0}
- Node 10: Neighbors {19, 5}
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 18, 2, 15}
- Node 12: Neighbors {17, 0, 2, 1}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 2, 1}
- Node 14: Neighbors {7, 16}
- Node 15: Neighbors {9, 4, 11, 16}
- Node 16: Neighbors {14, 19, 7, 15}
- Node 17: Neighbors {12, 4}
- Node 18: Neighbors {4, 11}
- Node 19: Neighbors {10, 3, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 39

So, the final answer, in brackets, is [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (9, 12, 2)>
- <2, (6, 0, 13)>
- <4, (17, 18, 11)>
- <5, (10, 13, 1)>
- <7, (9, 14, 16)>
- <9, (15, 7, 0)>
- <11, (4, 18, 2)>
- <12, (17, 0, 1)>
- <13, (5, 2, 1)>
- <15, (9, 11, 4)>
- <16, (14, 19, 7)>
- <19, (10, 3, 16)>
