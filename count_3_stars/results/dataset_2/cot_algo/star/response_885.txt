Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 15) (2, 10) (29, 22) (7, 21) (7, 1) (7, 9) (7, 13) (21, 16) (21, 7) (21, 3) (8, 11) (8, 15) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 1) (20, 25) (20, 4) (20, 23) (20, 10) (25, 20) (25, 17) (12, 27) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 23) (27, 12) (27, 19) (27, 6) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 26) (0, 19) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 4) (24, 26) (24, 28) (26, 0) (26, 24) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 17) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 1) (3, 21) (3, 19) (3, 22) (3, 18) (28, 0) (28, 24) (28, 9) (28, 22) (4, 11) (4, 20) (4, 14) (4, 9) (9, 7) (9, 28) (9, 4) (15, 16) (15, 8) (23, 20) (23, 12) (23, 10) (18, 14) (18, 3) (18, 5) (6, 12) (6, 27) (6, 10) (10, 2) (10, 20) (10, 23) (10, 6) (5, 18) (22, 29) (22, 3) (22, 28) (19, 27) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 3) 

Response:
First, let's go ahead and identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {12, 14, 19, 26, 28}
- Node 1: {7, 13, 17}
- Node 2: {10}
- Node 3: {18, 19, 21, 22}
- Node 4: {9, 11, 14, 20}
- Node 5: {18}
- Node 6: {10, 12, 27}
- Node 7: {1, 9, 13, 21}
- Node 8: {11, 15}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 28}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 20, 23}
- Node 11: {4, 8, 16}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 23, 27}
- Node 13: {1, 7, 17}
- Node 14: {0, 4, 18, 19, 28}
- Node 15: {8, 16}
- Node 16: {11, 15, 21}
- Node 17: {1, 13, 25}
- Node 18: {3, 5, 14}
- Node 19: {0, 3, 14, 27}
- Node 20: {4, 10, 23, 25}
- Node 21: {7, 16, 3}
- Node 22: {3, 28, 29}
- Node 23: {10, 12, 20}
- Node 24: {26, 28}
- Node 25: {20, 17}
- Node 26: {0, 24}
- Node 27: {12, 19}
- Node 28: {0, 9, 14, 22, 24}
- Node 29: {22}

Next, let's identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, Node 10, Node 14, Node 18, and Node 28 have 4 or more neighbors. 

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars from these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 43

Thus, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [43].
Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
- <0, 12, 19>
- <0, 12, 26>
- <0, 12, 28>
- <0, 14, 19>
- <0, 14, 28>
- <3, 18, 19>
- <3, 18, 21>
- <3, 19, 21>
- <7, 13, 17>
- <7, 13, 21>
- <10, 20, 23>
- <14, 18, 28>
- <18, 3, 19>
- <18, 3, 21>
- <18, 14, 19>
- <18, 14, 28>
- <19, 0, 14>
- <19, 0, 27>
- <19, 3, 21>
- <19, 14, 28>
- <28, 14, 22>
