Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 10) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 0) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 11) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {4, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 7}
- Node 3: {10}
- Node 4: {1, 8, 10}
- Node 5: {6, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 11: {1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {7, 9}
- Node 13: {6, 7, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 14: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 54

So, the total number of 3-stars is [54].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (6, 10, 11)>, <6, (5, 11, 13)>, <8, (1, 11, 14)>, <9, (8, 11, 14)>, <11, (6, 8, 13)>, <14, (6, 8, 9)>
