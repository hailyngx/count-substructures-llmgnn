Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 1) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 11) (2, 6) (2, 18) (2, 11) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 3) (5, 8) (5, 14) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 19) (15, 9) (15, 12) (4, 13) (4, 16) (12, 17) (12, 15) (12, 8) (19, 14) (19, 16) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 1) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (3, 18) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 9, 16}
- Node 2: {6, 11, 18}
- Node 3: {13, 18}
- Node 4: {13, 16}
- Node 5: {8, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {8, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 15, 16}
- Node 10: {7, 14, 17}
- Node 11: {2, 6, 17, 18}
- Node 12: {8, 15, 17}
- Node 13: {3, 6, 7, 4}
- Node 14: {0, 5, 10, 19}
- Node 15: {9, 12}
- Node 16: {1, 4, 9, 19}
- Node 17: {10, 11, 12, 18}
- Node 18: {2, 3, 11, 17}
- Node 19: {14, 16}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each node:
- Node 1, 9, and 18 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes:

  - Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 0, 16>
<9, 1, 16>
<18, 11, 17>
<18, 11, 2>
<18, 11, 3>
<18, 17, 12>
