Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 13) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {9, 10, 11, 8}
Node 1: {5, 7, 3, 13, 8}
Node 2: {7, 3}
Node 3: {1, 13, 2}
Node 4: {7, 12, 6}
Node 5: {9, 1, 11}
Node 6: {4, 12, 13}
Node 7: {4, 12, 11, 2, 1}
Node 8: {1, 12, 14, 0}
Node 9: {5, 14, 10, 13, 0}
Node 10: {9, 11, 0, 13}
Node 11: {7, 5, 10, 0}
Node 12: {4, 7, 14, 6, 8}
Node 13: {9, 1, 3, 10, 6, 14}
Node 14: {9, 12, 8, 13}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 77

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [77].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 9, 10, 11>
<1, 5, 8, 13>
<1, 7, 10, 13>
<1, 7, 11, 13>
<1, 7, 12, 13>
<1, 8, 12, 13>
<4, 7, 12, 13>
<7, 10, 11, 13>
<7, 10, 12, 13>
<7, 11, 12, 13>
<7, 11, 12, 14>
<7, 12, 13, 14>
