Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 1) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 13) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 13) (3, 14) (3, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 13) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {7, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 1: {8, 2, 13}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 5, 1, 13, 6}
- Node 3: {14, 5}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 5, 14, 11, 2}
- Node 5: {4, 3, 2}
- Node 6: {11, 12, 2}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {4, 9, 12, 1}
- Node 9: {8, 12, 14, 13}
- Node 10: {11, 0, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {4, 10, 0, 6}
- Node 12: {8, 6, 9}
- Node 13: {10, 0, 9, 2, 14, 1}
- Node 14: {4, 10, 9, 3, 13}

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 4, 8, 9, 13, and 14 have 4 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( C(6, 3) = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( C(6, 3) = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( C(6, 3) = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( C(5, 3) = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 82 \).

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [82].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 10, 13)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (7, 11, 2)>
<8, (9, 12, 1)>
<9, (8, 12, 14)>
<13, (0, 9, 10)>
<14, (9, 10, 13)>
