Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 17) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 18) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 17) (3, 9) (11, 4) (11, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 19) (10, 5) (10, 18) (10, 19) (15, 6) (15, 17) (15, 16) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 19) (14, 8) (14, 19) (17, 4) (17, 5) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 18) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (13, 4) (18, 6) (18, 10) (18, 17) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 7, 8, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 11, 12
Node 2: 1, 9
Node 3: 6, 9, 17
Node 4: 8, 11, 12, 13, 17
Node 5: 10, 17
Node 6: 3, 15, 18
Node 7: 0, 19
Node 8: 0, 4, 14
Node 9: 0, 2, 3
Node 10: 5, 18, 19
Node 11: 1, 4
Node 12: 1, 4, 16
Node 13: 4
Node 14: 8, 19
Node 15: 6, 16, 17
Node 16: 12, 15, 19
Node 17: 3, 4, 5, 15, 18
Node 18: 6, 10, 17
Node 19: 7, 10, 14, 16

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes listed above:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 32
So, the final answer is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (8, 11, 12)>
<8, (0, 14, 19)>
<12, (1, 4, 16)>
<15, (6, 16, 17)>
<16, (12, 15, 19)>
<17, (4, 5, 15)>
<19, (7, 10, 14)>
