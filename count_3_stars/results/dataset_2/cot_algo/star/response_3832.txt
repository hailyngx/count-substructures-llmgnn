Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 3) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 1) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 1) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 0) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 4) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can determine the 3-star graph in this network:

1. Node 0 has neighbors: {1, 3, 9, 11, 13}. 
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
    - Unique 3-stars: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 11>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 11>, <0, 3, 13>, <0, 9, 11>, <0, 9, 13>, <0, 11, 13>.

2. Node 2 has neighbors: {1, 3, 6, 13}. 
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
    - Unique 3-stars: <2, 1, 3>, <2, 1, 13>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 13>.

3. Node 4 has neighbors: {9, 10, 12, 14}. 
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
    - Unique 3-stars: <4, 9, 10>, <4, 9, 12>, <4, 9, 14>, <4, 10, 12>.
   
4. Node 6 has neighbors: {2, 3, 9, 14}. 
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
    - Unique 3-stars: <6, 2, 3>, <6, 2, 13>, <6, 3, 9>, <6, 3, 14>.

5. Node 8 has neighbors: {3, 7, 10, 11, 14}.
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
    - Unique 3-stars: <8, 3, 7>, <8, 3, 10>, <8, 3, 11>, <8, 3, 14>, <8, 7, 10>, <8, 7, 11>, <8, 7, 14>, <8, 10, 11>, <8, 10, 14>, <8, 11, 14>.

6. Node 10 has neighbors: {4, 5, 7, 8, 12}.
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
    - Unique 3-stars: <10, 4, 5>, <10, 4, 7>, <10, 4, 8>, <10, 4, 12>, <10, 5, 7>, <10, 5, 8>, <10, 5, 12>, <10, 7, 8>, <10, 7, 12>, <10, 8, 12>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 42.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42].
