Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {7, 9, 3, 8, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 6, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 6, 0, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 5, 1, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 1, 2, 0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 1, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 0, 6, 2, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7, 9, 1, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (7, 8, 5)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (7, 5, 3)>
- <3, (4, 6, 0)>
- <4, (7, 5, 1)>
