Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 6) (14, 3) (14, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {6, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 12, 14}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {10, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 8: {10, 11, 13}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 7, 12}
- Node 10: {5, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 3, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {2, 5, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 14: {3, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: Node 12 forms 4 3-stars
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: Node 7 forms 10 3-stars
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: None

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 14, so we put this final number inside brackets: [14].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<7, (0, 10, 12)>
<12, (0, 2, 9)>
<12, (0, 7, 11)>
<12, (2, 3, 9)>
<12, (2, 7, 11)>
<12, (3, 7, 9)>
<12, (7, 9, 11)>
<7, (1, 4, 10)>
<7, (1, 4, 12)>
<7, (4, 9, 10)>
<7, (4, 9, 12)>
<7, (9, 10, 13)>
<7, (9, 12, 13)>
<3, (1, 12, 14)>
