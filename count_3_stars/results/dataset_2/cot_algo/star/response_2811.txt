The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 24) (14, 15) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 9) (17, 19) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 23) (0, 9) (27, 25) (27, 5) (2, 18) (2, 23) (2, 24) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 29) (1, 12) (26, 8) (26, 4) (5, 27) (6, 7) (6, 22) (4, 18) (4, 26) (4, 8) (4, 25) (4, 29) (8, 26) (8, 4) (8, 24) (11, 28) (11, 22) (11, 25) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 13) (29, 0) (29, 18) (29, 4) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 20) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 9) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 22) (15, 13) (3, 10) (3, 21) (3, 12) (21, 3) (21, 24) (22, 6) (22, 11) (22, 15) (22, 20) (25, 27) (25, 4) (25, 11) (25, 19) (20, 16) (20, 22) (24, 14) (24, 0) (24, 2) (24, 8) (24, 21) (7, 6) (7, 28) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 10) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 23) (23, 0) (23, 2) (23, 12) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 25) (13, 28) (13, 10) (13, 15) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated as follows:

1. For each node, determine its neighbors:
- Node 0: {24, 29, 23, 9}
- Node 1: {12}
- Node 2: {18, 23, 24}
- Node 3: {10, 21, 12}
- Node 4: {18, 26, 8, 25, 29}
- Node 5: {27}
- Node 6: {7, 22}
- Node 7: {6, 28}
- Node 8: {26, 4, 24}
- Node 9: {17, 0, 10}
- Node 10: {15, 3, 13, 9}
- Node 11: {28, 22, 25}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 23}
- Node 13: {28, 10, 15}
- Node 14: {17, 24, 15, 16}
- Node 15: {14, 10, 22, 13}
- Node 16: {14, 19, 20}
- Node 17: {14, 9, 19}
- Node 18: {2, 4, 29}
- Node 19: {17, 16, 25}
- Node 20: {16, 22}
- Node 21: {3, 24}
- Node 22: {6, 11, 15, 20}
- Node 23: {0, 2, 12}
- Node 24: {0, 2, 8, 21, 14}
- Node 25: {27, 4, 11, 19}
- Node 26: {18, 4, 8}
- Node 27: {25, 5}
- Node 28: {11, 7, 13}
- Node 29: {0, 18, 4}

2. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 9, Node 10, Node 12, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19, Node 22, Node 24, Node 25, Node 26, Node 27, Node 28, Node 29

3. Calculate the number of 3-stars for each qualifying node:
- For each of the qualifying nodes above, apply \( \binom{n}{3} \):
    - Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 24 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 27 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
    - Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

4. Sum up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 51 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].
