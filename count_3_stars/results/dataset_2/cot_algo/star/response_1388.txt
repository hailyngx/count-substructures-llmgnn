Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 6) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (2, 11) (2, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 6) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 9) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: (4, 7, 13, 6)
- Node 1: (12, 5, 13, 9)
- Node 2: (11, 12)
- Node 3: (11, 4, 8, 14)
- Node 4: (8, 9, 0, 14, 3)
- Node 5: (10, 11, 13, 1)
- Node 6: (11, 13, 0, 14)
- Node 7: (8, 12, 0)
- Node 8: (4, 9, 14, 7, 3)
- Node 9: (11, 4, 8, 1)
- Node 10: (5, 11)
- Node 11: (10, 3, 9, 5, 2, 6)
- Node 12: (7, 2, 1)
- Node 13: (5, 1, 14, 0, 6)
- Node 14: (4, 8, 3, 13, 6)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the final answer is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <11, (3, 9, 5)>
- <11, (3, 9, 2)>
- <11, (3, 9, 6)>
- <11, (3, 1, 9)>
- <11, (3, 1, 5)>
- <11, (9, 4, 8)>
- <11, (9, 4, 13)>
- <11, (9, 4, 1)>
- <11, (5, 10, 13)>
- <11, (5, 13, 1)>
- <4, (8, 9, 14)>
- <8, (4, 9, 14)>
- <13, (1, 5, 14)>
- <14, (3, 8, 13)>
