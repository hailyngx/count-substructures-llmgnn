Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 6) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 16) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 15) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 18) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 18) (13, 12) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 19) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 18) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 0) (6, 12) (6, 14) (19, 2) (19, 3) (19, 13) (10, 7) (10, 1) (4, 13) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 18) (15, 14) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {16, 14}
- Node 1: {18, 12, 10}
- Node 2: {8, 16, 14, 19}
- Node 3: {5, 11, 19, 18}
- Node 4: {13}
- Node 5: {9, 17, 3}
- Node 6: {12, 14}
- Node 7: {16, 10, 8}
- Node 8: {9, 7, 2, 11}
- Node 9: {5, 8}
- Node 10: {7, 1}
- Node 11: {8, 3, 18}
- Node 12: {13, 1, 18, 6}
- Node 13: {12, 17, 19, 4}
- Node 14: {2, 0, 6, 15}
- Node 15: {14}
- Node 16: {7, 2, 0}
- Node 17: {5, 13, 18}
- Node 18: {12, 3, 11, 17, 1}
- Node 19: {2, 3, 13}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, and 19.

The number of 3-stars in this graph is [69].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (16, 14)>
- <1, (18, 12, 10)>
