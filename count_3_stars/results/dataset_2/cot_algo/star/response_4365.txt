Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 1) (3, 28) (3, 29) (3, 19) (15, 4) (28, 3) (28, 29) (28, 0) (29, 3) (29, 28) (29, 17) (17, 9) (17, 29) (24, 26) (24, 16) (24, 4) (24, 22) (26, 24) (26, 10) (26, 0) (6, 21) (6, 13) (21, 6) (21, 13) (21, 23) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 27) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 8) (25, 7) (25, 13) (25, 0) (25, 18) (25, 2) (4, 15) (4, 24) (4, 12) (4, 16) (12, 4) (12, 20) (12, 11) (22, 24) (22, 8) (10, 26) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 19) (11, 8) (16, 24) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 23) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 20) (13, 6) (13, 21) (13, 25) (13, 0) (0, 28) (0, 26) (0, 25) (0, 13) (0, 23) (20, 12) (20, 19) (27, 1) (18, 5) (18, 25) (2, 7) (2, 25) (2, 16) (2, 23) (23, 21) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 2) (14, 7) (14, 19) (8, 7) (8, 22) (8, 11) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {28, 26, 25, 13, 23}
- Node 1: {9, 11, 27}
- Node 2: {7, 25, 16, 23}
- Node 3: {28, 29, 19}
- Node 4: {15, 24, 12, 16}
- Node 5: {9, 18}
- Node 6: {21, 13}
- Node 7: {25, 14, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 22, 11}
- Node 9: {5, 17, 1}
- Node 10: {26}
- Node 11: {1, 12, 19, 8}
- Node 12: {4, 20, 11}
- Node 13: {6, 21, 25, 0}
- Node 14: {7, 19}
- Node 15: {4}
- Node 16: {24, 4, 2, 23}
- Node 17: {9, 29}
- Node 18: {5, 25}
- Node 19: {3, 11, 14, 20}
- Node 20: {12, 19}
- Node 21: {6, 13, 23}
- Node 22: {24, 8}
- Node 23: {21, 16, 0, 2}
- Node 24: {26, 16, 4, 22}
- Node 25: {7, 13, 0, 18, 2}
- Node 26: {24, 10, 0}
- Node 27: {1}
- Node 28: {3, 29, 0}
- Node 29: {3, 28, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29

Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{18}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} \)

Total number of 3-stars = \( 816 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 840

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [840].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<4, 16, 24>, <9, 17, 29>, <1, 9, 17>, <0, 13, 23>, <0, 25, 28>, <2, 23, 25>, <0, 23, 26>, <1, 11, 27>, <4, 12, 20>, <4, 12, 11>, <0, 13, 21>, <0, 13, 25>, <0, 13, 6>, <2, 16, 23>, <2, 16, 25>, <2, 16, 4>, <7, 8, 11>, <7, 8, 22>, <7, 8, 25>, <7, 2, 25>, <7, 2, 14>, <7, 2, 8>, <7, 14, 19>, <7, 14, 25>
