Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 2) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) 

Response:
After examining the provided edges, we can determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {11, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 7, 12}
- Node 2: {4, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 8, 12}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 11}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {2, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 12: {1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {2, 6, 11, 0}
- Node 14: {0, 6, 10}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 6: <5, 8, 11>, <5, 8, 13>, <5, 12, 6>, <5, 12, 9>, <5, 12, 10>, [inom{5}{3} = 10]
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 12: <1, 4, 12>, <1, 5, 12>, <1, 9, 12>, <1, 10, 12>, <2, 4, 12>, <2, 10, 12>, <4, 8, 12>, <5, 12, 9>, <5, 12, 10>, <9, 10, 12>, [inom{6}{3} = 20]

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars to get [4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 42].
