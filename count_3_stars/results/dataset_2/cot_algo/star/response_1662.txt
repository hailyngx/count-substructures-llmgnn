Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 11) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 17) (12, 13) (12, 7) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 15) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 16) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (15, 2) (15, 14) (15, 19) (17, 13) (17, 7) (17, 2) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 18) (4, 9) (4, 3) (18, 19) (18, 11) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 6) (16, 9) (16, 2) (16, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 18) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {14}
- Node 1: {6, 7, 14}
- Node 2: {8, 15, 16, 17}
- Node 3: {4, 6}
- Node 4: {3, 9}
- Node 5: {9, 10}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 12, 17, 19}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 8, 13, 19}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 16}
- Node 10: {5, 9}
- Node 11: {9, 11, 13, 18}
- Node 12: {7, 13}
- Node 13: {8, 11, 12, 13, 17}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 14, 15, 16}
- Node 15: {2, 14, 15, 19}
- Node 16: {2, 9, 14, 16}
- Node 17: {2, 7, 13, 17}
- Node 18: {11, 19}
- Node 19: {7, 8, 15, 18, 19}

Nodes with three or more neighbors that can form 3-stars: {9, 14, 16, 17, 19}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 16 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 48 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].

Unique 3-stars:

<9, (5, 10, 16)>, 
<9, (5, 9, 10)>,

<16, (9, 14, 16)>, 
<16, (9, 14, 16)>, 
<17, (2, 13, 17)>,
