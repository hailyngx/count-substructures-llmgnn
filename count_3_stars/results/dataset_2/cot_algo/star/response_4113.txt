Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (9, 10) (9, 16) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 11) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 16) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 11) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 13) (16, 9) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 12) (19, 18) (19, 12) (12, 16) (12, 19) (0, 3) (14, 10) (14, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 14) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 15) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 13, 16, 18}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {11, 17}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 8, 11}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 8, 13, 16}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {10, 16}
- Node 10: Neighbors {9, 14, 15, 17}
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 5, 15}
- Node 12: Neighbors {16, 19}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 7, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {10, 13}
- Node 15: Neighbors {10, 11, 18}
- Node 16: Neighbors {2, 7, 9, 12, 18}
- Node 17: Neighbors {4, 10}
- Node 18: Neighbors {2, 15, 16, 19}
- Node 19: Neighbors {12, 18}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
Node 1, Node 10, Node 13, and Node 16 have 5 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 34 \), so the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 7, 13)>, <1, (7, 13, 14)>, <1, (2, 6, 13)>, <1, (6, 7, 13)>, <1, (3, 7, 13)>, <1, (2, 3, 13)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (1, 13, 16)>, <1, (1, 13, 14)>, <10, (14, 15, 17)>, <10, (11, 15, 17)>, <10, (11, 14, 15)>, <10, (11, 14, 10)>, <13, (2, 7, 16)>, <13, (2, 7, 14)>, <13, (3, 14, 16)>, <13, (7, 14, 16)>, <13, (2, 14, 16)>, <13, (2, 3, 14)>, <16, (7, 12, 18)>, <16, (7, 12, 19)>, <16, (2, 7, 18)>, <16, (2, 7, 12)>, <16, (9, 12, 18)>, <16, (9, 12, 19)>, <16, (2, 9, 12)>, <16, (2, 12, 18)>, <16, (9, 16, 18)>, <16, (7, 9, 18)>, <16, (7, 16, 18)>, <16, (7, 9, 16)>, <16, (9, 13, 16)>, <16, (9, 2, 16)>
