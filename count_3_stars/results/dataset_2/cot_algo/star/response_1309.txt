Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 19) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (20, 25) (20, 18) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 15) (25, 12) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 26) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 24) (28, 21) (28, 13) (13, 25) (13, 28) (13, 26) (26, 21) (26, 13) (26, 24) (11, 3) (11, 24) (11, 19) (11, 12) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 22) (27, 18) (27, 5) (24, 3) (24, 26) (24, 11) (15, 25) (15, 16) (15, 10) (15, 2) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 10) (10, 15) (10, 16) (10, 2) (9, 29) (9, 23) (9, 12) (29, 27) (29, 9) (0, 16) (0, 22) (6, 21) (6, 23) (6, 8) (18, 20) (18, 27) (18, 19) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 18) (5, 27) (5, 8) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 5) (22, 27) (22, 16) (22, 0) (22, 12) (23, 9) (23, 6) (2, 7) (2, 15) (2, 10) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 9) (12, 22) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {16, 22}
- Node 1: {3, 4}
- Node 2: {7, 10, 15}
- Node 3: {1, 11, 24}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 19, 27}
- Node 5: {8, 27}
- Node 6: {8, 21, 23}
- Node 7: {2, 4}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 17}
- Node 9: {12, 23, 29}
- Node 10: {2, 15, 16}
- Node 11: {3, 12, 19, 24}
- Node 12: {9, 11, 22, 25}
- Node 13: {25, 26, 28}
- Node 14: {17}
- Node 15: {2, 10, 25}
- Node 16: {0, 10, 22}
- Node 17: {14, 19, 8}
- Node 18: {19, 20, 27}
- Node 19: {4, 11, 17, 18}
- Node 20: {18, 25}
- Node 21: {6, 26, 28}
- Node 22: {12, 16, 27}
- Node 23: {6, 9}
- Node 24: {3, 11, 26}
- Node 25: {12, 13, 15, 20}
- Node 26: {13, 21, 24}
- Node 27: {4, 5, 18, 22, 29}
- Node 28: {13, 21}
- Node 29: {9, 27}

Next, we identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (1, 7, 27)>
- <7, (2, 4, 27)>
- <12, (9, 22, 25)>
