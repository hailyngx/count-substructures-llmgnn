Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 10) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 13) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 3) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 3) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 1) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 3: {6, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 11}
- Node 5: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 12}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 8, 13}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 5, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 11: {3, 4, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 13: {7, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 8, 11, 13}

We can see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 8, and 9 have 5 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars around those nodes.
 
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 60\)
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 10>, <0, 1, 12>, <0, 1, 14>, <0, 2, 10>, <0, 8, 10>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 12>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 11, 14>, <4, 7, 8>
