Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 4) (13, 11) (22, 11) (22, 0) (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 23) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 19) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 26) (10, 11) (10, 23) (11, 13) (11, 22) (11, 10) (12, 27) (12, 8) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 14) (27, 19) (4, 13) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 12) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 26) (28, 29) (28, 26) (28, 25) (29, 28) (29, 20) (29, 16) (29, 14) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 17) (20, 9) (20, 29) (20, 15) (26, 3) (26, 8) (26, 28) (26, 16) (0, 22) (0, 8) (0, 16) (16, 29) (16, 26) (16, 0) (16, 2) (6, 4) (6, 25) (6, 18) (23, 9) (23, 10) (23, 7) (23, 24) (21, 25) (14, 3) (14, 27) (14, 29) (17, 15) (24, 23) (24, 7) (7, 23) (7, 24) (7, 18) (7, 2) (25, 28) (25, 6) (25, 21) (19, 1) (19, 12) (19, 27) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 7) (2, 16) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 
\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 48 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 19>, <1, 9, 5>, <1, 9, 23>, <3, 9, 1>, <3, 9, 14>, <3, 9, 26>, <9, 1, 5>, <9, 1, 23>, <9, 3, 1>, <9, 3, 23>, <9, 3, 14>, <9, 3, 26>, <11, 10, 22>, <11, 13, 22>, <11, 22, 10>, <11, 22, 13>, <11, 22, 10>, <12, 8, 27>, <14, 3, 9>, <14, 3, 27>, <14, 3, 29>, <15, 18, 20>, <16, 0, 2>, <16, 2, 7>, <16, 2, 0>, <16, 2, 7>, <16, 2, 0>, <16, 6, 25>, <16, 6, 28>, <16, 6, 29>, <19, 1, 12>, <19, 1, 27>, <19, 12, 1>, <19, 12, 27>, <19, 27, 1>, <19, 27, 12>, <20, 9, 15>, <20, 9, 29>, <20, 15, 9>, <20, 15, 29>, <20, 29, 9>, <20, 29, 15>, <23, 9, 10>, <23, 9, 24>, <23, 9, 27>, <25, 6, 28>, <25, 6, 29>, <25, 6, 18>, <25, 6, 28>, <25, 6, 29>.
