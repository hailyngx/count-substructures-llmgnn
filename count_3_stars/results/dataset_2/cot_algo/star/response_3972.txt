Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 

Response:
Let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 7, 8, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 4, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 3, 0, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 2, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 8, 1, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 8, 0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 3, 8, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9, 0, 3, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9, 4, 1, 0, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 4, 1, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 8, 6}
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 9, 0}
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 8, 1}

There are 3 unique 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [3] with the unique 3-stars being <4, (9, 8, 6)>, <8, (5, 9, 0)>, and <9, (5, 8, 1)>.
