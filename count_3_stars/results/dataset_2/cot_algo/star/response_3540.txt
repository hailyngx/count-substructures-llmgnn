Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 12) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 10) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 11) (14, 10) 

Response:
To begin, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

1: {11, 2}
2: {1, 4, 7, 0, 11}
3: {0, 12}
4: {9, 13, 2}
5: {9, 6, 8, 10, 7}
6: {5, 9, 8, 0}
7: {5, 12, 0, 11, 2}
8: {5, 6, 13, 10, 12}
9: {5, 6, 4, 10}
10: {5, 9, 8, 13, 0, 14}
11: {1, 7, 12, 2}
12: {3, 8, 7, 0, 11}
13: {8, 4, 10}
14: {10}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors => \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 54 

Therefore, the final answer is [54], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (6, 8, 10)>, <5, (6, 8, 7)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 10, 7)>, <5, (6, 10, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (8, 7, 9)>, <5, (8, 10, 7)>, <5, (8, 10, 9)>, <5, (7, 10, 9)>, <6, (8, 10, 7)>, <6, (8, 10, 9)>, <6, (8, 7, 9)>, <6, (10, 7, 9)>, <8, (10, 13, 12)>.
