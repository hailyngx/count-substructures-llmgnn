Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) 

Response:
Let's first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: {4, 8, 5}
Node 1: {3, 2, 12}
Node 2: {9, 1, 4, 7, 12}
Node 3: {9, 1}
Node 4: {6, 8, 12, 13, 0, 2}
Node 5: {10, 11, 8, 13, 0}
Node 6: {14, 8, 4, 13}
Node 7: {9, 11, 2}
Node 8: {6, 10, 4, 5, 0}
Node 9: {2, 14, 3, 7}
Node 10: {11, 12, 8, 5, 14}
Node 11: {10, 7, 13, 5}
Node 12: {1, 10, 4, 2}
Node 13: {6, 11, 4, 5}
Node 14: {6, 9, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes forming 3-stars: 6, 8, 4, 5, 10

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
\[
\binom{6}{3} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{10}{3} = 20 + 56 + 4 + 10 + 120 = 210
\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [210].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<6, (14, 8, 13)>
<8, (6, 4, 5)>
<4, (6, 12, 2)>
<5, (10, 11, 13)>
<10, (11, 12, 14)>
