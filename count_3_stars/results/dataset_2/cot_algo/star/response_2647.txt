Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we'll count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 46

So, the final answer is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 4, 7>
- <1, 3, 4, 8>
- <3, 4, 5, 6>
- <6, 0, 3, 5>
- <8, 1, 5, 6>
- <9, 2, 3, 4>
