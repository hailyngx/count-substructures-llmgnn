Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 19) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 19) (29, 28) (29, 16) (29, 13) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 23) (1, 8) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 6) (17, 15) (20, 21) (20, 22) (20, 24) (21, 20) (21, 25) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 14) (7, 25) (7, 18) (7, 26) (25, 17) (25, 21) (25, 7) (25, 22) (25, 14) (8, 1) (8, 15) (8, 27) (19, 9) (19, 28) (13, 29) (13, 27) (26, 5) (26, 7) (26, 23) (0, 10) (0, 22) (10, 1) (10, 0) (16, 9) (16, 28) (16, 29) (11, 24) (11, 18) (11, 4) (14, 15) (14, 25) (14, 22) (14, 2) (24, 20) (24, 11) (24, 6) (6, 17) (6, 24) (6, 2) (6, 23) (23, 1) (23, 26) (23, 6) (23, 12) (22, 20) (22, 25) (22, 0) (22, 14) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 23) (12, 4) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 27) (27, 8) (27, 13) (27, 18) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 29.

After analyzing the given edges and constructing the graph, we found the following information about the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: (10, 22)
- Node 1: (8, 10, 17, 23)
- Node 2: (4, 6, 14)
- Node 3: No neighbors
- Node 4: (2, 5, 11, 12)
- Node 5: (4, 9, 26)
- Node 6: (2, 6, 17, 23)
- Node 7: (18, 25, 26)
- Node 8: (1, 15, 27)
- Node 9: (5, 16, 19)
- Node 10: (0, 1)
- Node 11: (4, 18, 24)
- Node 12: (4, 23)
- Node 13: (27, 29)
- Node 14: (2, 14, 15, 22, 25)
- Node 15: (8, 14, 17)
- Node 16: (9, 28, 29)
- Node 17: (1, 6, 15, 25)
- Node 18: (7, 11, 18, 27)
- Node 19: (9, 28)
- Node 20: (21, 22, 24)
- Node 21: (20, 25)
- Node 22: (0, 14, 20, 25)
- Node 23: (1, 6, 12, 26)
- Node 24: (11, 20, 24)
- Node 25: (14, 17, 21, 22, 25)
- Node 26: (5, 7, 23, 26)
- Node 27: (8, 13, 18, 27)
- Node 28: (16, 19, 29)
- Node 29: (13, 16, 28)

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 14 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 = 20 \).

So, the final answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<14, (2, 14, 25)>
<25, (14, 17, 25)>
