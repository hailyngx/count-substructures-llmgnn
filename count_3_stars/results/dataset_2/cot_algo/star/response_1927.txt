Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 26) (15, 6) (27, 15) (27, 11) (27, 17) (27, 19) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 11) (29, 2) (29, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (3, 29) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 27) (11, 2) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 26) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 0) (12, 3) (18, 28) (6, 15) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 25) (28, 18) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 5) (28, 20) (9, 28) (9, 22) (9, 17) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 17) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 20) (7, 19) (16, 13) (16, 7) (16, 24) (16, 14) (17, 27) (17, 9) (17, 22) (17, 21) (25, 6) (24, 6) (24, 16) (24, 5) (4, 10) (4, 22) (4, 21) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 28) (5, 24) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 16) (14, 21) (20, 28) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 21) (26, 15) (26, 8) (26, 20) (21, 17) (21, 4) (21, 14) (21, 20) (19, 27) (19, 7) (0, 13) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node and then identify the 3-stars.

### Neighbor Set for Each Node:
- Node 1: {3, 5, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 11, 29}
- Node 3: {1, 12, 14, 29}
- Node 4: {10, 21, 22}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 8, 24, 28}
- Node 6: {15, 24, 25, 28}
- Node 7: {11, 16, 19, 20}
- Node 8: {5, 26}
- Node 9: {17, 22, 28}
- Node 10: {4, 11}
- Node 11: {2, 7, 10, 13, 27}
- Node 12: {3}
- Node 13: {0, 11, 16}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 16, 21}
- Node 15: {6, 26, 27}
- Node 16: {7, 13, 14, 24}
- Node 17: {9, 21, 22, 27}
- Node 18: {6, 28}
- Node 19: {7, 27}
- Node 20: {7, 21, 26, 28}
- Node 21: {4, 14, 17, 20}
- Node 22: {4, 9, 17}
- Node 24: {5, 6, 16}
- Node 25: {6}
- Node 26: {8, 15, 20}
- Node 27: {11, 15, 17, 19}
- Node 28: {5, 6, 9, 18, 20}
- Node 29: {2, 3}

### 3-Stars:
- Node 1: [<1, (3, 5, 14)>]
- Node 2: [<2, (3, 5, 29)>]
- Node 3: [<3, (1, 14, 29)>]
- Node 5: [<5, (1, 2, 28)>, <5, (8, 24, 28)>]
- Node 6: [<6, (24, 25, 28)>]
- Node 7: [<7, (16, 19, 20)>]
- Node 11: [<11, (7, 13, 16)>, <11, (10, 27, 15)>]
- Node 14: [<14, (1, 3, 16)>]
- Node 16: [<16, (7, 13, 14)>, <16, (14, 21, 17)>]
- Node 21: [<21, (4, 14, 17)>]
- Node 22: [<22, (4, 9, 17)>]
- Node 24: [<24, (5, 6, 16)>]
- Node 26: [<26, (8, 15, 20)>]
- Node 28: [<28, (5, 6, 20)>]

Total number of 3-stars: [15]
