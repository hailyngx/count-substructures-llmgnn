Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 2) (6, 13) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {10, 7, 2, 8}
Node 1: {2, 12, 8}
Node 2: {0, 9, 12, 1}
Node 3: {5, 10, 4, 7, 6}
Node 4: {11, 13, 14, 3}
Node 5: {9, 11, 3, 7}
Node 6: {13, 3}
Node 7: {5, 9, 12, 0, 3}
Node 8: {13, 0, 1}
Node 9: {5, 2, 11, 14, 7}
Node 10: {11, 0, 12, 3}
Node 11: {5, 9, 10, 12, 4}
Node 12: {10, 11, 7, 2, 14, 1}
Node 13: {8, 4, 6}
Node 14: {9, 4, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 68 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

Unique 3-stars found:
<6, 13, 3>
<11, 5, 7>
<4, 13, 8>
<1, 12, 2>
<5, 7, 3>
<4, 13, 6>
<2, 12, 1>
<9, 5, 11>
<2, 12, 14>
<0, 7, 10>
