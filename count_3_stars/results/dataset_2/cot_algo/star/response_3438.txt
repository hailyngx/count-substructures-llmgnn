Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 3) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 19) (15, 19) (15, 7) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 8) (5, 14) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 14) (4, 8) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (7, 15) (7, 18) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 10) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 2) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 12) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 6) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 19) (13, 3) (13, 19) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0:  5, 12, 16
- Node 1:  6, 10, 12, 17
- Node 2:  5, 8, 10, 18
- Node 3:  13, 16, 19
- Node 4:  8
- Node 5:  0, 2, 10, 14
- Node 6:  1, 11, 19
- Node 7:  15, 18
- Node 8:  2, 4, 12, 14, 17
- Node 9:  14
- Node 10:  1, 2, 5
- Node 11:  6, 14, 16, 18
- Node 12:  0, 1, 8
- Node 13:  3, 19
- Node 14:  5, 8, 9, 11, 17
- Node 15:  7, 19
- Node 16:  0, 3, 11
- Node 17:  1, 8, 14
- Node 18:  2, 7, 11
- Node 19:  3, 6, 13, 15

Node 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 17 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of them:

- \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star possible around Node 0
- \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars possible around Node 1
- \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars possible around Node 2
- \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars possible around Node 5
- \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars possible around Node 8
- \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star possible around Node 10
- \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars possible around Node 12
- \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars possible around Node 14
- \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars possible around Node 17

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 5, 12>
- <1, 6, 10>
- <1, 10, 12>
- <1, 10, 17>
- <1, 12, 17>
- <2, 5, 10>
- <2, 5, 14>
- <2, 8, 17>
- <2, 10, 14>
- <5, 8, 14>
- <5, 10, 14>
- <8, 12, 14>
- <8, 14, 17>
- <10, 12, 17>
- <14, 17, 18>
- <14, 17, 9>
- <14, 17, 8>
- <14, 17, 1>
- <14, 17, 5>
- <17, 8, 4>
