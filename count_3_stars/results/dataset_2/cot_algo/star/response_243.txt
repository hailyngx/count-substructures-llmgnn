Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 11) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (4, 19) (4, 6) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 7) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 3) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 15) (3, 5) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 17) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 12) (2, 12) (2, 16) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (19, 4) (19, 13) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 13) (13, 19) (13, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 14, 10, 15}
- Node 2: {12, 16}
- Node 3: {5, 18, 7, 12}
- Node 4: {6, 19}
- Node 5: {3, 7}
- Node 6: {4, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 8, 3}
- Node 8: {16, 15, 7}
- Node 9: {11, 7, 0}
- Node 10: {17, 0, 6, 12}
- Node 11: {9, 17}
- Node 12: {10, 3, 6, 2}
- Node 13: {19, 15}
- Node 14: {17, 0, 6}
- Node 15: {8, 18, 0, 13}
- Node 16: {17, 8, 2}
- Node 17: {14, 10, 16, 18, 11}
- Node 18: {17, 15, 3}
- Node 19: {4, 13}

Now, we will apply the combinatorial calculation to nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
    - <0, (9, 10, 15)>
    - <0, (9, 10, 14)>
    - <0, (9, 14, 15)>
    - <0, (10, 14, 15)>
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
    - <3, (5, 7, 12)>
    - <3, (7, 12, 18)>
    - <3, (5, 7, 18)>
    - <3, (7, 12, 10)>
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
    - <6, (4, 10, 12)>
    - <6, (4, 10, 14)>
    - <6, (4, 12, 14)>
    - <6, (10, 12, 14)>
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
    - <7, (5, 9, 3)>
    - <7, (5, 9, 8)>
    - <7, (3, 8, 12)>
    - <7, (5, 3, 12)>
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
    - <12, (10, 6, 3)>
    - <12, (10, 6, 2)>
    - <12, (10, 3, 2)>
    - <12, (6, 3, 2)>
- Node 15: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
    - <15, (8, 18, 0)>
    - <15, (8, 18, 13)>
    - <15, (8, 0, 13)>
    - <15, (18, 0, 13)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph gives us [24].
