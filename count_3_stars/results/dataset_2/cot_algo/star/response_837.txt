Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 15) (9, 17) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 12) (1, 17) (1, 22) (1, 18) (21, 11) (13, 26) (13, 22) (13, 29) (13, 0) (22, 1) (22, 13) (22, 17) (22, 7) (22, 25) (10, 26) (10, 11) (10, 15) (11, 21) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 27) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 25) (4, 20) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 29) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 25) (5, 28) (6, 5) (6, 3) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 20) (20, 4) (20, 8) (20, 15) (20, 14) (18, 1) (18, 4) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 22) (17, 27) (19, 7) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 0) (3, 6) (3, 28) (3, 27) (28, 5) (28, 3) (28, 24) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (12, 26) (12, 0) (12, 2) (24, 11) (24, 28) (24, 7) (27, 11) (27, 17) (27, 3) (27, 29) (27, 23) (29, 13) (29, 8) (29, 27) (14, 20) (14, 23) (7, 22) (7, 19) (7, 24) (25, 22) (25, 4) (25, 5) (23, 27) (23, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {12, 13, 16}
- Node 1: {17, 18, 22}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 12}
- Node 3: {6, 27, 28}
- Node 4: {2, 8, 18, 20, 25}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 25, 28}
- Node 6: {3, 5}
- Node 7: {19, 22, 24}
- Node 8: {4, 20, 29}
- Node 9: {15, 17}
- Node 10: {11, 15, 26}
- Node 11: {10, 21, 24, 27}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 26}
- Node 13: {0, 22, 26, 29}
- Node 14: {20, 23}
- Node 15: {9, 10, 20}
- Node 16: {0}
- Node 17: {1, 9, 22, 27}
- Node 18: {1, 4}
- Node 19: {7}
- Node 20: {4, 8, 14, 15}
- Node 21: {11}
- Node 22: {1, 7, 17, 25}
- Node 23: {14, 27}
- Node 24: {7, 11, 28}
- Node 25: {4, 5, 22}
- Node 26: {10, 12, 13}
- Node 27: {3, 11, 17, 23, 29}
- Node 28: {3, 5, 24}
- Node 29: {13, 27, 8}

Node 0 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {12, 13, 16}. This forms the 3-star <0, (12, 13, 16)>.
Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {17, 18, 22}. This forms the 3-star <1, (17, 18, 22)>.
Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {2, 18, 25}. This forms the 3-star <4, (2, 18, 25)>.
Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {20, 29}. This forms the 3-star <8, (20, 29)>.
Node 13 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {22, 26, 29}. This forms the 3-star <13, (22, 26, 29)>.
Node 17 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {22, 27}. This forms the 3-star <17, (22, 27)>.
Node 20 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {4, 15}. This forms the 3-star <20, (4, 15)>.
Node 27 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {17, 23, 29}. This forms the 3-star <27, (17, 23, 29)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
