Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5}
Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 7}
Node 2: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 3: Neighbors {0, 8, 9}
Node 4: Neighbors {1, 6, 7, 8}
Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 8, 9}
Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 9}
Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 4}
Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
Node 9: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<(3, (0, 8, 9)>
<(4, (1, 6, 7)>
<(5, (2, 8, 9)>
<(6, (2, 4, 9)>
<(7, (1, 2, 4)>
<(8, (0, 5, 9)>
