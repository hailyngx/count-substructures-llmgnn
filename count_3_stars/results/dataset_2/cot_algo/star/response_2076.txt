Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {4, 2, 5, 9}
Node 1: {3, 5, 9, 7}
Node 2: {3, 4, 6, 0}
Node 3: {1, 7, 6, 2}
Node 4: {8, 2, 9, 0}
Node 5: {1, 8, 7, 0}
Node 6: {3, 8, 7, 2}
Node 7: {1, 3, 6, 5}
Node 8: {4, 9, 5, 6}
Node 9: {1, 4, 8, 0}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 2, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars per node
For nodes with 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star per node

Total number of 3-stars:
\( 8 \times 4 + 2 \times 1 = 33 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 2, 5)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 9, 5)>, <1, (3, 7, 5)>, <1, (3, 9, 7)>, <1, (9, 4, 5)>, <1, (9, 8, 5)>, <4, (2, 8, 6)>, <4, (8, 6, 9)>, <4, (8, 6, 0)>, <5, (1, 8, 7)>, <5, (8, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 8, 7)>, <6, (8, 7, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (3, 6, 2)>, <8, (4, 9, 0)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>.
