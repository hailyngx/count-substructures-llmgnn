Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (14, 4) (17, 1) (17, 6) (10, 0) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 18) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 15) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 6) (0, 10) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 13) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 13) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 13) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 15) (6, 19) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {10, 16, 3, 13}
- Node 1: {5, 17, 12, 15, 18}
- Node 2: {13, 3}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 0, 2}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 19, 14}
- Node 5: {9, 1, 3}
- Node 6: {17, 11, 15, 19}
- Node 7: {4, 12}
- Node 8: {4, 18, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 18, 12}
- Node 10: {0}
- Node 11: {6}
- Node 12: {9, 7, 16, 1}
- Node 13: {2, 15, 0, 16, 18}
- Node 14: {4}
- Node 15: {1, 6, 13}
- Node 16: {12, 0, 13}
- Node 17: {1, 6}
- Node 18: {9, 8, 1, 13}
- Node 19: {4, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: <1, (5, 12, 18)>
- Node 3: <3, (5, 0, 13)>
- Node 6: <6, (17, 15, 19)>

Counting them up gives us a total of [3] 3-stars in this graph.
