Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 4) (14, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 13) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 6) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {8, 10, 12, 6}
- Node 1: {5, 10, 12, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 3: {2, 9, 10}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 7, 12}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 12}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 3, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 11: {2, 5, 7, 10}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 13: {7, 9, 10}
- Node 14: {4, 5}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 9, 10} <2, (3, 9, 10)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 7, 14} <4, (6, 7, 14)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 10, 11} <7, (9, 10, 11)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 10, 13} <9, (7, 10, 13)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 11, 13} <10, (9, 11, 13)>

There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
