Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 19) (14, 15) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 8) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 1) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 1) (5, 17) (5, 18) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 16) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 11) (1, 13) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 12) (16, 18) (16, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 15) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 9) (9, 0) (9, 19) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 3) (13, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 11, 13, 17, 18}
- Node 2: {1, 10}
- Node 3: {7, 13}
- Node 4: {8, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 17, 18}
- Node 6: {7, 10, 16}
- Node 7: {3, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 11, 12, 17}
- Node 9: {0, 19}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 17}
- Node 11: {1, 4, 8, 19}
- Node 12: {4, 8, 15}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 15, 19}
- Node 14: {15, 19}
- Node 15: {12, 13, 14}
- Node 16: {6, 18}
- Node 17: {1, 5, 8, 10}
- Node 18: {1, 5, 16}
- Node 19: {9, 11, 13, 14}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 33, which can be represented as [33].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (5, 11, 13)>
- <5, (0, 17, 18)>
- <8, (4, 11, 12)>
- <10, (2, 6, 17)>
- <11, (1, 4, 19)>
- <13, (1, 15, 19)>
- <15, (12, 13, 14)>
- <17, (1, 8, 10)>
- <19, (9, 11, 13)>
