Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 10) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 11) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 12) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 12) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated as follows:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors.

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors for each node:
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding all the combinations together: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 71 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [71].
