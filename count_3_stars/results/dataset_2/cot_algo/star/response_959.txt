Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 8) (16, 19) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 13) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 8) (27, 5) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 9) (23, 22) (23, 28) (23, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 24) (4, 8) (4, 21) (8, 16) (8, 27) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 28) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 18) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 19) (14, 0) (14, 27) (17, 26) (17, 2) (29, 7) (29, 28) (29, 5) (26, 22) (26, 17) (26, 18) (9, 22) (9, 23) (9, 7) (9, 24) (9, 3) (28, 23) (28, 8) (28, 29) (6, 11) (6, 21) (21, 4) (21, 6) (21, 3) (21, 25) (18, 0) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 26) (18, 13) (3, 9) (3, 21) (3, 19) (25, 21) (19, 16) (19, 12) (19, 3) (15, 20) (2, 17) (5, 27) (5, 12) (5, 29) (1, 10) (20, 15) (20, 24) (24, 10) (24, 9) (24, 20) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 13, 14, 18, 27}
- Node 1: {10}
- Node 2: {17}
- Node 3: {9, 19, 21}
- Node 4: {8, 21}
- Node 5: {7, 12, 27, 29}
- Node 6: {11, 21}
- Node 7: {0, 9, 12, 18, 29}
- Node 8: {4, 10, 16, 27, 28}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 22, 23, 24}
- Node 10: {1, 8, 11, 24}
- Node 11: {6, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {7, 19, 5}
- Node 13: {0, 11, 18}
- Node 14: {0}
- Node 15: {20}
- Node 16: {8, 19}
- Node 17: {2, 26}
- Node 18: {0, 13, 26, 27, 7}
- Node 19: {3, 12, 16}
- Node 20: {15, 24}
- Node 21: {3, 4, 6, 25}
- Node 22: {9, 23, 26}
- Node 23: {9, 22, 28}
- Node 24: {10, 20, 9}
- Node 25: {21}
- Node 26: {17, 18}
- Node 27: {0, 8, 14, 18, 5}
- Node 28: {8, 23, 29}
- Node 29: {5, 7, 28}

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 1 (Node 1)
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 9 (Nodes 0, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 18, 21, 27)

Now we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \sum \left(\binom{n}{3}\right) = \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 59 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [59]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (7, 13, 27)>
- <3, (9, 19, 21)>
- <7, (0, 18, 27)>
- <8, (10, 16, 28)>
- <9, (7, 22, 23)>
- <10, (8, 11, 24)>
- <18, (7, 26, 27)>
- <21, (4, 6, 25)>
- <27, (0, 18, 28)>
