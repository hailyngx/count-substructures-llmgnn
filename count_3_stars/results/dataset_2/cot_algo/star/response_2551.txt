Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 18) (15, 2) (15, 16) (6, 17) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 13) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 8) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 11) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 10) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 11) (4, 2) (12, 4) (12, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 12) (18, 15) (18, 0) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 7) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (16, 15) (16, 14) (16, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 13) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 3

We can see that nodes 2, 4, 5, 8, 11 have 4 or more neighbors so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of. 

Calculating with the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].

Listing the unique 3-stars:

- <2, 4, 11>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <2, 5, 11>
- <2, 8, 11>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 11>
- <4, 8, 11>
- <5, 8, 11>
- <8, 11, 15>
- <8, 11, 16>
