Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 4) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 15) (14, 17) (14, 7) (17, 11) (17, 14) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (18, 5) (18, 2) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 6) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 1) (19, 2) (19, 10) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 12) (10, 5) (10, 19) (10, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 8) (15, 11) (15, 9) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 10) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first need to identify the neighbors for each of the 20 nodes:

1. Node 0: Neighbors [1]
2. Node 1: Neighbors [0, 8, 16]
3. Node 2: Neighbors [13, 18, 19]
4. Node 3: Neighbors [5, 6, 8]
5. Node 4: Neighbors [10, 11, 16]
6. Node 5: Neighbors [3, 9, 10, 18]
7. Node 6: Neighbors [3, 7, 9]
8. Node 7: Neighbors [6, 12, 14, 16]
9. Node 8: Neighbors [1, 3, 9]
10. Node 9: Neighbors [5, 6, 8, 15]
11. Node 10: Neighbors [4, 5, 19]
12. Node 11: Neighbors [4, 13, 15, 16, 17]
13. Node 12: Neighbors [7, 13]
14. Node 13: Neighbors [2, 11, 12, 16]
15. Node 14: Neighbors [7, 17]
16. Node 15: Neighbors [9, 11]
17. Node 16: Neighbors [1, 4, 7, 11, 13]
18. Node 17: Neighbors [11, 14]
19. Node 18: Neighbors [2, 5]
20. Node 19: Neighbors [2, 10]

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in this graph. We see that nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, and 19. 

For these nodes, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to count the number of 3-stars centered at each node. We sum up these counts to get the total number of 3-stars.

Calculating:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [41].

List of unique 3-stars:

<4, (10, 16, 11)>
<5, (3, 9, 10)>
<6, (3, 9, 8)>
<7, (12, 14, 7)>
<8, (1, 9, 3)>
<9, (5, 10, 18)>
<10, (4, 16, 11)>
<11, (13, 15, 16)>
<13, (12, 7, 16)>
<16, (1, 13, 11)>
