Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 16) (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 0) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 18) (5, 3) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 19) (2, 9) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 6) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 2) (13, 17) (13, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 9) (18, 8) (16, 15) (16, 17) (16, 12) (7, 15) (7, 14) (7, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 12) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 1
- Node 19: degree 4

For constructing the 3-stars, we check nodes with degree 3 or more:
1. Node 0: [4 choose 3] = 4
2. Node 1: [3 choose 3] = 1
3. Node 3: [4 choose 3] = 4
4. Node 4: [4 choose 3] = 4
5. Node 6: [3 choose 3] = 1
6. Node 8: [3 choose 3] = 1
7. Node 9: [4 choose 3] = 4
8. Node 10: [3 choose 3] = 1
9. Node 12: [3 choose 3] = 1
10. Node 15: [4 choose 3] = 4
11. Node 16: [4 choose 3] = 4
12. Node 17: [4 choose 3] = 4
13. Node 19: [4 choose 3] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [31].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 11, 17)>
<1, (6, 8, 17)>
<3, (5, 6, 19)>
<4, (0, 12, 19)>
<6, (1, 3, 0)>
<8, (4, 1, 18)>
<9, (2, 10, 12)>
<10, (15, 9, 11)>
<12, (9, 4, 16)>
<15, (7, 10, 16)>
<16, (12, 15, 17)>
<17, (0, 1, 13)>
<19, (2, 3, 4)>
