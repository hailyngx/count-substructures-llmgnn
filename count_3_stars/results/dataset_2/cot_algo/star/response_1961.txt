Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 15) (5, 17) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (4, 16) (4, 14) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 6) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 19) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 15) (19, 18) (0, 13) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 2) (2, 16) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 14) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 7) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 12) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 7) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 12) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 13
Node 1: 2, 8, 9, 15
Node 2: 1, 10, 13, 16
Node 3: 7, 12
Node 4: 14, 16
Node 5: 7, 14, 17
Node 6: 7, 8, 18
Node 7: 3, 5, 6, 13
Node 8: 1, 6, 10
Node 9: 1, 11, 17
Node 10: 2, 8, 12
Node 11: 9, 16, 17
Node 12: 3, 10, 14, 17
Node 13: 0, 2, 7
Node 14: 4, 5, 12
Node 15: 1, 16, 19
Node 16: 2, 4, 11, 15
Node 17: 5, 9, 11, 12
Node 18: 6, 19
Node 19: 15, 18

Now, we can see which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- For nodes with 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding all the possible 3-stars together:
4(4) + 7(1) = 16 + 7 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 8, 15)>, <2, (1, 10, 16)>, <5, (7, 14, 17)>, <7, (5, 6, 13)>, <8, (1, 6, 10)>, <10, (2, 8, 12)>, <11, (9, 16, 17)>, <12, (3, 14, 17)>, <13, (0, 7, 2)>, <16, (2, 4, 15)>, <17, (5, 9, 11)>.
