Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
- Node 0, 1, 6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28

Calculating the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Number of 3-stars for each of these nodes = \( \binom{n}{3} \)

Calculations:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 43
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [43].
