Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, we will identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 8}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

There are a total of \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 48 \) 3-stars in the graph. Thus, the final answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <6, 7, 8>.
