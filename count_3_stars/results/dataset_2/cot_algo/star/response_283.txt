Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in terms of its adjacency list:

Node 0: 4, 14, 2
Node 1: 4, 6
Node 2: 7, 13, 0
Node 3: 5, 7, 13, 14, 11
Node 4: 9, 12, 0, 10, 1
Node 5: 6, 8, 3
Node 6: 5, 7, 1, 14, 10
Node 7: 11, 3, 6, 2, 13
Node 8: 5, 9, 14
Node 9: 8, 4, 10
Node 10: 9, 4, 6, 14
Node 11: 7, 14, 3, 12
Node 12: 4, 13, 0, 11
Node 13: 7, 12, 2, 3
Node 14: 8, 6, 0, 11, 3, 10

Now, let's identify the sets of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 14, 2}
- Node 1: {4, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 13}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 13, 14, 11}
- Node 4: {9, 12, 0, 10, 1}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 1, 14, 10}
- Node 7: {11, 3, 6, 2, 13}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 14}
- Node 9: {8, 4, 10}
- Node 10: {9, 4, 6, 14}
- Node 11: {7, 14, 3, 12}
- Node 12: {4, 13, 0, 11}
- Node 13: {7, 12, 2, 3}
- Node 14: {8, 6, 0, 11, 3, 10}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14
In total, we have \( 8 \times \binom{3}{3} = 8 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 14, 2)>, <1, (4, 6, 5)>, <2, (0, 7, 13)>, <8, (5, 9, 14)>, <9, (8, 4, 10)>, <12, (4, 13, 0)>, <13, (7, 12, 2)>, <14, (8, 6, 11)>.
