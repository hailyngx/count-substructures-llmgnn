Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 2) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 5) (7, 21) (7, 23) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 26) (21, 11) (21, 2) (22, 23) (22, 19) (23, 7) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 27) (10, 9) (11, 21) (8, 23) (8, 0) (1, 7) (1, 26) (1, 9) (1, 12) (26, 21) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 28) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 5) (29, 24) (19, 22) (19, 26) (19, 24) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 16) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 4) (28, 20) (20, 17) (20, 28) (20, 12) (20, 24) (16, 0) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 15) (4, 23) (4, 28) (4, 12) (12, 1) (12, 20) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (2, 14) (2, 21) (2, 6) (5, 17) (5, 29) (5, 16) (5, 12) (3, 12) (3, 6) (27, 23) (27, 29) (27, 13) (6, 2) (6, 3) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 24) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 18) (13, 27) (18, 16) (18, 15) (24, 29) (24, 19) (24, 20) (24, 9) 

Response:
Calculating the number of nodes by counting the number of unique node numbers in the given edges, we find that all nodes are present from 0 to 29.

    Node Set: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

We will now list the neighborhood sets for each node:

1. Node 0: {8, 14, 16}
2. Node 1: {7, 9, 12, 26}
3. Node 2: {6, 14, 21}
4. Node 3: {6, 12}
5. Node 4: {12, 23, 28}
6. Node 5: {12, 16, 17, 29}
7. Node 6: {2, 3}
8. Node 7: {1, 21, 23}
9. Node 8: {0, 23}
10. Node 9: {1, 10, 15, 24}
11. Node 10: {9}
12. Node 11: {21}
13. Node 12: {1, 3, 4, 5}
14. Node 13: {27}
15. Node 14: {0, 2}
16. Node 15: {9, 16, 18}
17. Node 16: {0, 5, 15, 18, 28}
18. Node 17: {5, 20, 29}
19. Node 18: {16, 15}
20. Node 19: {22, 24, 26}
21. Node 20: {17, 24, 28}
22. Node 21: {2, 7, 11, 26}
23. Node 22: {19, 23}
24. Node 23: {4, 7, 8, 22, 27}
25. Node 24: {9, 19, 20, 29}
26. Node 26: {1, 19, 21, 28}
27. Node 27: {13, 23, 29}
28. Node 28: {4, 16, 20, 26}
29. Node 29: {17, 24, 27}

Now, we will identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the number of 3-stars:

1. Node 0: [(1)]
2. Node 1: [(1)]
3. Node 2: [(1)]
4. Node 3: Not enough neighbors.
5. Node 4: [(3)]
6. Node 5: [(1)]
7. Node 6: Not enough neighbors.
8. Node 7: [(1)]
9. Node 8: Not enough neighbors.
10. Node 9: [(1)]
11. Node 10: Not enough neighbors.
12. Node 11: Not enough neighbors.
13. Node 12: [(1)]
14. Node 13: Not enough neighbors.
15. Node 14: Not enough neighbors.
16. Node 15: Not enough neighbors.
17. Node 16: [(1)]
18. Node 17: [(1)]
19. Node 18: Not enough neighbors.
20. Node 19: [(1)]
21. Node 20: [(1)]
22. Node 21: [(1)]
23. Node 22: Not enough neighbors.
24. Node 23: [(3)]
25. Node 24: [(1)]
26. Node 26: [(1)]
27. Node 27: [(1)]
28. Node 28: [(1)]
29. Node 29: [(1)]

Total number of 3-stars: [15]
