Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's analyze the neighbors of each node to identify the 3-stars formed.

1. Node 14 has neighbors: 17, 3, 1, 15. (4 neighbors)
2. Node 17 has neighbors: 14, 29, 13, 22, 26. (5 neighbors)
3. Node 3 has neighbor 14. (1 neighbor)
4. Node 25 has neighbors: 21, 18. (2 neighbors)
5. Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 27, 2. (3 neighbors)
6. Node 21 has neighbors: 25, 18. (2 neighbors)
7. Node 0 has neighbors: 7, 27, 10, 23. (4 neighbors)
8. Node 27 has neighbors: 7, 0, 12, 6. (4 neighbors)
9. Node 12 has neighbors: 27, 4, 5. (3 neighbors)
10. Node 2 has neighbors: 7, 18, 5. (3 neighbors)
11. Node 18 has neighbors: 21, 2, 23, 1. (4 neighbors)
12. Node 5 has neighbors: 12, 2, 6, 16. (4 neighbors)
13. Node 6 has neighbors: 27, 5, 28, 8. (4 neighbors)
14. Node 29 has neighbors: 17, 15, 4, 10. (4 neighbors)
15. Node 26 has neighbors: 17, 11, 8, 24. (4 neighbors)
16. Node 28 has neighbors: 6, 9, 1. (3 neighbors)
17. Node 24 has neighbors: 26, 11, 4, 23. (4 neighbors)
18. Node 11 has neighbors: 26, 24, 4. (3 neighbors)
19. Node 16 has neighbors: 5, 13. (2 neighbors)
20. Node 8 has neighbors: 6, 26. (2 neighbors)
21. Node 9 has neighbors: 28, 20. (2 neighbors)
22. Node 13 has neighbors: 17, 16. (2 neighbors)
23. Node 4 has neighbors: 12, 29, 24, 11. (4 neighbors)
24. Node 1 has neighbors: 14, 18, 28, 15. (4 neighbors)
25. Node 15 has neighbors: 14, 29, 1, 22. (4 neighbors)
26. Node 10 has neighbors: 0, 29. (2 neighbors)
27. Node 23 has neighbors: 0, 18, 24. (3 neighbors)
28. Node 20 has neighbors: 9, 22. (2 neighbors)
29. Node 22 has neighbors: 17, 15, 20. (3 neighbors)

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 14, 17, 29, and 1 have 4 neighbors each, thus a 3-star is formed with each of them. 
- Node 23 and 24 have 4 neighbors each, thus 3-stars are formed for both.
- Other nodes do not have 3-star formations due to having less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <14, 17, 29, 13>
2. <14, 17, 29, 4>
3. <14, 17, 29, 1>
4. <14, 17, 1, 15>
5. <14, 17, 29, 15>
6. <23, 0, 18, 24>
