Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 6) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 6) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 13) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) 

Response:
This graph is a bit complex with several edges, so let's start by finding the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Node 1: {10, 11}
Node 2: {0, 6, 12}
Node 3: {0, 6, 7, 13}
Node 4: {0, 5, 10, 11, 12}
Node 5: {0, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14}
Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}
Node 7: {0, 3, 5, 12}
Node 8: {6, 10, 13}
Node 9: {5, 14}
Node 10: {1, 4, 8, 11, 12}
Node 11: {1, 4, 5, 10}
Node 12: {2, 4, 7, 10}
Node 13: {3, 6, 8, 14}
Node 14: {5, 9, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 5: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing these up: 20 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 78

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [78], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 10, 12>
<3, 6, 13>
<4, 5, 10>
<4, 5, 11>
<4, 5, 12>
<5, 9, 14>
<10, 11, 1>
<10, 12, 2>
