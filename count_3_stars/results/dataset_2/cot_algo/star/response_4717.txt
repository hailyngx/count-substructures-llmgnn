Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 9, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 4, 7, 2}
- Node 2: {7, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 2}
- Node 4: {9, 6, 7, 1, 8}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 1, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {6, 4, 8, 1, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {6, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 0}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 3-stars: [1] - <0, 5, 7>
- Node 1, 3-stars: [1] - <1, 5, 7>
- Node 4, 3-stars: [2] - <4, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 9>
- Node 5, 3-stars: [1] - <5, 6, 9>
- Node 6, 3-stars: [2] - <6, 4, 8>, <6, 7, 5>
- Node 7, 3-stars: [1] - <7, 4, 8>

Total number of 3-stars: [8].
