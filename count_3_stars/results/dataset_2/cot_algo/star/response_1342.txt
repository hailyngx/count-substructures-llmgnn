Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 15) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 17) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 16) (13, 7) (13, 4) (1, 14) (1, 19) (15, 12) (15, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 3) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 3) (19, 6) (0, 12) (0, 15) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 6) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 11) (6, 19) (6, 11) (6, 17) (17, 2) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 5) (16, 17) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 19) (3, 10) (4, 5) (4, 13) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the neighbors for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: (12, 15, 10)
- Node 1: (14, 19)
- Node 2: (8, 5, 17)
- Node 3: (8, 9, 18, 19, 10)
- Node 4: (5, 13)
- Node 5: (2, 4, 17, 16)
- Node 6: (19, 11, 17)
- Node 7: (9, 13, 8)
- Node 8: (2, 3, 7)
- Node 9: (7, 3)
- Node 10: (0, 3)
- Node 11: (12, 14, 6)
- Node 12: (0, 11, 15)
- Node 13: (7, 4)
- Node 14: (1, 11, 18)
- Node 15: (12, 0)
- Node 16: (5, 17)
- Node 17: (2, 5, 18, 6, 16)
- Node 18: (3, 17, 19, 6, 14)
- Node 19: (1, 18, 3, 6)

Considering only the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, we can find the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 3 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 17 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 18 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 19 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 39 3-stars, so the final answer is [39].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (8, 18, 19)>, <3, (8, 18, 6)>, <3, (8, 17, 18)>, <3, (8, 17, 3)>, <5, (2, 4, 16)>, <5, (2, 4, 17)>, <5, (2, 5, 17)>, <5, (2, 5, 16)>, <6, (11, 14, 18)>, <6, (11, 14, 6)>, <6, (11, 18, 19)>, <6, (11, 18, 6)>, <6, (14, 18, 19)>, <6, (14, 18, 6)>, <6, (17, 18, 6)>, <6, (17, 18, 19)>, <17, (5, 16, 17)>, <17, (5, 16, 6)>, <17, (5, 17, 18)>, <17, (5, 17, 6)>
