Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 11) (22, 0) (22, 25) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 12) (26, 10) (26, 11) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 24) (7, 21) (7, 19) (7, 5) (21, 7) (21, 10) (0, 13) (0, 22) (0, 27) (0, 11) (27, 0) (27, 14) (3, 25) (3, 8) (25, 22) (25, 3) (25, 12) (8, 3) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 18) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 17) (4, 22) (4, 8) (4, 23) (28, 6) (28, 18) (28, 20) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 10) (15, 10) (15, 2) (10, 26) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 15) (20, 28) (20, 29) (20, 12) (29, 20) (18, 8) (18, 28) (18, 19) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 24) (24, 6) (24, 19) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 0) (11, 8) (2, 15) (2, 5) (2, 14) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 17) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 14) (17, 23) (17, 5) (17, 16) (12, 9) (12, 25) (12, 20) (14, 27) (14, 2) (14, 16) 

Response:
First, we will identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {13, 22, 27, 11}
- Node 1: {9, 5, 16, 10}
- Node 2: {15, 5, 14}
- Node 3: {25, 8}
- Node 4: {22, 8, 23}
- Node 5: {7, 1, 2, 17}
- Node 6: {9, 28, 24}
- Node 7: {21, 19, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 23, 11, 18}
- Node 9: {6, 1, 12}
- Node 10: {26, 21, 1, 15}
- Node 11: {22, 26, 0, 8}
- Node 12: {9, 25, 20}
- Node 13: {0, 22}
- Node 14: {27, 2, 16}
- Node 15: {10, 2}
- Node 16: {1, 14, 17}
- Node 17: {5, 16, 23}
- Node 18: {8, 28, 19}
- Node 19: {7, 18, 24}
- Node 20: {28, 29, 12}
- Node 21: {7, 10}
- Node 22: {13, 22, 4, 11, 0, 25}
- Node 23: {8, 4, 17}
- Node 24: {6, 19}
- Node 25: {3, 12, 22}
- Node 26: {10, 11}
- Node 27: {0, 14}
- Node 28: {6, 18, 20}
- Node 29: {20}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 7: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 10: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 13: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 14: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 15: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 16: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 17: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 18: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 19: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 20: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 21: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 22: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 23: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 24: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 25: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 26: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 27: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 28: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
- Node 29: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 49

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [49].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 4, 11>, <0, 4, 22>, <0, 11, 22>, <0, 11, 27>, <0, 22, 25>, <1, 5, 16>, <1, 5, 17>, <1, 5, 10>, <1, 9, 12>, <4, 8, 23>, <4, 8, 11>, <4, 23, 17>, <5, 7, 1>, <5, 7, 19>, <5, 17, 16>, <5, 1, 10>, <8, 18, 28>, <8, 18, 19>, <8, 11, 22>, <8, 11, 26>, <8, 23, 17>, <8, 23, 4>, <10, 21, 1>, <10, 15, 2>, <11, 22, 26>, <11, 22, 0>, <18, 19, 24>
