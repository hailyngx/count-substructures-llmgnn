Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 11, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {6, 10, 8}
- Node 2: {10, 13, 7, 5}
- Node 3: {6, 9, 13, 0, 14}
- Node 4: {11, 8, 5, 14}
- Node 5: {8, 4, 14, 2}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 14, 3, 0, 13}
- Node 7: {10, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {13, 4, 5, 12, 1}
- Node 9: {6, 10, 13, 3}
- Node 10: {9, 11, 7, 1, 2}
- Node 11: {10, 0, 4}
- Node 12: {8}
- Node 13: {6, 9, 8, 2, 3}
- Node 14: {6, 4, 3, 5}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 6: <6, (9, 1, 14)>, <6, (9, 3, 13)>, <6, (1, 14, 3)>, <6, (1, 14, 13)>, <6, (3, 13, 0)>, <6, (3, 13, 14)>, <6, (0, 14, 3)>, <6, (0, 14, 13)>, <6, (3, 0, 13)>, <6, (3, 0, 14)>
- Node 8: <8, (13, 4, 5)>, <8, (13, 5, 2)>, <8, (13, 2, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 14)>, <8, (5, 14, 2)>
- Node 13: <13, (6, 9, 3)>, <13, (6, 9, 8)>, <13, (6, 2, 5)>, <13, (9, 3, 8)>, <13, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 14: <14, (6, 4, 5)>, <14, (6, 3, 5)>, <14, (4, 3, 5)>

Counting up these combinations, we find a total of 23 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [23].
