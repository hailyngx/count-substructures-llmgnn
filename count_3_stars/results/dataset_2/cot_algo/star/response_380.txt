Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (17, 7) (17, 19) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 8) (19, 17) (19, 18) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 15) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 11) (11, 18) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 6) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 16) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 6) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (6, 16) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first analyze the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 13, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 6, 9, 16}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 12, 16}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8, 9, 15}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 13, 16}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 17}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 9, 14, 15}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 8, 13, 15}
- Node 11: Neighbors {18}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 3, 4}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 6, 8, 9, 16}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 3, 8}
- Node 15: Neighbors {5, 8, 15, 16, 18}
- Node 16: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 13, 15}
- Node 17: Neighbors {7, 19}
- Node 18: Neighbors {11, 15, 19}
- Node 19: Neighbors {17, 18}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars <2, (1, 9, 16)>, <2, (6, 9, 16)>, <2, (6, 13, 16)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 3: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars <3, (1, 12, 14)>, <3, (7, 12, 14)>, <3, (1, 3, 12)>, <3, (3, 14, 12)>
- Node 4: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 6: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars <6, (2, 13, 16)>, <6, (2, 4, 16)>, <6, (2, 4, 13)>, <6, (4, 13, 16)>
- Node 8: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars <8, (0, 9, 14)>, <8, (13, 14, 0)>, <8, (9, 15, 8)>, <8, (15, 18, 8)>
- Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars <9, (2, 8, 13)>, <9, (2, 15, 8)>, <9, (13, 0, 8)>, <9, (13, 16, 8)>
- Node 13: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars <13, (0, 6, 8)>, <13, (6, 16, 13)>, <13, (8, 9, 13)>, <13, (9, 15, 13)>, <13, (0, 9, 13)>, <13, (0, 16, 13)>, <13, (6, 8, 13)>, <13, (8, 16, 13)>, <13, (6, 9, 13)>, <13, (8, 15, 13)>
- Node 15: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars <15, (5, 8, 9)>, <15, (5, 8, 18)>, <15, (5, 16, 18)>, <15, (5, 16, 15)>, <15, (8, 15, 16)>, <15, (8, 18, 15)>, <15, (8, 16, 15)>, <15, (18, 16, 15)>, <15, (18, 16, 15)>, <15, (16, 18, 15)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 47

Therefore, the final answer, represented in brackets [], is [47].
