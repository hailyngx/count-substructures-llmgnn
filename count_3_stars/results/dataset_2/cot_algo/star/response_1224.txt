Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 9
Node 2 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
Node 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 6
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 8, 9
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 6
Node 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 2
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 2, 4, 9
Node 9 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 0: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: 35 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 77

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [77].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
