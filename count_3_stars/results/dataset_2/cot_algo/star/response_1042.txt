Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {3, 5, 6, 7}

Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 8}

Node 2: {1, 7, 9}

Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 7}

Node 4: {3, 5, 7, 9}

Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}

Node 6: {0, 8, 9}

Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Node 8: {1, 5, 6, 9}

Node 9: {2, 4, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]

Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]

Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]

Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]

Node 4: <4, (3, 5, 7)>, [inom{4}{3}] = [4]

Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]

Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]

Node 7: <7, (0, 4, 5)>, [inom{5}{3}] = [10]

Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]

Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]

Summing up all the 3-stars, we have [4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [42].

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42].
