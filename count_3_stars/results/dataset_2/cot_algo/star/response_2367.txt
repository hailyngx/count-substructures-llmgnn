Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges provided, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: {10, 11, 18, 22}
- Node 1 has neighbors: {2, 7, 27}
- Node 2 has neighbors: {1, 12, 16}
- Node 3 has neighbors: {5, 10, 13, 26, 29}
- Node 4 has neighbors: {6, 13, 14, 24}
- Node 5 has neighbors: {3, 13, 28}
- Node 6 has neighbors: {4}
- Node 7 has neighbors: {1, 13, 17}
- Node 8 has neighbors: {12, 19, 22}
- Node 9 has neighbors: {11, 13}
- Node 10 has neighbors: {0, 3, 13}
- Node 11 has neighbors: {0, 9, 23}
- Node 12 has neighbors: {2, 8, 18, 19, 26}
- Node 13 has neighbors: {3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 14 has neighbors: {4}
- Node 15 has neighbors: {20, 24, 29}
- Node 16 has neighbors: {2, 16, 17, 22, 26}
- Node 17 has neighbors: {7, 16, 20}
- Node 18 has neighbors: {0, 12}
- Node 19 has neighbors: {8, 12, 21}
- Node 20 has neighbors: {15, 17, 29}
- Node 21 has neighbors: {19}
- Node 22 has neighbors: {0, 8, 16, 22, 25}
- Node 23 has neighbors: {11, 24}
- Node 24 has neighbors: {4, 15, 23, 28}
- Node 25 has neighbors: {22, 25, 28}
- Node 26 has neighbors: {3, 12, 16, 25}
- Node 27 has neighbors: {1}
- Node 28 has neighbors: {5, 24, 25}
- Node 29 has neighbors: {3, 15, 20}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed from the graph:

Node 3 has 5 neighbors, thus it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 6 neighbors, thus it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 16 has 5 neighbors, thus it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 24 has 4 neighbors, thus it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 29 has 3 neighbors, thus it can form 1 3-star.
  
Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 45 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [45].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (5, 13, 10)>, <13, (3, 4, 10)>, <24, (4, 28, 15)>.
