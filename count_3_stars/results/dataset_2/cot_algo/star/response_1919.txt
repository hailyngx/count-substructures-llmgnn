Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 6) (22, 7) (15, 27) (15, 7) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 23) (27, 16) (5, 20) (5, 6) (5, 24) (20, 5) (20, 10) (18, 22) (18, 14) (18, 21) (0, 24) (0, 25) (7, 22) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 28) (12, 9) (6, 22) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 17) (1, 26) (1, 17) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 17) (24, 5) (24, 0) (24, 28) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 26) (2, 15) (2, 25) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 23) (4, 3) (10, 20) (10, 29) (23, 27) (23, 26) (23, 4) (23, 28) (16, 27) (16, 12) (16, 29) (16, 3) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 4) (9, 14) (29, 10) (29, 16) (29, 21) (3, 4) (3, 16) (3, 14) (11, 19) (11, 25) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 21) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 3) (28, 12) (28, 24) (28, 23) (21, 18) (21, 29) (21, 19) (25, 0) (25, 2) (25, 11) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first identify the neighbor sets for each node in the graph:

- Node 0: {24, 25}
- Node 1: {17, 26}
- Node 2: {15, 25}
- Node 3: {4, 14, 16}
- Node 4: {3, 9, 12, 23}
- Node 5: {6, 20, 24}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 17, 22}
- Node 7: {6, 12, 15, 19, 22}
- Node 9: {4, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {20, 29}
- Node 11: {19, 25}
- Node 12: {4, 7, 9, 16, 28}
- Node 13: {9, 22}
- Node 14: {3, 9, 18}
- Node 15: {2, 7, 27}
- Node 16: {3, 12, 27, 29}
- Node 17: {1, 6, 26}
- Node 18: {14, 21, 22}
- Node 19: {7, 11, 21}
- Node 20: {5, 10}
- Node 21: {18, 19, 29}
- Node 22: {6, 7, 13, 18}
- Node 23: {4, 26, 27, 28}
- Node 24: {0, 5, 28}
- Node 25: {0, 2, 11}
- Node 26: {1, 17, 23}
- Node 27: {15, 23, 16}
- Node 28: {12, 23, 24}
- Node 29: {10, 16, 21}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 6: <6, (5, 7, 17)>
- Node 7: <7, (6, 12, 15)>
- Node 12: <12, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 16: <16, (3, 12, 27)>
- Node 17: <17, (1, 6, 26)>
- Node 18: <18, (14, 21, 22)>
- Node 19: <19, (7, 11, 21)>
- Node 22: <22, (6, 7, 13)>
- Node 23: <23, (4, 26, 27)>
- Node 24: <24, (0, 5, 28)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 9, and the answer is [9].
