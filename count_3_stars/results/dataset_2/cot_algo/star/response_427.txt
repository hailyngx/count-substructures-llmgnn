Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 16) (17, 14) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 22) (25, 3) (25, 0) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 16) (22, 3) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 12) (7, 16) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 5) (21, 13) (21, 24) (0, 25) (0, 20) (0, 4) (0, 8) (20, 7) (20, 0) (20, 13) (20, 9) (20, 24) (5, 7) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 23) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 15) (26, 28) (26, 15) (26, 29) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 9) (15, 8) (15, 26) (15, 23) (16, 14) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 19) (13, 21) (13, 20) (11, 18) (11, 23) (11, 1) (11, 29) (23, 6) (23, 15) (23, 11) (23, 10) (9, 20) (9, 28) (9, 29) (29, 26) (29, 11) (29, 9) (4, 0) (4, 24) (12, 22) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 10) (19, 2) (19, 16) (19, 27) (27, 22) (27, 19) (10, 8) (10, 23) (10, 1) (10, 24) (24, 21) (24, 20) (24, 4) (24, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {25, 20, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 11, 10}
- Node 2: {18, 8, 19}
- Node 3: {25, 28, 22}
- Node 4: {0, 24}
- Node 5: {7, 1}
- Node 6: {7, 23}
- Node 7: {16, 20, 6, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 15, 10}
- Node 9: {20, 28, 29}
- Node 10: {8, 23, 1, 24}
- Node 11: {18, 1, 23, 29}
- Node 12: {22}
- Node 13: {21, 20}
- Node 14: {17, 16}
- Node 15: {8, 26, 23}
- Node 16: {14, 18, 7, 19}
- Node 17: {14}
- Node 18: {22, 2, 16, 11}
- Node 19: {2, 16, 27}
- Node 20: {7, 0, 13, 9, 24}
- Node 21: {13, 24}
- Node 22: {3, 18, 27, 12}
- Node 23: {6, 15, 11, 10}
- Node 24: {21, 20, 4, 10}
- Node 25: {3, 0}
- Node 26: {28, 15, 29}
- Node 27: {22, 19}
- Node 28: {3, 26, 9}
- Node 29: {26, 11, 9}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
Nodes with 3 neighbors or more: 0, 3, 7, 8, 11, 16, 20, 23, 24, 26, 29

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( \sum \binom{n}{3} = \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 55\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (25, 20, 8)>
<3, (25, 28, 22)>
<7, (16, 20, 6)>
<8, (2, 15, 10)>
<11, (1, 23, 29)>
<16, (18, 7, 19)>
<20, (0, 13, 24)>
<23, (15, 11, 10)>
<24, (21, 4, 10)>
<26, (28, 29, 15)>
