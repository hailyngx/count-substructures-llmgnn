Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 23) (18, 22) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 17) (22, 29) (22, 8) (7, 18) (5, 18) (5, 24) (5, 28) (24, 5) (24, 10) (24, 25) (21, 27) (21, 29) (26, 22) (26, 2) (26, 11) (26, 16) (26, 27) (4, 13) (4, 6) (17, 22) (17, 0) (25, 24) (25, 9) (0, 3) (0, 17) (10, 24) (10, 13) (10, 23) (8, 18) (8, 22) (8, 28) (28, 5) (28, 8) (19, 15) (19, 2) (9, 25) (9, 1) (9, 27) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 11) (2, 20) (23, 15) (23, 10) (23, 29) (23, 16) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 29) (6, 16) (29, 3) (29, 22) (29, 21) (29, 23) (29, 6) (27, 21) (27, 26) (27, 9) (27, 1) (13, 4) (13, 10) (1, 9) (1, 27) (16, 3) (16, 26) (16, 23) (16, 6) (16, 20) (20, 2) (20, 16) (20, 14) (20, 11) (14, 20) (11, 26) (11, 2) (11, 20) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 17}
- Node 1: {9, 27}
- Node 2: {19, 11, 20, 26}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 15, 16, 29}
- Node 4: {6, 13}
- Node 5: {8, 18, 24, 28}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 16, 29}
- Node 7: {18}
- Node 8: {5, 18, 22, 28}
- Node 9: {1, 25, 27}
- Node 10: {13, 23, 24}
- Node 11: {2, 20, 26}
- Node 13: {4, 10}
- Node 14: {20}
- Node 15: {3, 19, 23}
- Node 16: {3, 6, 20, 23, 26}
- Node 17: {0, 22}
- Node 18: {5, 7, 8, 22}
- Node 19: {15, 2}
- Node 20: {2, 11, 14, 16}
- Node 21: {27, 29}
- Node 22: {8, 17, 18, 26, 29}
- Node 23: {10, 15, 16, 29}
- Node 24: {5, 10, 25}
- Node 25: {9, 24}
- Node 26: {2, 11, 16, 22, 27}
- Node 27: {1, 9, 21, 26}
- Node 28: {5, 8}
- Node 29: {3, 6, 21, 22, 23}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49].

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <3, 15, 16>
- <3, 15, 23>
- <3, 15, 29>
- <3, 16, 22>
- <3, 16, 26>
- <3, 16, 29>
- <3, 22, 29>
- <3, 26, 27>
- <15, 16, 23>
- <15, 16, 29>
- <16, 22, 26>
- <16, 22, 27>
- <3, 15, 16, 26>
- <3, 15, 23, 29>
- <3, 22, 26, 27>
- <3, 16, 22, 26>
- <15, 16, 23, 29>
- <16, 22, 26, 27>
