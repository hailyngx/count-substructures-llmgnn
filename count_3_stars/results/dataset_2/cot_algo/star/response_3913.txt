Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 3}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9 have 6 neighbors each.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [46], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>
