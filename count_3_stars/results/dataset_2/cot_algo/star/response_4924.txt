Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 24) (26, 21) (5, 13) (5, 19) (3, 27) (3, 2) (15, 20) (15, 23) (15, 0) (15, 13) (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 10) (22, 20) (22, 7) (22, 21) (23, 15) (23, 8) (23, 13) (23, 19) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 7) (20, 15) (20, 22) (20, 2) (20, 28) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 7) (6, 10) (28, 20) (28, 6) (28, 12) (21, 26) (21, 22) (21, 18) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 23) (13, 12) (1, 11) (1, 29) (17, 0) (17, 27) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 23) (19, 4) (7, 22) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 25) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 24) (27, 3) (27, 17) (27, 25) (27, 2) (4, 16) (4, 19) (12, 28) (12, 13) (24, 9) (24, 6) (24, 25) (24, 14) (24, 29) (10, 16) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 2) (18, 9) (18, 21) (29, 1) (29, 24) (0, 15) (0, 17) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 20) (2, 27) (2, 10) (14, 24) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {15, 17}
- Node 1: {11, 29}
- Node 2: {3, 10, 11, 20, 27}
- Node 3: {2, 27}
- Node 4: {16, 19}
- Node 5: {13, 19}
- Node 6: {7, 10, 24, 28}
- Node 7: {6, 8, 22, 25}
- Node 8: {7, 10, 23}
- Node 9: {18, 24}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 8, 16}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 16}
- Node 12: {13, 28}
- Node 13: {5, 12, 15, 19, 23}
- Node 14: {24}
- Node 15: {0, 13, 20, 23}
- Node 16: {4, 10, 11, 19}
- Node 17: {0, 27}
- Node 18: {9, 21}
- Node 19: {4, 5, 13, 16, 23}
- Node 20: {2, 15, 22, 28}
- Node 21: {18, 22, 26}
- Node 22: {7, 20, 21}
- Node 23: {8, 13, 15, 19}
- Node 24: {6, 9, 14, 24, 29}
- Node 25: {7, 24, 27}
- Node 26: {21}
- Node 27: {2, 3, 17, 25}
- Node 28: {6, 12, 20}
- Node 29: {1, 24}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {11, 20, 27}.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {10, 24, 28}.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {8, 22, 25}.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {10, 23, 7}.
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with neighbors {15, 19, 23}.
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 13, 20}.
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 10, 19}.
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 13, 16}.
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 15, 22}.
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 20, 21}.
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with neighbors {13, 15, 19}.
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 9, 29}.
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 17, 25}.

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find there are 13 in total. 
Therefore, the final number to put inside brackets is [13].
