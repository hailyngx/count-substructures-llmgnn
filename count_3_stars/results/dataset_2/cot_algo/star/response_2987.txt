Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 2, 7}
- Node 1: {9, 3, 8, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 0, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 6}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 8, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 8, 4}
- Node 6: {5, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 8, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {5, 1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 1, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: No 3-stars (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: No 3-stars (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: No 3-stars (has only 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 33

Therefore, the final answer is [33], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (9, 4, 2)>, 
<1, (9, 3, 8)>, 
<4, (5, 9, 8)>, 
<5, (9, 6, 8)>, 
<5, (9, 2, 8)>, 
<5, (6, 8, 4)>, 
<5, (2, 8, 7)>, 
<5, (2, 8, 0)>, 
<5, (6, 2, 8)>, 
<5, (6, 4, 8)>, 
<6, (5, 3, 8)>, 
<7, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<7, (1, 8, 2)>, 
<7, (3, 8, 2)>, 
<7, (3, 8, 0)>, 
<7, (8, 2, 0)>, 
<8, (5, 1, 4)>, 
<8, (5, 1, 7)>, 
<8, (1, 4, 7)>, 
<8, (6, 7, 5)>.
