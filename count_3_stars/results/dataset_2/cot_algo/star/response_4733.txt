Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 14) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, the neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {10, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 13, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 12}
- Node 5: {2, 11, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 3, 13}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {9, 13, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 11, 7, 8}
- Node 10: {8, 11, 0, 12}
- Node 11: {9, 5, 1, 10}
- Node 12: {8, 4, 10, 0, 14}
- Node 13: {6, 3, 8, 14, 7}
- Node 14: {1, 13, 7, 12, 2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 68

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars formed is [68], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (1, 5, 13)>, <6, (9, 7, 3)>, <7, (4, 13, 14)>, <8, (9, 13, 14)>, <9, (2, 11, 7)>, <12, (0, 10, 14)>, <13, (6, 3, 14)>, <14, (1, 7, 12)>
