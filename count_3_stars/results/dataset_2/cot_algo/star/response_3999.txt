Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (10, 3) (11, 14) (11, 21) (11, 2) (8, 23) (8, 16) (23, 8) (23, 5) (23, 19) (0, 17) (20, 13) (20, 27) (20, 9) (5, 7) (5, 23) (5, 13) (6, 29) (6, 22) (1, 25) (1, 16) (1, 28) (1, 18) (17, 0) (17, 19) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 12) (28, 1) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 24) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 21) (3, 14) (21, 11) (21, 3) (21, 16) (21, 27) (18, 1) (18, 26) (18, 19) (13, 20) (13, 5) (13, 29) (12, 4) (12, 26) (12, 25) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 21) (16, 2) (14, 11) (14, 3) (19, 23) (19, 17) (19, 28) (19, 18) (25, 1) (25, 12) (25, 15) (29, 6) (29, 13) (27, 20) (27, 21) (27, 9) (9, 20) (9, 28) (9, 27) (9, 24) (24, 28) (24, 9) (24, 2) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 24) (22, 6) (15, 4) (15, 25)

- Node 3: 4, 7, 10, 14, 21
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7, 12, 15
- Node 5: 7, 13, 23
- Node 6: 22, 29
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 16, 23
- Node 9: 20, 24, 27, 28
- Node 10: 3

- Node 21: 3, 11, 16, 27
- Node 22: 6
- Node 23: 5, 8, 19
- Node 24: 2, 9, 28
- Node 25: 1, 12, 15
- Node 26: 12, 18, 28
- Node 27: 9, 20, 21
- Node 28: 1, 9, 18, 19, 24
- Node 29: 6, 13

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) <4, (3, 7, 15)>, <4, (2, 7, 12)>, <4, (3, 12, 15)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 13, 23)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 15, 25)>, <4, (12, 15, 25)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (12, 26, 25)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) <7, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <9, (20, 27, 28)>, <9, (20, 27, 21)>, <9, (20, 27, 9)>, <9, (20, 21, 27)>
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) <11, (3, 14, 21)>
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <12, (15, 25, 4)>, <12, (15, 25, 26)>, <12, (15, 4, 2)>, <12, (25, 26, 2)>
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) <13, (5, 20, 29)>
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <16, (1, 21, 27)>, <16, (21, 2, 16)>, <16, (1, 2, 16)>, <16, (1, 8, 16)>
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <18, (26, 28, 19)>, <18, (1, 28, 18)>, <18, (1, 26, 18)>, <18, (1, 19, 18)>
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <19, (17, 18, 28)>, <19, (17, 19, 28)>, <19, (17, 19, 23)>, <19, (18, 26, 28)>
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <21, (3, 11, 16)>, <21, (3, 16, 27)>, <21, (11, 16, 2)>, <21, (11, 21, 27)>
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) <23, (19, 28, 9)>
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) <25, (12, 15, 4)>
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) <26, (12, 25, 15)>
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) <28, (1, 9, 18)>, <28, (1, 26, 18)>, <28, (1, 19, 18)>, <28, (1, 24, 28)>, <28, (18, 24, 28)>, <28, (24, 2, 28)>, <28, (9, 19, 28)>, <28, (9, 24, 28)>, <28, (9, 27, 28)>, <28, (19, 27, 28)>
- No other nodes form 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars from each node: 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 39

So, the final answer is [39].
