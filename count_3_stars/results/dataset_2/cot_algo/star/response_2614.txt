Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {1, 6, 8} <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {2, 6, 9} <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {6, 8, 9} <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {2, 5, 9} <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {4, 5, 8} <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, so the answer is [5].
