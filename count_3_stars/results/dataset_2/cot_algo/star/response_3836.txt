Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:

- Node 0: {6, 3, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node.

- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 62, so the final answer is [62].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
