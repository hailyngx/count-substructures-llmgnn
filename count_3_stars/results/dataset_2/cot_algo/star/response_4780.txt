Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 11) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 5) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (10, 8) (10, 12) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 2) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 11) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 7, 2, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 14, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 12, 0, 9, 11}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 6, 5, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 8, 13, 0, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 0, 14, 11}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 13, 7, 12, 14, 11}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 12, 0, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 10, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors {13, 7, 2}
- Node 10: Neighbors {8, 12}
- Node 11: Neighbors {2, 14, 5, 6}
- Node 12: Neighbors {8, 7, 2, 10, 6}
- Node 13: Neighbors {4, 9, 6}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 11, 6, 5}

Next, we identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: 1 3-star (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: 1 3-star (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 12: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56].
