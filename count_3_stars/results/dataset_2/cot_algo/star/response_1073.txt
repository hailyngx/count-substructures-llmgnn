Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (16, 12) (16, 10) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 19) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 9) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 10) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 5) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 0) (10, 12) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 10) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 17) (9, 3) (9, 4) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 19) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 2) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 14, 10}
- Node 1: {2, 17, 11}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 15, 18}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 9, 15, 19}
- Node 4: {8, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {15, 17, 18}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 15}
- Node 7: {8, 14, 15, 19}
- Node 8: {4, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 4}
- Node 10: {0, 12, 16, 18}
- Node 11: {1}
- Node 12: {10, 14, 16}
- Node 13: {4, 19}
- Node 14: {0, 12, 7}
- Node 15: {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 16: {10, 12}
- Node 17: {1, 5}
- Node 18: {2, 5, 10}
- Node 19: {3, 7, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 6, 19)>, <3, (6, 15, 19)>, <3, (9, 15, 19)>, <3, (3, 15, 19)>, <7, (14, 15, 19)>, <7, (7, 15, 19)>, <7, (7, 14, 19)>, <7, (7, 14, 15)>, <15, (2, 5, 18)>, <15, (5, 17, 18)>.
