Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 4) (12, 10) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 0) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 3, 6, 2}
- Node 1: {7, 3, 6, 2}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 13, 0}
- Node 3: {1, 11, 10, 0}
- Node 4: {8, 12, 13, 10}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 1, 10, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 1}
- Node 8: {5, 4, 10, 14}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 14, 7, 0}
- Node 10: {4, 3, 11, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 11: {5, 3, 10, 14}
- Node 12: {4, 10}
- Node 13: {4, 2, 14}
- Node 14: {9, 11, 8, 13}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars based on the given information:

- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (5, 9, 10)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (5, 6, 14)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (9, 11, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3, so the final answer is [3].
