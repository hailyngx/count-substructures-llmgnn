Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 10) (22, 17) (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 4) (21, 1) (21, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 20) (2, 18) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 25) (5, 6) (5, 29) (5, 27) (0, 14) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 10) (19, 26) (19, 8) (19, 25) (19, 24) (26, 18) (26, 19) (26, 8) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 26) (3, 21) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 12) (17, 22) (17, 28) (20, 9) (20, 28) (15, 1) (15, 23) (23, 18) (23, 11) (23, 15) (23, 16) (23, 27) (29, 9) (29, 5) (29, 0) (29, 24) (7, 11) (7, 24) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 25) (28, 17) (28, 20) (28, 27) (24, 0) (24, 19) (24, 29) (24, 7) (16, 2) (16, 3) (16, 23) (25, 18) (25, 19) (25, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 27) (27, 5) (27, 23) (27, 28) (27, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

1: {21, 15, 4}
2: {18, 16}
3: {21, 6, 11}
4: {1}
5: {6, 29, 27}
6: {9, 5, 3}
7: {11, 24}
8: {9, 14, 19, 26}
9: {6, 8, 29, 20}
10: {13, 14, 27}
11: {3, 23, 7, 12}
12: {0, 11, 25}
13: {10}
14: {0, 8}
15: {1, 23}
16: {2, 3, 23}
17: {22, 28}
18: {2, 26, 23, 25}
19: {26, 8, 24, 25}
20: {9, 28}
21: {1, 3}
22: {17}
23: {18, 11, 15, 16, 27}
24: {0, 19, 29, 7}
25: {18, 19, 12}
26: {18, 19, 8}
27: {5, 23, 28, 10}
28: {17, 20, 27}
29: {0, 5, 9, 24}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (1 3-star each):
- 1: <1, (21, 15, 4)>
- 3: <3, (21, 6, 11)>
- 5: <5, (6, 29, 27)>
- 7: <7, (11, 24)>
- 12: <12, (0, 11, 25)>
- 13: <13, (10)>
- 15: <15, (1, 23)>
- 17: <17, (22)>
- 20: <20, (9, 28)>
- 22: <22, (17)>
- 28: <28, (17, 20, 27)>

Nodes with more than 3 neighbors (\( inom{n}{3} \) 3-stars each):
- 8: [\( inom{4}{3} \) = 4]
  - <8, (9, 14, 19)>
  - <8, (9, 14, 26)>
  - <8, (9, 19, 26)>
  - <8, (14, 19, 26)>
- 9: [\( inom{4}{3} \) = 4]
  - <9, (6, 8, 29)>
  - <9, (6, 20, 29)>
  - <9, (8, 20, 29)>
  - <9, (6, 8, 20)>
- 18: [\( inom{4}{3} \) = 4]
  - <18, (2, 23, 25)>
  - <18, (16, 23, 25)>
  - <18, (2, 16, 25)>
  - <18, (2, 16, 23)>
- 19: [\( inom{4}{3} \) = 4]
  - <19, (8, 24, 25)>
  - <19, (8, 24, 26)>
  - <19, (8, 25, 26)>
  - <19, (24, 25, 26)>

Finally, counting all the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [10] 3-stars.
