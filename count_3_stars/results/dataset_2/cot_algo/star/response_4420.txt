Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's build the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 62 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [62].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 2, 9)>
- <4, (2, 7, 8)>
