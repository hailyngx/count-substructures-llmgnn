Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 29) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 19) (9, 22) (9, 16) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 21) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 16) (21, 2) (20, 25) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 17) (25, 10) (25, 11) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 15) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 13) (4, 8) (4, 29) (4, 2) (12, 24) (0, 2) (2, 21) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (19, 9) (19, 20) (19, 28) (19, 14) (26, 23) (26, 13) (26, 28) (13, 23) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 27) (5, 13) (5, 16) (16, 9) (16, 21) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 17) (28, 19) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 3) (28, 18) (29, 6) (29, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 10) (15, 8) (18, 28) (27, 13) (27, 22) (27, 24) (27, 14) (10, 25) (10, 1) (3, 28) (3, 17) (17, 25) (17, 23) (17, 16) (17, 3) (22, 9) (22, 27) (24, 12) (24, 27) (14, 2) (14, 19) (14, 27) (11, 6) (11, 25) (11, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can first determine the neighbors for each node:

1. Node 6 neighbors: 9, 1, 29, 11
2. Node 9 neighbors: 6, 19, 22, 16, 7
3. Node 7 neighbors: 9, 21, 1
4. Node 21 neighbors: 7, 16, 2
5. Node 20 neighbors: 25, 19
6. Node 25 neighbors: 20, 17, 10, 11
7. Node 8 neighbors: 23, 4, 15
8. Node 23 neighbors: 8, 26, 17, 13
9. Node 4 neighbors: 8, 29, 2
10. Node 12 neighbors: 24
11. Node 0 neighbors: 2
12. Node 2 neighbors: 21, 4, 0, 14, 11
13. Node 19 neighbors: 9, 20, 28, 14
14. Node 26 neighbors: 23, 13, 28
15. Node 13 neighbors: 23, 26, 5, 27
16. Node 5 neighbors: 13, 16
17. Node 16 neighbors: 9, 21, 5, 28, 17
18. Node 28 neighbors: 19, 26, 16, 3, 18
19. Node 29 neighbors: 6, 4
20. Node 1 neighbors: 6, 7, 10
21. Node 15 neighbors: 8
22. Node 18 neighbors: 28
23. Node 27 neighbors: 13, 22, 24, 14
24. Node 10 neighbors: 25, 1
25. Node 3 neighbors: 28, 17
26. Node 17 neighbors: 25, 23, 16, 3
27. Node 22 neighbors: 9, 27
28. Node 24 neighbors: 12, 27, 14
29. Node 14 neighbors: 2, 19, 27
30. Node 11 neighbors: 6, 25, 2

Now, we identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 6, 9, 25, 16, 28, 26, 13, 3, 17, 27, and 14 have at least 3 neighbors.

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- For each of these nodes, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \):

\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} \]

After calculating the above, we get the total number of 3-stars as 135. 

Therefore, the final answer is [135], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<6, 9, 1>, <6, 9, 29>, <6, 9, 11>, <6, 7, 1>, <25, 20, 19>, <25, 20, 11>, <25, 20, 10>, <8, 23, 26>, <8, 23, 17>, <8, 23, 13>, <4, 29, 2>, <2, 21, 16>, <2, 21, 28>, <2, 21, 14>, <2, 4, 11>, <19, 20, 14>, <19, 20, 28>, <19, 26, 13>, <19, 26, 28>, <26, 13, 5>, <26, 13, 27>, <16, 21, 5>, <16, 21, 28>, <16, 21, 17>, <16, 5, 28>, <16, 5, 17>, <16, 28, 3>, <16, 28, 18>, <23, 26, 13>, <23, 26, 28>, <23, 13, 27>, <17, 25, 3>, <17, 23, 3>, <22, 27, 24>, <14, 2, 19>, <14, 2, 27>.
