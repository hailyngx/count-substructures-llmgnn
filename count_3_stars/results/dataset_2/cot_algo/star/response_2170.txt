Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 9, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 4, 1, 3, 6, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 1, 0, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 2, 8, 1, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 8, 0, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 9, 3, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 1, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 1, 7}

Now, we can find the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (5, 9, 3)>
- Node 2 forms 4 3-stars: <2, (5, 1, 3)>, <2, (5, 3, 0)>, <2, (1, 3, 0)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (7, 1, 0)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (9, 1, 7)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (7, 8, 2)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (5, 9, 1)>

The total number of 3-stars is 9. Therefore, the answer is [9].
