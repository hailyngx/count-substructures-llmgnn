- Node 0: {9, 2, 7, 16}
- Node 1: {25, 14, 23}
- Node 2: {0, 22}
- Node 3: {9, 4, 28, 16}
- Node 4: {26, 8, 3, 17}
- Node 5: {6, 12, 11}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 7: {27, 28, 0}

- Node 14: {8, 22, 1}
- Node 15: {27, 20, 13}
- Node 16: {0, 3, 24, 13}
- Node 17: {4, 23}
- Node 18: {27, 25, 10}
- Node 19: {24}
- Node 20: {26, 15, 27, 12}
- Node 22: {26, 8, 2, 14, 11}
- Node 23: {1, 17, 13}
- Node 24: {16, 13, 19, 25}
- Node 25: {8, 1, 24, 18}
- Node 26: {9, 22, 20, 4}
- Node 27: {15, 20, 7, 29, 18}
- Node 28: {3, 7}
- Node 29: {27}

Calculations for the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 65 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [65].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (9, 2, 7)>
- <3, (9, 4, 16)>
- <4, (26, 8, 17)>
- <8, (4, 22, 14)>
- <9, (26, 3, 0)>
- <13, (15, 24, 23)>
- <15, (27, 20, 13)>
- <16, (0, 3, 24)>
- <18, (27, 25, 10)>
- <20, (26, 15, 27)>
- <22, (26, 8, 11)>
- <24, (16, 13, 25)>
- <25, (8, 1, 18)>
- <26, (9, 22, 20)>
- <27, (15, 7, 29)>
