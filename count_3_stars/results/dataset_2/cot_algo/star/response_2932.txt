Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 1) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 7) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {12, 10, 14}
Node 1 neighbors: {6, 7, 8, 9, 14}
Node 2 neighbors: {8, 12, 14}
Node 3 neighbors: {4, 5, 6}
Node 4 neighbors: {3, 5, 9, 11, 12}
Node 5 neighbors: {3, 4, 7, 12}
Node 6 neighbors: {1, 3, 10, 13}
Node 7 neighbors: {1, 5, 8, 11}
Node 8 neighbors: {1, 2, 7, 11, 14}
Node 9 neighbors: {1, 4, 10, 13}
Node 10 neighbors: {0, 6, 9, 13}
Node 11 neighbors: {4, 7, 8, 14}
Node 12 neighbors: {0, 2, 4, 5}
Node 13 neighbors: {6, 9, 10}
Node 14 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 8, 11}

Now, let's check each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed:

Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 14: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 53

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 8, 14)>
<1, (7, 8, 11)>
<1, (9, 10, 13)>
<1, (8, 11, 14)>
<1, (1, 6, 14)>
<4, (3, 5, 12)>
<4, (5, 7, 12)>
<4, (4, 9, 11)>
<4, (4, 11, 12)>
<5, (3, 4, 12)>
<7, (5, 7, 12)>
<8, (1, 7, 11)>
<8, (1, 7, 14)>
<8, (1, 8, 14)>
<11, (4, 7, 8)>
<12, (4, 5, 12)>
<14, (1, 8, 11)>
