Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 7) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 11) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 14) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 10) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {4, 5, 11}
Node 1: {2, 4, 11, 12}
Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14}
Node 3: {4, 7, 8, 11}
Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 10}
Node 5: {0}
Node 6: {2, 4, 9}
Node 7: {2, 3, 10, 13}
Node 8: {3, 4, 9, 10, 14}
Node 9: {6, 8, 14}
Node 10: {4, 7, 8, 14}
Node 11: {0, 1, 2, 3, 12}
Node 12: {1, 2, 11, 13}
Node 13: {7, 12, 14}
Node 14: {2, 8, 9, 10, 13}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-star subgraphs:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14

Calculating the number of 3-star subgraphs for each node:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 4: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding up the total number of 3-star subgraphs: 1 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 79

Therefore, the final number of 3-star subgraphs is [79]. 

The unique 3-star subgraphs found are: 
<0, 4, 11>
<2, 4, 12>
<2, 4, 14>
<2, 8, 14>
<2, 10, 14>
<4, 8, 10>
<4, 11, 12>
<4, 11, 14>
<8, 10, 14>
<11, 12, 14>
