Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 15) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 16) (2, 8) (2, 15) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 4) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 18) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 4) (13, 14) (13, 3) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 19) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 12) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 19) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 15) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 16) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) 

Response:
Given a graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we need to determine the number of unique 3-stars in this graph.

Let's analyze the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 10}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {8, 15}
- Node 3: {12, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {4, 8, 10}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 16}
- Node 7: {6, 15, 17}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {8, 16}
- Node 10: {0, 5, 11}
- Node 11: {10, 15, 18, 19}
- Node 12: {3, 14, 19}
- Node 13: {3, 14}
- Node 14: {12, 13}
- Node 15: {2, 7, 11, 16, 17}
- Node 16: {6, 9, 15, 19}
- Node 17: {7, 15, 18}
- Node 18: {11, 17, 19}
- Node 19: {11, 12, 16, 18}

Nodes 0, 5, and 7 have at least 3 neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 1 + 4 = 6 \), which we represent as [6]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (1, 4, 10)>, <5, (4, 8, 10)>, <7, (6, 15, 17)>, <7, (15, 11, 17)>, <7, (15, 16, 17)>, <7, (15, 16, 11)>
