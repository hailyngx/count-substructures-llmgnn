Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 15) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 3) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 17) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (15, 13) (15, 0) (15, 10) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 15) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 12) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 18) (17, 4) (17, 0) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 16) (19, 2) (19, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 11) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 14) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 15, 17}
- Node 1: {6, 9, 8, 11}
- Node 2: {10, 19, 16}
- Node 3: {6, 9, 18}
- Node 4: {8, 18, 16, 17}
- Node 5: {8, 12, 10}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {6, 4, 5, 1}
- Node 9: {10, 3, 1, 12}
- Node 10: {9, 5, 15, 2}
- Node 11: {1, 12}
- Node 12: {9, 13, 5, 11}
- Node 13: {12, 15}
- Node 14: {18, 19, 16}
- Node 15: {13, 0, 10}
- Node 16: {4, 2, 14}
- Node 17: {4, 0}
- Node 18: {4, 14, 3}
- Node 19: {2, 14}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Does not form a 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: Does not form a 3-star (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 2: Does not form a 3-star (has 3 neighbors but not all connected)
- Node 3: Does not form a 3-star (has 3 neighbors but not all connected)
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star <4, (8, 16, 17)>
- Node 5: Does not form a 3-star (has 3 neighbors but not all connected)
- Node 6: Does not form a 3-star (has 3 neighbors but not all connected)
- Node 7: Does not form a 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star <8, (4, 5, 1)>
- Node 9: Does not form a 3-star (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 10: Forms 1 3-star <10, (9, 5, 15)>
- Node 11: Does not form a 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: Does not form a 3-star (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 13: Does not form a 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: Does not form a 3-star (has 3 neighbors but not all connected)
- Node 15: Does not form a 3-star (has 3 neighbors but not all connected)
- Node 16: Does not form a 3-star (has 3 neighbors but not all connected)
- Node 17: Does not form a 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 18: Does not form a 3-star (has 3 neighbors but not all connected)
- Node 19: Does not form a 3-star (has 2 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars found:
- <4, (8, 16, 17)>
- <8, (4, 5, 1)>
