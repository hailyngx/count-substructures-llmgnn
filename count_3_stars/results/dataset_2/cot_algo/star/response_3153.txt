Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 8) (21, 7) (21, 23) (21, 11) (21, 2) (21, 14) (12, 27) (12, 6) (27, 12) (27, 17) (27, 1) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 13) (2, 21) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 25) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 22) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 29) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 3) (11, 21) (28, 13) (28, 25) (29, 4) (29, 1) (29, 10) (10, 29) (10, 15) (10, 16) (15, 10) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 22) (16, 0) (16, 10) (16, 17) (5, 1) (5, 22) (5, 24) (26, 0) (26, 23) (26, 3) (22, 8) (22, 19) (22, 5) (23, 21) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 14) (1, 27) (1, 29) (1, 5) (24, 5) (24, 3) (24, 13) (9, 0) (9, 25) (25, 2) (25, 28) (25, 9) (3, 18) (3, 26) (3, 24) (17, 27) (17, 16) (17, 23) (13, 20) (13, 28) (13, 24) (13, 14) (6, 12) (6, 2) (14, 21) (14, 4) (14, 23) (14, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {20, 16, 9, 26}
- Node 1: {27, 29, 5}
- Node 2: {21, 8, 6, 25}
- Node 3: {18, 26, 24}
- Node 4: {18, 19, 14, 29}
- Node 5: {1, 22, 24}
- Node 6: {12, 2}
- Node 7: {21, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 2, 19, 22}
- Node 9: {0, 25}
- Node 10: {29, 15, 16}
- Node 11: {21}
- Node 12: {27, 6}
- Node 13: {20, 28, 24, 14}
- Node 14: {21, 4, 23, 13}
- Node 15: {10}
- Node 16: {0, 10, 17}
- Node 17: {27, 16, 23}
- Node 18: {4, 19, 3}
- Node 19: {8, 4, 18, 22}
- Node 20: {0, 13}
- Node 21: {7, 23, 11, 2, 14}
- Node 22: {8, 19, 5}
- Node 23: {21, 26, 17, 14}
- Node 24: {5, 3, 13}
- Node 25: {2, 28, 9}
- Node 26: {0, 23, 3}
- Node 27: {12, 17, 1}
- Node 28: {13, 25}
- Node 29: {4, 1, 10}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 5, 8, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 29 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 37

So, the final answer is [37].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (16, 20, 26)>
<5, (1, 22, 24)>
<8, (2, 19, 22)>
<13, (14, 20, 28)>
<14, (4, 23, 13)>
<16, (0, 10, 17)>
<19, (4, 18, 22)>
<21, (2, 14, 23)>
<22, (5, 8, 19)>
<23, (17, 21, 26)>
<24, (3, 13, 5)>
<25, (9, 28, 2)>
<26, (3, 23, 0)>
<29, (10, 1, 4)>
