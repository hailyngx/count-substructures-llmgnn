Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 20) (3, 26) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 23) (15, 18) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 21) (18, 15) (18, 2) (18, 27) (18, 21) (1, 26) (1, 29) (1, 14) (1, 7) (26, 3) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 0) (20, 3) (20, 15) (20, 23) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 23) (5, 16) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 19) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 25) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 4) (16, 19) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 10) (27, 18) (11, 24) (11, 25) (11, 29) (23, 15) (23, 20) (23, 5) (23, 21) (17, 13) (8, 19) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 14) (6, 24) (6, 22) (6, 0) (24, 11) (24, 6) (24, 0) (24, 22) (10, 26) (10, 4) (29, 1) (29, 11) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 26) (0, 6) (0, 24) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 25) (22, 6) (22, 24) (7, 1) (7, 5) (25, 28) (25, 11) (25, 14) (21, 2) (21, 18) (21, 23) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 5, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 0 = 66 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [66].
