Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 7, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 10, 12}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 8, 12}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 7, 13}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 10, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 11: Neighbors {2, 3, 9, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 14: Neighbors {2, 3, 4}

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: has 6 neighbors, so \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is possible
- Node 8: has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: has 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is possible

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated, we get a total of 70 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [70].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 4, 10>
- <1, 6, 10>
- <1, 8, 9>
- <3, 0, 8>
- <3, 0, 14>
- <3, 8, 11>
- <4, 0, 8>
- <4, 0, 14>
- <4, 7, 12>
- <5, 2, 11>
- <5, 6, 10>
- <8, 1, 9>
- <8, 1, 10>
- <9, 1, 10>
