Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 14) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 3) (0, 27) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 19) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 25) (22, 18) (22, 6) (22, 21) (10, 17) (10, 26) (17, 10) (17, 26) (17, 21) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 25) (15, 20) (20, 5) (20, 15) (20, 8) (11, 28) (11, 3) (11, 24) (11, 26) (28, 11) (28, 8) (28, 1) (28, 13) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 11) (25, 18) (25, 2) (25, 26) (25, 23) (1, 28) (1, 8) (1, 7) (6, 22) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 14) (12, 29) (19, 0) (19, 27) (19, 18) (19, 4) (8, 0) (8, 20) (8, 28) (8, 1) (8, 21) (24, 11) (24, 12) (24, 4) (26, 10) (26, 17) (26, 11) (26, 25) (26, 7) (13, 28) (13, 21) (21, 27) (21, 22) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 13) (4, 19) (4, 24) (7, 1) (7, 26) (29, 12) (29, 16) (16, 9) (16, 29) (23, 25) (14, 5) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 8, 19, 27}
- Node 1: {7, 8, 13, 28}
- Node 2: {12, 18, 25}
- Node 3: {0, 9, 11}
- Node 4: {19, 24}
- Node 5: {9, 14, 15, 20}
- Node 6: {22}
- Node 7: {1, 26}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 8, 20, 28}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 16}
- Node 10: {17, 26}
- Node 11: {3, 11, 24, 26, 28}
- Node 12: {2, 14, 24, 29}
- Node 13: {1, 21, 28}
- Node 14: {5, 12}
- Node 15: {5, 20}
- Node 16: {9, 29}
- Node 17: {10, 21, 26}
- Node 18: {2, 19, 22, 25}
- Node 19: {0, 4, 18, 27}
- Node 20: {5, 8, 15}
- Node 21: {17, 19, 21, 27, 28, 13}
- Node 22: {18, 21}
- Node 23: {25}
- Node 24: {4, 11, 12}
- Node 25: {2, 18, 23, 26}
- Node 26: {7, 10, 11, 17, 25}
- Node 27: {0, 19, 21}
- Node 28: {1, 8, 11, 13, 21}
- Node 29: {12, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars:

- Node 0
- Node 8
- Node 21
- Node 26

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 19>, <0, 3, 27>, <0, 8, 19>, <0, 8, 27>, <0, 19, 27>, <3, 9, 16>, <8, 20, 28>, <8, 21, 28>, <8, 13, 28>, <8, 1, 28>, <8, 1, 13>, <8, 1, 7>, <8, 1, 13>, <8, 1, 7>, <8, 1, 26>, <8, 20, 28>, <8, 20, 15>, <8, 20, 5>, <21, 17, 26>, <21, 17, 8>, <21, 17, 13>, <21, 17, 1>, <21, 17, 26>, <21, 17, 13>, <21, 17, 1>, <21, 26, 7>, <21, 13, 1>, <21, 13, 28>, <21, 13, 1>, <4, 19, 24>, <7, 1, 26>, <25, 23, 26>, <25, 2, 18>, <26, 7, 10>, <26, 7, 25>, <26, 11, 10>, <26, 11, 17>, <26, 11, 28>, <26, 11, 3>, <26, 11, 24>, <26, 17, 10>, <26, 17, 21>, <26, 17, 28>, <26, 17, 21>, <26, 17, 28>
