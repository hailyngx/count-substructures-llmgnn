Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will follow the steps outlined above:

1. Explore the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {4, 5, 7, 8, 3}
- Node 1: neighbors {5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 6, 9, 7, 3}
- Node 3: neighbors {9, 8, 5, 0, 2}
- Node 4: neighbors {6, 8, 0, 5, 2}
- Node 5: neighbors {4, 1, 0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 7: neighbors {5, 0, 2, 1}
- Node 8: neighbors {4, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 3}

2. Apply \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

3. Sum up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 58 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 8, 3>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 5>
