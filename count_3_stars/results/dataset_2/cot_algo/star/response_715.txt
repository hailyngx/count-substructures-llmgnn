Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 14) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 10) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {6, 13, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {4, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {7, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7, 11}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 1, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 8, 12}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {6, 7, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 12, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {7, 10, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8, 10}

We can see that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, and 14. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 13>
<2, 4, 10>
<3, 7, 10>
<4, 5, 11>
<6, 8, 14>
<7, 8, 12>
<9, 11, 2>
<10, 12, 7>
<13, 12, 3>
<14, 1, 6>
