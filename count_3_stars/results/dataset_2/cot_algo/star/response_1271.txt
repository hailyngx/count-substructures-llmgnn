Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 4) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 19) (4, 15) (4, 0) (4, 16) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 13) (2, 10) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 18) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 18) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 8) (11, 0) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 2) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 0) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 12) (19, 9) (19, 17) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 6) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 1) 

Response:
From the given information, we can construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 16, 11}
- Node 1: {17, 12, 18}
- Node 2: {10}
- Node 3: {15, 17, 6, 12}
- Node 4: {15, 0, 16}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 18, 16}
- Node 6: {3, 17, 12}
- Node 7: {10, 18, 13}
- Node 8: {16, 11, 18}
- Node 9: {5, 17, 10, 13, 19}
- Node 10: {9, 7, 2}
- Node 11: {8, 0}
- Node 12: {3, 1, 6}
- Node 13: {5, 9, 7}
- Node 15: {3, 4}
- Node 16: {5, 4, 8, 0}
- Node 17: {3, 9, 1, 6, 19}
- Node 18: {5, 7, 8, 1}
- Node 19: {9, 17}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors
- Node 16: 4 neighbors
- Node 17: 5 neighbors
- Node 18: 4 neighbors

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Finally, summing these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 28 3-stars. So the final answer is [28].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (15, 6, 12)>, 
<5, (9, 18, 16)>, 
<9, (5, 13, 7)>, 
<17, (9, 1, 19)>.
