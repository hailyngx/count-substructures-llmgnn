Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 7) (27, 12) (27, 21) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 26) (6, 19) (9, 6) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 24) (22, 18) (22, 14) (22, 11) (22, 3) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 1) (25, 20) (25, 29) (25, 4) (5, 17) (5, 24) (8, 14) (23, 14) (23, 7) (23, 10) (23, 28) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 7) (7, 15) (7, 23) (7, 12) (4, 18) (4, 25) (4, 29) (4, 2) (1, 6) (1, 20) (1, 26) (1, 17) (26, 6) (26, 20) (26, 1) (26, 2) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 21) (3, 22) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 22) (11, 3) (11, 2) (16, 17) (16, 28) (16, 0) (16, 29) (16, 10) (28, 23) (28, 16) (28, 0) (0, 16) (0, 28) (10, 23) (10, 16) (2, 4) (2, 26) (2, 3) (2, 11) (13, 3) (21, 27) (21, 17) (14, 22) (14, 8) (14, 23) (14, 24) (19, 6) (19, 29) (29, 25) (29, 4) (29, 16) (29, 19) (24, 18) (24, 5) (24, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 6, 7, 12, 22, 25, 26, 29.

For node 6: 
Number of neighbors = 5
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Unique 3-stars: <>
Total: 10

For node 7:
Number of neighbors = 4
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <>
Total: 4

For node 12:
Number of neighbors = 3
Number of 3-stars = 1
Unique 3-stars: <>
Total: 1

For node 22:
Number of neighbors = 4
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <>
Total: 4

For node 25:
Number of neighbors = 4
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <>
Total: 4

For node 26:
Number of neighbors = 4
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <>
Total: 4

For node 29:
Number of neighbors = 4
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <>
Total: 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 31

Therefore, the final answer is [31].
