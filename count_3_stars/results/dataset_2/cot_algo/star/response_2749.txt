Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 29) (1, 2) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 18) (0, 4) (0, 26) (20, 29) (28, 29) (28, 6) (29, 1) (29, 20) (29, 28) (29, 23) (17, 27) (17, 4) (6, 28) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 13) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 25) (4, 0) (4, 17) (4, 18) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 25) (5, 15) (5, 22) (5, 21) (5, 16) (19, 3) (10, 15) (10, 26) (10, 13) (10, 16) (22, 5) (22, 14) (22, 7) (26, 0) (26, 10) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 8) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 12) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 25) (9, 13) (25, 11) (25, 18) (25, 9) (25, 2) (14, 22) (14, 13) (14, 21) (2, 1) (2, 25) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 24) (8, 27) (24, 8) (24, 7) (24, 13) (7, 6) (7, 22) (7, 24) (21, 5) (21, 14) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 24) (23, 29) (23, 27) (27, 17) (27, 8) (27, 23) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated as follows:
- Node 29 has 5 neighbors: 1, 20, 28, and 23. It forms 1 3-star with nodes 1, 20, and 28.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 16, and 25. It forms 1 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 16.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors: 3, 5, 10, 12, and 18. It forms 1 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 10 and 1 3-star with nodes 3, 12, and 18.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 5, 9, and 10. It forms 1 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 10.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 8, 9, 25, and 2. It forms 1 3-star with nodes 8, 9, and 25.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 15, 22, 21, and 16. It forms 1 3-star with nodes 15, 5, and 16.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 15, 26, 13, and 16. It forms 1 3-star with nodes 15, 10, and 16.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 15, 11, 25, and 13. It forms 1 3-star with nodes 15, 9, and 10.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors: 11, 18, 9, and 2. It forms 1 3-star with nodes 11, 25, and 9.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: 5, 14, and 7. It forms 1 3-star with nodes 5, 22, and 7.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 22, 13, and 21. It forms 1 3-star with nodes 22, 14, and 5.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 11, 12, 24, and 27. It forms 1 3-star with nodes 11, 8, and 25.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors: 8, 7, and 13. It forms 1 3-star with nodes 8, 24, and 7.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 6, 10, 9, 14, and 24. It forms 1 3-star with nodes 6, 13, and 24.
  
Adding up all the 3-stars formed from the above nodes, we get a total of 13 3-stars. 
Hence, the final answer is [13].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 20, 28>
<3, 4, 16>
<3, 5, 10>
<3, 12, 18>
<5, 9, 10>
<8, 9, 11>
<5, 9, 15>
<5, 15, 16>
<15, 10, 16>
<9, 10, 15>
<11, 9, 25>
<5, 14, 22>
<7, 22, 5>
