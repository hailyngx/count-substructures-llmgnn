Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 6}
Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 6, 9}
Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 8}
Node 7: {0}
Node 8: {6, 9}
Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 9 have 5 or more neighbors.

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 78

Therefore, the final answer is [78], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
