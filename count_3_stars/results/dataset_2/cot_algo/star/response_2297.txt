Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 13) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (11, 12) (11, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

1: 5, 13, 14
2: 5, 6, 9
3: 9, 10, 13
4: 7, 13
5: 1, 2, 8, 12, 14
6: 2, 8, 10
7: 4, 8, 9, 12
8: 0, 5, 6, 7, 9
9: 2, 3, 7, 8, 13, 14
10: 0, 3, 6, 12
11: 12, 14
12: 0, 5, 7, 10, 11, 14
13: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
14: 1, 5, 9, 11, 12

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

1, 5, 9, 12, 13, 14

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

1: inom{3}{3} = 1
5: inom{5}{3} = 10
9: inom{6}{3} = 20
12: inom{6}{3} = 20
13: inom{5}{3} = 10
14: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 71

Therefore, the final number to put inside brackets is [71], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 5, 13>, <5, 1, 14>, <5, 9, 14>, <5, 12, 14>, <5, 14, 1>, 
<5, 14, 12>, <9, 5, 14>, <9, 13, 14>, <9, 14, 5>, <9, 14, 13>, 
<12, 5, 14>, <12, 9, 14>, <12, 14, 5>, <12, 14, 9>, <13, 9, 14>.
