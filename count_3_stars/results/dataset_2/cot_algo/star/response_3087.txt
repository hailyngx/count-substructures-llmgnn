Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 12) (7, 10) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 5, 9, 14
- Node 1: 0, 4, 8, 10
- Node 2: 5, 8, 12, 14
- Node 3: 9, 12, 14
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 9, 11, 12, 13
- Node 6: 9, 11, 13, 14
- Node 7: 10, 12
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 9, 10
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 10: 1, 7, 8
- Node 11: 5, 6, 14
- Node 12: 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 14
- Node 13: 5, 6, 12
- Node 14: 0, 2, 3, 6, 11, 12

Now let's check for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0: 1; we can't form a 3-star with this node.
- Node 1: 3; we can't form a 3-star with this node.
- Node 2: 4; we can't form a 3-star with this node.
- Node 3: 2; we can't form a 3-star with this node.
- Node 4: 2; we can't form a 3-star with this node.
- Node 5: 6; [inom{6}{3}] = 20.
- Node 6: 4; we can't form a 3-star with this node.
- Node 7: 2; we can't form a 3-star with this node.
- Node 8: 5; [inom{5}{3}] = 10.
- Node 9: 5; [inom{5}{3}] = 10.
- Node 10: 3; we can't form a 3-star with this node.
- Node 11: 3; we can't form a 3-star with this node.
- Node 12: 6; [inom{6}{3}] = 20.
- Node 13: 3; we can't form a 3-star with this node.
- Node 14: 6; [inom{6}{3}] = 20.

Summing up all the 3-stars formed, we get 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 60. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <5, 12, 6, 13>
- <5, 12, 6, 14>
- <5, 12, 13, 14>
- <5, 6, 13, 14>
- <8, 9, 1, 4>
- <8, 9, 1, 10>
- <8, 9, 4, 10>
- <8, 9, 1, 10>
- <8, 9, 4, 10>
- <9, 0, 5, 3>
