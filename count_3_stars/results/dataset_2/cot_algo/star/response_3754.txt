Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 9) (21, 0) (21, 23) (21, 29) (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 19) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 28) (25, 24) (12, 17) (12, 15) (12, 9) (27, 7) (27, 9) (5, 23) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (22, 26) (22, 0) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 10) (28, 25) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 7) (17, 20) (17, 12) (13, 6) (13, 29) (13, 0) (19, 20) (19, 6) (0, 21) (0, 22) (0, 13) (0, 16) (16, 20) (16, 0) (16, 24) (16, 18) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 29) (11, 15) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (10, 8) (10, 26) (10, 9) (10, 23) (23, 21) (23, 5) (23, 10) (23, 18) (15, 12) (15, 11) (24, 25) (24, 16) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 23) (18, 29) (18, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (9, 27) (9, 28) (9, 10) (4, 14) (29, 21) (29, 13) (29, 11) (29, 18) (7, 1) (7, 27) (7, 28) (7, 14) (3, 2) (3, 18) 

Response:
Based on the provided edge list, we can determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {13, 16, 21, 22}
Node 1 neighbors: {7, 9}
Node 2 neighbors: {3, 8}
Node 3 neighbors: {2, 18}
Node 4 neighbors: {14}
Node 5 neighbors: {23}
Node 6 neighbors: {13, 18, 19}
Node 7 neighbors: {1, 14, 27, 28}
Node 8 neighbors: {2, 10, 11}
Node 9 neighbors: {1, 10, 12, 27, 28}
Node 10 neighbors: {8, 9, 23, 26}
Node 11 neighbors: {8, 14, 15, 29}
Node 12 neighbors: {9, 15, 17}
Node 13 neighbors: {0, 6, 29}
Node 14 neighbors: {4, 7, 11}
Node 15 neighbors: {11, 12}
Node 16 neighbors: {0, 18, 20, 24}
Node 17 neighbors: {12, 20}
Node 18 neighbors: {3, 6, 13, 16, 23, 29}
Node 19 neighbors: {6, 20}
Node 20 neighbors: {16, 17, 19, 25}
Node 21 neighbors: {0, 23, 29}
Node 22 neighbors: {0, 26}
Node 23 neighbors: {5, 10, 18, 21}
Node 24 neighbors: {16, 25}
Node 25 neighbors: {20, 24, 28}
Node 26 neighbors: {10, 22, 28}
Node 27 neighbors: {7, 9}
Node 28 neighbors: {7, 9, 25, 26}
Node 29 neighbors: {11, 13, 18, 21}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {0, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 18, 20, 21, 23, 28, 29}

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = \binom{n}{3} \]

Calculating for each node:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 98 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [98].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (13, 16, 21)>
<9, (10, 27, 28)>
<10, (18, 23, 26)>
<11, (14, 15, 29)>
<21, (23, 29, [0])>
<28, (25, 26, 9)>
<29, (11, 18, 21)>
