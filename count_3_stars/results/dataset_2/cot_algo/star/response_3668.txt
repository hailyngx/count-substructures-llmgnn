Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 2) (13, 20) (13, 7) (22, 0) (22, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (21, 26) (21, 18) (21, 29) (2, 13) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 20) (29, 21) (29, 2) (29, 10) (6, 9) (6, 24) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 24) (9, 14) (18, 21) (18, 19) (18, 25) (0, 22) (0, 20) (20, 13) (20, 2) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 10) (15, 20) (15, 11) (15, 16) (28, 26) (28, 25) (26, 21) (26, 28) (26, 5) (26, 12) (3, 22) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (11, 15) (11, 3) (11, 27) (11, 5) (8, 9) (16, 15) (16, 25) (19, 2) (19, 18) (24, 6) (24, 9) (24, 17) (24, 25) (5, 26) (5, 11) (5, 7) (23, 17) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 27) (7, 17) (17, 24) (17, 23) (17, 7) (4, 1) (4, 14) (10, 1) (10, 29) (10, 20) (10, 3) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 25) (27, 11) (27, 7) (12, 1) (12, 26) (25, 18) (25, 28) (25, 16) (25, 24) (25, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 22, 20
- Node 1: 10, 4, 12
- Node 2: 13, 29, 19, 20
- Node 3: 22, 11, 7, 10
- Node 4: 1, 14
- Node 5: 26, 11, 7
- Node 6: 9, 24
- Node 7: 13, 3, 5, 27, 17
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 6, 24, 8, 14
- Node 10: 1, 29, 20, 3
- Node 11: 15, 3, 27, 5
- Node 12: 1, 26
- Node 13: 2, 20, 7
- Node 14: 9, 4, 25
- Node 15: 20, 11, 16
- Node 16: 15, 25
- Node 17: 24, 7, 23
- Node 18: 21, 19, 25
- Node 19: 2, 18
- Node 20: 13, 2, 0, 15, 10
- Node 21: 26, 18, 29
- Node 22: 0, 3
- Node 23: 17
- Node 24: 6, 9, 17, 25
- Node 25: 18, 28, 16, 24, 14
- Node 26: 21, 5, 12
- Node 27: 11, 7
- Node 28: 26, 25
- Node 29: 21, 2, 10

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (10, 4, 12)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (13, 29, 19)>
- Node 3 forms two 3-stars: <3, (22, 11, 7)> and <3, (10, 20, 29)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (13, 5, 27)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (6, 24, 14)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (15, 27, 5)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (20, 16, 11)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star: <17, (24, 7, 23)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star: <18, (21, 19, 25)>
- Node 20 forms a 3-star: <20, (13, 10, 29)>
- Node 21 forms a 3-star: <21, (26, 29, 18)>
- Node 24 forms a 3-star: <24, (6, 17, 25)>
- Node 25 forms a 3-star: <25, (18, 16, 14)>

Since each node that forms a 3-star has only one unique 3-star attached to it, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
