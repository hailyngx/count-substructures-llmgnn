Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 7, 8}

Now let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 4 neighbors:
- For each node, we calculate \( \binom{4}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Now sum up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 54\)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars found in the graph is [54], and the unique 3-stars are:
  
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
