Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, we'll create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 5}

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 48, which we put inside brackets as [48].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 2)>
<1, (0, 7, 6)>
<1, (2, 7, 3)>
<1, (6, 3, 5)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 1)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
