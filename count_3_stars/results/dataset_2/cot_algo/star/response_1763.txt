Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <7, (1, 2, 8)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>
