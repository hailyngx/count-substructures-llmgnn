Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 7) (17, 12) (17, 5) (17, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 11) (18, 5) (18, 11) (18, 12) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 13) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 6) (5, 17) (5, 18) (19, 16) (19, 6) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 12) (9, 3) (9, 11) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 16) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 16) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 13) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 9) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 15) (16, 6) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 10, 13, 4
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 14, 6, 9, 12
Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 17, 4, 16, 15, 11, 5
Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 17, 18, 3, 13, 12
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 3, 7, 19, 16, 12
Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 8, 18, 0, 9, 11
Node 16 has 5 neighbors: 8, 19, 15, 6, 16

Calculation for the number of 3-star subgraphs:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 74 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [74].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 10)>
<3, (1, 9, 12)>
<8, (17, 11, 15)>
<12, (13, 17, 18)>
<6, (7, 12, 16)>
<11, (0, 8, 18)>
<16, (6, 15, 19)>
