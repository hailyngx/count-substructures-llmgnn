Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges based on the nodes they connect:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 8}

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars it participates in:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors (3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4) 
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4) 
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (no 3-stars) 
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (no 3-stars) 
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4) 
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4) 
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4) 
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10) 
- Node 8: 6 neighbors (3-stars: [inom{6}{3}] = 20) 
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (no 3-stars) 

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 42

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, 
<1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, 
<4, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, 
<5, 6, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, 
<6, 8, 9>, 
<7, 8, 9>
