Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (5, 12) (5, 7) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 1) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 15) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 18) (3, 8) (3, 9) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 18) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (19, 17) (4, 1) (15, 13) (15, 0) (15, 16) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 4) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 17) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 17) (14, 16) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as:

{0: [7, 10, 11, 12, 15], 1: [4, 10, 12, 16], 2: [7, 8], 3: [8, 9], 4: [1], 5: [7, 12], 6: [7, 8, 13], 7: [0, 2, 5, 6], 8: [2, 3, 6, 13], 9: [3, 11, 17], 10: [0, 1, 18], 11: [0, 9, 18], 12: [0, 1, 5, 16], 13: [6, 8, 15], 14: [16], 15: [0, 13, 16], 16: [1, 12, 15, 17, 14], 17: [9, 16, 18, 19], 18: [10, 11, 17], 19: [17]}

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of.

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Summing all the 3-stars formed by these nodes: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 10, 12)>, <0, (7, 10, 15)>, <0, (7, 11, 12)>, <0, (7, 11, 15)>, <0, (7, 12, 15)>, <0, (10, 11, 12)>, <0, (10, 11, 15)>, 
<1, (4, 10, 12)>, <7, (0, 10, 12)>, <7, (0, 10, 15)>, <7, (0, 11, 12)>, <7, (0, 11, 15)>, <7, (0, 12, 15)>, <10, (0, 11, 12)>, 
<12, (0, 10, 15)>, <16, (1, 12, 15)>, <16, (12, 15, 17)>, <17, (9, 16, 18)>, <17, (16, 18, 19)>
