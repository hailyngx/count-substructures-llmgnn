Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 4, 7, 5, 1
- Node 1: Neighbors are 4, 6, 2, 8
- Node 2: Neighbors are 6, 9, 1, 3
- Node 3: Neighbors are 4, 9, 2, 8
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 1, 6, 3
- Node 5: Neighbors are 7, 8, 0
- Node 6: Neighbors are 4, 7, 9, 1, 2
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 6, 8, 5
- Node 8: Neighbors are 7, 9, 5, 3, 1
- Node 9: Neighbors are 6, 8, 2, 3

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 choose 3 = 120 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 choose 3 = 120 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [120 + 120] = [240].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 9, 5)>
<6, (4, 7, 1)>
<6, (4, 9, 2)>
<8, (7, 5, 0)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (9, 3, 2)>
<6, (1, 6, 2)>
<6, (1, 6, 9)>
