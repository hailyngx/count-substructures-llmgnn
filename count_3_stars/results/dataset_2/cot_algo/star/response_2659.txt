Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {11, 8, 13}
- Node 2: {5, 10, 11, 14, 1, 12}
- Node 3: {9, 7}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 13, 10, 14}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 2, 12, 0}
- Node 6: {10, 11, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 3}
- Node 8: {14, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 11, 3}
- Node 10: {6, 4, 12, 2}
- Node 11: {9, 6, 1, 2}
- Node 12: {5, 10, 14, 13, 2}
- Node 13: {5, 4, 14, 12, 1}
- Node 14: {4, 8, 12, 2, 13}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (11, 8, 13)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (9, 7, 0)>

Combining these, we have a total of [3] unique 3-stars in the graph.
