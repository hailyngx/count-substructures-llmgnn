Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's organize the graph in terms of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6, 9, 12}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 10, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 10, 11}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 8}
- Node 7: {9, 13}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 11}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 11: {3, 8, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 2, 4, 11}
- Node 13: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 4, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 7 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors

We need to calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:

- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (Node 0), we have 1 combination: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors (Nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 11):
  - Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - Node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
  - Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up:
1 (from node 0) + 10 (from node 1) + 20 (from node 2) + 10 (from node 5) + 35 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 11) = 86

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [86]. 

Some unique 3-stars found in the graph include: <0, 13, 14>, <1, 4, 12>, <2, 4, 10>, <5, 8, 10>, <11, 8, 12>.
