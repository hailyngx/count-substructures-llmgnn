Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 8, 2}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 8, 2}
- Node 2: {8, 1, 3, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 4, 7, 8, 2}
- Node 4: {8, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 8: {4, 2, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 7}

Nodes 0, 3, and 8 each have more than three neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them. 

For Node 0:
It forms 3-stars with the combinations of its neighbors: 
1. <0, (6, 7, 8)>
2. <0, (6, 7, 2)>
3. <0, (6, 8, 2)>
4. <0, (7, 8, 2)>

For Node 3:
It forms 3-stars with the combinations of its neighbors:
1. <3, (5, 4, 7)>
2. <3, (5, 4, 8)>
3. <3, (5, 4, 2)>
4. <3, (5, 7, 8)>
5. <3, (5, 7, 2)>
6. <3, (5, 8, 2)>
7. <3, (4, 7, 8)>
8. <3, (4, 7, 2)>
9. <3, (4, 8, 2)>
10. <3, (7, 8, 2)>

For Node 8:
It forms 3-stars with the combinations of its neighbors:
1. <8, (4, 0, 3)>
2. <8, (4, 1, 3)>
3. <8, (4, 2, 3)>
4. <8, (0, 1, 3)>
5. <8, (0, 2, 3)>
6. <8, (1, 2, 3)>

Total 3-stars formed: 4 (from Node 0) + 10 (from Node 3) + 6 (from Node 8) = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
