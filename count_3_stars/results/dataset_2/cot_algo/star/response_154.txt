Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 17) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 5) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 17) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 0) (4, 19) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (14, 12) (14, 18) (7, 1) (7, 10) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 16) (17, 9) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 6) (16, 17) (16, 13) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 6) (13, 3) (13, 16) (13, 10) (18, 14) (18, 10) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 2) (2, 3) (2, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {15, 8, 19, 6}
- Node 1: {15, 11, 8, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 10}
- Node 3: {13, 2}
- Node 4: {19, 12}
- Node 5: {9, 19, 8, 15}
- Node 6: {17, 0, 16}
- Node 7: {1, 10}
- Node 8: {5, 1, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 11, 17}
- Node 10: {12, 7, 13, 18, 2}
- Node 11: {9, 1}
- Node 12: {4, 10, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 16, 10}
- Node 14: {12, 18}
- Node 15: {5, 1, 0, 17}
- Node 16: {6, 17, 13}
- Node 17: {9, 15, 6, 16}
- Node 18: {14, 10}
- Node 19: {5, 4, 0}

Next, we'll find the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 5, Node 15, and Node 17 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 choose 3 = 4 unique 3-stars.
- Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, and Node 19 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 choose 3 = 4 unique 3-stars.
- Node 6, Node 12, and Node 16 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form 3 choose 3 = 1 unique 3-star.

Total number of unique 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the final answer is [17].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 8, 15, 17>
<1, 5, 15, 17>
<5, 8, 15, 17>
<0, 1, 15, 17>
<0, 9, 15, 17>
<1, 9, 15, 17>
<5, 9, 15, 17>
<0, 5, 15, 17>
<0, 4, 12>
<14, 18, 10>
<6, 16, 13>
