Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (16, 11) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 19) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 19) (17, 9) (17, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 18) (14, 7) (15, 10) (15, 19) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (1, 11) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 7) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 3) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 13) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 4) (18, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {8, 13}
- Node 1: {7, 11}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 12}
- Node 3: {7, 12}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {2, 9, 11}
- Node 6: {4, 8, 10}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 14, 19}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 8, 10, 17, 19}
- Node 10: {6, 8, 11, 15, 17, 19}
- Node 11: {1, 5, 10, 16}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 12}
- Node 14: {7, 18}
- Node 15: {10, 19}
- Node 16: {11}
- Node 17: {9, 10}
- Node 18: {14}
- Node 19: {7, 9, 10, 15}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 8} and {4, 5, 10}.
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 8, 11} and {8, 9, 19}.
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 8, 13}.

This gives us a total of 5 unique 3-stars: <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 10)>, <10, (6, 8, 11)>, <10, (8, 9, 19)>, and <12, (2, 8, 13)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
