Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 6) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 12) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 11) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 1) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 9) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 10) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 10) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms the 3-star with nodes 5, 2, and 11. So, we have <1, (2, 5, 11)>.
- Node 6 forms the 3-star with nodes 7, 13, and 2. So, we have <6, (2, 7, 13)>.

Since these are the only 3-stars in the graph, the total number of 3-stars formed is [2].
