Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: {0, 3, 7}
2: {3, 4, 6, 9}
3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6}
4: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
5: {4, 7, 8}
6: {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
7: {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
8: {5, 9}
9: {2, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
