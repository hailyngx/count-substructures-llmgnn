Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 7) (2, 8) (2, 10) (3, 0) (3, 10) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 13) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 3, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 11, 14, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors {8, 10}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 10}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 8, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors {12, 10, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 11, 12, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {8, 14, 1, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 2, 11, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 4, 11, 10, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {9, 2, 3, 5, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors {6, 9, 8, 0, 1}
- Node 12: Neighbors {6, 9, 0, 1, 5, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {4, 7, 0, 12, 10}
- Node 14: Neighbors {7, 1, 5}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 83

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [83].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (6, 11, 12)>
- <0, (6, 11, 13)>
- <0, (6, 12, 13)>
- <0, (11, 12, 13)>
- <1, (7, 11, 14)>
- <1, (7, 12, 14)>
- <1, (11, 12, 14)>
- <4, (8, 9, 13)>
- <7, (8, 11, 14)>
- <10, (9, 11, 12)>
- <12, (9, 12, 13)>
