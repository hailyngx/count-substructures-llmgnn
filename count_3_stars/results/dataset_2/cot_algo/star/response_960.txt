Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 11) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {8, 13, 4, 12, 11}
Node 1: {9, 6, 10}
Node 2: {8, 3}
Node 3: {5, 4, 12, 7, 2}
Node 4: {13, 6, 0, 3}
Node 5: {9, 6, 3, 10, 7}
Node 6: {5, 1, 10, 12, 4}
Node 7: {5, 11, 3}
Node 8: {13, 2, 10, 0}
Node 9: {5, 1}
Node 10: {8, 13, 6, 1, 14, 5}
Node 11: {14, 7, 0}
Node 12: {13, 6, 14, 0, 3}
Node 13: {8, 4, 10, 0, 12}
Node 14: {12, 11, 10}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 10: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
Node 12: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 13: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 80

Therefore, the final answer is [80].
