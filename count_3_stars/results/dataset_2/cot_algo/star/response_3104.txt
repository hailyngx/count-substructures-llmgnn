Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 6) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 3) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 6) (2, 14) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 19) (10, 14) (10, 15) (15, 4) (15, 10) (0, 18) (0, 5) (16, 8) (16, 12) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 11) (19, 13) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 11) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 19) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 9) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 8) (3, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 2) (9, 2) (9, 12) (5, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {18, 5}
Node 1: {13, 11, 19}
Node 2: {14, 9, 6, 11}
Node 3: {14, 17, 8, 12}
Node 4: {7, 6, 15}
Node 5: {0}
Node 6: {4, 7, 13, 2}
Node 7: {4, 6}
Node 8: {13, 16, 3}
Node 9: {2, 12}
Node 10: {14, 15}
Node 11: {14, 2, 1, 18, 19}
Node 12: {16, 3, 9}
Node 13: {8, 1, 19, 6}
Node 14: {17, 11, 3, 2, 10}
Node 15: {4, 10}
Node 16: {8, 12}
Node 17: {14, 3}
Node 18: {0, 19, 11}
Node 19: {13, 1, 18, 11}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, Node 11, Node 13, Node 14, Node 19

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 13: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 14: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 19: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 41

Therefore, the final answer is [41] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (13, 19, 11)>
<2, (14, 11, 10)>
<3, (8, 16, 12)>
<6, (4, 7, 13)>
<11, (14, 2, 1)>
<13, (8, 1, 19)>
<14, (17, 11, 3)>
<19, (13, 1, 18)>
