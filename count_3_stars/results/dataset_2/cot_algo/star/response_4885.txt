Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 17) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 16) (17, 10) (17, 15) (17, 18) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 14) (0, 15) (0, 13) (7, 18) (1, 11) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 3) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 19) (4, 19) (4, 3) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 4) (19, 3) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 0) (13, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 18) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 7) (18, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {15, 13}
- Node 1: {11, 6}
- Node 2: {6, 9}
- Node 3: {8, 4, 19, 18}
- Node 4: {19, 3}
- Node 5: {6, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 1, 2}
- Node 7: {18}
- Node 8: {14, 15, 3}
- Node 9: {11, 6, 2, 19}
- Node 10: {17, 5}
- Node 11: {16, 1, 9, 18, 15}
- Node 12: {14, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 12}
- Node 14: {5, 8, 12, 19}
- Node 15: {11, 17, 0, 8}
- Node 16: {11, 17}
- Node 17: {16, 10, 15, 18}
- Node 18: {11, 17, 7, 3}
- Node 19: {9, 14, 4, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star, <1, (11, 6, 2)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star, <3, (8, 19, 18)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star, <5, (6, 10, 14)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star, <6, (9, 5, 1)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star, <8, (14, 15, 3)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star, <9, (6, 2, 19)>
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star, <11, (1, 9, 18)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star, <14, (8, 12, 19)>
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star, <15, (17, 0, 8)>
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star, <17, (16, 10, 15)>
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star, <18, (17, 7, 3)>
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star, <19, (9, 14, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
