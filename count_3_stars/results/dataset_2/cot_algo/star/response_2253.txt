Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 12) (15, 2) (7, 19) (7, 5) (12, 15) (12, 1) (2, 3) (2, 15) (8, 1) (1, 12) (1, 8) (9, 10) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 18) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 14) (16, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 18) (11, 17) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 13) (17, 16) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 4) (14, 16) (14, 10) (14, 19) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 13) (4, 10) (4, 17) (18, 0) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 16) (5, 17) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 19) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 16, 10, 18
- Node 1: 12, 8
- Node 2: 3, 15
- Node 3: 2, 19, 5
- Node 4: 10, 17
- Node 5: 3, 7, 16, 17
- Node 6: 17, 18, 19, 13
- Node 7: 19, 5
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 10
- Node 10: 9, 0, 4, 13, 14
- Node 11: 18, 17
- Node 12: 15, 1
- Node 13: 10, 6, 19, 18
- Node 14: 16, 10, 19
- Node 15: 12, 2
- Node 16: 0, 17, 14, 5
- Node 17: 16, 11, 6, 5, 4
- Node 18: 0, 11, 6, 13
- Node 19: 3, 7, 6, 14, 13

Next, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form. Then we'll sum up the total number of 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3: 3C3 = 1
- Node 5: 4C3 = 4
- Node 6: 4C3 = 4
- Node 10: 5C3 = 10
- Node 13: 4C3 = 4
- Node 14: 3C3 = 1
- Node 16: 4C3 = 4
- Node 17: 5C3 = 10
- Node 18: 4C3 = 4
- Node 19: 5C3 = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (2, 19, 5)>
- <5, (3, 7, 16)>
- <6, (17, 18, 19)>
- <10, (9, 14, 13)>
- <13, (10, 6, 19)>
- <16, (0, 17, 5)>
- <17, (16, 6, 5)>
- <18, (11, 6, 13)>
- <19, (14, 4, 13)>
