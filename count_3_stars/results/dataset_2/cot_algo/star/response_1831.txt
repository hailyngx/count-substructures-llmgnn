Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 14) (17, 10) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 15) (8, 7) (8, 15) (12, 9) (12, 19) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 13) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 15) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 8) (15, 5) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 19) (16, 13) (13, 18) (13, 0) (13, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 13}
- Node 1: {10, 16}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 14, 15}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 14, 16}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 16, 19}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 15}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 8, 15}
- Node 8: {7, 15}
- Node 9: {4, 12, 18}
- Node 10: {1, 11, 17, 18}
- Node 11: {10, 14}
- Node 12: {9, 19}
- Node 13: {0, 16, 18}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 11}
- Node 15: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 16: {1, 3, 4, 13, 19}
- Node 17: {10}
- Node 18: {9, 10, 13, 19}
- Node 19: {4, 12, 16, 18}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: {5, 7, 14, 15}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 14, 16}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 16, 19}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 8, 15}
- Node 9: {4, 12, 18}
- Node 10: {1, 11, 17, 18}
- Node 13: {0, 16, 18}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 11}
- Node 15: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 16: {1, 3, 4, 13, 19}
- Node 18: {9, 10, 13, 19}
- Node 19: {4, 12, 16, 18}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star subgraphs by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up all these 3-star subgraphs: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [45].
