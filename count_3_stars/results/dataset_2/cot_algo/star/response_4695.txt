Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 11) (1, 9) (21, 1) (21, 23) (6, 16) (9, 1) (9, 22) (9, 12) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 5) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 22) (25, 14) (8, 24) (8, 27) (23, 21) (23, 25) (23, 29) (17, 29) (17, 24) (17, 12) (17, 4) (29, 23) (29, 17) (29, 11) (22, 9) (22, 25) (22, 11) (22, 24) (24, 3) (24, 8) (24, 17) (24, 22) (26, 18) (26, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 14) (19, 7) (15, 18) (15, 2) (15, 11) (18, 26) (18, 15) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 0) (10, 27) (10, 7) (10, 20) (11, 1) (11, 29) (11, 22) (11, 15) (11, 13) (2, 26) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 28) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 20) (7, 14) (20, 10) (20, 2) (20, 7) (12, 9) (12, 17) (4, 17) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 16) (14, 25) (14, 5) (14, 7) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 4) (27, 8) (27, 10) (27, 28) (27, 16) (28, 2) (28, 27) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 27) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {10, 13}
- Node 1: {9, 11, 21}
- Node 2: {15, 20, 26, 28}
- Node 3: {5, 24, 25}
- Node 4: {5, 13, 16, 17}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 14, 25}
- Node 6: {16}
- Node 7: {10, 14, 19, 20}
- Node 8: {24, 27}
- Node 9: {1, 12, 21, 22}
- Node 10: {0, 7, 20, 27}
- Node 11: {1, 13, 15, 22, 29}
- Node 12: {9, 17}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 11}
- Node 14: {5, 7, 25}
- Node 15: {2, 11, 18}
- Node 16: {4, 6, 27}
- Node 17: {4, 12, 24, 29}
- Node 18: {15, 26}
- Node 19: {7}
- Node 20: {2, 7, 10}
- Node 21: {1, 9, 23}
- Node 22: {9, 11, 24, 25}
- Node 23: {21, 25, 29}
- Node 24: {3, 8, 17, 22}
- Node 25: {3, 5, 14, 22, 23}
- Node 26: {2, 18}
- Node 27: {8, 10, 16, 28}
- Node 28: {2, 27}
- Node 29: {11, 17, 23}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors: 9, 11, 21 (<1, 9, 11, 21>)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors: 3, 4, 14 (<5, 3, 4, 14>)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors: 1, 12, 21, 22 (<9, 1, 12, 21, 22>)
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors: 0, 7, 20, 27 (<10, 0, 7, 20, 27>)
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with neighbors: 9, 11, 24, 25 (<22, 9, 11, 24, 25>)
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with neighbors: 3, 8, 17, 22 (<24, 3, 8, 17, 22>)
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with neighbors: 3, 5, 14, 22, 23 (<25, 3, 5, 14, 22, 23>)
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with neighbors: 8, 10, 16, 28 (<27, 8, 10, 16, 28>)

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have \([8]\).
