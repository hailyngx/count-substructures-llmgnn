Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 17) (5, 17) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 16) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (12, 3) (12, 7) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 17) (18, 16) (18, 1) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 13) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 16) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 6) (17, 15) (17, 5) (17, 8) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given edge list, we can construct the neighbor sets for each node:

1. Node 0: {4, 11, 14}
2. Node 1: {2, 6, 18, 19}
3. Node 2: {1, 9}
4. Node 3: {12, 14, 15, 16}
5. Node 4: {0, 7, 14, 19}
6. Node 5: {10, 17}
7. Node 6: {1, 13, 16}
8. Node 7: {4, 11, 12, 13}
9. Node 8: {9, 15, 17}
10. Node 9: {2, 8, 16}
11. Node 10: {5}
12. Node 11: {0, 7}
13. Node 12: {3, 7}
14. Node 13: {6, 7, 19}
15. Node 14: {0, 3, 4, 15}
16. Node 15: {3, 8, 14, 17}
17. Node 16: {3, 6, 9, 18}
18. Node 17: {8, 15, 5}
19. Node 18: {1, 16}
20. Node 19: {4, 13, 1}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, and Node 19 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 25 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [25], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (4, 11, 14)>, <1, (2, 6, 18)>, <4, (0, 7, 19)>, <7, (4, 11, 12)>, <8, (9, 15, 17)>, <9, (2, 8, 16)>, <14, (0, 3, 15)>, <15, (3, 8, 17)>, <16, (3, 6, 18)>, <17, (8, 15, 5)>, <19, (4, 13, 1)>
