Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 12) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 12) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {13, 9}
- Node 1: {7, 2, 11}
- Node 2: {4, 1, 13, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {11, 10, 12, 8}
- Node 4: {7, 13, 14, 2}
- Node 5: {7, 6, 12}
- Node 6: {5, 11, 12, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 9, 5, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 6, 3, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {7, 0, 14, 10}
- Node 10: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 11: {6, 14, 2, 3, 1}
- Node 12: {5, 6, 3, 13, 8}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 2, 12}
- Node 14: {4, 11, 9, 2}

Now, we will identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

3-stars:
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <4, 7, 13>
- <7, 4, 13>
- <11, 1, 14>
- <12, 5, 6>
- <13, 0, 12>
