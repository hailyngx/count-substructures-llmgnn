Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8 have 4 or more neighbors.

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars from each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
