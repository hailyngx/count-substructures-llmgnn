Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 0) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 10) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 10) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) 

Response:
We will first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 13, 14}
Node 1: {0, 6, 8, 10}
Node 2: {5, 7, 8, 10, 11}
Node 3: {0, 8, 10, 12, 14}
Node 4: {9, 10, 12, 14}
Node 5: {0, 2, 8}
Node 6: {1, 7, 12}
Node 7: {2, 6, 11, 12}
Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}
Node 9: {4, 11, 13}
Node 10: {1, 2, 3, 4}
Node 11: {2, 7, 9, 14}
Node 12: {3, 4, 6, 7}
Node 13: {0, 9, 8}
Node 14: {0, 3, 4, 11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 8, 10} -> <1, (0, 8, 10)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes {5, 8, 10} -> <2, (5, 8, 10)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 8, 14} -> <3, (0, 8, 14)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes {10, 12, 14} -> <4, (10, 12, 14)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes {2, 11, 12} -> <7, (2, 11, 12)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 2, 5} -> <8, (0, 2, 5)>
Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes {7, 9, 14} -> <11, (7, 9, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 6, and you should write this as [6].
