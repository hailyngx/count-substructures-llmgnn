Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 11) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (10, 6) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 1) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 2, 14, 10, 13}
- Node 1: {5, 11, 4}
- Node 2: {13, 14, 11, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 12, 4}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 1, 4, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 10, 3, 8, 13}
- Node 7: {6, 11, 8}
- Node 8: {6, 7, 11}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 14, 12}
- Node 10: {6, 0}
- Node 11: {7, 2, 8, 1}
- Node 12: {9, 13, 14, 3}
- Node 13: {6, 12, 2, 0}
- Node 14: {9, 12, 2, 0}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: No 3-star (has 2 neighbors only)
- Node 2: No 3-star (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: No 3-star (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: No 3-star (has 2 neighbors only)
- Node 8: No 3-star (has 2 neighbors only)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: No 3-star (has 1 neighbor only)
- Node 11: No 3-star (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 66

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [66], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 14, 10)>
<0, (2, 14, 13)>
<0, (2, 10, 13)>
<0, (14, 10, 13)>
<0, (5, 1, 4)>
<0, (5, 4, 3)>
<0, (5, 10, 13)>
<0, (14, 10, 13)>
<3, (5, 6, 12)>
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<5, (9, 1, 3)>
<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<5, (1, 4, 3)>
<6, (9, 7, 13)>
<9, (12, 14, 2)>
