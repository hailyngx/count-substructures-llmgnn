Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 18) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 23) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 2) (20, 25) (20, 12) (25, 20) (25, 15) (25, 0) (25, 24) (0, 25) (0, 1) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 19) (18, 16) (18, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 26) (19, 2) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 4) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 27) (26, 12) (9, 24) (9, 7) (22, 28) (22, 12) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 5) (10, 18) (15, 25) (15, 7) (27, 26) (27, 21) (4, 19) (4, 28) (4, 21) (12, 20) (12, 26) (12, 22) (12, 5) (28, 22) (28, 4) (23, 14) (23, 26) (23, 29) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 15) (7, 6) (6, 14) (6, 7) (21, 8) (21, 27) (21, 4) (29, 11) (29, 23) (24, 17) (24, 25) (24, 9) (24, 1) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 24) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighborhood of each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {1, 25}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {0, 13, 24}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {8, 17, 19}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {5, 11, 16}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {19, 21, 28}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {3, 8, 12, 13, 19}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {7, 14}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {6, 9, 11, 15}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {2, 5, 21, 26}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {7, 24}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {18}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {3, 7, 16, 29}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {5, 20, 22, 26}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {1, 5, 14}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {6, 13, 17, 23}
16. Node 15: Neighbors {7, 25}
17. Node 16: Neighbors {3, 11, 18}
18. Node 17: Neighbors {2, 14, 24}
19. Node 18: Neighbors {10, 16}
20. Node 19: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 26}
21. Node 20: Neighbors {12, 15, 25}
22. Node 21: Neighbors {4, 8, 27}
23. Node 23: Neighbors {14, 26, 29}
24. Node 24: Neighbors {1, 9, 17, 25}
25. Node 25: Neighbors {0, 15, 20, 24}
26. Node 26: Neighbors {8, 12, 19, 23, 27}
27. Node 27: Neighbors {21, 26}
28. Node 28: Neighbors {4, 22}
29. Node 29: Neighbors {11, 23}

Now, for the nodes that have three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 11: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars formed is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 22 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [22], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <11, 7, 15>
- <11, 7, 16>
- <11, 7, 29>
- <11, 15, 25>
- <14, 6, 7>
- <14, 6, 23>
- <14, 6, 13>
- <14, 13, 5>
- <24, 9, 7>
- <24, 9, 17>
- <24, 9, 1>
- <26, 12, 5>
- <26, 12, 20>
- <26, 12, 22>
- <26, 12, 28>
- <26, 21, 8>
- <26, 21, 27>
- <2, 17, 24>
- <2, 17, 14>
- <2, 19, 26>
- <2, 19, 5>
- <3, 11, 16>
