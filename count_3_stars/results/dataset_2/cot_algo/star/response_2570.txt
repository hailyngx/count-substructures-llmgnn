Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 3) (2, 25) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 26) (18, 23) (18, 10) (18, 24) (18, 21) (22, 26) (22, 10) (12, 27) (12, 28) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 20) (27, 8) (1, 12) (1, 26) (1, 5) (26, 29) (26, 22) (26, 1) (26, 13) (26, 23) (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 14) (16, 3) (16, 15) (28, 12) (28, 4) (28, 23) (3, 2) (3, 16) (3, 21) (3, 9) (21, 18) (21, 3) (21, 15) (8, 12) (8, 27) (8, 19) (8, 20) (8, 6) (19, 29) (19, 8) (19, 9) (19, 0) (23, 18) (23, 26) (23, 28) (6, 8) (7, 5) (14, 13) (14, 24) (14, 25) (14, 10) (15, 16) (15, 21) (9, 3) (9, 19) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 14) (10, 5) (20, 27) (20, 8) (20, 4) (0, 2) (0, 19) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 10) (4, 28) (4, 20) (4, 24) (24, 18) (24, 14) (24, 4) (24, 25) (25, 2) (25, 14) (25, 24) (11, 12) (11, 13) 

Response:
Calculating the number of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2
Node 1: 3
Node 2: 4
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 3
Node 6: 1
Node 7: 1
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 2
Node 10: 3
Node 11: 2
Node 12: 5
Node 13: 3
Node 14: 4
Node 15: 2
Node 16: 2
Node 18: 4
Node 19: 3
Node 20: 3
Node 21: 3
Node 22: 2
Node 23: 3
Node 24: 4
Node 25: 3
Node 26: 5
Node 27: 3
Node 28: 3
Node 29: 3

Based on the number of neighbors, the nodes forming 3-stars are:

Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
Node 12 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
Node 26 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 28 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 27 \).

Putting this final number inside brackets gives [27].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (25, 0, 29)>
<4, (28, 14, 10)>
<8, (20, 27, 19)>
<12, (28, 11, 1)>
<12, (13, 11, 27)>
<12, (13, 14, 26)>
<12, (13, 26, 1)>
<12, (14, 24, 25)>
<12, (26, 1, 13)>
<12, (26, 13, 23)>
<14, (24, 25, 10)>
<18, (23, 28, 21)>
<24, (25, 2, 14)>
<26, (13, 14, 11)>
<26, (13, 14, 23)>
<26, (13, 14, 24)>
<26, (13, 23, 28)>
<26, (13, 24, 25)>
<26, (14, 24, 25)>
<26, (23, 28, 21)>
<26, (24, 25, 2)>
<28, (23, 4, 20)>
<8, (20, 27, 8)>
<18, (28, 24, 10)>
<8, (19, 0, 29)>
<4, (20, 24, 18)>
<26, (25, 24, 10)>

These unique 3-stars have been listed inside <> each only once.
