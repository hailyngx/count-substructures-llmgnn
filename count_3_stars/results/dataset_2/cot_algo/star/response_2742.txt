Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {9, 7, 8, 5}
- Node 1: {9, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {8, 3}
- Node 3: {6, 9, 4, 5, 2}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 8, 3}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 7, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {6, 4, 0, 5, 1}
- Node 8: {4, 2, 0, 1}
- Node 9: {6, 3, 1, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 5, 7}, resulting in the 3-star <6, (9, 5, 7)>.
Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 8, 3}, resulting in the 3-star <4, (7, 8, 3)>.
Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 4, 0}, resulting in the 3-star <7, (6, 4, 0)>.
Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 4, 5}, resulting in the 3-star <3, (6, 4, 5)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4. Thus, the final answer is [4].
