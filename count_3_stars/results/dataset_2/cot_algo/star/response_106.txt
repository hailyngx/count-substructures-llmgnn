Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 22) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 4) (0, 20) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 14) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 29) (5, 25) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 25) (6, 13) (14, 20) (14, 27) (14, 7) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 26) (13, 29) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 21) (26, 17) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 23) (1, 9) (17, 26) (28, 26) (28, 9) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 12) (29, 20) (29, 5) (29, 13) (29, 10) (29, 12) (2, 22) (2, 12) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 21) (16, 21) (16, 18) (21, 4) (21, 26) (21, 22) (21, 16) (21, 24) (12, 19) (12, 29) (12, 2) (12, 25) (9, 1) (9, 28) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 27) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 11) (24, 21) (24, 10) (25, 5) (25, 6) (25, 12) (25, 9) (10, 3) (10, 29) (10, 24) (10, 7) (7, 14) (7, 19) (7, 10) (27, 14) (27, 9) (11, 18) (23, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 20
- Node 1: 5, 8, 9, 23
- Node 2: 12, 22
- Node 3: 10, 22
- Node 4: 8, 15, 19, 21
- Node 5: 1, 6, 25, 29
- Node 6: 5, 13, 15, 25
- Node 7: 10, 14, 19
- Node 8: 1, 4, 19
- Node 9: 1, 9, 18, 25, 27, 28
- Node 10: 3, 7, 24, 29
- Node 11: 18
- Node 12: 2, 19, 25, 29
- Node 13: 6, 26, 29
- Node 14: 7, 14, 20, 27
- Node 15: 4, 6, 19
- Node 16: 18, 21
- Node 17: 26
- Node 18: 9, 11, 16
- Node 19: 4, 8, 12, 15, 19, 7
- Node 20: 0, 14, 29
- Node 21: 4, 16, 21, 22, 24, 26
- Node 22: 2, 3, 21
- Node 23: 1
- Node 24: 10, 21
- Node 25: 5, 9, 12, 25
- Node 26: 13, 17, 21, 28
- Node 27: 9, 14
- Node 28: 9, 26
- Node 29: 5, 10, 12, 13, 20

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 19 3-stars: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 4, 5, 19 3-stars: [inom{6}{3} = 20]
- Node 9, 25, 28 3-stars: [inom{6}{3} = 20]
- Node 21 3-stars: [inom{6}{3} = 20]

Summing up the number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 64 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, 19, (5, 8, 9)> 
<4, 5, 19>
<9, 25, 28>
<21, (16, 24, 26)>
