Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor nodes {28}
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes {11, 25}
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes {9, 21}
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes {7, 10, 14, 18, 23}
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes {13, 24}
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes {7, 15, 21}
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes {10, 14, 23, 26}
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes {3, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes {23, 27}
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes {2, 18, 21, 29}
- Node 10: Neighbor nodes {3, 6}
- Node 11: Neighbor nodes {1, 13, 22}
- Node 12: Neighbor nodes {18, 29}
- Node 13: Neighbor nodes {11, 16, 4}
- Node 14: Neighbor nodes {6, 20, 26}
- Node 15: Neighbor nodes {5, 22, 23, 27}
- Node 16: Neighbor nodes {13, 18, 22}
- Node 17: Neighbor nodes {26, 28}
- Node 18: Neighbor nodes {3, 9, 12, 16, 29}
- Node 19: Neighbor nodes {25, 29}
- Node 20: Neighbor nodes {14}
- Node 21: Neighbor nodes {2, 5, 9, 29}
- Node 22: Neighbor nodes {11, 15, 16, 24, 25}
- Node 23: Neighbor nodes {3, 6, 8, 15}
- Node 24: Neighbor nodes {4, 22, 26}
- Node 25: Neighbor nodes {1, 19, 22}
- Node 26: Neighbor nodes {6, 14, 17, 24, 28}
- Node 27: Neighbor nodes {8, 15}
- Node 28: Neighbor nodes {0, 17, 26}
- Node 29: Neighbor nodes {9, 12, 18, 19, 21}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors that can form 3-stars are: 3, 6, 15, 18, 22, and 26.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors => inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors => inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors => inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors => inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors => inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors => inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Summing up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (7, 14, 18)>
<6, (10, 14, 26)>
<15, (5, 22, 27)>
<18, (9, 12, 29)>
<22, (11, 16, 25)>
<26, (17, 24, 28)>
