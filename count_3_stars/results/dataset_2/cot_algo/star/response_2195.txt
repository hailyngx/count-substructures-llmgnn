Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 23) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 21) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 29) (23, 19) (1, 16) (26, 16) (26, 7) (26, 17) (5, 6) (5, 29) (5, 20) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 7) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 17) (20, 5) (20, 15) (20, 18) (20, 28) (20, 10) (28, 6) (28, 20) (28, 25) (3, 7) (3, 22) (21, 8) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 4) (9, 11) (19, 8) (19, 23) (19, 4) (19, 0) (2, 24) (2, 14) (22, 3) (22, 4) (22, 12) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 22) (17, 26) (17, 15) (17, 27) (25, 28) (25, 9) (25, 14) (0, 19) (0, 29) (16, 1) (16, 26) (7, 26) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 27) (11, 9) (11, 13) (13, 11) (13, 10) (29, 23) (29, 5) (29, 0) (29, 12) (24, 2) (24, 27) (24, 12) (24, 10) (27, 17) (27, 7) (27, 24) (14, 23) (14, 2) (14, 25) (10, 20) (10, 13) (10, 24) (10, 12) (12, 22) (12, 29) (12, 24) (12, 10) (18, 15) (18, 20) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {19, 29}
- Node 1: {16}
- Node 2: {14, 24}
- Node 3: {7, 22}
- Node 4: {9, 19, 22}
- Node 5: {6, 20, 29}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 28}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 26, 27}
- Node 8: {9, 19, 21, 23}
- Node 9: {4, 8, 11, 19, 25}
- Node 10: {12, 13, 20, 24}
- Node 11: {9, 13}
- Node 12: {10, 22, 24, 29}
- Node 13: {10, 11}
- Node 14: {2, 23, 25}
- Node 15: {17, 18, 20}
- Node 16: {1, 26}
- Node 17: {15, 26, 27}
- Node 18: {15, 20}
- Node 19: {0, 4, 8, 23}
- Node 20: {5, 10, 15, 18, 28}
- Node 21: {8}
- Node 22: {3, 4, 12}
- Node 23: {8, 14, 19, 29}
- Node 24: {2, 10, 12, 24}
- Node 25: {9, 14, 28}
- Node 26: {7, 16, 17}
- Node 27: {7, 24, 17}
- Node 28: {6, 20, 25}
- Node 29: {0, 5, 12, 23}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <8, 19, 23>
- <8, 19, 9>
- <8, 19, 14>
- <9, 19, 4>
- <9, 19, 23>
- <19, 23, 29>
- <20, 10, 24>
- <23, 8, 19>
