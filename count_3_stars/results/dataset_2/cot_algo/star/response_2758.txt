Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors = {4, 6, 2, 1}
2. Node 1: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 8}
3. Node 2: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 0}
4. Node 3: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 6, 8}
5. Node 4: Neighbors = {9, 7, 2, 0, 3, 6}
6. Node 5: Neighbors = {6, 2, 8, 1, 3}
7. Node 6: Neighbors = {5, 4, 1, 3, 0}
8. Node 7: Neighbors = {4, 2}
9. Node 8: Neighbors = {5, 3, 1}
10. Node 9: Neighbors = {4, 3, 1}

Now, let's check for nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars.
   <1, (5, 9, 6)>, <1, (5, 9, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (9, 6, 8)>

2. Node 2 and Node 4 also have 4 neighbors, and since they form the same 3-stars, we count them only once.
   <2, (5, 4, 7)> or <4, (5, 2, 7)>

3. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = [10] 3-stars.
   <3, (5, 4, 9)>, <3, (5, 4, 6)>, <3, (5, 4, 8)>, <3, (5, 9, 6)>, <3, (5, 9, 8)>, <3, (4, 9, 6)>, <3, (4, 9, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (9, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is [4] + [10] = [14].
