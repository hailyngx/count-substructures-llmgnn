Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <0, (5, 9, 8)>

Counting unique 3-stars, we have a total of [1].
