Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 6) (4, 1) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 3) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) 

Response:
From the given information, we can construct the adjacency list for each node based on the edges provided:

- Node 0: {2, 10, 12, 3}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 1, 10, 0}
- Node 3: {6, 13, 0, 10, 7}
- Node 4: {6, 1}
- Node 5: {13, 2, 7, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 13, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 6, 13, 3}
- Node 8: {2, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {6, 11, 7}
- Node 10: {2, 0, 3}
- Node 11: {9, 8, 14, 1}
- Node 12: {8, 14, 0}
- Node 13: {5, 6, 3, 14, 7}
- Node 14: {12, 1, 5, 11, 13}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 68

Therefore, the final answer is [68], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 3, 10)>, <2, (5, 13, 14)>, <3, (6, 13, 7)>, <6, (9, 7, 13)>, <7, (5, 9, 13)>, <11, (9, 8, 14)>, <13, (5, 6, 7)>, <14, (12, 11, 13)>
