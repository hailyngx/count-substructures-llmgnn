Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 1) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 8) (22, 19) (22, 11) (23, 9) (23, 27) (19, 22) (19, 26) (19, 16) (19, 27) (26, 14) (26, 19) (26, 13) (11, 22) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 0) (28, 5) (13, 17) (13, 26) (13, 7) (13, 6) (20, 17) (20, 8) (20, 18) (20, 10) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 15) (21, 3) (21, 6) (21, 5) (10, 14) (10, 20) (10, 15) (10, 24) (15, 16) (15, 10) (15, 5) (9, 23) (9, 4) (29, 7) (6, 13) (6, 21) (6, 18) (24, 11) (24, 10) (24, 7) (24, 2) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 29) (7, 24) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (5, 28) (5, 21) (5, 15) (5, 4) (8, 3) (8, 20) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (25, 12) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 25) (18, 20) (18, 6) (2, 24) (2, 4) (27, 23) (27, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 11}
- Node 1: {3, 12, 16, 17}
- Node 2: {4, 24}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 8, 21}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 15, 21, 28}
- Node 6: {13, 18, 21}
- Node 7: {11, 13, 24, 29}
- Node 8: {3, 20}
- Node 9: {4, 23}
- Node 10: {14, 15, 20, 24}
- Node 11: {0, 7, 22, 24}
- Node 12: {1, 17, 25}
- Node 13: {6, 7, 17, 26}
- Node 14: {10, 17, 26}
- Node 15: {5, 10, 16}
- Node 16: {1, 15, 19}
- Node 17: {1, 12, 13, 14, 20}
- Node 18: {6, 20}
- Node 19: {16, 19, 22, 26, 27}
- Node 20: {8, 10, 17, 18}
- Node 21: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 22: {11, 19}
- Node 23: {9, 27}
- Node 24: {2, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 25: {12}
- Node 26: {13, 14, 19}
- Node 27: {19, 23}
- Node 28: {5}
- Node 29: {7}

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives: 
\[4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 52 \] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 3, 8>
- <1, 3, 12>
- <1, 3, 16>
- <1, 8, 20>
- <3, 5, 21>
- <4, 9, 23>
- <5, 15, 28>
- <7, 11, 24>
- <10, 15, 16>
- <12, 17, 25>
- <17, 19, 26>
- <19, 22, 27>
