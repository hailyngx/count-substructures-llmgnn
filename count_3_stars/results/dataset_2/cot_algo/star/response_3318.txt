Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 16) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 18) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (17, 0) (17, 5) (5, 17) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 18) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 0) (15, 18) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (12, 3) (16, 4) (16, 10) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 13) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) (14, 8) (14, 13) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 18) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 14) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 5, 15, 17, 18}
- Node 1: {5, 13, 19}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {16, 19}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 17}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {3, 11, 18}
- Node 8: {2, 8, 9, 14, 18}
- Node 9: {2, 8, 11}
- Node 10: {3, 10, 16, 18}
- Node 11: {7, 9, 10}
- Node 12: {3}
- Node 13: {1, 14, 19}
- Node 14: {8, 13}
- Node 15: {0, 18}
- Node 16: {4, 10}
- Node 17: {0, 5}
- Node 18: {0, 7, 8, 10, 15}
- Node 19: {1, 4, 13}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Since the other nodes with three or more neighbors do not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 40. 

Therefore, the final answer is [40], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 5, 18)>
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <8, (2, 9, 18)>
- <18, (0, 7, 10)>
