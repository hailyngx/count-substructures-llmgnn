Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 11) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node: 

- Node 0: {8, 13, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {13, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 10, 6, 12, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 8, 13, 14, 2}
- Node 5: {8, 0, 11}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 14, 10}
- Node 7: {1, 10, 11, 2}
- Node 8: {13, 4, 5, 11, 12, 0}
- Node 9: {13, 0, 2}
- Node 10: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 11: {8, 14, 7, 5}
- Node 12: {8, 13, 3}
- Node 13: {8, 12, 4, 2, 9, 0}
- Node 14: {4, 6, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: forms 4 *inom{4}{3}* = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: forms 5 *inom{5}{3}* = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: forms 5 *inom{5}{3}* = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: forms 6 *inom{6}{3}* = 20 3-stars
- Node 13: forms 6 *inom{6}{3}* = 20 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is [64].

The unique 3-stars found are:
