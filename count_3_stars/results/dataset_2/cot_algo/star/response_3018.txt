Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 29) (15, 21) (14, 11) (14, 29) (14, 25) (17, 10) (17, 23) (17, 5) (17, 27) (7, 21) (7, 20) (7, 19) (7, 23) (7, 26) (21, 15) (21, 7) (21, 0) (21, 26) (18, 0) (22, 16) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 27) (13, 8) (13, 19) (12, 28) (27, 17) (27, 8) (10, 17) (10, 23) (0, 21) (0, 18) (0, 8) (11, 14) (28, 3) (28, 12) (28, 1) (28, 5) (24, 26) (24, 1) (24, 20) (26, 7) (26, 21) (26, 24) (2, 9) (2, 6) (5, 17) (5, 28) (5, 20) (4, 1) (4, 29) (4, 6) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 13) (1, 28) (1, 24) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 23) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (20, 7) (20, 24) (20, 5) (20, 16) (9, 2) (9, 23) (16, 22) (16, 20) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 10) (23, 1) (23, 9) (25, 14) (25, 29) (29, 3) (29, 15) (29, 14) (29, 4) (29, 25) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first determine the neighbors of each node:

1. Nodes with 3 neighbors:
   - Node 3: {15, 28, 29}
   - Node 7: {21, 19, 23}
   - Node 8: {13, 0, 27}
   - Node 13: {8, 19, 28}
   - Node 14: {11, 29, 25}
   - Node 15: {3, 19, 6}
   - Node 17: {10, 23, 5}
   - Node 20: {7, 24, 5}
   - Node 23: {17, 7, 10}
   - Node 26: {7, 21, 24}
   - Node 28: {3, 12, 1}
   - Node 29: {3, 14, 25}

2. Nodes with 2 neighbors:
   - Node 0: {21, 18}
   - Node 1: {28, 24}
   - Node 2: {9, 6}
   - Node 4: {1, 29}
   - Node 5: {17, 28}

3. Nodes with 1 neighbor:
   - Node 6: {15}
   - Node 9: {2}
   - Node 10: {17}
   - Node 11: {14}
   - Node 12: {28}
   - Node 16: {22}
   - Node 18: {0}
   - Node 19: {15}
   - Node 21: {15}
   - Node 22: {16}
   - Node 24: {26}
   - Node 25: {14}
   - Node 27: {17}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed around nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 11 nodes -> 11 * 1 = 11 3-stars
- For nodes with 2 neighbors: 5 nodes -> 5 * 0 = 0 3-stars
- For nodes with 1 neighbor: No 3-stars are formed.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 11, which is represented as [11].

Unique 3-stars found:
<3, (15, 28, 29)>
<7, (21, 19, 23)>
<8, (13, 0, 27)>
<13, (8, 19, 28)>
<14, (11, 29, 25)>
<15, (3, 19, 6)>
<17, (10, 23, 5)>
<20, (7, 24, 5)>
<23, (17, 7, 10)>
<26, (7, 21, 24)>
<28, (3, 12, 1)>
<29, (3, 14, 25)>
