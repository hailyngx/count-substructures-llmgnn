Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 18) (7, 9) (7, 0) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 8) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 7) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 6) (10, 16) (10, 14) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 13) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 16) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (12, 18) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 19) (16, 10) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 8) (3, 13) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 14) (8, 18) (8, 16) (19, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {6, 9, 14}
- Node 2: {6, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {13}
- Node 4: {5, 18}
- Node 5: {4, 9, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 12, 15, 16}
- Node 7: {0, 9}
- Node 8: {16, 18}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 7, 15, 17}
- Node 10: {14, 16}
- Node 11: {2, 14}
- Node 12: {6, 16, 18, 19}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 5, 17}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 10, 11}
- Node 15: {6, 9, 18}
- Node 16: {6, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 17: {9, 13, 18}
- Node 18: {4, 8, 12, 15, 17}
- Node 19: {12}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 
\[ 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 52 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 11, 14>, <2, 13, 14>, <5, 9, 13>, <6, 12, 16>, <6, 15, 18>, <6, 16, 18>, <9, 13, 17>, <12, 16, 18>
