Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5
- Node 5: 0, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars for each such node:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the final answer is [40].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
