Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 6) (22, 28) (15, 20) (15, 1) (15, 29) (15, 28) (27, 10) (27, 9) (14, 4) (14, 10) (17, 18) (7, 21) (7, 25) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 19) (21, 24) (20, 15) (20, 26) (20, 8) (20, 28) (29, 15) (29, 5) (28, 22) (28, 15) (28, 20) (28, 8) (3, 21) (3, 11) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 23) (25, 7) (25, 16) (25, 4) (25, 2) (1, 15) (1, 23) (1, 0) (8, 20) (8, 28) (8, 19) (8, 10) (19, 21) (19, 8) (19, 6) (19, 0) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 25) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 10) (16, 25) (16, 26) (6, 22) (6, 19) (6, 24) (24, 21) (24, 6) (24, 9) (24, 2) (23, 11) (23, 1) (2, 25) (2, 24) (2, 5) (5, 29) (5, 3) (5, 2) (18, 17) (26, 7) (26, 20) (26, 16) (26, 0) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 26) (10, 27) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 12) (9, 13) (9, 27) (9, 24) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 1
- Node 18: degree 1
- Node 19: degree 4
- Node 20: degree 4
- Node 21: degree 4
- Node 22: degree 3
- Node 23: degree 2
- Node 24: degree 4
- Node 25: degree 4
- Node 26: degree 4
- Node 27: degree 2
- Node 28: degree 4
- Node 29: degree 2

We can see that nodes 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, and 28 have 3 or more neighbors, which means they have the potential to form 3-stars. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <4, 25, 2>
- <4, 14, 10>
- <4, 13, 9>
- <6, 24, 2>
- <6, 19, 21>
- <7, 25, 16>
- <7, 21, 3>
- <8, 28, 20>
- <8, 19, 21>
- <8, 10, 12>
- <9, 27, 10>
- <9, 24, 6>
