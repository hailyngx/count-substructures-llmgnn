Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 4) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 17) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (17, 15) (17, 19) (17, 18) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 16) (7, 11) (7, 13) (16, 9) (16, 5) (12, 2) (12, 14) (18, 8) (18, 17) (18, 1) (19, 17) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 16) (0, 3) (14, 12) (14, 6) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 4) (1, 8) (1, 18) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 6) 

Response:
There are multiple steps we need to take to find the number of 3-stars in this graph:
1. Calculate the degree of each node to identify their neighbors.
2. Create a list of all 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's start with step 1:
- Node 0 has a degree of 1 and its neighbor is 3.
- Node 1 has a degree of 3 and its neighbors are 8, 18, and 2.
- Node 2 has a degree of 5 and its neighbors are 8, 12, 5, 9, and 4.
- Node 3 has a degree of 3 and its neighbors are 11, 0, and 9.
- Node 4 has a degree of 4 and its neighbors are 2, 10, 13, and 6.
- Node 5 has a degree of 4 and its neighbors are 2, 11, 15, and 16.
- Node 6 has a degree of 3 and its neighbors are 10, 14, and 4.
- Node 7 has a degree of 2 and its neighbors are 11 and 13.
- Node 8 has a degree of 5 and its neighbors are 2, 9, 11, 1, and 18.
- Node 9 has a degree of 4 and its neighbors are 2, 8, 3, and 16.
- Node 10 has a degree of 3 and its neighbors are 15, 6, and 4.
- Node 11 has a degree of 5 and its neighbors are 8, 3, 7, 13, and 5.
- Node 12 has a degree of 2 and its neighbors are 2 and 14.
- Node 13 has a degree of 4 and its neighbors are 11, 4, 7, and 13.
- Node 14 has a degree of 2 and its neighbors are 12 and 6.
- Node 15 has a degree of 3 and its neighbors are 10, 5, and 17.
- Node 16 has a degree of 2 and its neighbors are 9 and 5.
- Node 17 has a degree of 3 and its neighbors are 15, 19, and 18.
- Node 18 has a degree of 3 and its neighbors are 8, 17, and 1.
- Node 19 has a degree of 1 and its neighbor is 17.

Next, let's move to step 2 and find the number of 3-stars present in the graph:
Since multiple nodes have more than 3 neighbors, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2 and Node 8 both have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 5, Node 11, and Node 17 have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 3-stars from Node 2, 10 3-stars from Node 8, 4 3-stars from Node 5, 4 3-stars from Node 11, and 4 3-stars from Node 17. This gives us a total of \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32 \) 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [32], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (8, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 18, 1)>, <5, (2, 11, 15)>, <11, (8, 3, 5)>, <17, (15, 19, 18)>
