Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 3) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 10) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 14, 3, 6}
- Node 1: {7, 8, 10}
- Node 2: {9, 8, 12, 6, 10}
- Node 3: {7, 0, 12, 6}
- Node 4: {9, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 12, 11, 10}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 11, 3}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 8: {9, 13, 2, 10, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 4, 2}
- Node 10: {5, 8, 2, 1}
- Node 11: {5, 13, 14, 6}
- Node 12: {5, 4, 2, 3}
- Node 13: {5, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {4, 13, 0, 11}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 2: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 3: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 5: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 8: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 9: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 10: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 11: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 12: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 13: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 14: 4 choose 3 = 4

Summing these up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (7, 14, 3)>
- <2, (9, 8, 6)>
- <3, (7, 12, 6)>
- <5, (9, 13, 11)>
- <8, (9, 13, 10)>
- <9, (5, 4, 2)>
- <10, (5, 8, 1)>
- <11, (5, 13, 14)>
- <12, (5, 4, 3)>
- <13, (5, 8, 14)>
- <14, (4, 13, 11)>
