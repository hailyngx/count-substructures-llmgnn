Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 9}
Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 3: {4, 5, 9}
Node 4: {1, 3, 8}
Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 6}
Node 6: {0, 2, 5}
Node 7: {2, 8, 9}
Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 7}
Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each:

Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from node 1) + 20 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 8) + 10 (from node 9) = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>.
