Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 9) (1, 12) (1, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 13) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 7) (9, 4) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {11, 6}
- Node 1: {12, 4}
- Node 2: {8, 12, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {14, 2, 12, 4}
- Node 4: {6, 1, 3, 2, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 12}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 0, 4}
- Node 7: {10, 11, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 14, 2, 12}
- Node 9: {10, 14, 12, 7, 4}
- Node 10: {11, 7, 9}
- Node 11: {10, 14, 7, 13, 0}
- Node 12: {5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 9}
- Node 13: {11, 14, 4}

Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 8, and Node 12 have 4 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} = 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 58 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <2, (8, 12, 4)>
- <3, (12, 2, 4)>
- <4, (6, 1, 3)>
- <8, (5, 12, 2)>
- <12, (5, 2, 8)>
