Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 12) (0, 1) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 8, 10}
- Node 4: {2, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 8, 12}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {9, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 13: {8, 9, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 8, 10, 13}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with (0, 5, 8), (3, 8, 13), and (5, 7, 12). Total 3-stars: 3
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star with (4, 6, 9).
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star with (8, 10, 13).
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star with (1, 6, 7).
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star with (5, 8, 12).
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star with (1, 3, 13).
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star with (6, 11, 13) and 1 3-star with (9, 12, 13). Total 3-stars: 2
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star with (2, 13, 14).
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star with (5, 7, 13) and 1 3-star with (0, 9, 13). Total 3-stars: 2
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star with (8, 9, 14).
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star with (2, 10, 13).

Total number of 3-stars = 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 14

So, the final answer is [14].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, 5, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 8, 13>, <5, 1, 7>, <5, 7, 12>, <1, 3, 13>, <6, 9, 11>, <9, 12, 13>, <2, 10, 14>.
