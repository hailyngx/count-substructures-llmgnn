Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 6, 8}
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 5, 8}
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 3, 5}

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4, represented as [4]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (7, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
