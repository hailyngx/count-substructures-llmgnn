Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 28) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 28) (9, 26) (9, 17) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 2) (26, 8) (3, 25) (3, 29) (3, 19) (25, 3) (25, 20) (7, 21) (7, 15) (21, 7) (21, 11) (21, 24) (20, 25) (20, 16) (28, 13) (28, 22) (28, 29) (28, 24) (29, 3) (29, 28) (29, 12) (1, 6) (1, 0) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 23) (15, 17) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 5) (4, 10) (4, 23) (4, 14) (4, 17) (12, 29) (12, 18) (16, 20) (16, 6) (6, 1) (6, 16) (6, 2) (6, 0) (23, 15) (23, 4) (23, 18) (19, 22) (19, 3) (19, 11) (2, 26) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 24) (2, 11) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 14) (11, 21) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 27) (18, 12) (18, 23) (18, 17) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 24) (0, 8) (24, 9) (24, 21) (24, 28) (24, 2) (24, 0) (14, 4) (14, 5) (27, 11) (17, 9) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 18) (8, 26) (8, 0) 

Response:
Since we are given a graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {1, 6, 8, 24}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6, 11, 24, 26}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {19, 25, 29}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {10, 14, 15, 17, 23}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {2, 10, 14}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {15, 21}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {0, 26}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {17, 24, 26}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {4, 5, 15}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {2, 19, 21, 27}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {18, 29}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {22, 28}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {4, 5}
16. Node 15: Neighbors {4, 7, 10, 17, 23}
17. Node 16: Neighbors {6, 20}
18. Node 17: Neighbors {4, 9, 15, 18}
19. Node 18: Neighbors {12, 17, 23}
20. Node 19: Neighbors {3, 11, 22}
21. Node 20: Neighbors {16, 25}
22. Node 21: Neighbors {7, 11, 24}
23. Node 23: Neighbors {4, 15, 18}
24. Node 24: Neighbors {0, 2, 9, 21, 28}
25. Node 25: Neighbors {3, 20}
26. Node 26: Neighbors {2, 8, 9}
27. Node 27: Neighbors {11}
28. Node 28: Neighbors {13, 22, 24, 29}
29. Node 29: Neighbors {3, 12, 28}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

1. Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
2. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
3. Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
4. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
6. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7. Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
8. Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
9. Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
10. Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
11. Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars from the nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] unique 3-stars formed in this graph.
The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (5, 6, 11)>, <2, (5, 6, 24)>, <2, (5, 11, 24)>, <2, (6, 11, 24)>, <4, (10, 14, 15)>, <4, (10, 15, 17)>, <4, (14, 15, 17)>, <9, (17, 24, 26)>, <11, (2, 19, 21)>, <15, (4, 10, 17)>, <24, (0, 2, 28)>, <28, (13, 22, 29)>
