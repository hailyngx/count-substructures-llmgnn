Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 9

Next, calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \(  \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: It has 4 neighbors (1, 6, 7, 9) which is less than 3, so no 3-stars.
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: It has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 6) which is exactly 3, so 1 3-star.
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>
