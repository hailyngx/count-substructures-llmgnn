Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {9, 3, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {4, 7, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {6, 9, 3, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {9, 0, 2, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 7, 6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {7, 6, 8, 2}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {4, 9, 5, 1, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {4, 9, 5, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {4, 3, 5, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {7, 6, 2, 3, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 9, 0, 2: <3, (9, 0, 2)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 6, 8: <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 7, 6, 8: <5, (7, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 9, 5: <6, (4, 9, 5)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 3, 5: <8, (4, 3, 5)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 7, 6, 2: <9, (7, 6, 2)>

Since there's 6 unique 3-stars identified, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
