Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 17) (16, 13) (16, 14) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 15) (7, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 18) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 16) (13, 12) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 15) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 19) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 17) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 0) (15, 7) (15, 10) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 12) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 0) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 8, 11, 14, 19
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 12
- Node 2: 14, 18, 19
- Node 3: 1, 9, 12, 18
- Node 4: 1, 5, 10
- Node 5: 0, 4, 14
- Node 6: 1, 17
- Node 7: 9, 15
- Node 8: 0, 10, 12
- Node 9: 3, 7, 12
- Node 10: 4, 8, 15
- Node 11: 0, 17
- Node 12: 1, 3, 8, 9, 13
- Node 13: 12, 16
- Node 14: 0, 2, 5, 16
- Node 15: 7, 10
- Node 16: 13, 14
- Node 17: 6, 11, 19
- Node 18: 2, 3
- Node 19: 0, 2, 17

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 5 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 0: \(C(6, 3) = 20\)
- For Node 1: \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
- For Node 3: \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
- For Node 12: \(C(5, 3) = 10\)
- For Node 14: \(C(4, 3) = 4\)

Adding these up, we get a total of 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [42] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 5, 14>, <0, 8, 10, 15>, <1, 3, 9, 12>, <1, 4, 6, 12>, <3, 9, 12, 18>, <5, 0, 14, 16>
