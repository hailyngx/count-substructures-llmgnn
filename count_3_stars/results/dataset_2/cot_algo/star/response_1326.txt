Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
This graph forms the following 3-stars:
1. Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 8, 9: <2, (4, 8, 9)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 4, 7: <3, (1, 4, 7)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 7, 8: <4, (2, 7, 8)>
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 3, 6: <7, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
