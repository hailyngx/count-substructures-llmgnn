Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 6) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 2) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 5) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 11, 12, 10, 5, 2}
- Node 1: {4, 3, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 13, 14, 0, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 11, 10, 6, 2}
- Node 4: {8, 1, 11}
- Node 5: {11, 12, 0, 10, 2}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 8, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 7: {10, 9, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 0, 6}
- Node 9: {7, 6}
- Node 10: {7, 3, 6, 0, 5}
- Node 11: {4, 3, 14, 0, 5}
- Node 12: {13, 6, 5, 0}
- Node 13: {12, 2}
- Node 14: {11, 2}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12 have 6 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 98 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [98].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (8, 11, 12)>
- <0, (8, 10, 5)>
- <0, (8, 10, 2)>
- <0, (11, 5, 2)>
- <2, (3, 13, 14)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <3, (6, 10, 0)>
- <5, (12, 0, 10)>
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- <6, (12, 5, 0)>
- <10, (7, 3, 6)>
- <11, (4, 5, 0)>
