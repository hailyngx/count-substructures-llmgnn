Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (17, 1) (17, 9) (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 17) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (0, 14) (0, 19) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 16) (18, 15) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 16) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 10) (7, 14) (1, 17) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 11) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 19) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 6) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 16) (8, 15) (8, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 14, 19
Node 1 neighbors: 17, 10
Node 2 neighbors: 3, 14, 12, 6
Node 3 neighbors: 6, 16, 13, 2
Node 4 neighbors: 18, 12, 16
Node 5 neighbors: 9, 13
Node 6 neighbors: 3, 2, 11
Node 7 neighbors: 14
Node 8 neighbors: 15, 10
Node 9 neighbors: 17, 5, 11, 10
Node 10 neighbors: 1, 9, 13, 8
Node 11 neighbors: 9, 12, 6
Node 12 neighbors: 15, 4, 2, 11
Node 13 neighbors: 3, 5, 10
Node 14 neighbors: 0, 7, 2
Node 15 neighbors: 18, 8, 12
Node 16 neighbors: 3, 4, 18, 19
Node 17 neighbors: 1, 9
Node 18 neighbors: 15, 4, 16, 19
Node 19 neighbors: 0, 18, 16

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: <6, (3, 2, 11)>
Node 10 has 4 neighbors: <10, (1, 9, 13)> 
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: <12, (15, 11, 4)>
Node 16 has 4 neighbors: <16, (3, 4, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
