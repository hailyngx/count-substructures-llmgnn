Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 20) (13, 0) (13, 27) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 11) (26, 4) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 29) (11, 26) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (6, 1) (6, 12) (21, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (15, 16) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 20) (19, 11) (19, 5) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 23) (25, 18) (27, 13) (27, 25) (27, 9) (27, 8) (16, 15) (16, 29) (16, 8) (2, 12) (2, 20) (2, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 29) (17, 9) (0, 13) (0, 8) (28, 22) (28, 23) (18, 11) (18, 25) (18, 23) (23, 25) (23, 28) (23, 18) (8, 27) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 29) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 7) (14, 10) (22, 28) (22, 14) (4, 26) (4, 2) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 27) (9, 17) (9, 4) (20, 13) (20, 5) (20, 2) (29, 3) (29, 16) (29, 12) (29, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (24, 12) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {8, 13}
- Node 1: {6, 10}
- Node 2: {4, 12, 20}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 11, 29}
- Node 4: {2, 9, 26}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 10, 19, 20}
- Node 6: {1, 12}
- Node 7: {5, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 14, 16, 27, 29}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 17, 27}
- Node 10: {1, 5, 14}
- Node 11: {3, 18, 19, 26}
- Node 12: {2, 6, 24, 29}
- Node 13: {0, 20, 21, 26, 27}
- Node 14: {7, 8, 10, 22}
- Node 15: {16}
- Node 16: {8, 15, 29}
- Node 17: {9}
- Node 18: {11, 23, 25}
- Node 19: {5, 11}
- Node 20: {2, 5, 13}
- Node 21: {13}
- Node 22: {14, 28}
- Node 23: {18, 28}
- Node 24: {12}
- Node 25: {18, 26, 27}
- Node 26: {11, 13, 25}
- Node 27: {8, 13, 25, 9}
- Node 28: {22, 23}
- Node 29: {3, 12, 16, 8}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 27 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 29 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (5, 9, 29)>
<5, (3, 10, 19)>
<8, (14, 16, 29)>
<13, (20, 21, 27)>
<27, (13, 25, 9)>
