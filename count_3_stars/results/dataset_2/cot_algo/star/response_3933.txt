Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (15, 3) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 19) (4, 15) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 19) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (18, 19) (18, 5) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 17) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 13) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 16) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 18) (7, 10) (7, 2) (13, 14) (13, 16) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {19}
- Node 1: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 10, 14, 15}
- Node 3: {15, 17}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 15}
- Node 5: {1, 8, 18}
- Node 6: {4, 9, 12, 15}
- Node 7: {2, 10}
- Node 8: {1, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {2, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {9, 10, 19}
- Node 12: {6, 9, 15, 16}
- Node 13: {14, 16}
- Node 14: {2, 10, 13}
- Node 15: {2, 3, 4, 6, 12}
- Node 16: {12, 13, 17}
- Node 17: {3, 16, 19}
- Node 18: {5, 19}
- Node 19: {0, 11, 17, 18}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get a total of 31 3-stars. Therefore, the final number is [31].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (5, 9, 12)>
- <2, (7, 10, 14)>
- <2, (7, 10, 2)>
- <2, (10, 14, 13)>
- <2, (10, 14, 13)>
- <2, (14, 7, 10)>
- <2, (14, 10, 2)>
- <4, (6, 9, 12)>
- <5, (1, 8, 18)>
- <6, (4, 9, 12)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>
- <10, (7, 11, 19)>
- <11, (9, 10, 14)>
- <12, (6, 4, 15)>
- <14, (2, 10, 13)>
- <15, (6, 12, 16)>
- <16, (12, 13, 17)>
- <19, (11, 17, 18)>
