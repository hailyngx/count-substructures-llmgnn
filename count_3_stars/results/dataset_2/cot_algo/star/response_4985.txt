Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 17) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 8) (10, 17) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 3) (11, 19) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 12) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 5) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 18) (18, 16) (18, 9) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 12) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 2) (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 14) (2, 14) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 9) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 5, 9, 6
Node 1: 17, 14, 13, 12
Node 2: 14
Node 3: 15, 11, 0, 4, 12
Node 4: 3, 7, 5, 16
Node 5: 4, 0, 19
Node 6: 17, 0, 13
Node 7: 4, 8
Node 8: 7, 16, 14
Node 9: 18, 0, 12
Node 10: 17
Node 11: 3, 19
Node 12: 3, 1, 9
Node 13: 15, 17, 1, 6
Node 14: 1, 8, 2
Node 15: 3, 13, 17
Node 16: 4, 8, 18
Node 17: 15, 10, 1, 6, 19
Node 18: 16, 9
Node 19: 17, 5, 11

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 17, 13
Nodes with 4 neighbors: None
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 3, 0

For nodes with 3 neighbors, apply \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For nodes with 5 neighbors, as there are exactly 3 leaves:
- Node 3: 1 
- Node 0: 1

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 16

Therefore, the final answer is [16]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<17, (15, 1, 6)>, <13, (15, 1, 17)>, <3, (15, 11, 4)>, <0, (5, 9, 6)>
