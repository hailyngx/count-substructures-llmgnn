Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {6, 8, 5, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 0}
- Node 3: {6, 1, 7, 5, 0}
- Node 4: {1, 8, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {6, 3, 4, 2, 0, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 1, 3, 5, 0}
- Node 8: {6, 4, 0}
- Node 9: {7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 6 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (6, 8, 5)>
- <0, (6, 5, 3)>
- <0, (6, 3, 7)>
- <0, (8, 4, 5)>
- <0, (5, 4, 2)>
- <3, (6, 1, 7)>
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <3, (4, 8, 2)>
- <5, (6, 3, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 1)>
- <5, (4, 2, 0)>
- <7, (9, 1, 3)>
- <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- <7, (3, 5, 0)>
