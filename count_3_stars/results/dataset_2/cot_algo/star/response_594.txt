Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 14) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 13) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 14) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 9) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 1) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 9, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {5, 14}
- Node 4: {5, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 10}
- Node 7: {5, 8, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {1, 7, 13}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 11}
- Node 11: {1, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {1, 2, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 12}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
\[
\binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} = 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 94
\]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [94].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 9, 12)>
- <1, (2, 12, 14)>
- <1, (5, 8, 14)>
- <1, (7, 9, 14)>
- <1, (11, 13, 14)>
- <2, (6, 10, 13)>
- <5, (3, 7, 14)>
- <5, (4, 8, 12)>
- <5, (7, 8, 14)>
- <7, (9, 11, 13)>
- <8, (7, 9, 13)>
- <12, (1, 4, 14)>
- <12, (2, 4, 14)>
- <12, (4, 5, 14)>
- <12, (8, 11, 13)>
- <13, (0, 2, 9)>
- <13, (0, 9, 11)>
- <13, (2, 6, 10)>
- <13, (8, 11, 14)>
- <14, (1, 3, 5)>
- <14, (1, 3, 7)>
- <14, (1, 3, 12)>
- <14, (1, 4, 12)>
- <14, (1, 5, 7)>
- <14, (1, 5, 12)>
- <14, (3, 4, 7)>
- <14, (3, 4, 12)>
- <14, (3, 5, 7)>
- <14, (3, 5, 12)>
- <14, (4, 5, 7)>
- <14, (4, 5, 12)>
- <14, (5, 7, 12)>
