Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 24) (13, 9) (13, 7) (23, 12) (20, 25) (25, 20) (25, 29) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 1) (10, 28) (17, 10) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (8, 9) (8, 29) (8, 15) (6, 28) (6, 3) (28, 10) (28, 6) (28, 18) (28, 5) (28, 15) (0, 14) (0, 21) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 27) (14, 7) (9, 13) (9, 8) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 11) (1, 10) (1, 4) (24, 13) (24, 11) (5, 28) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 15) (26, 10) (26, 5) (26, 2) (26, 16) (11, 21) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 29) (7, 13) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 11) (2, 5) (2, 26) (2, 27) (12, 23) (12, 15) (12, 19) (16, 26) (16, 19) (18, 17) (18, 28) (18, 14) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 16) (19, 27) (15, 8) (15, 28) (15, 5) (15, 12) (29, 25) (29, 8) (29, 11) (29, 3) (27, 14) (27, 2) (27, 19) (3, 6) (3, 29) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {14, 21, 4}
- Node 1: {10, 4}
- Node 2: {5, 26, 27}
- Node 3: {6, 29}
- Node 4: {17, 0, 1}
- Node 5: {28, 26, 2, 15}
- Node 6: {28, 3}
- Node 7: {13, 17, 14, 11}
- Node 8: {9, 29, 15}
- Node 9: {13, 8}
- Node 10: {17, 21, 26, 1, 28}
- Node 11: {21, 24, 7, 19, 29}
- Node 12: {23, 15, 19}
- Node 13: {24, 9, 7}
- Node 14: {0, 18, 27, 7}
- Node 15: {8, 28, 5, 12}
- Node 16: {26, 19}
- Node 17: {10, 18, 4, 7}
- Node 18: {17, 28, 14}
- Node 19: {11, 12, 16, 27}
- Node 20: {25}
- Node 21: {10, 0, 11}
- Node 23: {12}
- Node 24: {13, 11}
- Node 25: {20, 29}
- Node 26: {10, 5, 2, 16}
- Node 27: {14, 2, 19}
- Node 28: {10, 6, 18, 5, 15}
- Node 29: {25, 8, 11, 3}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors {17, 21, 28}.
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with neighbors {21, 24, 29}.
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors {18, 27, 7}.
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with neighbors {8, 28, 12}.
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with neighbors {18, 4, 7}.
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with neighbors {16, 27, 11}.

Adding these up, we have a total of 6 unique 3-stars, so the final answer is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <10, 17, 21, 28>
- <11, 21, 24, 29>
- <14, 18, 7, 27>
- <15, 8, 12, 28>
- <17, 4, 7, 18>
- <19, 16, 11, 27>
