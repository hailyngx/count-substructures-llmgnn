Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 9) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (5, 3) (5, 1) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 9) (14, 8) (14, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 13) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 9) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 8, 10, 1, 13, 9
- Node 1: 11, 0, 5, 14, 9
- Node 2: 9, 3, 11
- Node 3: 4, 8, 2, 11, 5
- Node 4: 7, 8, 11, 6, 3
- Node 5: 3, 1
- Node 6: 4, 12, 11, 10
- Node 7: 4, 12, 13
- Node 8: 4, 14, 0, 3
- Node 9: 2, 0, 1, 13
- Node 10: 12, 0, 6, 13
- Node 11: 4, 2, 3, 1, 6
- Node 12: 7, 13, 10, 6
- Node 13: 7, 12, 0, 10, 9
- Node 14: 8, 1

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 54 3-stars in the graph: \([54]\).

The unique 3-stars are:

- <1, (11, 5, 14)>
- <3, (4, 8, 11)>
- <3, (4, 8, 5)>
- <3, (8, 11, 5)>
- <4, (7, 6, 12)>
