This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 27) (3, 18) (25, 7) (25, 19) (25, 8) (25, 2) (8, 25) (8, 28) (8, 24) (8, 21) (13, 28) (13, 14) (18, 3) (18, 16) (18, 17) (20, 22) (5, 23) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (19, 25) (19, 17) (19, 27) (26, 2) (26, 29) (7, 25) (7, 6) (7, 2) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 29) (23, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (22, 20) (22, 28) (22, 24) (10, 4) (10, 29) (28, 8) (28, 13) (28, 22) (28, 0) (28, 1) (29, 26) (29, 23) (29, 10) (16, 18) (16, 24) (16, 14) (24, 8) (24, 22) (24, 16) (1, 5) (1, 28) (2, 25) (2, 26) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 28) (0, 15) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 21) (9, 14) (9, 27) (15, 0) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 21) (21, 8) (21, 9) (21, 15) (21, 12) (14, 13) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 27) (27, 3) (27, 19) (27, 9) (27, 14) (12, 6) (12, 23) (12, 21) (17, 18) (17, 19) (17, 23) (17, 15)

Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 15, 28}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 28}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 25, 26}
- Node 3: Neighbors {18, 27}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 9, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 23}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 12}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 6, 25}
- Node 8: Neighbors {21, 24, 25, 28}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 9, 14, 15, 21, 27}
- Node 10: Neighbors {4, 29}
- Node 12: Neighbors {6, 21, 23}
- Node 13: Neighbors {14, 28}
- Node 14: Neighbors {9, 13, 16, 27}
- Node 15: Neighbors {0, 9, 17, 21}
- Node 16: Neighbors {14, 18, 24}
- Node 17: Neighbors {15, 18, 19, 23}

- Node 20: Neighbors {22}
- Node 21: Neighbors {8, 9, 12, 15}
- Node 22: Neighbors {20, 24, 28}
- Node 23: Neighbors {5, 12, 17, 29}
- Node 24: Neighbors {8, 16, 22}
- Node 25: Neighbors {2, 7, 8, 19}
- Node 26: Neighbors {2, 29}
- Node 27: Neighbors {3, 9, 14, 19}
- Node 28: Neighbors {1, 8, 13, 22}
- Node 29: Neighbors {10, 23, 26}

Based on the neighbor sets, the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 3, 8, 9, 14, 15, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29. 

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars by applying \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- For Node 3: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 2 neighbors.
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed. Unique 3-star sets: <8, (21, 24, 28)>, <8, (25, 24, 28)>, <8, (25, 21, 28)>, <8, (25, 21, 24)>.
- For Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars can be formed. Unique 3-star sets: <9, (14, 15, 27)>, <9, (14, 21, 27)>, <9, (14, 15, 21)>, <9, (14, 15, 9)> and others.
- For Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed. Unique 3-star sets: <14, (9, 27, 14)>, <14, (9, 15, 27)>, <14, (9, 15, 14)>, <14, (27, 15, 14)>.
- For Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed. Unique 3-star sets: <15, (9, 21, 15)>, <15, (9, 21, 15)>, <15, (9, 17, 21)>, <15, (17, 21, 15)>.
- For Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed. Unique 3-star sets: <17, (15, 18, 23)>, <17, (15, 19, 23)>, <17, (15, 17, 23)>, <17, (18, 19, 23)>.
- For Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed. Unique 3-star sets: <21, (9, 15, 21)>, <21, (9, 17, 21)>, <21, (9, 12, 21)>, <21, (15, 17, 21)>.
- For Node 22: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 3 neighbors.
- For Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed. Unique 3-star sets: <23, (12, 17, 29)>, <23, (12, 23, 17)>, <23, (12, 17, 23)>, <23, (17, 29, 23)>.
- For Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed. Unique 3-star sets: <24, (16, 22, 28)>, <24, (16, 22, 24)>, <24, (16, 22, 24)>, <24, (22, 28, 24)>.
- For Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed. Unique 3-star sets: <25, (8, 19, 27)>, <25, (8, 19, 25)>, <25, (8, 27, 25)>, <25, (19, 27, 25)>.
- For Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed. Unique 3-star sets: <27, (9, 19, 27)>, <27, (9, 14, 27)>, <27, (9, 19, 27)>, <27, (14, 19, 27)>.
- For Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed. Unique 3-star sets: <28, (1, 13, 22)>, <28, (1, 13, 28)>, <28, (1, 22, 28)>, <28, (13, 22, 28)>.
- For Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed. Unique 3-star sets: <29, (10, 23, 26)>, <29, (10, 23, 29)>, <29, (10, 26, 29)>, <29, (23, 26, 29)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 52 3-stars. So, the final answer is [52].
