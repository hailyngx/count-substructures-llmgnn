Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 29) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 17) (16, 14) (16, 5) (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 2) (27, 26) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (22, 5) (22, 28) (23, 25) (23, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 1) (17, 16) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (2, 27) (2, 6) (2, 20) (18, 0) (18, 8) (20, 15) (20, 2) (5, 16) (5, 22) (5, 13) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 3) (26, 27) (8, 17) (8, 18) (8, 19) (8, 21) (19, 23) (19, 8) (19, 29) (4, 6) (4, 3) (12, 15) (12, 25) (12, 1) (21, 16) (21, 8) (21, 24) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 28) (3, 13) (3, 4) (24, 21) (24, 7) (7, 9) (7, 24) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 25) (25, 11) (25, 23) (25, 12) (25, 1) (29, 11) (29, 19) (29, 0) (28, 22) (28, 14) (0, 18) (0, 29) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {18, 29}
- Node 1: {9, 10, 12, 25}
- Node 2: {6, 15, 20, 27}
- Node 3: {4, 13}
- Node 4: {3, 6}
- Node 5: {13, 16, 22}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 13, 15}
- Node 7: {9, 24}
- Node 8: {17, 18, 19, 21}
- Node 9: {1, 7, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 15, 17, 11}
- Node 11: {10, 16, 25, 29}
- Node 12: {1, 15, 25}
- Node 13: {3, 5, 6, 17}
- Node 14: {9, 16, 28}
- Node 15: {2, 6, 10, 12, 20, 27}
- Node 16: {5, 11, 14, 17}
- Node 17: {8, 10, 13, 16}
- Node 18: {0, 8}
- Node 19: {8, 23, 29}
- Node 20: {2, 15}
- Node 21: {8, 16, 24}
- Node 22: {5, 28}
- Node 23: {19, 25}
- Node 24: {7, 21}
- Node 25: {1, 11, 12, 23}
- Node 26: {27}
- Node 27: {2, 15, 26}
- Node 28: {14, 22}
- Node 29: {0, 11, 19}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, thus contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) towards 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, thus contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) towards 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, thus contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) towards 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, thus contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) towards 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, thus contributes 1 towards 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, thus contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) towards 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, thus contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) towards 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, thus contributes 1 towards 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, thus contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) towards 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, thus contributes 1 towards 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 6 neighbors, thus contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) towards 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, thus contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) towards 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, thus contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) towards 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, thus contributes 1 towards 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, thus contributes 1 towards 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, thus contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) towards 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, thus contributes 1 towards 3-stars.

Adding all these contributions together, we get a total of 59 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [59].
