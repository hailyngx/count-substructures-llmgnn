Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 21) (9, 11) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 21) (26, 16) (26, 4) (26, 17) (1, 21) (1, 3) (1, 25) (21, 9) (21, 26) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 6) (17, 26) (17, 13) (17, 28) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 27) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 28) (2, 25) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 13) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 27) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 15) (23, 2) (23, 8) (4, 26) (4, 22) (4, 24) (15, 8) (15, 18) (20, 25) (20, 27) (20, 22) (25, 1) (25, 2) (25, 20) (25, 11) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 25) (28, 17) (28, 2) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 17) (13, 29) (13, 5) (6, 21) (6, 16) (6, 27) (12, 3) (16, 26) (16, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 24) (22, 4) (22, 20) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 4) (24, 10) (18, 15) (18, 10) (27, 7) (27, 3) (27, 20) (27, 6) (27, 19) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 27) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can first determine the neighbors for each node:

1. Node 0 neighbors: {2, 10, 19}
2. Node 1 neighbors: {3, 21, 25}
3. Node 2 neighbors: {0, 23, 25, 28, 29}
4. Node 3 neighbors: {1, 12, 27}
5. Node 4 neighbors: {22, 24, 26}
6. Node 5 neighbors: {10, 13}
7. Node 6 neighbors: {16, 21, 27}
8. Node 7 neighbors: {11, 21, 27}
9. Node 8 neighbors: {15, 23, 24}
10. Node 9 neighbors: {11, 21, 24, 26}
11. Node 10 neighbors: {0, 5, 18, 19, 24}
12. Node 11 neighbors: {7, 9, 25}
13. Node 12 neighbors: {3}
14. Node 13 neighbors: {5, 17, 29}
15. Node 15 neighbors: {8, 18}
16. Node 16 neighbors: {6, 26}
17. Node 17 neighbors: {13, 26, 28}
18. Node 18 neighbors: {10, 15}
19. Node 19 neighbors: {0, 10, 27}
20. Node 20 neighbors: {22, 25, 27}
21. Node 21 neighbors: {1, 6, 7, 9, 26}
22. Node 22 neighbors: {4, 20}
23. Node 23 neighbors: {2, 8}
24. Node 24 neighbors: {4, 9, 10, 8}
25. Node 25 neighbors: {1, 2, 11, 20}
26. Node 26 neighbors: {4, 9, 16, 17, 21}
27. Node 27 neighbors: {3, 6, 7, 19, 20}
28. Node 28 neighbors: {2, 17}
29. Node 29 neighbors: {2, 13}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
Node 2 and Node 10 have exactly 3 neighbors, so each forms 1 3-star.
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (0, 10, 19)>
<10, (0, 5, 18)>
