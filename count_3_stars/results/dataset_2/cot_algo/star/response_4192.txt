Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 1: {0, 3, 4}
Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 8}
Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4}
Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 7, 8}
Node 5: {4, 6, 9}
Node 6: {0, 5, 8, 9}
Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 9}
Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 6}
Node 9: {0, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 47

Therefore, the final result is [47] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>.
