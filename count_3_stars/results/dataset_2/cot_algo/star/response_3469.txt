Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 5) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (1, 17) (1, 2) (10, 4) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 0) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 17) (12, 16) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 17) (8, 15) (8, 14) (17, 1) (17, 7) (17, 4) (5, 15) (5, 2) (19, 9) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 13) (0, 16) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 14) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 16) 

Response:
There are 20 nodes in the graph with 60 edges. Let's first create the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 13, 16, 18}
- Node 1: {2, 17}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 11, 13, 15}
- Node 4: {10, 11, 17}
- Node 5: {2, 15}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {6, 14, 15, 17}
- Node 8: {14, 15}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 19}
- Node 10: {4, 16}
- Node 11: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 12: {16}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 7, 8, 13, 16}
- Node 15: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 16: {0, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 17: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 18: {0, 14}
- Node 19: {9}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 2: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 3: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 6: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 7: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 9: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 14: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 15: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 16: [4 choose 3] = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 35

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (13, 16, 18)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <3, (6, 11, 13)>
- <6, (7, 9, 11)>
- <7, (14, 15, 17)>
- <9, (2, 6, 19)>
- <14, (7, 8, 13)>
- <15, (5, 7, 8)>
- <16, (10, 12, 14)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].
