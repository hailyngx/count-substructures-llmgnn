Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 3) (22, 1) (1, 22) (1, 21) (1, 19) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 26) (21, 5) (4, 27) (4, 24) (4, 17) (7, 25) (7, 29) (7, 23) (10, 13) (10, 25) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 29) (15, 20) (15, 23) (15, 12) (15, 16) (20, 15) (20, 23) (24, 4) (24, 5) (24, 19) (26, 21) (26, 0) (27, 21) (27, 4) (27, 28) (27, 2) (25, 7) (25, 10) (25, 6) (25, 28) (25, 14) (16, 15) (16, 28) (16, 3) (16, 18) (28, 27) (28, 25) (28, 16) (28, 5) (3, 22) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 8) (9, 12) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 14) (18, 29) (29, 7) (29, 11) (29, 18) (14, 25) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 2) (0, 26) (0, 8) (2, 27) (2, 14) (6, 25) (23, 13) (23, 7) (23, 15) (23, 20) (19, 1) (19, 24) (12, 1) (12, 15) (12, 9) (17, 4) (5, 21) (5, 24) (5, 28) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 26, 8
- Node 1: 22, 21, 19, 12
- Node 2: 27, 14
- Node 3: 22, 16, 14, 8
- Node 4: 27, 24, 17
- Node 5: 21, 24, 28
- Node 6: 25
- Node 7: 25, 29, 23
- Node 8: 11, 3, 0
- Node 9: 12
- Node 10: 13, 25
- Node 11: 18, 8, 29
- Node 12: 1, 15, 9
- Node 13: 22, 10, 23
- Node 14: 25, 3, 18, 2
- Node 15: 20, 23, 12, 16
- Node 16: 15, 28, 3, 18
- Node 17: 4
- Node 18: 11, 16, 14, 29
- Node 19: 1, 24
- Node 20: 15, 23
- Node 21: 1, 27, 26, 5
- Node 22: 13, 3, 1
- Node 23: 7, 15, 13, 20
- Node 24: 4, 5, 19
- Node 25: 7, 10, 6, 28, 14
- Node 26: 21, 0
- Node 27: 21, 4, 28, 2
- Node 28: 27, 25, 16, 5
- Node 29: 7, 11, 18

Next, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 47

So, the final answer is [47].
