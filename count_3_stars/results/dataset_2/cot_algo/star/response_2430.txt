Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 8: 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 52

So, the final answer is [52], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>.
