Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 4) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 9) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 9) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 11) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 4) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 14) (13, 11) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 9) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 9, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 10, 11}
- Node 2: {1, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 12}
- Node 7: {3, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13}
- Node 12: {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 13: {11}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 4, 8}

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 4, 9, and 11 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 61

Therefore, the final answer is [61], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 9, 11)>, <1, (0, 4, 10)>, <4, (1, 9, 14)>, <9, (4, 10, 11)>, <11, (0, 7, 13)>.
