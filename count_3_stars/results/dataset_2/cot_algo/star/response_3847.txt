Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 7, 8}

Now, for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are involved in:

- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (4 choose 3)
- Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 8: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 56

Therefore, the final answer is [56], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 9)>
- <7, (0, 2, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
