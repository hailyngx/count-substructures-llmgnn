Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {9, 6, 2}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 8, 7, 0}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 3, 2, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 4}
- Node 6: {5, 4, 8, 7, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 1, 3, 6, 2}
- Node 8: {9, 6, 2}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 4, 2, 7, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars around those nodes:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is then calculated as \(10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 60\). 
Therefore, the final answer is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 7, 4)>
