Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 3) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 17) (8, 7) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 14) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 5) (0, 7) (0, 17) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 10) (13, 18) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 19) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 1) (17, 16) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 19) (16, 1) (16, 17) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 18) (12, 6) (12, 19) (10, 18) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 5) (19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {11, 14, 16, 17, 19}
- Node 2: {6, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {9, 14, 17}
- Node 4: {18}
- Node 5: {7, 10, 11}
- Node 6: {2, 9, 12, 15}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 8, 10, 17}
- Node 8: {7, 17}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 15}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 7, 18}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 12: {6, 19}
- Node 13: {18}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 19}
- Node 15: {6, 9, 18}
- Node 16: {1, 17, 19}
- Node 17: {0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 16}
- Node 18: {4, 10, 13, 15}
- Node 19: {1, 12, 14}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1: 5 neighbors, can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 2: 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3: 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5: 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7: 5 neighbors, can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9: 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10: 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 11: 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12: 2 neighbors, cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 14: 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15: 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17: 5 neighbors, can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 18: 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 19: 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 48

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 14, 17>, 
<1, 14, 19>, 
<1, 16, 17>, 
<1, 16, 19>, 
<1, 17, 19>, 
<2, 6, 10>, 
<3, 9, 14>, 
<5, 7, 10>, 
<6, 9, 15>, 
<7, 8, 17>, 
<7, 10, 17>, 
<7, 17, 19>, 
<10, 15, 18>, 
<11, 2, 5>, 
<17, 16, 19>, 
<18, 10, 15>.
