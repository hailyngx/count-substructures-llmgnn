Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 12) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 2) (14, 12) (14, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 1: {9, 5, 8, 2}
- Node 2: {10, 11, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {4, 10, 8, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 6, 0, 3}
- Node 5: {10, 11, 8, 1}
- Node 6: {4, 9, 8, 13}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 11, 10}
- Node 8: {6, 13, 5, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 1, 0}
- Node 10: {7, 11, 3, 13, 2}
- Node 11: {7, 10, 5, 2}
- Node 12: {14, 0}
- Node 13: {6, 10, 8}
- Node 14: {12, 3}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0, 1 3-star
- Node 3, 1 3-star
- Node 4, 1 3-star
- Node 5, 1 3-star
- Node 8, 1 3-star
- Node 10, 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 10, 11>
<3, 4, 10>
<4, 7, 10>
<8, 6, 13>
