Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 4) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 19) (2, 3) (2, 12) (13, 16) (13, 7) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 13) (19, 17) (19, 0) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 5) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 18) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 15) (8, 1) (8, 15) (8, 18) (15, 14) (15, 8) (15, 4) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 8) (4, 11) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 15) 

Response:
Given a graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will first identify the neighbors of each node. Then, we will count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

### Neighbors of Each Node:
- Node 0: {7, 4, 19}
- Node 1: {3, 14, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 12}
- Node 3: {5, 1, 16, 2}
- Node 4: {11, 17, 0, 15}
- Node 5: {9, 3, 16}
- Node 6: {16, 18}
- Node 7: {10, 0, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 15, 18}
- Node 9: {5, 12}
- Node 10: {11, 17, 7}
- Node 11: {12, 4, 10}
- Node 12: {9, 11, 2, 16}
- Node 13: {16, 7}
- Node 14: {1, 18, 15}
- Node 15: {14, 8, 4}
- Node 16: {5, 3, 13, 12, 6}
- Node 17: {10, 19, 4}
- Node 18: {6, 14, 8}
- Node 19: {17, 0}

### Counting 3-stars:
- Node 0 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (3, 14, 8)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (5, 1, 16)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (11, 17, 15)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (10, 0, 13)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 15, 18)>
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star: <10, (11, 17, 7)>
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star: <11, (12, 4, 10)>
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star: <12, (9, 11, 16)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star: <14, (1, 18, 15)>
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star: <15, (14, 8, 4)>
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star: <16, (5, 3, 13)>
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star: <17, (10, 4, 19)>
- Node 18 does not form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 13, therefore, the final answer is [13].
