Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 23) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 14) (3, 15) (3, 29) (15, 13) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 26) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 20) (7, 4) (7, 23) (7, 1) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 20) (0, 27) (0, 8) (27, 0) (27, 10) (27, 16) (10, 27) (10, 25) (10, 14) (11, 24) (11, 2) (6, 9) (6, 29) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 21) (9, 14) (2, 22) (2, 18) (2, 11) (2, 5) (28, 29) (28, 19) (29, 3) (29, 6) (29, 9) (29, 28) (29, 21) (20, 4) (20, 18) (5, 13) (5, 2) (26, 15) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 23) (23, 13) (23, 7) (23, 18) (23, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 24) (8, 25) (19, 28) (19, 21) (12, 6) (12, 17) (17, 12) (17, 25) (17, 16) (25, 10) (25, 9) (25, 8) (25, 17) (24, 11) (24, 8) (14, 22) (14, 10) (14, 9) (16, 27) (16, 17) (21, 9) (21, 29) (21, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {27, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {15, 4, 7, 23}
- Node 2: Neighbors {22, 18, 11, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {15, 29}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 1, 20}
- Node 5: Neighbors {13, 2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 29, 12, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 23, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 6, 24, 25}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 29, 25, 21, 14}
- Node 10: Neighbors {27, 25, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {2, 24}
- Node 12: Neighbors {6, 17}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 15, 23}
- Node 14: Neighbors {22, 9, 10}
- Node 15: Neighbors {13, 3, 1, 26}
- Node 16: Neighbors {27, 17}
- Node 17: Neighbors {12, 25, 16}
- Node 18: Neighbors {22, 2, 23, 20}
- Node 19: Neighbors {28, 21}
- Node 20: Neighbors {4, 18}
- Node 21: Neighbors {9, 29, 19}
- Node 22: Neighbors {14, 2, 18}
- Node 23: Neighbors {13, 7, 18, 1}
- Node 24: Neighbors {11, 8}
- Node 25: Neighbors {10, 9, 8, 17}
- Node 26: Neighbor {15}
- Node 27: Neighbors {0, 10, 16}
- Node 28: Neighbor {29}
- Node 29: Neighbors {3, 6, 9, 28, 21}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (forming one 3-star each): None
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: Nodes 9 and 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars for nodes 9 and 29:
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 = 20

Therefore, the final answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are <9, (6, 25, 21)> and <29, (3, 6, 9)>.
