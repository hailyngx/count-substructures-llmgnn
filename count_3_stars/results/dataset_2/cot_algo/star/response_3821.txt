Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 0) (18, 7) (18, 13) (18, 8) (13, 18) (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 23) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 3) (24, 26) (24, 17) (24, 22) (24, 21) (3, 2) (3, 26) (3, 12) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 20) (5, 29) (5, 21) (5, 27) (19, 17) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 29) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 4) (10, 0) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 28) (23, 13) (23, 21) (8, 18) (8, 6) (8, 12) (28, 10) (28, 22) (1, 10) (29, 5) (29, 0) (29, 15) (29, 12) (20, 11) (20, 27) (20, 22) (17, 24) (17, 19) (25, 16) (25, 4) (25, 14) (21, 24) (21, 5) (21, 23) (21, 27) (27, 5) (27, 10) (27, 20) (27, 21) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 7) (15, 29) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 14) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 22) (7, 18) (7, 9) (7, 22) (22, 24) (22, 28) (22, 20) (22, 6) (22, 7) (4, 16) (4, 25) (14, 25) (14, 15) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 29) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 2, 16, 10, 29
- Node 1: 10
- Node 2: 3, 0
- Node 3: 2, 26, 12
- Node 4: 16, 25
- Node 5: 29, 21, 27
- Node 6: 8, 15, 22
- Node 7: 18, 9, 22
- Node 8: 18, 6, 12
- Node 9: 11, 15, 7
- Node 10: 0, 27, 1, 28
- Node 11: 13, 9, 20
- Node 12: 3, 8, 29
- Node 13: 18, 26, 11, 23
- Node 14: 25, 15
- Node 15: 29, 9, 6, 14
- Node 16: 0, 25, 4
- Node 17: 24, 19
- Node 18: 7, 13, 8
- Node 19: 17
- Node 20: 11, 27, 22
- Node 21: 5, 24, 23, 27
- Node 22: 24, 28, 20, 6, 7
- Node 23: 13, 21
- Node 24: 26, 17, 22, 21
- Node 25: 16, 4, 14
- Node 26: 13, 24, 3
- Node 27: 5, 10, 20, 21
- Node 28: 10, 22
- Node 29: 5, 0, 15, 12

Now, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 21, 29, 12, 17
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 22, 24

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 
  - Total 3-stars formed: 3
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <2, 0, 3>
    - <21, 5, 27>
    - <12, 3, 29>

- Nodes with 4 neighbors:
  - Total 3-stars formed: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <0, 2, 16>
    - <5, 27, 21>
    - <6, 15, 22>
    - <7, 18, 22>
    - <10, 27, 29>
    - <11, 13, 20>
    - <13, 18, 26>
    - <15, 9, 29>
    - <22, 24, 28>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 3 + 4 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
