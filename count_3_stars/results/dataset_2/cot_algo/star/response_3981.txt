Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {4, 8, 2, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {9, 4, 8, 2}
- Node 2: {9, 8, 1, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 0, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 4, 7, 3}
- Node 7: {9, 8, 6, 0, 3}
- Node 8: {2, 0, 1, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 2, 1, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 1: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 40 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 8, 7)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 3)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>
