Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 19) (11, 17) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 16) (18, 13) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 3) (1, 7) (1, 19) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 7) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 5) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 0) (14, 2) (14, 4) (14, 13) (12, 8) (12, 16) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 12) (0, 15) (0, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (7, 1) (7, 17) (13, 18) (13, 4) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {15, 3}
- Node 1: {7, 19}
- Node 2: {10, 19, 14}
- Node 3: {6, 9, 8, 0}
- Node 4: {8, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {10, 8, 19, 16}
- Node 6: {9, 3}
- Node 7: {1, 17}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 15, 12, 3}
- Node 9: {6, 17, 10, 3}
- Node 10: {9, 15, 5, 2}
- Node 11: {19, 17}
- Node 12: {8, 16}
- Node 13: {4, 18, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 13}
- Node 15: {10, 8, 0}
- Node 16: {18, 5, 12}
- Node 17: {9, 11, 7}
- Node 18: {16, 13}
- Node 19: {11, 2, 1, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 15, and Node 19 have more than 3 neighbors.

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 3 forms 4 3-stars. <3, (6, 9, 8)>, <3, (9, 8, 10)>, <3, (8, 10, 15)>, <3, (8, 15, 0)>
- Node 8 forms 10 3-stars. <8, (4, 5, 12)>, <8, (4, 5, 15)>, <8, (4, 8, 12)>, <8, (4, 8, 13)>, <8, (4, 8, 15)>, <8, (5, 10, 15)>, <8, (5, 8, 12)>, <8, (5, 8, 15)>, <8, (10, 15, 0)>, <8, (12, 15, 0)>
- Node 9 forms 4 3-stars. <9, (6, 17, 3)>, <9, (17, 10, 2)>, <9, (17, 11, 7)>, <9, (10, 15, 8)>
- Node 10 forms 4 3-stars. <10, (2, 19, 14)>, <10, (2, 14, 13)>, <10, (14, 13, 4)>, <10, (13, 4, 8)>
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star. <15, (0, 3, 8)>
- Node 19 forms 4 3-stars. <19, (11, 17, 7)>, <19, (11, 17, 1)>, <19, (11, 17, 5)>, <19, (2, 1, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].
