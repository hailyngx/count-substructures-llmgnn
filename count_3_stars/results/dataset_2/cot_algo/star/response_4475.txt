Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 5) (15, 24) (27, 15) (18, 22) (18, 5) (18, 12) (22, 18) (22, 29) (22, 7) (10, 11) (10, 26) (10, 2) (10, 20) (11, 10) (11, 13) (28, 16) (28, 19) (28, 20) (29, 22) (29, 17) (29, 0) (29, 25) (4, 9) (4, 1) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 9) (7, 22) (7, 24) (7, 23) (7, 1) (12, 18) (12, 24) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 8) (6, 14) (6, 25) (6, 13) (24, 15) (24, 7) (24, 12) (26, 10) (26, 16) (1, 4) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 13) (16, 28) (16, 26) (16, 19) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 21) (25, 29) (25, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 20) (19, 28) (19, 16) (19, 21) (8, 5) (8, 20) (8, 0) (14, 6) (14, 21) (23, 15) (23, 7) (23, 0) (0, 29) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 23) (21, 9) (21, 19) (21, 14) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 1) (20, 10) (20, 28) (20, 2) (20, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes: 0, 1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, and 22. 

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: Since node 0 has 4 neighbors, the number of 3-stars involving node 0 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 1: Node 1 has 4 neighbors, thus \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1.
- Node 5: Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with node 5.
- Node 7: Node 7 has 4 neighbors, thus \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7.
- Node 9: Node 9 has 4 neighbors, which gives \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9.
- Node 10: Node 10 has 4 neighbors, thus \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 10.
- Node 15: Node 15 also has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 15.
- Node 16: Node 16 has 3 neighbors, resulting in 1 3-star with node 16.
- Node 17: Node 17 has 4 neighbors, thus \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 17.
- Node 22: Node 22 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 22.

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated for each node, we get a total of 30 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (17, 23, 29)> 
- <1, (4, 7, 13)> 
- <5, (8, 15, 18)> 
- <7, (1, 12, 24)> 
- <9, (3, 4, 17)> 
- <10, (2, 20, 28)> 
- <15, (5, 15, 24)> 
- <16, (19, 26, 28)> 
- <17, (0, 9, 29)> 
- <22, (18, 29, 7)>
