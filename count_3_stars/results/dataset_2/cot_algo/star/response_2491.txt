Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 10) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 11) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we need to determine the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph.

Let's first identify the three neighbor nodes for each node:

1. Node 0: {6, 10, 11}
2. Node 1: {3, 12, 14}
3. Node 2: {4, 5, 10}
4. Node 3: {1, 7, 12}
5. Node 4: {2, 5, 7}
6. Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 9}
7. Node 6: {0, 5, 9}
8. Node 7: {4, 10, 14}
9. Node 8: {9, 12, 13}
10. Node 9: {5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13}
11. Node 10: {0, 2, 7, 9, 12, 13}
12. Node 11: {0, 4, 9, 12, 14}
13. Node 12: {1, 8, 10, 11, 13}
14. Node 13: {8, 9, 10, 12}
15. Node 14: {1, 7, 11}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 12, 14 (total 9 nodes)
- Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{9}{3} = 84 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [84].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (4, 5, 10)>, <3, (1, 12, 14)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (4, 10, 14)>, <8, (9, 12, 13)>, <12, (10, 11, 13)>, <14, (1, 7, 11)>
