Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (7, 12) (7, 6) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 15) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 18) (10, 12) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 4) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 19) (17, 12) (17, 13) (0, 10) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 6) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 18) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 16) (11, 12) (11, 0) (3, 19) (3, 14) (14, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 10) (4, 0) (18, 13) (18, 16) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated as follows:

For node 5: (5, 9), (5, 13), (13, 5)
- <5, (9, 13)>
- <5, (9, 13)>

For node 9: (5, 9), (9, 1), (9, 13), (9, 12), (12, 9)
- <9, (5, 13)>
- <9, (5, 13)>
- <9, (1, 12)>
- <9, (1, 12)>
- <9, (13, 17)>
- <9, (13, 17)>

For node 12: (7, 12), (12, 9), (12, 7), (12, 10), (12, 17), (12, 11)
- <12, (7, 10)>
- <12, (7, 10)>
- <12, (9, 17)>
- <12, (9, 17)>
- <12, (10, 17)>
- <12, (10, 17)>

For node 2: (2, 8), (2, 19), (2, 16), (2, 15), (8, 2)
- <2, (8, 19)>
- <2, (8, 19)>
- <2, (16, 15)>
- <2, (16, 15)>

For node 8: (2, 8), (8, 1), (8, 2)
- <8, (2, 1)>
- <8, (2, 1)>

For node 13: (13, 5), (13, 9), (13, 17), (13, 15), (13, 18), (17, 13)
- <13, (5, 17)>
- <13, (5, 17)>
- <13, (9, 15)>
- <13, (9, 15)>
- <13, (17, 18)>
- <13, (17, 18)>

For node 10: (12, 10), (10, 15), (10, 0), (10, 4), (15, 10)
- <10, (12, 15)>
- <10, (12, 15)>
- <10, (0, 4)>
- <10, (0, 4)>

For node 15: (2, 15), (15, 13), (15, 10), (15, 19), (13, 15)
- <15, (2, 19)>

- <15, (10, 19)>
- <15, (10, 19)>

For node 0: (10, 0), (0, 16), (0, 11), (0, 4), (0, 6), (6, 0), (4, 10), (4, 0)
- <0, (10, 4)>
- <0, (10, 4)>
- <0, (11, 6)>
- <0, (11, 6)>

For node 16: (2, 16), (16, 0), (16, 1), (16, 18), (0, 16), (18, 16)
- <16, (2, 18)>
- <16, (2, 18)>
- <16, (1, 18)>
- <16, (1, 18)>

For node 19: (2, 19), (19, 15), (19, 3), (3, 19)
