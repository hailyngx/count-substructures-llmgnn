Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 10) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (2, 11) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's determine the number of 3-stars.

We will first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 14}
- Node 2: {11, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {9, 10}
- Node 5: {7, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 9, 13}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 10, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5, 13}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {4, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 3, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 7, 13}
- Node 13: {5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 5, 9, 13, 2}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
    <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 11)>, <0, (1, 3, 12)>, <0, (1, 8, 11)>, <0, (1, 8, 12)>, <0, (1, 11, 12)>, <0, (3, 8, 11)>, <0, (3, 8, 12)>, <0, (3, 11, 12)>, <0, (8, 11, 12)>
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
    <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 11)>, <3, (0, 7, 12)>, <3, (0, 8, 11)>, <3, (0, 8, 12)>, <3, (0, 11, 12)>, <3, (7, 8, 11)>, <3, (7, 8, 12)>, <3, (7, 11, 12)>, <3, (8, 11, 12)>
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
    <5, (7, 8, 13)>, <5, (7, 13, 14)>, <5, (8, 13, 14)>, <5, (7, 8, 14)>
- Node 13: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
    <13, (5, 8, 11)>, <13, (5, 8, 12)>, <13, (5, 8, 14)>, <13, (5, 11, 12)>, <13, (5, 11, 14)>, <13, (5, 12, 14)>, <13, (8, 11, 12)>, <13, (8, 11, 14)>, <13, (8, 12, 14)>, <13, (11, 12, 14)>, <13, (6, 8, 11)>, <13, (6, 8, 12)>, <13, (6, 8, 14)>, <13, (6, 11, 12)>, <13, (6, 11, 14)>, <13, (6, 12, 14)>, <13, (8, 11, 12)>, <13, (8, 11, 14)>, <13, (8, 12, 14)>, <13, (11, 12, 14)>

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 44

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [44].
