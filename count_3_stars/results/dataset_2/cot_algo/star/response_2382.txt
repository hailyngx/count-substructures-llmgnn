Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 12) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 5) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 14) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 5, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 11}
- Node 2: {9, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 2, 10}
- Node 12: {2, 4, 5, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 10, 12, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 82 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [82].

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (1, 5, 11)>
- <4, (6, 12, 14)>
