Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
For this graph, the neighbors for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 7}

Now we will check for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {6, 7, 9}

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <3, 0, 5>
- <4, 0, 5>
- <5, 2, 4>
- <6, 5, 8>
- <7, 1, 5>
- <8, 6, 9>
- <8, 7, 9>
