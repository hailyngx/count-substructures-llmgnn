Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 13) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 4) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {14, 7, 10}
- Node 1: {3, 11, 10, 4, 12, 8}
- Node 2: {9, 8, 12, 11}
- Node 3: {5, 1, 10, 13, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 1, 14, 11}
- Node 5: {8, 4, 3}
- Node 6: {14, 10, 12}
- Node 7: {0, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {5, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 9: {2, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 6, 1, 3, 7, 13}
- Node 11: {9, 1, 2, 4}
- Node 12: {6, 2, 1}
- Node 13: {9, 3, 14, 7, 10}
- Node 14: {6, 0, 4, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 and Node 3 both have 6 neighbors, so they can each form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. 
- Node 10 also has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- The total number of 3-stars is 20 + 20 + 20 = 60.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 11, 10)>
<3, (1, 10, 13)>
<10, (1, 3, 13)>
