Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 5, 8}

Next, we will find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 42
Therefore, the final answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 1, 9)>
