Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 17) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 18) (7, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 6) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 1) (0, 7) (0, 19) (15, 1) (15, 5) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 19) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 14) (18, 8) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 10) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 19) (19, 0) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 10) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 10) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 5) 

Response:
The first step is to create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 neighbors: 7, 19
- Node 1 neighbors: 6, 15, 17
- Node 2 neighbors: 9, 19
- Node 3 neighbors: 12, 13, 14
- Node 4 neighbors: 10, 13, 17
- Node 5 neighbors: 10, 11, 15, 18
- Node 6 neighbors: 1, 12, 14, 19
- Node 7 neighbors: 0
- Node 8 neighbors: 16, 17, 18
- Node 9 neighbors: 2, 14, 18
- Node 10 neighbors: 4, 5, 18, 19
- Node 11 neighbors: 5, 16
- Node 12 neighbors: 3, 6
- Node 13 neighbors: 3, 4, 14, 16
- Node 14 neighbors: 3, 6, 9, 13
- Node 15 neighbors: 1, 5
- Node 16 neighbors: 8, 11, 13
- Node 17 neighbors: 1, 4, 8
- Node 18 neighbors: 5, 8, 9, 10
- Node 19 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 10

Next, we identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19

For each node with three or more neighbors, we apply the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula to calculate the number of 3-stars centered at that node:

- Node 1 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, 6, 15, 17>, 
<3, 12, 13, 14>, 
<4, 10, 13, 17>, 
<5, 10, 11, 15>, 
<6, 1, 12, 14>, 
<8, 16, 17, 18>, 
<10, 4, 18, 19>, 
<13, 3, 14, 16>, 
<14, 3, 6, 9>, 
<16, 8, 11, 13>, 
<17, 1, 4, 8>, 
<18, 5, 8, 9>, 
<19, 0, 6, 10>.
