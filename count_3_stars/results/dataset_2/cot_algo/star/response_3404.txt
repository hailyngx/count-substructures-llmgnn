Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 2) (1, 24) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 26) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 21) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 27) (7, 13) (20, 25) (20, 3) (20, 24) (25, 7) (25, 20) (25, 29) (12, 0) (27, 7) (27, 23) (27, 17) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (18, 19) (18, 23) (11, 8) (11, 28) (11, 29) (11, 15) (28, 11) (28, 22) (3, 20) (3, 23) (5, 13) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 16) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 26) (15, 24) (14, 26) (14, 22) (14, 9) (26, 21) (26, 15) (26, 14) (26, 23) (26, 17) (19, 18) (19, 0) (22, 28) (22, 14) (22, 6) (23, 27) (23, 18) (23, 3) (23, 26) (29, 25) (29, 11) (17, 27) (17, 26) (17, 16) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 17) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 22) (9, 14) (9, 24) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 19) (24, 1) (24, 20) (24, 15) (24, 9) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 12, 13, 19}
- Node 1: {2, 21, 24}
- Node 2: {1, 8}
- Node 3: {20, 23}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {13}
- Node 6: {8, 10, 22}
- Node 7: {4, 21, 25, 27, 13}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 6, 10, 11, 16}
- Node 9: {14, 24}
- Node 10: {6, 8, 15, 16}
- Node 11: {8, 11, 15, 28, 29}
- Node 12: {0}
- Node 13: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 14: {9, 22, 26}
- Node 15: {10, 11, 24, 26}
- Node 16: {8, 10, 17}
- Node 17: {16, 26, 27}
- Node 18: {19, 23}
- Node 19: {0, 18}
- Node 20: {3, 24, 25}
- Node 21: {1, 7, 26}
- Node 22: {6, 14, 28}
- Node 23: {3, 18, 26, 27}
- Node 24: {1, 9, 15, 20}
- Node 25: {7, 20, 29}
- Node 26: {14, 15, 17, 21, 23}
- Node 27: {7, 17, 23}
- Node 28: {11, 22}
- Node 29: {25, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars and count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 10: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 11: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 15: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 16: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 17: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 22: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 24: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 26: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 27: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 66\)

Therefore, the final answer is [66]. 

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 21, 24)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <7, (4, 25, 27)>
- <8, (2, 6, 10)>
- <10, (6, 8, 16)>
- <11, (8, 15, 29)>
- <15, (10, 24, 26)>
- <16, (8, 17, 6)>
- <17, (16, 26, 27)>
- <22, (14, 28, 6)>
- <24, (9, 15, 20)>
- <26, (14, 15, 17)>
- <27, (17, 23, 7)>
