Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 18) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 15) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (0, 17) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 15) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 3) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 14) (19, 2) (2, 19) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 5) 

Response:
The central idea of this problem is to identify nodes that are connected by exactly three edges, as these nodes can form 3-star graphs. Let's start by identifying such nodes and their neighboring nodes based on the given edges:

1. Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 12}
2. Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 10}
3. Node 8: Neighbors {1, 6, 14}
4. Node 12: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 7, 13}
5. Node 14: Neighbors {0, 8, 11, 15}
6. Node 15: Neighbors {7, 14, 17}
7. Node 16: Neighbors {10, 11, 18}
8. Node 17: Neighbors {0, 10, 15, 18}
9. Node 18: Neighbors {3, 9, 16, 17}
10. Node 0: Neighbors {5, 14, 17}
11. Node 6: Neighbors {8, 9, 13}
12. Node 13: Neighbors {2, 6, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

1. Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. Calculate: \(C(3,3) = 1\)
2. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. Calculate: \(C(4,3) = 4\)
3. Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. Calculate: \(C(3,3) = 1\)
4. Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. Calculate: \(C(5,3) = 10\)
5. Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. Calculate: \(C(4,3) = 4\)
6. Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. Calculate: \(C(3,3) = 1\)
7. Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. Calculate: \(C(3,3) = 1\)
8. Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. Calculate: \(C(4,3) = 4\)
9. Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. Calculate: \(C(4,3) = 4\)
10. Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. Calculate: \(C(3,3) = 1\)
11. Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. Calculate: \(C(3,3) = 1\)
12. Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. Calculate: \(C(3,3) = 1\)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have: \(1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 32\)

Therefore, the final answer is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (1, 3, 12)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 10, 5)>
<8, (1, 6, 14)>
<12, (1, 3, 4)>
<12, (1, 7, 13)>
<12, (3, 7, 13)>
<12, (4, 7, 13)>
<12, (1, 7, 15)>
<14, (0, 15, 17)>
<14, (8, 15, 17)>
<14, (11, 15, 17)>
<14, (14, 15, 17)>
<17, (0, 15, 18)>
<17, (8, 15, 18)>
<17, (10, 15, 18)>
<17, (17, 15, 18)>
<18, (3, 9, 16)>
<18, (3, 10, 17)>
