Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 2) (16, 1) (2, 11) (2, 20) (2, 0) (29, 15) (29, 22) (29, 10) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 25) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 25) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 1) (23, 6) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 20) (6, 23) (6, 5) (6, 28) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 14) (12, 17) (12, 21) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 17) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 24) (14, 28) (14, 0) (14, 22) (25, 7) (25, 8) (25, 23) (25, 19) (18, 11) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 24) (26, 18) (19, 25) (19, 18) (22, 29) (22, 14) (22, 21) (3, 7) (3, 24) (3, 20) (3, 13) (24, 27) (24, 0) (24, 18) (24, 3) (9, 4) (9, 28) (9, 17) (15, 29) (15, 4) (15, 17) (13, 3) (20, 2) (20, 5) (20, 3) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 23) (10, 29) (10, 27) (17, 23) (17, 12) (17, 27) (17, 9) (17, 15) (21, 12) (21, 22) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 11, 14, 24}
- Node 1: {4, 16, 23}
- Node 2: {0, 11, 20}
- Node 3: {7, 13, 20, 24}
- Node 4: {1, 8, 9, 15}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 20}
- Node 6: {5, 23, 28}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 25}
- Node 8: {4, 11, 25}
- Node 9: {4, 17, 28}
- Node 10: {27, 29}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 8, 18}
- Node 12: {17, 21}
- Node 13: {3}
- Node 14: {0, 22, 28}
- Node 15: {4, 17, 29}
- Node 16: {1}
- Node 17: {9, 12, 15, 23, 27}
- Node 18: {11, 19, 24, 26}
- Node 19: {18, 25}
- Node 20: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 21: {12, 22}
- Node 22: {14, 21, 29}
- Node 23: {1, 6, 17, 25}
- Node 24: {0, 3, 18, 27}
- Node 25: {7, 8, 19, 23}
- Node 26: {18}
- Node 27: {10, 17, 24}
- Node 28: {6, 9, 14}
- Node 29: {10, 15, 22}

Next, let's identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors to determine the 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 11, Node 24, Node 25, Node 28, and Node 29 have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 3-stars each.
- Node 2, Node 4, Node 17, and Node 20 have 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 3-star each.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 6 \times 4 + 4 \times 1 = 24 + 4 = 28 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, (2, 14, 24)>
- <11, (2, 8, 18)>
- <24, (18, 0, 3)>
- <25, (7, 8, 23)>
- <28, (6, 9, 14)>
- <29, (10, 15, 22)>
- <2, (0, 11, 20)>
- <4, (1, 9, 15)>
- <17, (9, 12, 15)>
- <20, (2, 3, 5)>
