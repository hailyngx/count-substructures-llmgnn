Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 18) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (0, 16) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 6) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 19) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 12) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 2) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 19) (19, 7) (19, 18) (12, 0) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 17) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (2, 9) (2, 16) (2, 17) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Now, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
1. Node 0 neighbors: {12, 16}
2. Node 1 neighbors: {15, 18}
3. Node 2 neighbors: {9, 16, 17}
4. Node 3 neighbors: {7, 9, 15, 18}
5. Node 4 neighbors: {8, 10, 14}
6. Node 5 neighbors: {6, 8, 15}
7. Node 6 neighbors: {5, 11, 14}
8. Node 7 neighbors: {3, 15, 19}
9. Node 8 neighbors: {4, 5, 9, 10}
10. Node 9 neighbors: {2, 3, 8, 11, 15}
11. Node 10 neighbors: {4, 8}
12. Node 11 neighbors: {6, 9, 13}
13. Node 12 neighbors: {0, 15, 16, 17, 13}
14. Node 13 neighbors: {11, 12}
15. Node 14 neighbors: {4, 6}
16. Node 15 neighbors: {1, 5, 7, 9, 12}
17. Node 16 neighbors: {0, 2, 12}
18. Node 17 neighbors: {2, 12}
19. Node 18 neighbors: {1, 3, 19}
20. Node 19 neighbors: {7, 18}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 8, 9, 12, 15}
Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{7}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 35 + 35 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 114 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [114].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (12, 16, 17)>, 
<2, (9, 16, 17)>, 
<3, (7, 15, 18)>, 
<8, (4, 5, 9)>, 
<9, (2, 8, 11)>, 
<12, (0, 15, 16)>, 
<15, (1, 9, 12)>
