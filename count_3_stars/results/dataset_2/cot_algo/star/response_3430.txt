Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 6) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 11) (7, 17) (12, 15) (12, 19) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 0) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 1) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 9) (9, 19) (16, 17) (16, 10) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 11) (10, 2) (10, 16) (10, 0) (10, 14) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (18, 8) (18, 19) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 15) (3, 2) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 3) (17, 7) (17, 16) (17, 11) (15, 12) (15, 0) (15, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 10, 11, 15}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 10, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 6, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 13, 19}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {11, 16, 17}
- Node 8: Neighbors {18}
- Node 9: Neighbors {19}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 2, 14, 16}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 1, 7, 15, 17}
- Node 12: Neighbors {15, 19}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 6, 19}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 10}
- Node 15: Neighbors {0, 11, 12}
- Node 16: Neighbors {7, 10, 17}
- Node 17: Neighbors {7, 11, 16}
- Node 18: Neighbors {8, 19}
- Node 19: Neighbors {5, 9, 12, 13, 18}

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 5, 10>, <0, 5, 11>, <0, 10, 11>, <0, 10, 15>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 4, 14>, <1, 6, 11>, <1, 6, 14>, <2, 3, 14>, <5, 13, 19>, <6, 13, 19>, <10, 14, 16>, <11, 15, 17>, <11, 15, 19>, <11, 17, 19>, <11, 17, 16>, <14, 2, 10>, <14, 3, 2>, <14, 4, 10>
