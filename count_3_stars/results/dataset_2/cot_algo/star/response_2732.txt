Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 13) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {7, 5, 14, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 3, 6, 12, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {11, 6, 14, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 7, 1, 13, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 10, 6, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {10, 6, 13, 12, 0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 1, 11, 5, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 0, 3, 9, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7, 0, 13}
- Node 10: Neighbors {4, 11, 12, 5, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {10, 6, 2}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 10, 5}
- Node 13: Neighbors {3, 5, 9}
- Node 14: Neighbors {10, 0, 2}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

There are three nodes that have exactly three neighbors: nodes 0, 1, and 5.

For node 0, we can form 1 3-star:
- <0, 7, 5, 14>

For node 1, we also have 1 3-star:
- <1, 7, 3, 6>

For node 5, we can form 1 3-star:
- <5, 10, 6, 13>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
