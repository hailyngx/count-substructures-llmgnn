Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 2) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 6) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 0) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 14) (10, 8) (10, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by first determining the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {8, 14}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 7, 13}
- Node 12: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 13: {2, 9, 11}
- Node 14: {1, 6, 7, 9, 10}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 78 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [78].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 14, 0)>, <2, (3, 11, 13)>, <4, (9, 12, 8)>, <6, (1, 14, 0)>, <7, (9, 14, 11)>, <9, (13, 14, 11)>
