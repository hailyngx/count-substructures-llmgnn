Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 5) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 1) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (5, 16) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 17) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 0) (8, 6) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 13) (12, 16) (12, 1) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 19) (1, 15) (1, 12) (1, 19) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 1) 

Response:
We will first create a list of neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

1: {15, 12}
2: {3, 18, 19}
3: {11, 15, 2, 7}
5: {16, 9, 18, 17}
6: {9, 10, 19, 8}
7: {16, 3, 17, 13}
8: {6}
9: {6, 5, 14, 10}
10: {6, 9, 17}
11: {3}
12: {16, 1}
13: {0, 7, 19}
14: {9, 0}
15: {3, 1}
16: {7, 5, 12}
17: {5, 10, 0, 7}
18: {5, 2, 19, 0}
19: {6, 2, 18, 13, 1}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-star structures.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-star structures.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-star structures.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-star structures.
Node 2 and Node 18 have 4 neighbors each, so they each form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-star structures.
Node 16 and Node 19 have 5 neighbors each, so they each form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-star structures.

Summing up the 3-stars:
4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (11, 15, 2)>
<5, (16, 9, 18)>
<9, (6, 5, 14)>
<7, (16, 5, 12)>
<2, (3, 18, 19)>
<18, (5, 2, 19)>
<16, (7, 5, 12)>
<19, (6, 2, 18)>
