Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 1) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 12) 

Response:
First, we need to represent the given graph visually to better understand it:

\[
\begin{array}{ccccccccccccc}
& & & 1 & & & 0 & & & & & & \\
& & & | & & & | & & & & & & \\
& & & 9 & & & 4 & & & & & & \\
& & / & | & & / & | & & \backslash & & & & \\
& 11 & & 6 & & 2 & & 14 & & 10 & & 12 & \\
& & \backslash & | & \backslash & | & \backslash & | & \backslash & & & & \\
& & & 5 & & & 13 & & & 8 & & 3 & \\
& & & | & & & | & & & | & & | \\
& & & 7 & & & & & & & & & \\
\end{array}
\]

Now let's calculate the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {7, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {3, 10}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 5, 6, 11}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 2, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {7, 9, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 2, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {6, 10}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, 9, 10, 12>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, 4, 10, 12>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, 0, 2, 6>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, 3, 11, 14>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, 1, 4, 5>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, 1, 2, 12>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, 7, 9, 12>

Since each of these nodes has exactly 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star formed with each of them. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 7, and this number should be presented inside brackets [] as [7].
