Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 14) (0, 27) (0, 12) (27, 0) (27, 10) (27, 13) (4, 28) (4, 16) (4, 2) (7, 20) (7, 14) (7, 2) (17, 18) (17, 28) (17, 23) (17, 5) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 23) (18, 21) (18, 1) (8, 13) (8, 20) (8, 16) (13, 27) (13, 8) (13, 11) (1, 18) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 6) (26, 12) (9, 18) (9, 19) (22, 3) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 11) (19, 9) (19, 25) (19, 23) (16, 4) (16, 8) (20, 7) (20, 8) (20, 28) (23, 17) (23, 18) (23, 19) (28, 4) (28, 17) (28, 20) (28, 5) (24, 14) (24, 10) (6, 3) (6, 26) (6, 10) (10, 27) (10, 24) (10, 6) (10, 12) (12, 0) (12, 26) (12, 10) (12, 21) (5, 17) (5, 28) (5, 25) (5, 29) (25, 19) (25, 5) (25, 21) (29, 15) (29, 5) (21, 18) (21, 12) (21, 25) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 24) 

Response:
First, we'll find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {27, 12}
Node 1: Neighbors {18, 26}
Node 2: Neighbors {4, 7, 11}
Node 3: Neighbors {15, 11, 6, 22}
Node 4: Neighbors {28, 16, 2}
Node 5: Neighbors {17, 28, 25, 29}
Node 6: Neighbors {3, 26, 10}
Node 7: Neighbors {20, 14, 2}
Node 8: Neighbors {13, 20, 16}
Node 9: Neighbors {18, 19}
Node 10: Neighbors {27, 24, 6, 12}
Node 11: Neighbors {3, 13, 2}
Node 12: Neighbors {0, 26, 10, 21}
Node 13: Neighbors {27, 8, 11}
Node 14: Neighbors {15, 7, 24}
Node 15: Neighbors {3, 29, 14}
Node 16: Neighbors {4, 8}
Node 17: Neighbors {18, 28, 23, 5}
Node 18: Neighbors {1, 9, 23, 21, 17}
Node 19: Neighbors {9, 25, 23}
Node 20: Neighbors {7, 8, 28}
Node 21: Neighbors {18, 12, 25}
Node 22: Neighbors {3}
Node 23: Neighbors {17, 18, 19}
Node 24: Neighbors {14, 10}
Node 25: Neighbors {19, 5, 21}
Node 26: Neighbors {1, 6, 12}
Node 27: Neighbors {0, 10, 13}
Node 28: Neighbors {4, 17, 20, 5}
Node 29: Neighbors {15, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 15, 11, and 6.  
Node 15 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 14, and 29.  
No other nodes form 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (15, 11, 6)> and <15, (3, 14, 29)>.
