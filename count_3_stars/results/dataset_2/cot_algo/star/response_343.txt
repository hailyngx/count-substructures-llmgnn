Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 24) (3, 13) (15, 4) (15, 28) (6, 18) (6, 11) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 0) (7, 19) (7, 23) (7, 14) (7, 13) (21, 25) (21, 22) (28, 15) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 24) (29, 28) (29, 1) (29, 19) (17, 13) (17, 5) (17, 2) (17, 11) (22, 21) (22, 26) (22, 19) (22, 20) (26, 22) (26, 14) (26, 27) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 16) (1, 23) (16, 28) (16, 1) (16, 0) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 19) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 11) (19, 7) (19, 29) (19, 22) (19, 13) (19, 8) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 26) (14, 25) (25, 21) (25, 14) (25, 27) (27, 26) (27, 25) (4, 15) (4, 12) (4, 11) (12, 4) (12, 23) (0, 9) (0, 16) (18, 6) (2, 17) (2, 5) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 23) (5, 10) (23, 7) (23, 1) (23, 12) (23, 5) (20, 22) (20, 1) (24, 3) (24, 9) (24, 28) (24, 8) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 8) (11, 4) 

Response:
The nodes that have at least three neighbors are nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, 13, 14, 16, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, and 29. Each of these nodes can potentially form 3-stars. 

By calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors, we find:

- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form 2 3-stars.
- Node 13 can form 3 3-stars.
- Node 14 can form 3 3-stars.
- Node 16 can form 2 3-stars.
- Node 19 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 23 can form 2 3-stars.
- Node 24 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 25 can form 2 3-stars.
- Node 26 can form 2 3-stars.
- Node 28 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 29 can form 1 3-star.

Summing up all the possible 3-stars gives a total of 40 3-stars, so the final answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, 20, 28>
<4, 11, 6>
<5, 17, 2>
<7, 13, 19>
<11, 6, 18>
<13, 17, 19>
<14, 25, 27>
<16, 1, 23>
<19, 7, 8>
<22, 20, 1>
<23, 5, 12>
<24, 9, 28>
<25, 14, 27>
<26, 14, 25>
<28, 15, 29>
