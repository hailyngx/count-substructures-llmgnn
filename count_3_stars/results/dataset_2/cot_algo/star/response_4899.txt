Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 14) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 13) (6, 2) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 12) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 9) 

Response:
The graph has the following neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 10}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {2, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 5: {1, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 11: {8, 13}
- Node 12: {3, 6, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 6, 8, 12, 13}

Nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1 forms 1 \(\left(\binom{4}{3}\right)\) 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 \(\left(\binom{5}{3}\right)\) 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 \(\left(\binom{4}{3}\right)\) 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 \(\left(\binom{4}{3}\right)\) 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 \(\left(\binom{4}{3}\right)\) 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 \(\left(\binom{4}{3}\right)\) 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 \(\left(\binom{5}{3}\right)\) 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 \(\left(\binom{5}{3}\right)\) 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 \(\left(\binom{5}{3}\right)\) 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 \(\left(\binom{5}{3}\right)\) 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 \(\left(\binom{5}{3}\right)\) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 11
Therefore, the final answer is [11].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, 2, 4>
- <2, 3, 13>
- <3, 9, 12>
- <4, 8, 10>
- <6, 10, 12>
- <8, 11, 12>
- <9, 10, 12>
- <10, 12, 13>
- <12, 13, 14>
- <13, 14, 1>
- <14, 1, 6>
