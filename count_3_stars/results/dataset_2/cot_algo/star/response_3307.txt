Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 20) (1, 28) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 29) (21, 4) (15, 9) (15, 24) (15, 16) (27, 21) (27, 26) (27, 5) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 17) (22, 18) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 29) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 29) (8, 17) (23, 27) (23, 8) (23, 0) (24, 15) (24, 26) (26, 27) (26, 24) (26, 7) (0, 23) (0, 19) (7, 26) (7, 29) (7, 14) (16, 15) (16, 22) (16, 28) (16, 9) (28, 1) (28, 16) (28, 17) (28, 9) (14, 7) (14, 11) (19, 18) (19, 22) (19, 0) (19, 25) (19, 3) (17, 18) (17, 8) (17, 28) (25, 19) (25, 9) (25, 13) (11, 14) (11, 20) (4, 21) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (2, 10) (5, 27) (5, 8) (5, 20) (29, 21) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 7) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 28) (9, 25) (20, 1) (20, 11) (20, 5) (13, 25) (13, 12) (13, 3) (6, 18) (10, 12) (10, 2) (3, 19) (3, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: {20, 21, 28}
- Node 2: {10}
- Node 3: {13, 19}
- Node 4: {12, 21}
- Node 5: {8, 20, 27}
- Node 6: {18}
- Node 7: {14, 26, 29}
- Node 8: {5, 17, 23, 29}
- Node 9: {15, 16, 25, 28}
- Node 10: {2, 12}
- Node 11: {14, 20}
- Node 12: {4, 10, 13}
- Node 13: {3, 12, 25}
- Node 14: {7, 11}
- Node 15: {9, 16, 24}
- Node 16: {15, 22, 28}
- Node 17: {8, 18, 28}
- Node 18: {6, 17, 19, 22}
- Node 19: {0, 3, 18, 22, 25}
- Node 20: {1, 5, 11}
- Node 21: {1, 4, 27, 29}
- Node 22: {18, 19, 29}
- Node 23: {0, 8, 27}
- Node 24: {15, 26}
- Node 25: {9, 13, 19}
- Node 26: {7, 24, 27}
- Node 27: {5, 21, 23, 26}
- Node 28: {1, 9, 16, 17}
- Node 29: {7, 21, 22, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 12: [1]
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 15: [1]
- Node 16: [1]
- Node 17: [1]
- Node 18: [1]
- Node 19: [1]
- Node 20: [1]
- Node 21: [1]
- Node 22: [1]
- Node 23: [1]
- Node 25: [1]
- Node 26: [1]
- Node 27: [1]
- Node 28: [1]
- Node 29: [1]

There is a total of [20] 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, 20, 28>, 
<4, 12, 21>, 
<5, 8, 27>, 
<8, 17, 28>, 
<9, 15, 16>, 
<12, 10, 13>, 
<13, 3, 25>, 
<15, 9, 25>, 
<16, 22, 28>, 
<18, 22, 29>, 
<19, 0, 25>, 
<20, 1, 11>, 
<21, 1, 29>, 
<23, 0, 27>, 
<26, 7, 24>, 
<27, 5, 23>, 
<28, 9, 17>, 
<29, 7, 22>.
