Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 7, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 9, 1, 8, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 4, 8, 0, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 2, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 9, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 4, 2, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 4, 1, 7}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44].

Unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 4, 8)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<7, (9, 4, 8)>
