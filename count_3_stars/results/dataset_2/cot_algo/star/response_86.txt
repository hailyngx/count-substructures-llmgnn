Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 25) (9, 2) (26, 9) (26, 28) (3, 2) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 6) (15, 16) (14, 11) (14, 7) (17, 19) (17, 18) (25, 9) (25, 27) (25, 0) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (27, 25) (27, 22) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 18) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 1) (18, 29) (28, 26) (28, 29) (28, 0) (28, 24) (28, 5) (29, 18) (29, 28) (29, 8) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 23) (22, 27) (6, 15) (6, 21) (6, 8) (21, 6) (21, 23) (21, 4) (4, 12) (4, 21) (4, 20) (4, 11) (0, 25) (0, 28) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 24) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 24) (16, 15) (16, 12) (24, 28) (24, 10) (24, 11) (24, 1) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 10) (5, 28) (5, 8) (8, 29) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 20) (8, 1) (20, 4) (20, 8) (20, 13) (23, 15) (23, 7) (23, 21) (23, 1) (13, 20) (1, 18) (1, 10) (1, 24) (1, 8) (1, 23) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {25, 28, 10}
- Node 1: {18, 24, 8, 23, 10}
- Node 2: {9, 3, 18}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {12, 21, 11, 20}
- Node 5: {28, 8}
- Node 6: {15, 21, 8}
- Node 7: {14, 12, 23}
- Node 8: {29, 6, 5, 20, 1}
- Node 9: {26, 25, 2}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 19, 24}
- Node 11: {14, 4, 24}
- Node 12: {7, 4, 16}
- Node 13: {20}
- Node 14: {11, 7}
- Node 15: {19, 23, 6, 16}
- Node 16: {15, 12}
- Node 17: {19, 18}
- Node 18: {17, 2, 1, 29}
- Node 19: {15, 17, 10}
- Node 20: {4, 8, 13}
- Node 21: {6, 23, 4}
- Node 22: {27}
- Node 23: {15, 7, 21, 1}
- Node 24: {28, 10, 11, 1}
- Node 25: {9, 27, 0}
- Node 26: {9, 28}
- Node 27: {25, 22}
- Node 28: {26, 29, 0, 24, 5}
- Node 29: {18, 28, 8}

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 15, 18, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 3 3-stars
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 23: 1 3-star
- Node 24: 2 3-stars
- Node 25: 1 3-star
- Node 28: 2 3-stars
- Node 29: 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 19

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 25, 28>
<1, 18, 24>
<4, 12, 16>
<8, 1, 23>
<9, 25, 27>
<10, 1, 24>
<15, 19, 23>
<15, 16, 12>
<15, 6, 21>
<18, 17, 19>
<18, 1, 10>
<18, 28, 29>
<23, 7, 21>
<24, 28, 10>
<28, 29, 18>
