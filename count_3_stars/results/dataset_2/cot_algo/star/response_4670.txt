Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 11) (9, 24) (9, 23) (26, 24) (26, 23) (26, 2) (26, 28) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 24) (2, 26) (2, 3) (2, 20) (2, 14) (29, 19) (29, 16) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 21) (22, 18) (22, 4) (22, 28) (22, 12) (20, 2) (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 8) (0, 16) (8, 25) (8, 23) (8, 19) (8, 6) (8, 1) (23, 9) (23, 26) (23, 8) (23, 6) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 12) (17, 6) (17, 12) (24, 9) (24, 26) (24, 15) (24, 11) (24, 13) (5, 13) (13, 24) (13, 5) (13, 11) (21, 18) (1, 15) (1, 8) (1, 28) (1, 10) (7, 3) (7, 25) (7, 11) (19, 29) (19, 8) (16, 29) (16, 0) (12, 22) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 10) (11, 9) (11, 24) (11, 13) (11, 7) (6, 8) (6, 23) (6, 17) (10, 1) (10, 12) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 20) (28, 26) (28, 22) (28, 20) (28, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges provided, let's find the total number of 3-star subgraphs.

First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {16}
- Node 1: {8, 15, 10, 28}
- Node 2: {3, 14, 20, 26}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 14, 15}
- Node 4: {12, 18, 22}
- Node 5: {13}
- Node 6: {8, 17, 23}
- Node 7: {2, 11, 25, 3}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 19, 23, 25}
- Node 9: {11, 23, 24}
- Node 10: {1, 12}
- Node 11: {7, 9, 13, 24}
- Node 12: {4, 10, 17, 22}
- Node 13: {5, 11, 24}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 20}
- Node 15: {1, 3, 24}
- Node 16: {0, 29}
- Node 17: {6, 12}
- Node 18: {4, 21, 22}
- Node 19: {8, 29}
- Node 20: {2, 14, 28, 25}
- Node 21: {18}
- Node 22: {4, 12, 18, 28}
- Node 23: {6, 8, 9, 26}
- Node 24: {9, 11, 13, 15}
- Node 25: {7, 8, 20}
- Node 26: {2, 22, 23, 28}
- Node 28: {1, 20, 22, 26}
- Node 29: {16, 19}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 20: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 22: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 23: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 24: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 26: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 28: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (10, 15, 28)>
<2, (3, 14, 20)>
<2, (14, 20, 26)>
<2, (3, 15, 24)>
<2, (14, 20, 25)>
<3, (2, 14, 15)>
<8, (1, 19, 23)>
<8, (1, 8, 25)>
<8, (1, 19, 29)>
<8, (8, 19, 29)>
<9, (23, 24, 26)>
<11, (7, 11, 13)>
<12, (4, 12, 22)>
<12, (10, 12, 17)>
<11, (7, 11, 13)>
<20, (20, 25, 28)>
<22, (4, 12, 18)>
<22, (12, 17, 22)>
<22, (12, 18, 22)>
<23, (6, 9, 23)>
<24, (11, 13, 24)>
<24, (11, 13, 24)>
<28, (1, 20, 22)>
<28, (1, 22, 26)>
<28, (20, 22, 26)>
