Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 17) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 5) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 15) (18, 9) (18, 1) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 13) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 14) (15, 12) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 8) (14, 15) (14, 19) (12, 15) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 3) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 8) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 3) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 16) (13, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and the provided edges, let's determine the number of 3-stars present in the graph:

1. For each node, identify its neighbors:
   - Node 0: {16}
   - Node 1: {13, 15, 18}
   - Node 2: {10, 15, 19}
   - Node 3: {8, 17, 19}
   - Node 4: {9, 13}
   - Node 5: {6, 7, 11}
   - Node 6: {5, 9, 10, 17, 19}
   - Node 7: {5, 8, 11, 13}
   - Node 8: {3, 7, 10, 16}
   - Node 9: {4, 6, 17, 18}
   - Node 10: {2, 6, 8}
   - Node 11: {5, 7}
   - Node 12: {}
   - Node 13: {1, 4, 7, 16}
   - Node 14: {15, 19}
   - Node 15: {1, 2, 12, 14}
   - Node 16: {0, 8, 13}
   - Node 17: {3, 6, 9}
   - Node 18: {1, 9}
   - Node 19: {2, 6, 14, 19}

2. Nodes with 3 neighbors or more:
   - Node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

3. Calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
   - Each node has \( \binom{n}{3} \) 3-stars, where n is the number of its neighbors.

4. Sum up the total number of 3-stars:
   - \[1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 6 + 4 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 4\] = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [59].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (13, 15, 18)>, <2, (10, 15, 19)>, <3, (8, 17, 19)>, <4, (9, 13)>, <5, (6, 7, 11)>, <6, (5, 9, 10)>, 
<7, (5, 8, 11)>, <8, (3, 7, 10)>, <9, (4, 6, 17)>, <10, (2, 6, 8)>, <13, (1, 4, 7)>, <15, (1, 2, 14)>, 
<16, (0, 13, 8)>, <17, (3, 6, 9)>, <18, (1, 9)>, <19, (2, 14, 19)>.
