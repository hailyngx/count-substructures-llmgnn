Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the final answer is [60], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <7, (3, 5, 8)>
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
