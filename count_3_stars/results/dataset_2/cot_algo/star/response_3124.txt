Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 64.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [64].
