Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 8) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 4: {2, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 12}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5, 6, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {6, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {4, 9, 12, 2}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 12: {3, 4, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 14: {5, 8, 9}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
Node 1 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
Node 2 forms 1 3-star. (2, 10, 11)
Node 3 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
Node 4 forms 1 3-star. (2, 10, 11)
Node 5 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
Node 6 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
Node 7 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
Node 8 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
Node 9 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
Node 10 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
Node 11 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
Node 12 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
Node 13 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
Node 14 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars found: <2, (10, 11)>
