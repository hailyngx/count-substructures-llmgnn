Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, we will represent the given graph in a clearer format:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8.

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph.

1. Node 0: This node has neighbors 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>.

2. Node 1: This node has neighbors 0, 2, 4, 8, and 9, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>.

3. Node 2: This node has neighbors 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>.

4. Nodes 0, 1, and 2 have already covered all possible 3-stars.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 10 + 10 = 30, and the final answer is [30].
