Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 24) (5, 21) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (15, 19) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 11) (27, 29) (27, 26) (0, 7) (0, 28) (24, 5) (24, 22) (24, 28) (24, 14) (26, 27) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (13, 1) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 28) (6, 29) (10, 9) (10, 19) (10, 20) (19, 15) (19, 10) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 3) (22, 24) (22, 19) (22, 12) (4, 26) (4, 21) (4, 2) (16, 23) (29, 27) (29, 6) (29, 8) (29, 12) (11, 15) (11, 7) (11, 8) (18, 19) (18, 8) (25, 15) (25, 12) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 2) (14, 24) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 8) (28, 0) (28, 24) (28, 1) (28, 17) (23, 16) (23, 21) (23, 20) (8, 29) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 14) (12, 22) (12, 29) (12, 25) (12, 20) (20, 10) (20, 23) (20, 12) (21, 5) (21, 26) (21, 4) (21, 23) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (17, 15) (17, 26) (17, 28) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {7, 28}
- Node 1: {13, 14, 28}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 14, 19}
- Node 4: {2, 21, 26}
- Node 5: {9, 21, 24}
- Node 6: {29}
- Node 7: {0, 11}
- Node 8: {11, 14, 18, 29}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 10}
- Node 10: {9, 19, 20}
- Node 11: {7, 8, 15}
- Node 12: {20, 22, 25, 29}
- Node 13: {1}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 8, 24}
- Node 15: {11, 17, 19, 25}
- Node 16: {23}
- Node 17: {15, 26, 28}
- Node 18: {8, 19}
- Node 19: {3, 10, 15, 18, 22}
- Node 20: {10, 12, 23}
- Node 21: {4, 5, 23, 26}
- Node 22: {19, 24}
- Node 23: {16, 20, 21}
- Node 24: {5, 14, 22, 28}
- Node 25: {12, 15}
- Node 26: {4, 17, 21, 27}
- Node 27: {26, 29}
- Node 28: {0, 1, 14, 17, 24}
- Node 29: {6, 8, 12, 27}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 12 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 18 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star.
- Node 19 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 29 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].
