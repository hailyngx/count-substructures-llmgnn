Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 11) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 9) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 10) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 6, 11}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 6, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 10}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 9, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 9, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors {4, 5, 9}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 6, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 14: Neighbors {2, 6, 12}

Now, we look for nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 5, 7)
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star with neighbors (5, 9, 11)
- Node 6: Forms two 3-stars with neighbors (0, 4, 6) and (12, 13, 14)
- Node 9: Forms four 3-stars with neighbors (3, 7, 9), (2, 9, 11), (9, 10, 11), and (1, 9, 11)
- Node 11: Forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 1, 11)
- Node 12: Forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 8, 12)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 2) + 2 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 9) + 1 (from node 11) + 1 (from node 12) = 10

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
- <0, 1, 5, 7>
- <2, 5, 9, 11>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <12, 13, 14>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <2, 9, 11>
- <9, 10, 11>
- <1, 9, 11>
- <0, 1, 11>
- <1, 8, 12>
