Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \binom{3}{3} = 1$, so we have 1 3-star.
- Node 1: \binom{3}{4} = 4$, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 2: \binom{4}{3} = 4$, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 3: \binom{7}{3} = 35$, so there are 35 3-stars.
- Node 4: \binom{4}{3} = 4$, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 5: \binom{4}{3} = 4$, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 6: \binom{5}{3} = 10$, so there are 10 3-stars.
- Node 7: \binom{4}{3} = 4$, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 8: \binom{2}{3} = 0$, so there are no 3-stars.
- Node 9: \binom{4}{3} = 4$, so there are 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 4 + 35 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 66, so the answer is [66].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 8, 9>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <4, 7, 9>
