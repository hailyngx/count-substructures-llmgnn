Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 26) (15, 4) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 6) (6, 27) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 22) (9, 17) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 17) (3, 24) (3, 26) (8, 23) (8, 16) (8, 22) (23, 8) (23, 5) (4, 15) (4, 1) (4, 24) (2, 26) (18, 6) (18, 19) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 5) (20, 27) (20, 0) (20, 13) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 5) (21, 22) (21, 29) (28, 0) (28, 21) (11, 15) (11, 1) (11, 12) (22, 9) (22, 8) (22, 21) (22, 12) (22, 25) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (25, 22) (29, 21) (29, 12) (10, 21) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 16) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 26) (14, 12) (14, 24) (26, 15) (26, 3) (26, 2) (26, 14) (19, 18) (16, 8) (16, 10) (17, 9) (17, 3) (5, 23) (5, 0) (5, 21) (24, 3) (24, 4) (24, 14) (13, 9) (13, 20) (13, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 22) (12, 29) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph as an adjacency list:

1: [11, 14, 4]
2: [26]
3: [17, 24, 26]
4: [15, 1, 24]
5: [23, 0, 21]
6: [27, 18, 12]
7: [0, 10, 14]
8: [23, 16, 22]
9: [22, 17, 13]
0: [20, 7, 28, 5]
11: [15, 1, 12]
12: [6, 11, 22, 29, 14]
13: [9, 20, 10]
14: [1, 7, 26, 12, 24]
15: [27, 26, 4]
16: [8, 10]
17: [9, 3]
18: [6, 19]
19: [18]
20: [27, 13, 0]
21: [28, 10, 5, 22, 29]
22: [9, 8, 21, 12, 25]
23: [8, 5]
24: [3, 4, 14]
25: [22]
26: [15, 3, 2, 14]
27: [15, 20, 6]
28: [21, 0]
29: [12, 21]

Now, let's identify the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
Node 2 has only 1 neighbor, so no 3-star forms.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
Node 12 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star forms.
Node 17 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star forms.
Node 18 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star forms.
Node 19 has only 1 neighbor, so no 3-star forms.
Node 20 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
Node 21 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 22 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 23 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star forms.
Node 24 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
Node 25 has only 1 neighbor, so no 3-star forms.
Node 26 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 27 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
Node 28 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star forms.
Node 29 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star forms.

Total number of 3-stars: 56
This final number goes inside brackets [], so the answer is [56].
