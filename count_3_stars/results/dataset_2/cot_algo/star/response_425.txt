Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 15) (17, 11) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 14) (0, 6) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 9) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 19) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 9) (16, 2) (1, 5) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (11, 17) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 2) (9, 19) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 3) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 7) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 1) (18, 15) (13, 19) (13, 4) (2, 16) (2, 11) (15, 17) (15, 18) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-star structures:

<0, (14, 6, 10)>
<1, (5, 18, 15)>
<2, (16, 11, 2)>
<3, (14, 9, 7)>
<4, (9, 13, 4)>
<5, (8, 1, 18)>
<6, (0, 5, 6)>
<7, (3, 11, 10)>
<8, (5, 17, 19)>
<9, (4, 12, 3)>
<10, (14, 7, 10)>
<11, (17, 12, 7)>
<12, (18, 9, 11)>
<13, (19, 4, 13)>
<14, (17, 0, 3)>
<15, (17, 18, 15)>
<16, (2, 17, 16)>
<17, (14, 19, 15)>
<18, (5, 12, 1)>
<19, (17, 8, 13)>

Based on the information above, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
