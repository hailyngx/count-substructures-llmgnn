Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 8) (10, 4) (10, 19) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 19) (2, 4) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 18) (7, 13) (8, 17) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 14) (9, 11) (9, 15) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 12) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 4) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 3) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 18) (16, 18) (15, 9) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 18) (3, 18) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: (4, 5, 7)
- Node 1: (4, 7, 14)
- Node 2: (4, 19)
- Node 3: (5, 13, 18)
- Node 4: (0, 1, 2, 10, 12)
- Node 5: (0, 3, 8)
- Node 6: (8, 17, 18)
- Node 7: (0, 1, 13, 18)
- Node 8: (5, 6, 8, 11, 17)
- Node 9: (11, 14, 15)
- Node 10: (4, 19)
- Node 11: (8, 9, 12)
- Node 12: (4, 11, 17)
- Node 13: (5, 7, 3)
- Node 14: (1, 9, 17)
- Node 15: (9)
- Node 16: (18)
- Node 17: (6, 8, 12, 14)
- Node 18: (3, 6, 7, 16, 19)
- Node 19: (2, 10, 18)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 10 (nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19)
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 2 (nodes 4, 8)

For the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, the number of 3-stars formed by each node is given by \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), as they have exactly 3 neighbors.

For the nodes with more than 3 neighbors (nodes 4 and 8), the number of 3-stars formed by each node is given by \( \binom{n}{3} \), where n is the number of neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19: \( 10 \times 1 = 10 \)
- For nodes 4 and 8: \( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 10 = 20 \)

Adding all the 3-stars:
- Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 = 30

Thus, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 14)>, <2, (4, 19)>, <6, (8, 17, 18)>, <11, (8, 9, 12)>, <12, (4, 11, 17)>, <13, (5, 7, 3)>, <15, (9)>, <16, (18)>, <19, (2, 10, 18)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>
