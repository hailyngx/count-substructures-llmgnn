Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 12) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 17) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 7) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 17) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 19) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (16, 8) (18, 19) (18, 14) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 14) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 12) (14, 7) (4, 11) (7, 8) (7, 14) 

Response:
The graph you provided has the following structure:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
(3, 15), (3, 17), (3, 6), (3, 9), (15, 3), (15, 1), (15, 12), (6, 3), (6, 9), (6, 5), 
(6, 13), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 11), (9, 17), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 1), (11, 9), 
(11, 10), (11, 0), (11, 4), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 8), (2, 5), (2, 13), (8, 5), 
(8, 16), (8, 0), (8, 7), (1, 15), (1, 10), (1, 17), (17, 3), (17, 9), (17, 1), 
(17, 19), (0, 11), (0, 8), (0, 13), (16, 8), (18, 19), (18, 14), (19, 17), (19, 18), 
(19, 14), (12, 15), (12, 10), (12, 14), (13, 6), (13, 2), (13, 0), (14, 18), (14, 19), 
(14, 12), (14, 7), (4, 11), (7, 8), (7, 14)

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

1. Node 0: Neighbors = {8, 11, 13}
2. Node 1: Neighbors = {10, 15, 17}
3. Node 2: Neighbors = {5, 13}
4. Node 3: Neighbors = {6, 9, 15, 17}
5. Node 4: Neighbors = {11}
6. Node 5: Neighbors = {2, 6, 8}
7. Node 6: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9, 13}
8. Node 7: Neighbors = {8, 14}
9. Node 8: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7, 16}
10. Node 9: Neighbors = {3, 6, 11, 17}
11. Node 10: Neighbors = {1, 11, 12}
12. Node 11: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9, 10}
13. Node 12: Neighbors = {10, 14, 15}
14. Node 13: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6}
15. Node 14: Neighbors = {7, 12, 18, 19}
16. Node 15: Neighbors = {3, 12, 1}
17. Node 16: Neighbors = {8}
18. Node 17: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9, 19}
19. Node 18: Neighbors = {14, 19}
20. Node 19: Neighbors = {17, 18}

The 3-stars in this graph are:

- <0, (8, 11, 13)>
- <1, (10, 12, 15)>
- <1, (10, 12, 17)>
- <1, (10, 15, 17)>
- <3, (6, 9, 15)>
- <3, (6, 9, 17)>
- <3, (9, 11, 17)>
- <3, (9, 15, 17)>
- <6, (3, 9, 13)>
- <6, (3, 5, 13)>
- <6, (5, 8, 13)>
- <8, (0, 7, 16)>
- <9, (3, 11, 17)>
- <10, (1, 11, 12)>
- <11, (0, 9, 4)>
- <12, (10, 14, 15)>
- <14, (7, 18, 19)>
- <14, (12, 18, 19)>
- <14, (12, 14, 19)>
- <17, (1, 9, 19)>
- <18, (14, 19, 18)>

Since we have found 21 unique 3-stars in the graph, the final answer is [21].
