Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 21) (6, 20) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 20) (14, 15) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 4) (0, 6) (0, 27) (0, 4) (27, 0) (27, 26) (27, 5) (20, 6) (20, 14) (20, 25) (20, 13) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 19) (25, 12) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 29) (28, 17) (28, 29) (29, 18) (29, 28) (29, 13) (29, 5) (21, 6) (21, 24) (13, 20) (13, 29) (13, 12) (13, 16) (26, 27) (26, 15) (7, 25) (7, 2) (7, 22) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 26) (11, 8) (11, 12) (23, 24) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 25) (19, 8) (19, 3) (5, 27) (5, 29) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 4) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 19) (12, 25) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 24) (24, 21) (24, 23) (24, 12) (24, 1) (1, 9) (1, 24) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 16) (22, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 6, 27}
- Node 1: {9, 24}
- Node 2: {7, 10, 18}
- Node 3: {9, 10, 19}
- Node 4: {0, 16, 17}
- Node 5: {27, 29}
- Node 6: {0, 20, 21}
- Node 7: {2, 22, 25}
- Node 8: {11, 16, 19}
- Node 9: {1, 3}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 14, 15, 17}
- Node 11: {8, 12}
- Node 12: {11, 13, 24, 25}
- Node 13: {12, 16, 20, 29}
- Node 14: {10, 15, 17, 20}
- Node 15: {10, 14, 18, 26}
- Node 16: {4, 8, 13}
- Node 17: {4, 10, 14, 28}
- Node 18: {2, 15, 29}
- Node 19: {3, 8, 25}
- Node 20: {6, 13, 14, 25}
- Node 21: {6, 24}
- Node 22: {7}
- Node 23: {24}
- Node 24: {1, 12, 21, 23}
- Node 25: {7, 8, 12, 19, 20}
- Node 26: {15, 27}
- Node 27: {0, 5, 26}
- Node 28: {17, 29}
- Node 29: {5, 13, 18, 28}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 6, Node 14, and Node 20 are the only nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, so they can form a total of 3 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <6, 0, 27>
- <14, 10, 15>
- <20, 13, 29>
