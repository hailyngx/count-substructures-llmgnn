Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 2) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 2) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 14) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 17) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 19) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 19) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 6) (14, 5) (14, 16) (14, 4) (7, 19) (7, 13) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 15) (19, 12) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 1) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 18) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 19) (8, 0) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {1, 8, 18}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 9, 19}
- Node 2: {9, 11, 15}
- Node 4: {12, 14, 17}
- Node 5: {1, 14, 16}
- Node 6: {17, 18, 19}
- Node 7: {13, 19}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 15}
- Node 10: {11, 12}
- Node 11: {2, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {4, 10, 13, 16, 19}
- Node 13: {7, 11, 12, 18}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 16}
- Node 15: {2, 9, 17, 18}
- Node 16: {5, 12, 14}
- Node 17: {4, 6, 15}
- Node 18: {0, 6, 13, 15}
- Node 19: {1, 6, 7, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22 \), so the final answer is [22].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <12, (4, 13, 19)>
- <13, (7, 18, 19)>
- <18, (0, 15, 6)>
