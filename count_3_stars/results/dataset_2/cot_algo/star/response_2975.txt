Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 6) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 9) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 14) (11, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 10) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8, 12, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 14, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 12, 6, 14}
- Node 3: {7, 1, 13, 0}
- Node 4: {7, 1, 2}
- Node 5: {1, 13, 6, 0, 10}
- Node 6: {1, 13, 5, 10, 2}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 2}
- Node 8: {1, 13, 14, 0}
- Node 9: {13, 12, 14, 0, 10}
- Node 10: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 11: {14}
- Node 12: {2, 0, 9}
- Node 13: {3, 8, 5, 9, 6}
- Node 14: {1, 8, 2, 11, 9}

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars each can form:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9, Node 13, Node 14 can form 3-stars.
- Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of the above nodes:
  - Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 84

Therefore, there are a total of [84] 3-stars in the given graph, and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 8, 12)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 6, 13)>
- <6, (1, 2, 13)>
- <8, (1, 13, 14)>
- <9, (0, 13, 14)>
- <13, (5, 6, 9)>
- <14, (1, 9, 11)>
