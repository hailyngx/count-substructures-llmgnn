This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 12) (29, 2) (29, 27) (29, 4) (29, 21) (4, 29) (4, 7) (4, 24) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 22) (7, 26) (18, 2) (18, 20) (18, 24) (5, 25) (5, 21) (6, 14) (6, 3) (15, 13) (15, 11) (20, 18) (19, 1) (19, 27) (26, 7) (26, 22) (26, 3) (22, 7) (22, 26) (22, 8) (0, 16) (0, 28) (0, 23) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 23) (14, 13) (10, 13) (10, 25) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 12) (17, 13) (17, 23) (8, 22) (8, 24) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 27) (21, 29) (21, 5) (21, 9) (21, 23) (25, 5) (25, 10) (25, 16) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 9) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 27) (24, 4) (24, 18) (24, 8) (24, 1) (9, 21) (9, 12) (9, 11) (27, 29) (27, 19) (27, 16) (27, 11) (27, 28) (28, 0) (28, 27) (3, 6) (3, 26) (1, 19) (1, 24) (23, 0) (23, 14) (23, 17) (23, 21)

Node 1 neighbors: 19, 24
Node 2 neighbors: 12, 18, 29
Node 3 neighbors: 6, 26
Node 4 neighbors: 7, 16, 24, 29
Node 5 neighbors: 21, 25
Node 6 neighbors: 3, 14
Node 7 neighbors: 4, 14, 22, 26
Node 8 neighbors: 22, 24
Node 9 neighbors: 11, 12, 21
Node 10 neighbors: 13, 25
Node 11 neighbors: 9, 15, 27
Node 12 neighbors: 2, 9, 13
Node 13 neighbors: 10, 12, 14, 17
Node 14 neighbors: 6, 7, 13, 23
Node 15 neighbors: 11, 13
Node 16 neighbors: 0, 4, 25, 27
Node 17 neighbors: 13, 23
Node 18 neighbors: 2, 20, 24
Node 19 neighbors: 1, 27
Node 20 neighbors: 18
Node 21 neighbors: 5, 9, 23, 29
Node 22 neighbors: 7, 8, 26
Node 23 neighbors: 0, 14, 17, 21
Node 24 neighbors: 4, 8, 18
Node 25 neighbors: 5, 10, 16
Node 26 neighbors: 3, 7, 22
Node 27 neighbors: 11, 19, 27, 28, 29
Node 28 neighbors: 0, 27
Node 29 neighbors: 2, 21, 27, 4

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:

Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <2, (12, 18, 29)>
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <4, (7, 16, 24)>, <4, (7, 16, 29)>, <4, (7, 24, 29)>, <4, (16, 24, 29)>
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <7, (4, 14, 22)>, <7, (4, 14, 26)>, <7, (4, 22, 26)>, <7, (14, 22, 26)>
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <9, (11, 12, 21)>
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <11, (9, 15, 27)>, <11, (9, 21, 27)>, <11, (15, 21, 27)>, <11, (9, 15, 21)>
Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars. <13, (12, 14, 17)>, <13, (12, 14, 23)>, <13, (12, 17, 23)>, <13, (14, 17, 23)>, <13, (14, 12, 23)>, <13, (10, 12, 14)>, <13, (10, 12, 17)>, <13, (10, 14, 17)>, <13, (12, 17, 10)>, <13, (14, 17, 10)>
Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <16, (0, 25, 27)>, <16, (4, 25, 27)>, <16, (0, 4, 25)>, <16, (0, 16, 27)>
Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <21, (5, 9, 29)>, <21, (5, 23, 29)>, <21, (9, 23, 29)>, <21, (5, 9, 23)>
Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <22, (7, 8, 26)>
Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <23, (14, 17, 21)>, <23, (14, 17, 23)>, <23, (14, 21, 23)>, <23, (17, 21, 23)>
Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <24, (8, 18, 4)>, <24, (8, 18, 24)>, <24, (8, 4, 18)>, <24, (18, 4, 24)>
Node 27 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars. <27, (19, 27, 28)>, <27, (19, 27, 29)>, <27, (19, 28, 29)>, <27, (27, 28, 29)>, <27, (19, 28, 27)>, <27, (11, 16, 27)>, <27, (11, 19, 27)>, <27, (16, 19, 27)>, <27, (11, 16, 19)>, <27, (16, 19, 11)>
Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <29, (2, 21, 27)>, <29, (2, 21, 9)>, <29, (21, 27, 9)>, <29, (2, 27, 9)>

Adding them up, we have a total of 45 3-stars, which can be represented as [45].
