Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 8) (9, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 19) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 15) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 21) (8, 18) (28, 6) (28, 3) (28, 0) (28, 2) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 23) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 25) (20, 2) (20, 19) (20, 5) (20, 16) (29, 0) (29, 5) (5, 17) (5, 20) (5, 29) (5, 19) (5, 25) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 20) (19, 5) (14, 1) (14, 26) (26, 14) (26, 11) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 22) (16, 20) (16, 7) (16, 2) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 24) (11, 26) (11, 12) (24, 3) (24, 2) (25, 6) (25, 15) (25, 5) (2, 28) (2, 20) (2, 16) (2, 24) (0, 4) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 21) (18, 8) (18, 23) (18, 27) (18, 13) (23, 17) (23, 1) (23, 18) (21, 8) (21, 0) (27, 18) (27, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 22) (22, 7) (22, 12) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 27) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 21, 28, 29
- Node 1: 14, 15, 23
- Node 2: 16, 20, 24, 28
- Node 3: 7, 24, 28
- Node 4: 8, 15, 8
- Node 5: 17, 19, 20, 25, 29
- Node 6: 8, 9, 25, 28
- Node 7: 3, 16, 22
- Node 8: 4, 6, 18, 21
- Node 9: 6
- Node 10: 12, 13, 19
- Node 11: 12, 26
- Node 12: 10, 11, 22
- Node 13: 10, 18, 27
- Node 14: 1, 26
- Node 15: 1, 4, 25
- Node 16: 2, 7, 20
- Node 17: 5, 19, 23
- Node 18: 8, 13, 27, 18
- Node 19: 5, 10, 17, 20
- Node 20: 2, 5, 16, 19
- Node 21: 0, 8
- Node 22: 7, 12
- Node 23: 1, 17, 18
- Node 24: 2, 3
- Node 25: 5, 6, 15
- Node 26: 11, 14
- Node 27: 13, 18
- Node 28: 2, 3, 6, 28
- Node 29: 0, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 (degree = 4)
- Node 2 (degree = 4)
- Node 5 (degree = 5)
- Node 6 (degree = 4)
- Node 8 (degree = 4)
- Node 18 (degree = 4)
- Node 19 (degree = 4)
- Node 28 (degree = 4)

For each of these nodes, we will calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) where n is the number of neighbors.

For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 34, so the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 21, 29>
<2, 16, 20, 24>
<5, 17, 19, 20>
<6, 8, 25, 28>
<8, 18, 27, 18>
<19, 5, 10, 20>
<28, 2, 3, 28>
