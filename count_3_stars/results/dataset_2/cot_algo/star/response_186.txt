Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9 (degree: 5)
- Node 1: 0, 4, 9 (degree: 3)
- Node 2: 3, 7, 8 (degree: 3)
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7, 9 (degree: 4)
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 7 (degree: 4)
- Node 5: 6, 8, 9 (degree: 3)
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5 (degree: 4)
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 8 (degree: 4)
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9 (degree: 5)
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8 (degree: 5)

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) where n is the degree of the node.

Calculations:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing these results: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <7, (2, 3, 4)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>
