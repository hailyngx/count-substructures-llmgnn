Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 4) (15, 7) (15, 14) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (18, 10) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 16) (6, 10) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 18) (10, 6) (10, 0) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 19) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 9) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 13) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 9) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 9) (12, 19) (12, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 9) (9, 1) (9, 16) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 19) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

1. Node 0: {4, 10, 13}
2. Node 1: {7, 11, 9}
3. Node 2: {4, 7, 13}
4. Node 3: {4, 16, 17, 19}
5. Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 14}
6. Node 5: {8, 11, 16}
7. Node 6: {8, 10}
8. Node 7: {1, 2, 15}
9. Node 8: {5, 6}
10. Node 9: {1, 12, 14, 16, 19}
11. Node 10: {0, 6, 18}
12. Node 11: {1, 5, 13}
13. Node 12: {9, 19}
14. Node 13: {0, 2, 11}
15. Node 14: {4, 9, 15}
16. Node 15: {7, 14}
17. Node 16: {3, 5, 9, 17}
18. Node 17: {3, 16, 19}
19. Node 18: {10, 19}
20. Node 19: {3, 9, 12, 17, 18}

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 29. 

Therefore, the final answer is [29], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<3, (4, 16, 17)>
<3, (4, 16, 19)>
<3, (4, 17, 19)>
<9, (14, 16, 19)>
<9, (16, 17, 19)>
