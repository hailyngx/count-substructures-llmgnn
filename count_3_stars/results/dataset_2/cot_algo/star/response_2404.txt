Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (11, 14) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 11) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {6, 7, 10, 2}
Node 1: {3, 10, 12, 14, 2}
Node 2: {9, 6, 1, 0}
Node 3: {1, 7, 8, 13, 14}
Node 4: {8, 12, 13}
Node 5: {9, 8}
Node 6: {9, 10, 2, 8, 0, 13}
Node 7: {3, 0}
Node 8: {5, 6, 3, 4, 14}
Node 9: {5, 6, 2, 14, 10, 12}
Node 10: {9, 6, 1, 0, 13}
Node 11: {14}
Node 12: {9, 1, 4}
Node 13: {6, 3, 4, 10}
Node 14: {9, 1, 3, 8, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 7, 11 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5 doesn't have enough neighbors to form a 3-star
- Node 7 doesn't have enough neighbors to form a 3-star
- Node 11 doesn't have enough neighbors to form a 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 = 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 6, 2, 10>
<0, 6, 2, 13>
<0, 6, 10, 13>
<0, 10, 13, 6>
<4, 8, 12>
