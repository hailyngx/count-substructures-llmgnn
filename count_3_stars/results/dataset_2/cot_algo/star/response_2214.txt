Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {6, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 3, 2, 0, 8, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {9, 1, 5, 4}
- Node 4: {6, 8, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {6, 3, 2}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 1, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 1, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {1, 4}
- Node 9: {6, 3, 7, 0}

Next, let's identify nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 6, and Node 9 have 4 or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42
Therefore, the final answer is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (6, 1, 7)>
- <1, (6, 3, 2)>
- <1, (6, 3, 8)>
- <1, (6, 2, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 2)>
- <4, (6, 8, 2)>
- <6, (9, 5, 7)>
