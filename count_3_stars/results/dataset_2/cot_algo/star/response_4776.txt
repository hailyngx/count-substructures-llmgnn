Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 7}

Using the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors, we find that nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9 have the potential to form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 68 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [68], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 5, 9>, <1, 2, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 6, 8>, <0, 4, 5, 9>, <0, 1, 4, 9>, <0, 1, 2, 9>.
