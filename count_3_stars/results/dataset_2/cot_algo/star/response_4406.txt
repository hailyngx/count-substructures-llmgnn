Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 5) (5, 14) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {12, 14, 2}
Node 1: Neighbors {5, 2, 4, 9}
Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 3}
Node 3: Neighbors {13, 10, 2}
Node 4: Neighbors {14, 1, 2, 11, 9}
Node 5: Neighbors {14, 6, 13, 8, 1}
Node 6: Neighbors {14, 5, 10, 13}
Node 7: Neighbors {12, 11, 10, 9}
Node 8: Neighbors {5, 10, 11}
Node 9: Neighbors {7, 1, 10, 4}
Node 10: Neighbors {7, 6, 3, 8, 9}
Node 11: Neighbors {7, 12, 8, 4}
Node 12: Neighbors {7, 14, 0, 11}
Node 13: Neighbors {5, 6, 3}
Node 14: Neighbors {12, 0, 6, 4, 5}

Identifying nodes that form 3-stars:
Node 0: Forms a 3-star with (12, 14, 2)
Node 1: Forms a 3-star with (5, 2, 4)
Node 2: Forms a 3-star with (0, 1, 4)
Node 3: Does not form a 3-star
Node 4: Forms a 3-star with (14, 1, 2)
Node 5: Forms a 3-star with (14, 6, 13)
Node 6: Forms a 3-star with (14, 5, 13)
Node 7: Forms a 3-star with (12, 11, 9)
Node 8: Does not form a 3-star
Node 9: Forms a 3-star with (7, 1, 10)
Node 10: Forms a 3-star with (7, 6, 3)
Node 11: Does not form a 3-star
Node 12: Forms a 3-star with (7, 14, 0)
Node 13: Does not form a 3-star
Node 14: Forms a 3-star with (12, 0, 6)

Counting the total number of 3-stars = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (12, 14, 2)>, <1, (5, 2, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (14, 1, 2)>, <5, (14, 6, 13)>, <6, (14, 5, 13)>, <7, (12, 11, 9)>, and <12, (7, 14, 0)>.
