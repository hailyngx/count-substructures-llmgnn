Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44].

List of unique 3-stars:
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
