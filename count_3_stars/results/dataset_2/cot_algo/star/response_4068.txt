Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the provided graph, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 6, 7, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 8, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 7, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 8, 3, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 2, 8, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 1, 3, 4, 0}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 6, 1, 4, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 4, 1, 0}

Next, we will identify the 3-stars:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes (9, 8, 7)
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes (5, 1, 3)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes (5, 6, 2)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes (6, 4, 1)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <5, (9, 8, 7)>, <7, (5, 1, 3)>, <8, (5, 6, 2)>, and <9, (6, 4, 1)>.
