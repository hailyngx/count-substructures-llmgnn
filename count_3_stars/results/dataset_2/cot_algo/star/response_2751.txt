Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (15, 14) (10, 7) (10, 14) (17, 13) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 6) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 1) (11, 17) (11, 4) (11, 7) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 13) (16, 3) (16, 0) (16, 9) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 14) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 11) (1, 18) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 14) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 13) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 1) (19, 17) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 1, 16}
- Node 1: {18, 0, 5, 14}
- Node 2: {7, 0}
- Node 3: {16}
- Node 4: {18, 12, 13, 0, 11}
- Node 5: {1, 13, 17}
- Node 6: {8, 18, 13}
- Node 7: {10, 2, 18, 11}
- Node 8: {6}
- Node 9: {18, 16, 14}
- Node 10: {7, 14}
- Node 11: {17, 4, 7}
- Node 12: {4, 13}
- Node 13: {17, 4, 5, 12, 6}
- Node 14: {15, 10, 9, 1}
- Node 15: {14}
- Node 16: {3, 0, 9}
- Node 17: {13, 19, 5, 11}
- Node 18: {4, 9, 6, 7, 1}
- Node 19: {17}

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 4, 7, 13, and 18 have 4 neighbors, so we need to calculate \( \text{inom}(4, 3) \) for each of these nodes.

Performing the calculations:
- Node 0: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \) 
- Node 4: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \) 
- Node 7: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \) 
- Node 13: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \) 
- Node 18: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \) 

Total 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 32 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 1)>
<4, (18, 12, 13)>
<7, (10, 2, 18)>
<13, (17, 5, 12)>
<18, (9, 6, 7)>
