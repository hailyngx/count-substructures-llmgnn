Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {12, 11, 22}
- Node 1: {26}
- Node 2: {29, 27}
- Node 3: {29, 27, 23}
- Node 4: {11, 21, 17}
- Node 5: {9, 19, 12, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 12}
- Node 7: {5, 29, 23, 27}
- Node 8: {28}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 25, 14, 10}
- Node 10: {9, 26, 16, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {20, 0, 21, 4}
- Node 12: {5, 6, 10, 0}
- Node 13: {20, 10, 27}
- Node 14: {9, 25, 24}
- Node 15: {28, 23}
- Node 16: {18, 28, 10}
- Node 17: {18, 19, 4, 24}
- Node 18: {22, 16, 17, 25}
- Node 19: {5, 17}
- Node 20: {13, 11}
- Node 21: {11, 4}
- Node 22: {18, 27, 0}
- Node 23: {3, 7, 15}
- Node 24: {17, 14}
- Node 25: {9, 18, 14}
- Node 26: {1, 10}
- Node 27: {2, 29, 3, 7, 13}
- Node 28: {18, 8, 15}
- Node 29: {2, 7, 3}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding them up:
4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [41].
