Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 13) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 8) (4, 15) (4, 9) (7, 9) (7, 1) (10, 0) (10, 18) (8, 14) (8, 17) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 6) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 6) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 5) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 6) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 11) (12, 1) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 19) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 0) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 16) (11, 18) (11, 12) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 3
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 3
- Node 10: 2
- Node 11: 2
- Node 12: 5
- Node 13: 4
- Node 14: 4
- Node 15: 4
- Node 16: 3
- Node 17: 4
- Node 18: 4
- Node 19: 2

We will now consider the neighbor sets for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: {1, 6, 10}
- For Node 1: {0, 7, 12, 16}
- For Node 2: {6, 13, 18}
- For Node 3: {12, 13, 15}
- For Node 6: {0, 2, 18}
- For Node 9: {4, 7, 19}
- For Node 12: {1, 3, 16, 17, 11}
- For Node 13: {2, 5, 14, 3}
- For Node 14: {5, 8, 13, 17}
- For Node 15: {19, 3, 4, 15}
- For Node 16: {17, 1, 12}
- For Node 17: {8, 12, 14, 16}
- For Node 18: {0, 2, 6, 11}

Calculating the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: 1 3-star 
- For Node 1: 1 3-star 
- For Node 2: 1 3-star 
- For Node 3: 1 3-star 
- For Node 6: 1 3-star 
- For Node 9: 1 3-star 
- For Node 12: 10 3-stars 
- For Node 13: 1 3-star 
- For Node 14: 1 3-star 
- For Node 15: 1 3-star 
- For Node 16: 1 3-star 
- For Node 17: 1 3-star 
- For Node 18: 1 3-star 

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [21]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 10>
<1, 0, 12>
<2, 6, 18>
<3, 12, 16>
<6, 0, 18>
<9, 4, 19>
<12, 1, 16>
<12, 3, 17>
<12, 11, 18>
<12, 13, 14>
<12, 13, 17>
<12, 13, 5>
<12, 16, 17>
<13, 12, 14>
<14, 12, 17>
<14, 5, 13>
<15, 3, 4>
<16, 12, 17>
<17, 12, 14>
<17, 12, 16>
<18, 0, 6>
