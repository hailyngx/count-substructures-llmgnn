Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 7) (1, 19) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 8) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (17, 18) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 5) (16, 6) (16, 0) (18, 17) (18, 14) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 11) (4, 9) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 15) (15, 6) (15, 0) (15, 7) (15, 11) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 14) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 13) (10, 9) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 15) 

Response:
Given that we have 20 nodes and 60 edges in the graph, we will first determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {2, 5, 8, 15, 16}
Node 1: {7, 19}
Node 2: {0, 5, 8}
Node 3: {8, 13, 19}
Node 4: {9}
Node 5: {0, 2, 11, 15}
Node 6: {9, 11, 15, 16, 19}
Node 7: {1, 9, 15}
Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 11, 12}
Node 9: {4, 6, 7, 10}
Node 10: {9, 12}
Node 11: {5, 6, 8, 15}
Node 12: {8, 10, 13, 14}
Node 13: {3, 12, 14}
Node 14: {12, 13, 18}
Node 15: {0, 6, 7, 11}
Node 16: {0, 6}
Node 17: {18}
Node 18: {14, 17}
Node 19: {1, 3, 6}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-star subgraphs:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 19

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (8, 12, 13)>
<6, (9, 15, 16)>
<8, (0, 2, 15)>
<9, (6, 11, 15)>
<11, (5, 8, 15)>
<12, (8, 10, 13)>
<13, (3, 12, 14)>
<15, (7, 11, 19)>
<19, (1, 3, 6)>
