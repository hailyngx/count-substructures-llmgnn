Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 10) (9, 0) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 10) (15, 5) (15, 16) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 13) (7, 17) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 0) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 18) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 2) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 12) (18, 8) (18, 10) (19, 7) (19, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 10) (11, 4) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 16) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 16) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 1) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 6) (12, 1) (12, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 9, 13, 10}
- Node 1: {17, 6, 2, 16}
- Node 2: {4, 17, 1}
- Node 3: {5, 14, 10}
- Node 4: {7, 2, 11}
- Node 5: {0, 15, 3}
- Node 6: {1, 12, 16}
- Node 7: {4, 19, 13, 17}
- Node 8: {13, 18}
- Node 9: {10, 0}
- Node 10: {9, 3, 0, 18}
- Node 11: {4}
- Node 12: {1, 6}
- Node 13: {7, 8, 0, 16}
- Node 14: {3, 19, 16}
- Node 15: {5, 16}
- Node 16: {15, 13, 1, 14, 6}
- Node 17: {7, 2, 1}
- Node 18: {8, 10}
- Node 19: {7, 14}

Next, we'll check which nodes have three or more neighbors since these nodes can potentially form 3-stars. 
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, and 17.

Now, we'll apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes to find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors)

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes: 
\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 30 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 5, 15>
- <0, 5, 3>
- <0, 5, 13>
- <0, 5, 10>
- <1, 17, 7>
- <1, 17, 2>
- <1, 17, 16>
- <1, 6, 12>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <3, 5, 14>
- <3, 5, 10>
- <4, 7, 13>
- <4, 7, 17>
- <10, 9, 18>
- <10, 3, 0>
- <13, 7, 19>
- <13, 7, 17>
- <13, 7, 16>
- <13, 0, 10>
- <14, 3, 16>
- <16, 15, 13>
- <16, 15, 6>
- <16, 15, 14>
- <16, 13, 1>
- <16, 13, 14>
- <16, 13, 6>
- <16, 1, 12>
- <16, 14, 6>
- <17, 7, 2>
- <18, 8, 13>
- <19, 7, 14>
