Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 6) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 5, 11, 12, 13
- Node 1: 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 10, 11
- Node 3: 6, 7, 9, 12, 13
- Node 4: 5, 10, 13, 14
- Node 5: 0, 4, 9, 12, 14
- Node 6: 3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14
- Node 7: 3, 6, 10
- Node 8: 1, 6, 9, 10
- Node 9: 3, 5, 8, 13
- Node 10: 4, 7, 8, 2
- Node 11: 0, 2, 6, 13
- Node 12: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 13: 0, 3, 4, 11, 12
- Node 14: 4, 5, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars each of them forms:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 75

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [75].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, 11, 12>, <0, 11, 13>, <0, 6, 12>, <0, 6, 13>, <2, 1, 8>, 
<3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 12>, <3, 6, 13>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 10, 13>, 
<4, 13, 11>, <4, 13, 12>, <4, 5, 14>, <5, 9, 12>, <5, 9, 14>, 
<5, 4, 14>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 11, 12>, <6, 11, 14>, <8, 9, 10>, 
<9, 8, 13>.
