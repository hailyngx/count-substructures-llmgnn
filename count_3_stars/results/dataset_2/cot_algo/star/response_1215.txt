Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6
- Node 4: 0, 3, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 9: 5, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 0 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 0 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 0 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 0 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 0 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 0 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [38].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
