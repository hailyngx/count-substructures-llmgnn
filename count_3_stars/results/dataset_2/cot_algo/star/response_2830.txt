Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 23) (13, 7) (13, 18) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 27) (22, 12) (3, 17) (3, 23) (3, 8) (15, 26) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 24) (9, 26) (9, 17) (9, 16) (26, 15) (26, 9) (26, 14) (4, 24) (4, 2) (7, 13) (0, 20) (0, 10) (0, 19) (20, 0) (20, 1) (20, 21) (20, 23) (20, 11) (1, 20) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 14) (10, 0) (21, 13) (21, 20) (21, 18) (14, 22) (14, 26) (14, 1) (14, 18) (2, 22) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 11) (12, 22) (12, 18) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 19) (11, 20) (11, 2) (6, 25) (6, 8) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 9) (5, 23) (5, 27) (23, 13) (23, 3) (23, 20) (23, 5) (27, 22) (27, 5) (27, 29) (27, 24) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 25) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 29) (18, 13) (18, 21) (18, 14) (18, 12) (24, 15) (24, 4) (24, 27) (25, 6) (25, 29) (25, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 25) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {10, 19, 20}
- Node 1: {2, 14, 16, 20}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 11, 22}
- Node 3: {8, 15, 17, 23}
- Node 4: {2, 24}
- Node 5: {23, 27}
- Node 6: {8, 25}
- Node 7: {13}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 15, 25}
- Node 9: {16, 17, 26}
- Node 10: {0}
- Node 11: {2, 20}
- Node 12: {18, 22}
- Node 13: {7, 18, 21, 23}
- Node 14: {1, 18, 22, 26}
- Node 15: {3, 8, 17, 24, 26}
- Node 16: {1, 9, 19}
- Node 17: {3, 9, 15}
- Node 18: {12, 13, 14, 21}
- Node 19: {0, 16, 29}
- Node 20: {0, 1, 11, 13, 21, 23}
- Node 21: {13, 18, 20}
- Node 22: {2, 12, 14, 27}
- Node 23: {3, 5, 13, 20}
- Node 24: {4, 15, 27}
- Node 25: {6, 8, 29}
- Node 26: {9, 14, 15, 26}
- Node 27: {5, 22, 24, 29}
- Node 29: {19, 25, 27}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 43 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43].

List of unique 3-stars found:
- <13, (7, 18, 21)>
- <15, (3, 8, 17, 24)>
- <20, (1, 13, 21, 23)>
- <26, (9, 14, 15, 26)>
- <27, (5, 22, 24, 29)>
