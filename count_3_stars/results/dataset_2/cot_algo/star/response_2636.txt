Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 14) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify all the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 6: {5, 10}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 11}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 4, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 14: {5, 12}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (4, 7, 12)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (3, 7, 12)>
- <1, (3, 8, 12)>
- <1, (7, 8, 13)>
- <2, (5, 10, 11)>
- <2, (5, 9, 13)>
- <2, (9, 10, 13)>
- <7, (1, 8, 13)>
- <7, (3, 8, 13)>
- <7, (8, 10, 13)>
- <12, (0, 4, 14)>
- <12, (1, 4, 14)>
- <12, (4, 14, 5)>
