Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 5) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 11) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 5) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7, 10}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 8, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 5, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 4, 10, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 9, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 7, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {3, 7, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 10, 11}
- Node 14: Neighbors {3, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 7, 10} - <1, (2, 7, 10)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {8, 12, 14} - <3, (8, 12, 14)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 8, 14} - <5, (1, 8, 14)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 11}, {4, 11, 12}, and {1, 11, 14} - <7, (2, 4, 11)>, <7, (4, 11, 12)>, <7, (1, 11, 14)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 10, 11} - <9, (4, 10, 11)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 7, 9}, {7, 9, 12}, and {9, 11, 13} - <11, (4, 7, 9)>, <11, (7, 9, 12)>, <11, (9, 11, 13)>

Total number of 3-stars: [6]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 7, 10)>, <3, (8, 12, 14)>, <5, (1, 8, 14)>, <7, (2, 4, 11)>, <7, (4, 11, 12)>, <7, (1, 11, 14)>, <9, (4, 10, 11)>, <11, (4, 7, 9)>, <11, (7, 9, 12)>, <11, (9, 11, 13)>
