Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 16) (21, 10) (21, 9) (21, 15) (14, 6) (17, 9) (17, 18) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 24) (25, 3) (25, 23) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 18) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 29) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 0) (27, 12) (27, 23) (26, 1) (26, 10) (26, 15) (26, 6) (4, 23) (4, 6) (4, 2) (18, 17) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 24) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 10) (9, 21) (9, 17) (9, 22) (9, 28) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 5) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 15) (5, 18) (5, 22) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 28) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 7) (10, 29) (2, 4) (2, 22) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 0) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 24) (15, 21) (15, 26) (15, 11) (24, 3) (24, 8) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 0) (20, 1) (6, 14) (6, 26) (6, 4) (0, 12) (0, 28) (0, 24) (23, 25) (23, 27) (23, 4) (29, 13) (29, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8]. 

The unique 3-stars are <1, (16, 20, 26)>, <3, (11, 24, 25)>, <8, (18, 24, 27)>, <9, (21, 22, 28)>, <10, (21, 26, 29)>, <12, (0, 27, 28)>, <15, (11, 21, 26)>, <18, (8, 24, 5)>.
