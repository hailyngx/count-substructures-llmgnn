Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {3, 8, 9, 4}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 8, 7}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 7, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 0, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 9, 0}
- Node 5: {6, 8}
- Node 6: {5, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 2, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 6, 2, 9, 0}
- Node 9: {3, 8, 4, 7, 0}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 8, Node 9

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 46 3-stars. 
Therefore, the final answer is [46]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 3, 8, 9>
- <1, 3, 7, 8>
- <2, 4, 7, 8>
- <4, 0, 1, 2>
- <8, 6, 5, 2>
- <9, 3, 7, 0>
