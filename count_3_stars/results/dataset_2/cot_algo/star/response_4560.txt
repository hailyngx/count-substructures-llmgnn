Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 12) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 11) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 13}
- Node 2: {3, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {7, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 10}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 8, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 6, 13}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 4, 9, 10}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to form potential 3-stars:

- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 78

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [78].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, 3, 14>, <2, 3, 11>, <2, 3, 12>, <2, 14, 9>, <3, 10, 14>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 11, 13>, <6, 12, 2>, <7, 4, 8>, <10, 5, 13>
