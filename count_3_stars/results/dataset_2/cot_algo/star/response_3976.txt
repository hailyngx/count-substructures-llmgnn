Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 7) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (17, 19) (17, 15) (2, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 6) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 15) (4, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 0) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 18) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 18) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 18) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 9) (18, 6) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 6) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 15) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 10, 7, 16
- Node 1: 3, 10, 16
- Node 2: 11
- Node 3: 1, 7
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 8, 13, 16, 19
- Node 6: 7, 13, 15, 18
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6, 9, 13
- Node 8: 5, 12, 14
- Node 9: 4, 7, 18
- Node 10: 0, 1, 12
- Node 11: 2, 13, 18
- Node 12: 8, 10
- Node 13: 5, 7, 11, 14, 18, 6
- Node 14: 8, 13, 18
- Node 15: 6, 17, 19
- Node 16: 1, 5, 0
- Node 17: 15, 19
- Node 18: 11, 14, 9, 6
- Node 19: 17, 15, 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 18, 19 (11 nodes)
- Total 3-stars = inom{11}{3} = 165

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [165].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 7, 16>
- <1, 3, 16>
- <5, 13, 16>
- <6, 7, 18>
- <7, 13, 18>
- <10, 0, 16>
- <13, 6, 18>
- <15, 17, 19>
- <18, 6, 15>
