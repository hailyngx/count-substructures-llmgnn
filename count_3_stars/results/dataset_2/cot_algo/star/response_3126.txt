Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 16) (9, 6) (2, 0) (2, 11) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 13) (7, 16) (7, 8) (12, 5) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 11) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 17) (8, 7) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 5) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 13) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 10) (15, 19) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 15) (16, 6) (16, 7) (16, 4) (14, 8) (14, 5) (1, 8) (1, 13) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (17, 0) (17, 4) (13, 18) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 1) 

Response:
The graph described has 20 nodes and 60 edges, and it is not a 3-star graph as it has nodes with more than three neighbors. 

We need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors in order to calculate the number of 3-stars formed.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 2, 15, 17, 11)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 8, 13, 16, 17)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 18, 12, 11, 14)

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 15, 17)>
- <0, (2, 15, 11)>
- <0, (2, 17, 11)>
- <0, (15, 17, 11)>
- <4, (8, 13, 16)>
- <4, (8, 13, 17)>
- <4, (8, 16, 17)>
- <4, (13, 16, 17)>
- <5, (18, 12, 11)>
- <5, (18, 12, 14)>
- <5, (18, 11, 14)>
- <5, (12, 11, 14)>
