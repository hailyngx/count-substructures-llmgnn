Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (17, 16) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 13) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 15) (13, 18) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 4) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 12) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 0) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 2) (19, 1) (19, 11) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 2) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 9) (8, 1) (8, 18) (7, 15) (9, 14) (9, 11) (9, 2) (18, 5) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 8) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {12}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 8, 19}
- Node 2: {1, 9, 11, 16}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 16}
- Node 4: {3, 12, 15}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 13, 16, 18}
- Node 6: {5, 13}
- Node 7: {15}
- Node 8: {1, 18}
- Node 9: {2, 11, 14}
- Node 10: {15, 18}
- Node 11: {2, 9, 14, 19}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 14}
- Node 13: {5, 6, 15, 18}
- Node 14: {9, 11, 12}
- Node 15: {4, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 16: {2, 3, 5, 17}
- Node 17: {16}
- Node 18: {5, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 19: {1, 11}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: 4 neighbors (3-star)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (3-star)
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (3-star)
- Node 15: 4 neighbors (3-star)
- Node 16: 4 neighbors (3-star)
- Node 18: 4 neighbors (3-star)

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Total 3-stars = 1 (from Node 1) + 1 (from Node 3) + 1 (from Node 5) + 1 (from Node 15) + 1 (from Node 16) + 1 (from Node 18) = 6

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the given graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 2, 3, 8>
<3, 1, 4, 5>
<5, 3, 6, 13>
<15, 4, 7, 10>
<16, 2, 5, 17>
<18, 5, 8, 13>
