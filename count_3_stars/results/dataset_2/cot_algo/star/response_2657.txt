Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 3) (29, 2) (29, 25) (29, 15) (29, 22) (29, 18) (10, 17) (10, 22) (17, 10) (17, 23) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 23) (20, 0) (20, 27) (1, 26) (1, 7) (1, 27) (1, 8) (26, 1) (21, 28) (21, 8) (21, 18) (28, 21) (28, 16) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 15) (5, 2) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 24) (13, 9) (13, 27) (16, 0) (16, 28) (16, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 15) (7, 27) (14, 15) (14, 25) (8, 1) (8, 21) (8, 24) (8, 6) (24, 13) (24, 8) (19, 3) (19, 27) (19, 12) (15, 29) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 22) (4, 13) (4, 16) (22, 29) (22, 10) (22, 15) (25, 29) (25, 14) (25, 18) (23, 17) (23, 0) (23, 9) (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 6) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 3) (9, 13) (9, 23) (18, 29) (18, 21) (18, 11) (18, 25) (27, 20) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 7) (27, 19) (12, 19) 

Response:
The graph has 30 nodes and a total of 90 edges. Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. For node 2: Neighbors {29, 5, 3}, 3-stars formed: inom{3}{3} = 1
2. For node 29: Neighbors {2, 25, 15, 22, 18}, 3-stars formed: inom{5}{3} = 10
3. For node 10: Neighbors {17, 22}, 3-stars formed: 0
4. For node 17: Neighbors {10, 23}, 3-stars formed: 0
5. For node 0: Neighbors {20, 7, 16, 23}, 3-stars formed: inom{4}{3} = 4
6. For node 20: Neighbors {0, 27}, 3-stars formed: 0
7. For node 1: Neighbors {26, 7, 27, 8}, 3-stars formed: inom{4}{3} = 4
8. For node 26: Neighbors {1}, 3-stars formed: 0
9. For node 21: Neighbors {28, 8, 18}, 3-stars formed: 0
10. For node 28: Neighbors {21, 16}, 3-stars formed: 0
11. For node 11: Neighbors {18, 6, 15}, 3-stars formed: 0
12. For node 5: Neighbors {2, 13}, 3-stars formed: 0
13. For node 13: Neighbors {5, 4, 24, 9, 27}, 3-stars formed: inom{5}{3} = 10
14. For node 16: Neighbors {0, 28, 4}, 3-stars formed: 0
15. For node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 15, 27}, 3-stars formed: 0
16. For node 14: Neighbors {15, 25}, 3-stars formed: 0
17. For node 8: Neighbors {1, 21, 24, 6}, 3-stars formed: inom{4}{3} = 4
18. For node 24: Neighbors {13, 8}, 3-stars formed: 0
19. For node 19: Neighbors {3, 27, 12}, 3-stars formed: 0
20. For node 15: Neighbors {29, 11, 7, 14, 22}, 3-stars formed: inom{5}{3} = 10
21. For node 4: Neighbors {13, 16}, 3-stars formed: 0
22. For node 22: Neighbors {29, 10, 15}, 3-stars formed: 0
23. For node 25: Neighbors {29, 14, 18}, 3-stars formed: 0
24. For node 23: Neighbors {17, 0, 9}, 3-stars formed: 0
25. For node 3: Neighbors {2, 19, 6}, 3-stars formed: 0
26. For node 6: Neighbors {11, 8, 3}, 3-stars formed: 0
27. For node 9: Neighbors {13, 23}, 3-stars formed: 0
28. For node 18: Neighbors {29, 21, 11, 25}, 3-stars formed: inom{4}{3} = 4
29. For node 27: Neighbors {20, 1, 13, 7, 19}, 3-stars formed: inom{5}{3} = 10
30. For node 12: Neighbors {19}, 3-stars formed: 0

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (29, 5, 3)>, <13, (5, 4, 24)>, <1, (26, 7, 27)>, <8, (1, 21, 24)>, <15, (29, 11, 7)>, <27, (20, 1, 13)>, <18, (29, 21, 11)>
