The edges are as follows: (9, 0) (9, 28) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 16) (26, 8) (13, 22) (13, 29) (13, 20) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 20) (22, 17) (2, 14) (2, 21) (2, 11) (29, 13) (29, 17) (29, 25) (0, 9) (0, 5) (27, 4) (27, 18) (27, 7) (27, 5) (20, 13) (20, 22) (20, 25) (20, 17) (25, 29) (25, 20) (25, 1) (25, 24) (17, 22) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 19) (17, 7) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 18) (28, 9) (28, 26) (4, 22) (4, 27) (4, 19) (4, 21) (3, 16) (21, 2) (21, 4) (21, 23) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 16) (10, 14) (15, 10) (15, 12) (5, 0) (5, 27) (5, 10) (5, 19) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 5) (14, 26) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 10) (1, 25) (1, 6) (1, 23) (6, 1) (8, 26) (8, 24) (8, 18) (23, 21) (23, 1) (23, 24) (24, 25) (24, 8) (24, 23) (7, 27) (7, 17) (18, 27) (18, 11) (18, 8) (16, 26) (16, 3) (16, 10) (12, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {25, 6, 23}
- Node 2: Neighbors {14, 21, 11}
- Node 3: Neighbor {16}
- Node 4: Neighbors {22, 27, 19, 21}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 27, 10, 19}
- Node 6: Neighbor {1}
- Node 7: Neighbors {27, 17}
- Node 8: Neighbors {26, 24, 18}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 28}
- Node 10: Neighbors {15, 5, 16, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {2, 14, 18}
- Node 12: Neighbor {15}
- Node 13: Neighbors {22, 29, 20}
- Node 14: Neighbors {26, 2, 11, 10}
- Node 15: Neighbors {10, 12}
- Node 16: Neighbors {26, 3, 10}
- Node 17: Neighbors {22, 29, 20, 19, 7}
- Node 18: Neighbors {27, 11, 8}
- Node 19: Neighbors {4, 5, 17}
- Node 20: Neighbors {13, 22, 25, 17}
- Node 21: Neighbors {2, 4, 23}
- Node 22: Neighbors {13, 4, 20, 17}
- Node 23: Neighbors {1, 21, 24}
- Node 24: Neighbors {25, 8, 23}
- Node 25: Neighbors {29, 1, 20, 24}
- Node 26: Neighbors {28, 14, 8, 16}
- Node 27: Neighbors {4, 18, 5, 7}
- Node 28: Neighbors {9, 26}
- Node 29: Neighbors {13, 25, 17}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2, 13, 17, 20, 22, 25, and 27 have 4 neighbors, so for each of these nodes, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed. 
- Node 10 and 14 have 4 neighbors, resulting in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 7 \times 4 + 2 \times 4 = 28 + 8 = 36 \)

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [36].

The unique 3-stars formed are:
<2, (14, 21, 11)>
<13, (22, 29, 20)>
<17, (22, 29, 20)>
<20, (13, 22, 25)>
<22, (13, 29, 20)>
<25, (13, 29, 20)>
<27, (4, 18, 5)>
<10, (15, 16, 14)>
<14, (26, 2, 11)>
<19, (4, 5, 17)>
