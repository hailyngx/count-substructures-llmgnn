Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (1, 4) (1, 13) (9, 13) (9, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 1: {4, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 12, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 8, 12}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {6, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {11, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 3, 9, 14}
- Node 12: {2, 6, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 11, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which can potentially form 3-stars:
- Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 13

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, there's 1 3-star formed.
- For the nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we can apply \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars formed.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For each node with exactly 3 neighbors, add 1 to the count.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
  - Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total, we get: 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 55

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [55].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <7, (3, 5, 10)>
- <7, (3, 13, 8)>
- <7, (3, 13, 12)>
- <7, (5, 8, 10)>
- <7, (5, 8, 12)>
- <13, (4, 8, 12)>
- <13, (4, 8, 9)>
- <13, (4, 12, 9)>
- <13, (7, 8, 12)>
- <13, (7, 8, 9)>
- <13, (7, 12, 9)>
- <12, (6, 8, 10)>
- <12, (6, 8, 14)>
- <12, (6, 10, 14)>
- <12, (8, 10, 14)>
- <0, (2, 10, 11)>
- <0, (2, 10, 12)>
- <0, (2, 11, 12)>
- <2, (0, 12, 14)>
- <2, (5, 12, 14)>
- <2, (5, 3, 14)>
- <3, (5, 7, 14)>
- <3, (11, 9, 14)>
- <3, (11, 0, 14)>
- <4, (1, 13, 9)>
- <4, (6, 12, 8)>
- <6, (8, 10, 12)>
- <8, (10, 0, 12)>
- <10, (0, 6, 12)>
- <11, (0, 9, 14)> 

These unique 3-stars encapsulate the structure of the 3-star graph within the given network.
