Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 6) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 5) (2, 16) (2, 18) (2, 9) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 15) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 10) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (1, 6) (1, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 17) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 7) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 8) (12, 13) (12, 1) (14, 3) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 9) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 19) (17, 15) (17, 9) (17, 3) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in terms of neighbors for each node:

1: {6, 12}
2: {6, 9, 16, 18}
3: {4, 14, 17, 19}
4: {0, 3, 18, 19}
5: {10, 13}
6: {1, 2, 8, 16}
7: {9, 10, 16}
8: {0, 6, 9, 11}
9: {2, 7, 8, 17}
10: {5, 7, 11, 19}
11: {8, 10, 15}
12: {1, 13}
13: {0, 5, 12}
14: {3}
15: {11, 17, 18}
16: {2, 6, 7}
17: {3, 9, 15}
18: {2, 4, 15}
19: {4, 10, 19}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph:

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 18, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 24

Therefore, the final answer is [24], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, 6, 16>
- <3, 4, 19>
- <4, 18, 15>
- <6, 8, 16>
- <8, 9, 17>
- <9, 7, 10>
- <10, 11, 15>
