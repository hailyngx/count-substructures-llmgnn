Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 12) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 19) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 2) (18, 17) (4, 11) (17, 18) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 14) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 8) (7, 5) (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 6) (19, 1) (19, 2) (9, 15) (9, 17) (12, 15) (12, 13) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (14, 2) (14, 5) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: (8, 17, 5)
- Node 1: (3, 10, 19)
- Node 2: (8, 18, 19, 6, 14)
- Node 3: (1, 16, 6, 18)
- Node 4: (11)
- Node 5: (13, 0, 16, 7, 14)
- Node 6: (3, 2, 16)
- Node 7: (5)
- Node 8: (2, 10, 0)
- Node 9: (15, 17)
- Node 10: (15, 1, 8)
- Node 11: (13, 4)
- Node 12: (15, 13)
- Node 13: (5, 12, 11)
- Node 14: (2, 5)
- Node 15: (10, 9, 18, 12)
- Node 16: (3, 17, 5, 6)
- Node 17: (18, 16, 0, 9)
- Node 18: (15, 3, 2, 17)
- Node 19: (1, 2)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 10: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 15: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 18: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (8, 17, 5)>, <2, (8, 18, 14)>, <3, (1, 16, 6)>, <5, (13, 0, 16)>, <15, (10, 9, 18)>, <16, (3, 17, 6)>, <17, (18, 16, 9)>, <18, (15, 2, 17)>
