Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 10) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 10) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node. 

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6, 10}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 7, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 8, 11}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 11, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 9, 10}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 5, 10, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 7, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 2, 9, 10}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 10, 11, 12}

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed for each node with three or more neighbors.

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 70

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 13, 14)>, <2, (3, 7, 13)>, <6, (1, 10, 11)>, <7, (3, 9, 10)>, <8, (4, 10, 12)>, <10, (1, 13, 14)>, <12, (2, 9, 14)>, <14, (0, 10, 11)>
