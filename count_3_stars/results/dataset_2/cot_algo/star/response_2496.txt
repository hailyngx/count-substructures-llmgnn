Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 18) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 15) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (14, 6) (14, 17) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 1) (4, 6) (4, 13) (18, 11) (18, 19) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (1, 16) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 19) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 1) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 9) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 12) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (15, 16) (15, 14) (10, 6) (10, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 9, 5, 12
- Node 1: 16, 17, 2, 19
- Node 2: 14, 13, 1, 12
- Node 3: 9, 12, 8
- Node 4: 6, 13
- Node 5: 13, 0, 10
- Node 6: 9, 14, 10, 19, 4
- Node 7: 11, 16, 9
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 6, 0, 3, 7
- Node 10: 6, 5
- Node 11: 7, 18
- Node 12: 2, 0, 3
- Node 13: 4, 5, 2
- Node 14: 6, 17, 15, 2
- Node 15: 16, 14
- Node 16: 7, 1, 19, 15
- Node 17: 14, 1
- Node 18: 11, 19
- Node 19: 16, 6, 18, 1

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 1: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 2: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 3: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 6: C(5,3) = 10
- Node 9: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 12: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 13: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 14: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 16: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 19: C(4,3) = 4

Summing the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

And the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 12, 0)>
<1, (2, 1, 19)>
<1, (2, 13, 1)>
<1, (2, 17, 1)>
<1, (16, 1, 19)>
<2, (14, 2, 13)>
<6, (9, 6, 7)>
<6, (14, 6, 4)>
<6, (14, 6, 10)>
<6, (19, 6, 4)>
<6, (19, 6, 10)>
<14, (17, 14, 15)>
<16, (7, 16, 15)>
<16, (16, 1, 15)>
<16, (16, 1, 19)>
<16, (16, 7, 15)>
<19, (18, 19, 1)>
<19, (19, 16, 1)>
<19, (19, 16, 6)>
<19, (19, 18, 1)>
