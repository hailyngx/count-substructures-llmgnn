Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 3, 8}
- Node 2: {9, 6, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {6, 1, 7, 4}
- Node 4: {6, 3, 8, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 8, 1, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 3, 4, 2}
- Node 7: {6, 9, 3, 0}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 1, 4, 2}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8, 2, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 2, 4, 6, and 8 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 have 4 neighbors each, so they can't form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 \times 4 = 40 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [40].

Unique 3-stars:
- <2, (6, 4, 8)>
- <4, (6, 3, 8)>
- <6, (9, 7, 3)>
- <8, (5, 9, 4)>
