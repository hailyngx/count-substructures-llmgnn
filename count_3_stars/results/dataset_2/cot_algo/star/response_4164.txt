Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
    - Node 0: {1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
    - Node 1: {0, 8}
    - Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 9}
    - Node 3: {2, 5, 6}
    - Node 4: {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
    - Node 5: {3, 6, 7, 9}
    - Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
    - Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 6}
    - Node 8: {0, 1, 4}
    - Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
    - Node 0: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
    - Node 2: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
    - Node 4: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
    - Node 5: has exactly 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with Node 5 at the center

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 35, so the answer is [35].

Unique 3-stars found: 
    <0, (2, 4, 6)>
    <0, (2, 4, 8)>
    <0, (2, 4, 9)>
    <0, (2, 6, 7)>
    <0, (2, 7, 9)>
    <0, (4, 6, 7)>
    <0, (4, 6, 9)>
    <0, (4, 7, 9)>
    <0, (6, 7, 9)>
    <2, (0, 4, 9)>
    <4, (0, 2, 6)>
    <4, (0, 2, 8)>
    <4, (0, 2, 9)>
    <4, (0, 6, 7)>
    <4, (0, 6, 9)>
    <4, (0, 7, 9)>
    <4, (2, 6, 7)>
    <4, (2, 6, 9)>
