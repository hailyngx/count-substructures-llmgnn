Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:

Nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes. 

Calculations:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 53\)

Therefore, the final answer is [53], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 7, 3)>, <2, (5, 0, 9)>, <3, (8, 2, 9)>, <5, (8, 7, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (9, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>.
