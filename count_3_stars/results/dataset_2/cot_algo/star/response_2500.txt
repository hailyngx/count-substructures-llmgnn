Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 0) (2, 29) (2, 5) (29, 2) (29, 16) (29, 24) (7, 8) (21, 6) (21, 26) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 27) (17, 4) (3, 25) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 8) (8, 7) (8, 25) (8, 23) (8, 18) (23, 13) (23, 8) (23, 1) (23, 0) (23, 12) (10, 12) (10, 20) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 12) (20, 14) (20, 10) (20, 19) (20, 28) (12, 23) (12, 10) (12, 15) (12, 18) (11, 19) (11, 9) (28, 20) (28, 16) (28, 9) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 4) (16, 29) (16, 15) (16, 28) (5, 2) (5, 19) (19, 17) (19, 20) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 18) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 26) (26, 21) (26, 18) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 6) (0, 22) (0, 23) (0, 15) (0, 9) (9, 11) (9, 28) (9, 0) (9, 27) (24, 29) (24, 14) (24, 27) (27, 17) (27, 9) (27, 24) (4, 17) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighborhoods of each node:
- Node 0: {22, 23, 15, 9}
- Node 1: {25, 6, 23}
- Node 2: {29, 5}
- Node 3: {25}
- Node 4: {17, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 19}
- Node 6: {21, 1, 4}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {7, 25, 23, 18}
- Node 9: {11, 28, 0, 27}
- Node 10: {12, 20}
- Node 11: {19, 9}
- Node 12: {23, 10, 15, 18}
- Node 13: {22, 23}
- Node 14: {17, 18, 24, 20}
- Node 15: {16, 0, 12}
- Node 16: {29, 15, 28}
- Node 17: {14, 19, 27, 4}
- Node 18: {14, 8, 12, 19, 26}
- Node 19: {17, 20, 11, 5, 18}
- Node 20: {14, 10, 19, 28}
- Node 21: {6, 26}
- Node 22: {13, 0}
- Node 23: {13, 8, 1, 0, 12}
- Node 24: {29, 14, 27}
- Node 25: {3, 1, 8}
- Node 26: {21, 18}
- Node 27: {17, 24, 9}
- Node 28: {20, 16, 9}
- Node 29: {2, 16, 24}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0, 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8, 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9, 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 12, 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 14, 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 18, 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 19, 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 23, 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 24, 3 neighbors: 1
- Node 25, 3 neighbors: 1

Adding them up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 54

Final Answer: [54]
