Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 12) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 8, 13
- Node 1: 0, 4, 11
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7, 8, 12
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8, 14
- Node 4: 0, 1, 7, 10, 11
- Node 5: 2, 6, 10, 12
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 9, 10
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 6, 13
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 8, 12, 13
- Node 9: 6, 12
- Node 10: 4, 5, 6
- Node 11: 1, 4, 12
- Node 12: 2, 5, 8, 9, 11, 14
- Node 13: 0, 7, 8
- Node 14: 3, 12

Next, we identify nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 

- Node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) where \( n \) is the number of neighbors. 

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) <0, (1, 8, 13)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 10)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 12)>, <2, (5, 6, 10)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <3, (2, 8, 14)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 11)>, <4, (1, 10, 11)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) <5, (2, 6, 12)>
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) <6, (0, 7, 10)>, <6, (5, 7, 12)>, <6, (5, 10, 12)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) <7, (2, 4, 13)>, <7, (3, 4, 13)>, <7, (4, 6, 13)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) <8, (0, 2, 13)>, <8, (0, 3, 13)>, <8, (0, 12, 13)>, <8, (2, 3, 12)>
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) <12, (2, 9, 14)>, <12, (5, 9, 14)>, <12, (8, 9, 14)>, <12, (11, 14, 0)>

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 88

Therefore, the final answer is [88].
