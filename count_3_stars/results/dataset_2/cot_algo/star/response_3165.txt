Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (26, 15) (1, 21) (21, 1) (21, 25) (21, 14) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 8) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 23) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 25) (20, 5) (20, 10) (20, 16) (5, 12) (5, 20) (5, 13) (5, 17) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 4) (28, 0) (28, 29) (28, 22) (29, 27) (29, 28) (29, 16) (29, 10) (19, 8) (19, 13) (22, 9) (22, 28) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 24) (13, 3) (13, 18) (11, 6) (11, 23) (11, 7) (15, 26) (15, 12) (15, 0) (15, 14) (7, 11) (7, 25) (7, 2) (7, 8) (25, 21) (25, 0) (25, 7) (25, 14) (25, 2) (4, 27) (4, 6) (4, 17) (8, 12) (8, 19) (8, 7) (8, 3) (23, 27) (23, 11) (23, 18) (16, 20) (16, 29) (17, 5) (17, 6) (17, 4) (18, 13) (18, 23) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 24) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 25) (2, 3) (24, 13) (24, 3) (10, 20) (10, 29) (10, 14) (14, 21) (14, 15) (14, 25) (14, 10) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {28, 15, 25}
- Node 1: {21}
- Node 2: {7, 25, 3}
- Node 3: {13, 8, 24, 2}
- Node 4: {27, 6, 17}
- Node 5: {12, 20, 13, 17}
- Node 6: {17, 11, 4}
- Node 7: {25, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {12, 19, 7, 3}
- Node 9: {22}
- Node 10: {20, 29, 14}
- Node 11: {6, 23, 7}
- Node 12: {5, 15, 8}
- Node 13: {5, 19, 24, 3, 18}
- Node 14: {21, 15, 25, 10}
- Node 15: {26, 12, 0, 14}
- Node 16: {20, 29}
- Node 17: {5, 6, 4}
- Node 18: {13, 23}
- Node 19: {8,13}
- Node 20: {5, 10, 16}
- Node 21: {1, 25, 14}
- Node 22: {9, 28}
- Node 23: {27, 11, 18}
- Node 24: {13, 3}
- Node 25: {21, 0, 7, 14, 2}
- Node 26: {15}
- Node 27: {4, 29, 23}
- Node 28: {0, 29, 22}
- Node 29: {27, 28, 16, 10}

Now we can identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 13 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 19, 3, 16 <13, (3, 16, 19)>
2. Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 12, 19, 7 <8, (12, 7, 19)>
3. Node 21 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 25, 14 <21, (1, 25, 14)>
4. Node 25 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 21, 0, 14 <25, (21, 0, 14)>
5. Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 13, 24, 2 <3, (13, 24, 2)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 12, 20, 17 <5, (12, 20, 17)>
7. Node 0 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 28, 15, 25 <0, (28, 15, 25)>
8. Node 29 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 27, 28, 16 <29, (27, 28, 16)>
9. Node 20 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 5, 10, 16 <20, (5, 10, 16)>
  
The total number of 3-stars is 9, so the final answer is [9].
