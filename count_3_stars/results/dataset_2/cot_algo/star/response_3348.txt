Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Neighbors of node 0: {7, 3, 2}
Neighbors of node 1: {5, 4, 3, 2}
Neighbors of node 2: {5, 6, 1, 8, 0}
Neighbors of node 3: {9, 6, 1, 0, 8}
Neighbors of node 4: {5, 1}
Neighbors of node 5: {9, 6, 2, 1, 4}
Neighbors of node 6: {5, 9, 3, 2, 8}
Neighbors of node 7: {0, 8}
Neighbors of node 8: {9, 7, 6, 3, 2, 0}
Neighbors of node 9: {5, 6, 8, 3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 2 and Node 6 each have 5 neighbors, so they each form 10 3-stars: <2, (5, 1, 8)>, <2, (5, 1, 0)>, <2, (5, 1, 6)>, <2, (5, 1, 3)>, <2, (5, 4, 8)>, <2, (5, 4, 0)>, <2, (5, 4, 6)>, <2, (5, 4, 3)>, <2, (6, 9, 3)>, <2, (6, 3, 8)> and <6, (5, 1, 8)>, <6, (5, 1, 0)>, <6, (5, 1, 3)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (5, 2, 0)>, <6, (9, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 8, 0)>, <6, (2, 1, 8)>, <6, (2, 1, 0)>, <6, (2, 8, 0)>.
Node 1 and Node 8 each have 4 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
