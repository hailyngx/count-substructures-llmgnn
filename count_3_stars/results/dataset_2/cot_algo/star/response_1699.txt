Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 10) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 5) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 5) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {8, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 3: {7, 10, 13}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 10, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {11, 12}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 8, 11}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 14}
- Node 11: {6, 7, 12}
- Node 12: {1, 5, 6, 11, 0}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 5, 9, 10, 14, 3}
- Node 14: {0, 5, 9, 10, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14

For each of these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 35 + 10 = 92

So, there are a total of 92 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as [92].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 5, 12>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 13>
<2, 8, 9>
<2, 8, 13>
<5, 10, 14>
<5, 12, 14>
<3, 7, 13>
<5, 13, 14>
<11, 6, 12>
<13, 1, 9>
<13, 2, 5>
<13, 2, 9>
<13, 5, 14>
<13, 9, 14>
