Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 1) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 24) (21, 16) (21, 0) (2, 29) (2, 16) (29, 2) (29, 6) (29, 0) (29, 24) (20, 25) (20, 27) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 16) (25, 28) (25, 10) (22, 23) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 14) (23, 3) (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 27) (28, 9) (28, 25) (28, 0) (28, 12) (17, 8) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 20) (19, 5) (19, 3) (19, 6) (18, 26) (18, 11) (16, 21) (16, 2) (16, 25) (16, 8) (6, 29) (6, 19) (6, 12) (3, 22) (3, 23) (3, 19) (3, 12) (0, 21) (0, 29) (0, 13) (0, 28) (0, 5) (8, 17) (8, 16) (8, 14) (8, 10) (14, 23) (14, 8) (14, 7) (10, 25) (10, 8) (10, 4) (27, 20) (27, 13) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 12) (7, 1) (7, 14) (4, 26) (4, 10) (4, 24) (24, 1) (24, 29) (24, 4) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 11)

Node 3: degree 4  
Node 4: degree 4  
Node 5: degree 3  
Node 6: degree 4  
Node 7: degree 2  
Node 8: degree 4  
Node 9: degree 3  
Node 10: degree 3  
Node 11: degree 3  
Node 12: degree 4  
Node 13: degree 4  
Node 14: degree 3  
Node 16: degree 4  
Node 17: degree 1  
Node 18: degree 3  
Node 19: degree 4  
Node 20: degree 4  
Node 21: degree 2  
Node 22: degree 2  
Node 23: degree 3  
Node 24: degree 4  
Node 25: degree 4

Using the combinatorial formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we find the following number of 3-stars for nodes with degree 3 or more:  
Node 0: 20 3-stars  
Node 1: 1 3-star  
Node 3: 4 3-stars  
Node 4: 4 3-stars  
Node 5: 1 3-star  
Node 6: 4 3-stars  
Node 8: 4 3-stars  
Node 9: 1 3-star  
Node 10: 1 3-star  
Node 11: 1 3-star  
Node 12: 4 3-stars  
Node 13: 4 3-stars  
Node 14: 1 3-star  
Node 16: 4 3-stars  
Node 18: 1 3-star  
Node 19: 4 3-stars  
Node 20: 4 3-stars  
Node 23: 4 3-stars  
Node 24: 4 3-stars  
Node 25: 4 3-stars  
Node 26: 4 3-stars  
Node 28: 4 3-stars  
Node 29: 4 3-stars  

Adding up these results, we get a total of 85 3-stars.  
Therefore, the final answer is [85]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
