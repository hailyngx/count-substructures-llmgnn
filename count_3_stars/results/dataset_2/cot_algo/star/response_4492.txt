Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 12) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 17) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 2) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 16) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 1) (6, 4) (19, 9) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 15) (11, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 9) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 5) (17, 2) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 4) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 5) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 3) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 17) (4, 6) (4, 16) (4, 17) (4, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are:
\[ \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19\} \]

Let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Neighbors of node 0: {1, 11, 13}
- Neighbors of node 1: {0, 6, 7, 14}
- Neighbors of node 2: {10, 17, 18}
- Neighbors of node 3: {4, 5, 14}
- Neighbors of node 4: {3, 6, 16, 17}
- Neighbors of node 5: {3, 11, 16}
- Neighbors of node 6: {1, 4}
- Neighbors of node 7: {1, 12, 13}
- Neighbors of node 8: {11, 13}
- Neighbors of node 9: {13, 14, 17, 19}
- Neighbors of node 10: {2, 15}
- Neighbors of node 11: {0, 5, 8, 15}
- Neighbors of node 12: {7, 17, 18}
- Neighbors of node 13: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Neighbors of node 14: {1, 3, 9}
- Neighbors of node 15: {10, 11, 16}
- Neighbors of node 16: {4, 5, 15}
- Neighbors of node 17: {2, 4, 9, 12}
- Neighbors of node 18: {2, 12}
- Neighbors of node 19: {9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 17 have at least 3 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For nodes with 3 neighbors, there's only 1 3-star formed.
So, the total number of 3-stars is:
\[ [10] \]

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 11, 13)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 14)>
<4, (3, 6, 16)>
<5, (3, 11, 16)>
<7, (1, 12, 17)>
<9, (13, 14, 17)>
<11, (0, 5, 15)>
<13, (0, 7, 9)>
<17, (1, 4, 9)>
