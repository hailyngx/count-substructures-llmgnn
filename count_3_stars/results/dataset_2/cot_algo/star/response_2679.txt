Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 24) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 7) (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 18) (22, 23) (23, 22) (23, 24) (23, 12) (0, 20) (0, 29) (0, 25) (0, 19) (0, 13) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 5) (20, 10) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 20) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 16) (29, 17) (29, 0) (29, 1) (29, 18) (7, 15) (7, 12) (12, 23) (12, 7) (12, 24) (26, 24) (24, 3) (24, 23) (24, 12) (24, 26) (18, 17) (18, 29) (18, 9) (18, 11) (21, 3) (21, 10) (21, 25) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 10) (10, 20) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 16) (8, 28) (8, 27) (8, 16) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 27) (4, 14) (28, 8) (28, 13) (28, 25) (9, 18) (9, 10) (9, 27) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 8) (2, 19) (11, 18) (13, 0) (13, 28) (13, 27) (25, 0) (25, 21) (25, 28) (27, 20) (27, 8) (27, 19) (27, 9) (27, 13) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 5, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 23, 24, 27, and 29.  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars:  
\[ 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 55 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55].  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (5, 19, 20)>, <0, (5, 20, 13)>, <0, (5, 19, 27)>, <0, (20, 13, 27)>, <0, (20, 19, 27)>,  
<3, (5, 14, 20)>,  
<5, (3, 20, 6)>,  
<10, (1, 9, 16)>, <10, (1, 16, 21)>, <10, (9, 16, 8)>,  
<18, (9, 10, 11)>,  
<27, (8, 13, 19)>.
