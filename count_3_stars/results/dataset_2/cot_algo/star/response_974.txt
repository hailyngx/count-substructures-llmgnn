Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 4) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 14) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 4) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 10
- Node 1: 2, 5, 11
- Node 2: 0, 1, 7, 9, 14
- Node 3: 4, 5, 8, 12
- Node 4: 0, 3, 9, 13, 14
- Node 5: 1, 3, 11, 12, 13
- Node 6: 0, 8, 9, 12
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 8, 14
- Node 10: 0, 12, 14
- Node 11: 1, 5, 13
- Node 12: 3, 5, 6, 10, 14
- Node 13: 4, 5, 11
- Node 14: 2, 4, 9, 10, 12

Next, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 64.

Therefore, the final answer is [64], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (2, 4, 10)>
<0, (2, 4, 14)>
<0, (4, 9, 14)>
<0, (4, 10, 12)>
<2, (0, 4, 10)>
<2, (0, 4, 14)>
<2, (4, 9, 12)>
<2, (4, 9, 14)>
<2, (9, 10, 14)>
<4, (0, 2, 10)>
<4, (0, 2, 14)>
<4, (2, 9, 14)>
<4, (9, 10, 14)>
<5, (1, 11, 13)>
<9, (0, 4, 14)>
<9, (4, 10, 12)>
<12, (4, 9, 14)>
<12, (5, 10, 14)>
<14, (4, 9, 12)>
<14, (5, 10, 12)>
