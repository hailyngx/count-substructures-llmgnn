Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 19) (25, 20) (25, 19) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 6) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 29) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (0, 16) (0, 21) (0, 11) (22, 5) (22, 29) (26, 20) (26, 27) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 13) (28, 11) (28, 24) (28, 15) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 14) (27, 26) (27, 18) (27, 16) (16, 0) (16, 27) (16, 24) (23, 2) (23, 21) (23, 12) (7, 3) (7, 29) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (29, 4) (29, 22) (29, 7) (29, 5) (24, 28) (24, 16) (24, 9) (24, 13) (24, 14) (6, 20) (6, 8) (6, 15) (2, 20) (2, 23) (2, 17) (2, 10) (21, 0) (21, 23) (12, 23) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 9) (13, 11) (13, 24) (13, 12) (9, 24) (9, 12) (5, 22) (5, 29) (18, 8) (18, 27) (18, 15) (15, 28) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 18) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 10) (10, 2) (10, 1) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 24) 

Response:
There are a few nodes with more than 3 neighbors, so we will need to calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

1. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 2.
2. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 4.
3. Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star involving node 8.
4. Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star involving node 11.
5. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 12.
6. Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 15.
7. Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star involving node 16.
8. Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star involving node 19.
9. Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 20.
10. Node 24 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 24.
11. Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star involving node 27.
12. Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 29.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars given by the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we get:

\[ 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<2, 17, 23>, <2, 10, 1>, <2, 10, 23>, <4, 1, 12>, <4, 14, 19>, <8, 4, 14>, <8, 4, 29>, <8, 14, 24>, <11, 0, 13>, <12, 9, 24>, <12, 13, 11>, <12, 13, 24>, <15, 17, 6>, <15, 17, 18>, <15, 18, 27>, <15, 6, 20>, <15, 6, 8>, <16, 0, 27>, <19, 3, 25>, <20, 2, 6>, <20, 2, 17>, <20, 6, 8>, <20, 6, 15>, <20, 26, 27>, <24, 9, 12>, <24, 9, 13>, <24, 13, 11>, <24, 13, 12>, <24, 13, 14>, <27, 16, 24>, <29, 4, 22>, <29, 5, 22>, <29, 5, 7>, <29, 5, 7>
