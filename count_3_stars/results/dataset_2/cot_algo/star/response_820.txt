Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
The graph based on the given edges is as follows:

```
   6 - 1 - 2
   |   | x | 
   3 - 9 - 5
   | x |   |
   0 - 8 - 7
       | x |
       4 - - 
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 8}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 7, 9}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 7}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 7}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 3}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {0, 7, 9}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, 1, 8>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, 6, 9>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, 7, 9>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, 1, 8>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, 1, 8>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
