Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 15) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 17) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 6) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 9) (17, 18) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 15) (0, 10) (14, 11) (14, 16) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 9) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 19) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 3) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 19) (3, 9) (15, 2) (15, 17) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 9) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The central idea of a 3-star graph is to have a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star-like structure. 

Let's first find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {10}
- Node 1: {4, 19, 9}
- Node 2: {11, 18, 15, 4, 19}
- Node 3: {10, 12, 5, 19, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 1}
- Node 5: {7, 4, 3}
- Node 6: {8, 19}
- Node 7: {12, 9, 5, 17}
- Node 8: {6}
- Node 9: {7, 13, 16, 3, 1}
- Node 10: {0, 3}
- Node 11: {14, 13, 2}
- Node 12: {7, 16, 3}
- Node 13: {11, 17, 9}
- Node 14: {11, 16}
- Node 15: {2, 17}
- Node 16: {12, 14, 9}
- Node 17: {18, 7, 13, 15}
- Node 18: {2, 17}
- Node 19: {2, 6, 1, 3}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 2 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in each of the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 4 3-stars
- Node 9: 10 3-stars
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 4 3-stars
- Node 19: 4 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [38]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (4, 19, 9)>, 
<2, (11, 18, 15)>, 
<3, (10, 12, 5)>, 
<4, (2, 5, 1)>, 
<5, (7, 4, 3)>, 
<7, (12, 9, 5)>, 
<9, (13, 17, 1)>, 
<11, (14, 13, 2)>, 
<12, (16, 14, 9)>, 
<13, (11, 17, 9)>, 
<16, (12, 14, 9)>, 
<17, (7, 13, 15)>, 
<19, (6, 1, 3)>.
