Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 13) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 10) (27, 17) (27, 26) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 24) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 19) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 18) (25, 7) (25, 3) (25, 28) (2, 29) (2, 28) (29, 2) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 0) (13, 21) (13, 15) (13, 9) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 24) (21, 27) (21, 13) (21, 28) (21, 15) (28, 25) (28, 2) (28, 21) (28, 18) (22, 26) (22, 20) (26, 27) (26, 22) (26, 15) (26, 20) (6, 18) (20, 22) (20, 26) (20, 1) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 11) (1, 20) (1, 10) (1, 19) (5, 23) (23, 5) (23, 15) (11, 12) (11, 9) (11, 17) (15, 13) (15, 21) (15, 26) (15, 23) (16, 19) (16, 10) (24, 4) (24, 14) (10, 27) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 16) (18, 3) (18, 14) (18, 28) (18, 6) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 16) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 11) (17, 27) (17, 4) (17, 11) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are listed below:

Node 0 neighbors: 27, 14, 13
Node 1 neighbors: 20, 10, 19
Node 2 neighbors: 29, 28
Node 3 neighbors: 25, 10, 9, 18
Node 4 neighbors: 7, 12, 24, 17
Node 5 neighbors: 23
Node 6 neighbors: 18
Node 7 neighbors: 4, 25, 19
Node 8 neighbors: 14, 12
Node 9 neighbors: 3, 13, 11
Node 10 neighbors: 27, 3, 1, 16
Node 11 neighbors: 12, 9, 17
Node 12 neighbors: 4, 8, 11
Node 13 neighbors: 0, 21, 15, 9
Node 14 neighbors: 0, 8, 18, 24
Node 15 neighbors: 13, 21, 26, 23
Node 16 neighbors: 1, 19, 10
Node 17 neighbors: 27, 4, 11
Node 18 neighbors: 3, 14, 28, 6
Node 19 neighbors: 7, 1, 16
Node 20 neighbors: 22, 26, 1
Node 21 neighbors: 27, 13, 28, 15
Node 22 neighbors: 26, 20
Node 23 neighbors: 5, 15
Node 24 neighbors: 4, 14
Node 25 neighbors: 7, 3, 28
Node 26 neighbors: 27, 22, 15, 20
Node 27 neighbors: 0, 21, 10, 17, 26
Node 28 neighbors: 25, 2, 21, 18

Now we will count the number of 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 27 has 5 neighbors, forming 10 3-stars. 
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.
Node 14 has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.
Node 15 has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.
Node 21 has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.
Node 26 has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.
Node 28 has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 43

Therefore, the final answer is [43].

The unique 3-stars found are:
