Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 17) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 20) (17, 22) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 8) (18, 22) (18, 10) (18, 25) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 19) (3, 8) (25, 18) (25, 3) (25, 29) (25, 10) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 26) (8, 17) (8, 3) (8, 6) (15, 20) (15, 5) (15, 16) (20, 14) (20, 15) (20, 21) (20, 28) (20, 10) (2, 21) (21, 20) (21, 2) (21, 28) (21, 11) (28, 3) (28, 20) (28, 21) (26, 4) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 14) (7, 27) (6, 8) (6, 23) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 29) (12, 1) (12, 9) (29, 25) (29, 16) (29, 27) (29, 23) (5, 15) (23, 6) (23, 29) (23, 9) (11, 13) (11, 21) (11, 19) (11, 1) (19, 3) (19, 0) (19, 11) (1, 16) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 10) (27, 22) (27, 7) (27, 29) (27, 9) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 23) (9, 27) (10, 18) (10, 25) (10, 20) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {17, 19}
- Node 1: {10, 11, 12, 16}
- Node 2: {21}
- Node 3: {8, 19, 25, 28}
- Node 4: {9, 13, 26}
- Node 5: {15}
- Node 6: {8, 9, 23}
- Node 7: {14, 27}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 17}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 9, 12, 23, 27}
- Node 10: {1, 18, 20, 25}
- Node 11: {1, 13, 19, 21}
- Node 12: {1, 9}
- Node 13: {11, 4, 22}
- Node 14: {7, 17, 20}
- Node 15: {5, 16, 20}
- Node 16: {1, 15, 29}
- Node 17: {0, 14, 22}
- Node 18: {10, 22, 25}
- Node 19: {3, 11, 19, 0}
- Node 20: {10, 14, 15, 21, 28}
- Node 21: {2, 11, 20, 28}
- Node 22: {13, 17, 18, 27}
- Node 23: {6, 9, 29}
- Node 25: {3, 10, 18, 29}
- Node 26: {4}
- Node 27: {7, 9, 22, 29}
- Node 28: {3, 20, 21}
- Node 29: {16, 23, 25, 27}

Next, we need to identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors in order to form 3-stars. These nodes are: 1, 10, 17, 20, 21, 22, 25, 27, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 21: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 10, 12>
<1, 10, 16>
<1, 11, 12>
<1, 11, 16>
<10, 16, 25>
<15, 16, 20>
<20, 21, 28>
<22, 27, 29>
