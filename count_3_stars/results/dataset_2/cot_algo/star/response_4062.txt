Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 24) (14, 1) (14, 4) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 15) (17, 26) (7, 20) (12, 21) (12, 27) (12, 26) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 19) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 29) (0, 11) (0, 5) (20, 7) (20, 9) (20, 23) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 13) (24, 21) (24, 26) (24, 16) (26, 17) (26, 12) (26, 24) (16, 24) (16, 25) (16, 23) (5, 0) (29, 27) (29, 10) (29, 18) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (19, 1) (19, 27) (15, 17) (15, 18) (9, 17) (9, 20) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 28) (28, 9) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 23) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 29) (18, 15) (18, 13) (25, 16) (25, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 25) (4, 14) (4, 28) (4, 23) (23, 20) (23, 16) (23, 28) (23, 4) (23, 13) (22, 10) (22, 28) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 23) 

Response:
The graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. 

Let's first identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {11, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 14, 19, 21}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 4: {14, 23, 28}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 25}
- Node 7: {9, 20}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 9, 17, 20, 28}
- Node 10: {3, 17, 18, 22, 29}
- Node 11: {0, 3, 13, 18}
- Node 12: {21, 26, 27}
- Node 13: {11, 18, 23}
- Node 14: {1, 4}
- Node 15: {17, 18}
- Node 16: {23, 24, 25}
- Node 17: {9, 10, 15, 26}
- Node 18: {10, 11, 13, 15, 29}
- Node 19: {1, 27}
- Node 20: {7, 9, 23}
- Node 21: {1, 12, 24}
- Node 22: {10, 28}
- Node 23: {4, 13, 16, 20, 28}
- Node 24: {16, 21, 26}
- Node 25: {6, 16}
- Node 26: {12, 17, 19, 24, 27}
- Node 27: {12, 19, 29}
- Node 28: {4, 9, 22, 23}
- Node 29: {10, 18, 27}

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 19, 21: <1, (2, 19, 21)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 17, 28: <9, (2, 17, 28)>
Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 18, 29: <10, (17, 18, 29)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3, so the final answer is [3].
