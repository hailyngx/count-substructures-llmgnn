Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 26) (11, 12) (11, 29) (11, 20) (16, 13) (16, 14) (15, 27) (15, 25) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 2) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 6) (22, 9) (22, 12) (23, 26) (23, 14) (23, 7) (23, 9) (2, 27) (2, 5) (2, 14) (18, 26) (18, 9) (18, 8) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 4) (28, 8) (28, 7) (26, 11) (26, 23) (26, 18) (26, 25) (9, 22) (9, 23) (9, 18) (9, 4) (17, 20) (17, 21) (20, 11) (20, 17) (20, 5) (0, 21) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 24) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 22) (12, 5) (8, 18) (8, 28) (8, 10) (8, 21) (19, 1) (19, 24) (5, 2) (5, 20) (5, 12) (5, 7) (25, 15) (25, 26) (21, 27) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 8) (21, 4) (29, 11) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 21) (7, 23) (7, 28) (7, 5) (7, 24) (24, 10) (24, 19) (24, 7) (24, 13) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 24) (14, 16) (14, 23) (14, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1. Node 0: {21}
2. Node 1: {3, 12, 19}
3. Node 2: {5, 14, 27}
4. Node 3: {1, 6}
5. Node 4: {6, 9, 21, 7}
6. Node 5: {2, 20, 12, 7}
7. Node 6: {3, 10, 4}
8. Node 7: {23, 28, 5, 24}
9. Node 8: {18, 28, 10, 21}
10. Node 9: {22, 23, 18, 4}
11. Node 10: {6, 8, 24}
12. Node 11: {26, 12, 29, 20}
13. Node 13: {16, 15, 24}
14. Node 14: {16, 23, 2}
15. Node 15: {13, 27, 25}
16. Node 16: {13, 14}
17. Node 17: {20, 21}
18. Node 18: {26, 9, 8}
19. Node 19: {1, 24}
20. Node 20: {11, 17, 5}
21. Node 21: {27, 17, 0, 8, 4}
22. Node 22: {9, 12}
23. Node 23: {26, 14, 7, 9}
24. Node 24: {10, 19, 7, 13}
25. Node 25: {15, 26}
26. Node 26: {11, 23, 18, 25}
27. Node 27: {15, 21, 2}
28. Node 28: {8, 7}
29. Node 29: {11}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars around each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 21, and 24 have 4 neighbors, thus each contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1, 2, 11, 15, and 26 have 3 neighbors, thus each contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars:
\[ 9 \times 4 + 5 \times 1 = 36 + 5 = 41 \]

Therefore, the final result is [41].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<4, (6, 9, 21)>
<5, (2, 12, 7)>
<7, (23, 28, 24)>
<8, (18, 28, 10)>
<9, (22, 23, 18)>
<12, (11, 29, 20)>
<13, (16, 15, 24)>
<21, (27, 17, 8)>
<24, (10, 19, 7)>
