Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 2}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 7}

Nodes 0, 7, and 9 have 6, 5, and 4 neighbors respectively, so they can form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <9, (4, 5, 7)>
