Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we can first determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 6: {3, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 10}
- Node 8: {1, 3}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 10, 11}
- Node 10: {7, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {5, 9}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 3, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 10, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 10, 12}

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars formed by the nodes that can form them:
Total 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the final answer (total number of 3-stars) is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 2, 4, 12>, <0, 2, 4, 14>, <0, 2, 5, 12>, <0, 2, 5, 14>, <0, 4, 5, 12>,
<0, 4, 5, 14>, <1, 3, 8, 12>, <1, 3, 8, 13>, <1, 3, 12, 13>, <1, 8, 12, 13>,
<2, 3, 12, 13>, <7, 10, 13, 14>, <9, 10, 11, 13>, <9, 10, 11, 14>, <9, 10, 13, 14>.
