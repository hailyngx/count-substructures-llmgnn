Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 11) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 3) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 7) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) 

Response:
First, let's denote the nodes that are connected in the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 10, 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 13, 11, 14, 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 11, 14.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 0, 14, 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 11.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 11, 10.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 3, 12.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 1, 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 4, 10, 12, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 11, 14, 0, 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 8, 5, 0.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 5, 1, 2.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 8.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 1, 14, 0.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 3, 1, 7, 2.

Now we will identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Nodes that form a 3-star:
- Node 9: <9, (2, 11, 14)>, <9, (0, 13, 12)>
- Node 13: <13, (1, 14, 0)>
- Node 14: <14, (1, 7, 2)>, <14, (9, 13, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of 6 three-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final result is [6].
