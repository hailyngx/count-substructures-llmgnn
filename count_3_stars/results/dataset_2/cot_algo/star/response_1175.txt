Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 19) (17, 1) (17, 9) (17, 11) (0, 18) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 18) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 14) (9, 8) (9, 17) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (12, 4) (12, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 16) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 19) (11, 6) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 3) (14, 16) (6, 7) (6, 11) (10, 8) (16, 19) (16, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 11, 18
- Node 1: 14, 17, 19
- Node 2: 18
- Node 3: 7, 11, 13, 14
- Node 4: 0, 8, 12
- Node 5: 13
- Node 6: 7, 11
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6, 8, 18
- Node 8: 4, 7, 9, 10, 12
- Node 9: 8, 11, 17
- Node 10: 8
- Node 11: 0, 6, 7, 9, 13, 17, 19
- Node 12: 4, 8
- Node 13: 3, 5, 11
- Node 14: 1, 3, 15, 16
- Node 15: 14, 18, 19
- Node 16: 14, 19
- Node 17: 1, 9, 11
- Node 18: 0, 2, 7, 15
- Node 19: 1, 11, 15, 16

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the number of 3-stars centered at those nodes:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 1: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 3: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 7: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 11: 7 neighbors -> [inom{7}{3}] = 35 3-stars
- Node 14: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 15: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 16: 2 neighbors (not enough for a 3-star)
- Node 17: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 18: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 19: 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 35 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 84

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [84].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 4, 7, 18>
- <0, 7, 11, 18>
- <1, 14, 15, 16>
- <1, 14, 15, 19>
- <1, 14, 16, 19>
- <1, 17, 11, 19>
- <3, 7, 11, 13>
- <7, 8, 9, 11>
- <7, 8, 10, 11>
- <7, 8, 9, 17>
- <11, 13, 14, 16>
