Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 8) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 13) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 14) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 13) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given edges in a more readable format:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 11, 2, 5, 13.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 12, 14, 13.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 10, 11, 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 12, 14.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 11.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 10, 14, 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 2, 8, 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 4, 7, 11.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 10, 1, 0.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 5.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 14, 0, 8, 2.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 13, 1, 3.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 12, 14, 0, 1.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 3, 1, 13, 5.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 44 \), which we represent as [44].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 4)>
<6, (8, 9, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 13)>
<9, (1, 8, 13)>
<9, (1, 13, 0)>
<9, (8, 13, 1)>
<11, (0, 2, 8)>
<11, (0, 8, 14)>
<11, (2, 8, 14)>
<11, (8, 14, 0)>
<11, (8, 14, 2)>
<12, (1, 13, 14)>
<14, (1, 13, 0)>
<14, (1, 13, 12)>
<14, (1, 13, 14)>
<14, (0, 1, 13)>
