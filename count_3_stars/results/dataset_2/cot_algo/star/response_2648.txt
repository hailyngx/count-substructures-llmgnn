Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 2) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 14) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 2) (2, 16) (2, 17) (18, 16) (18, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 19) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 6) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 19) (1, 16) (1, 15) (1, 7) (1, 5) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 8) (19, 12) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 5) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 14) (9, 8) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 13) (13, 6) 

Response:
Calculating the degrees for each node:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 1
- Node 14: degree 5
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 19: degree 4

Identifying nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, Node 8, Node 14, Node 16, Node 19 have 4 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 1, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 4, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 5, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 8, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 14, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 16, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 19, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 5, 14>
<1, 5, 15>
<4, 6, 15>
<8, 9, 14>
<14, 4, 19>
