Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 17) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 18) (18, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 6) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 13) (0, 6) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 1) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 3) (15, 4) (15, 0) (3, 10) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 3) (16, 17) (16, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 16) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node. Then we will identify the 3-stars formed in the graph.

- Node 0 neighbors: {2, 6, 13, 15}
- Node 1 neighbors: {5, 9, 13, 16}
- Node 2 neighbors: {0, 6, 12}
- Node 3 neighbors: {7, 10, 14, 19}
- Node 4 neighbors: {8, 10, 15}
- Node 5 neighbors: {1, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 6 neighbors: {0, 2, 11}
- Node 7 neighbors: {3, 5, 13, 17}
- Node 8 neighbors: {4, 15, 18}
- Node 9 neighbors: {1, 5, 10}
- Node 10 neighbors: {3, 4, 9, 14}
- Node 11 neighbors: {6, 10, 17}
- Node 12 neighbors: {2, 14, 19}
- Node 13 neighbors: {0, 1, 5, 17}
- Node 14 neighbors: {3, 10, 12}
- Node 15 neighbors: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 16 neighbors: {1, 17}
- Node 17 neighbors: {7, 11, 13, 16}
- Node 18 neighbors: {8}
- Node 19 neighbors: {3, 12}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 33 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].
