Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 8, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 1, 7, 4}
- Node 3: {5, 0, 4}
- Node 4: {6, 2, 0, 3}
- Node 5: {6, 2, 8, 1, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 1, 7, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {6, 2}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 2, 0, 1}
- Node 9: {6, 8}

Now, we can identify the 3-star configurations:
- Node 0, 3 stars: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
- Node 1, 1 star: only 3 neighbors
- Node 2, 1 star: only 5 neighbors
- Node 4, 2 stars: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
- Node 5, \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
- Node 6, \[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]
- Node 8, \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 44 \).
Therefore, the answer is [44] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 4), (3, 8), (0, 4), (0, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 8), (1, 8, 9), (1, 2, 6), (1, 5, 8), (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 4), (6, 8, 9), (2, 6, 8), (0, 6, 8), (4, 6, 0)>
<8, (2, 6, 5), (2, 6, 1), (8, 1, 5), (8, 1, 6), (8, 2, 5)>
