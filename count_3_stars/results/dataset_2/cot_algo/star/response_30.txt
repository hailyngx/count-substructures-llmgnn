Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 16) (7, 13) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 9) (15, 1) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 9) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 8) (16, 6) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 4) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 18) (19, 3) (19, 12) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 17) (9, 18) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 1) (8, 17) (8, 14) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (4, 16) (4, 3) (2, 6) (2, 16) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 14) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {11, 12, 18}
- Node 1: {9, 11, 15}
- Node 2: {6, 16}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 10, 19}
- Node 4: {3, 16}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 16}
- Node 7: {5, 13, 16}
- Node 8: {14, 17}
- Node 9: {1, 13, 17, 18}
- Node 10: {3}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 14, 19}
- Node 13: {7, 9, 17}
- Node 14: {5, 8, 12}
- Node 15: {1}
- Node 16: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 17: {8, 9, 13}
- Node 18: {0, 9, 19}
- Node 19: {3, 12, 18}

Nodes 0, 3, 5, 12, and 16 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed around these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 23

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (11, 12, 18)>, <3, (4, 6, 19)>, <5, (6, 7, 11)>, <12, (0, 5, 14)>, <16, (2, 4, 6)>, <16, (2, 6, 7)>, <16, (4, 6, 7)>, <16, (6, 7, 16)>
