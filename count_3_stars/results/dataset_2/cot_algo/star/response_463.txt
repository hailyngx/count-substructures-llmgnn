Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 8, 6, 3, 1}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 7, 8, 0}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 4, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 8, 6, 0}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8, 3, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 8, 1, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 9, 4, 2, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9, 4, 7, 0, 1, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8, 7, 0}

Next, we identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 35 = 72 \). 
So, the final answer is [72], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (8, 9, 5)>.
