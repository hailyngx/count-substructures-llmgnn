Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 12) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 2) (8, 14) (3, 4) (3, 14) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 12}
- Node 1: {2, 14, 13}
- Node 2: {9, 7, 10, 11, 8, 1}
- Node 3: {4, 14}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 0, 11, 6, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 12, 11, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 4, 7, 12}
- Node 7: {5, 4, 6, 2, 13}
- Node 8: {2, 14}
- Node 9: {5, 2, 0}
- Node 10: {11, 13, 2, 14}
- Node 11: {5, 4, 10, 2}
- Node 12: {5, 6, 0}
- Node 13: {7, 10, 1, 14}
- Node 14: {10, 8, 3, 1, 13}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 80

Therefore, the final number is [80], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 12, 6)>
<5, (9, 4, 11)>
<5, (9, 4, 7)>
<5, (9, 11, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 6)>
<4, (5, 11, 6)>
<4, (5, 11, 7)>
<4, (7, 11, 6)>
<7, (5, 6, 12)>
<7, (4, 6, 12)>
<7, (4, 6, 5)>
<7, (2, 13, 10)>
<2, (9, 11, 10)>
<2, (9, 11, 4)>
<2, (7, 11, 10)>
<13, (7, 14, 10)>
