Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 9) (7, 17) (21, 7) (21, 9) (20, 25) (20, 27) (20, 2) (25, 20) (2, 20) (2, 18) (2, 22) (2, 23) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 29) (6, 11) (6, 23) (17, 7) (17, 29) (17, 8) (29, 18) (29, 17) (29, 16) (28, 24) (28, 13) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 26) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 14) (27, 20) (27, 14) (27, 13) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 24) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 1) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 22) (19, 15) (14, 11) (14, 27) (14, 9) (14, 12) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 26) (15, 19) (15, 0) (16, 29) (16, 24) (16, 1) (24, 28) (24, 10) (24, 16) (24, 9) (0, 15) (0, 1) (9, 7) (9, 21) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 24) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 26) (26, 3) (26, 8) (26, 12) (1, 22) (1, 16) (1, 0) (23, 4) (23, 2) (23, 6) (23, 13) (13, 28) (13, 27) (13, 23) 

Response:
The central idea is to first determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 15}
Node 1: {0, 16, 22}
Node 2: {18, 20, 22, 23}
Node 3: {4, 11, 12, 26}
Node 4: {3, 7, 19, 23}
Node 6: {11, 23}
Node 7: {4, 9, 17, 21}
Node 8: {10, 17, 24, 26}
Node 9: {7, 10, 14, 21, 24}
Node 10: {8, 9, 24}
Node 11: {3, 6, 14}
Node 12: {3, 14, 26}
Node 13: {23, 27, 28}
Node 14: {9, 11, 12, 27}
Node 15: {0, 19}
Node 16: {1, 24, 29}
Node 17: {7, 8, 21, 29}
Node 18: {2, 19, 22, 29}
Node 19: {4, 15, 18, 22}
Node 20: {2, 25, 27}
Node 21: {7, 9, 17}
Node 22: {1, 2, 18, 19}
Node 23: {2, 4, 6, 13}
Node 24: {8, 9, 10, 16, 28}
Node 25: {20}
Node 26: {3, 8, 12}
Node 27: {13, 14, 20}
Node 28: {13, 24}
Node 29: {16, 17, 18}

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed:

Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
Node 11: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 16: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
Node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 18: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 19: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 22: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
Node 24: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
Node 26: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]
Node 29: [inom{3}{3}] = [1]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1] = [51]

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [51].
