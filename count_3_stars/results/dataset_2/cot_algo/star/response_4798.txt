Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 12) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 11) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by identifying the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 7, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 9, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 9, 10}
- Node 6: Neighbors {12, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 4, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 5, 10, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors {5, 9, 12}
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 10}
- Node 13: Neighbors {4, 6, 11, 14, 2}
- Node 14: Neighbors {4, 8, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 13 have 5 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node using \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 12>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 12>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <0, 12, 10>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 9, 11>
- <1, 9, 12>
- <2, 5, 11>
- <2, 5, 13>
- <2, 11, 13>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <4, 7, 11>
- <4, 8, 11>
- <4, 8, 14>
- <4, 11, 13>
- <4, 13, 14>
- <8, 11, 14>
- <8, 11, 13>
- <8, 13, 14>
- <12, 10, 5>
- <12, 10, 0>
