Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 13) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 12) (5, 15) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 19) (3, 18) (3, 6) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 9) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 12) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 16) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 15) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 12) (14, 2) (14, 15) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 9) (11, 0) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are neighbors of each node. 

Here are the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 13, 7, 11
- Node 1: 2, 16, 9
- Node 2: 8, 1, 14
- Node 3: 18, 6, 12
- Node 4: 17, 18, 13
- Node 5: 15
- Node 6: 10, 13, 3, 12
- Node 7: 10, 18, 0, 19
- Node 8: 10, 2, 16, 12
- Node 9: 1, 19, 12
- Node 10: 6, 8, 7
- Node 11: 0
- Node 12: 18, 8, 3, 9, 6
- Node 13: 4, 19, 0, 6
- Node 14: 2, 15
- Node 15: 5, 14, 16
- Node 16: 8, 1, 15
- Node 17: 4
- Node 18: 4, 7, 12, 3
- Node 19: 13, 7, 9

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: No 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 3 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: No 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: No 3-stars
- Node 15: No 3-stars
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 17: No 3-stars
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 13, 7>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 1, 14>, <3, 18, 12>, <4, 17, 18>, <6, 10, 13>, <7, 10, 18>, <8, 10, 16>, <9, 1, 19>, <12, 8, 18>, <13, 0, 19>, <15, 5, 14>, <16, 1, 8>, <19, 7, 9>
