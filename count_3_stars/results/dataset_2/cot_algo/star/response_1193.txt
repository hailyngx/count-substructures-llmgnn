Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 8, 3, 1}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 0, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 1}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 8, 0}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 8, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 1, 4, 3, 0}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 2}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 1}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 0, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 3, 0}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 8, and Node 9 have 5 neighbors.

For nodes with 5 neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 + 35 + 10 + 10 = 85 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [85].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 4, 8)>
<3, (5, 9, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<8, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
