Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 7, 14
Node 1: 0, 6, 9, 12
Node 2: 0, 3, 7, 11, 12, 13
Node 3: 2, 5, 7, 8
Node 4: 9, 13
Node 5: 3, 9, 10, 14
Node 6: 1, 10, 14
Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 8, 13
Node 8: 3, 7, 14
Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 10, 12
Node 10: 5, 6, 9, 11
Node 11: 2, 10
Node 12: 1, 2, 9, 14
Node 13: 2, 4, 7, 14
Node 14: 0, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
Nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, 9, 12, and 14 have 4 or more neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 72

Therefore, the final answer is [72], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 2, 7>, <2, 7, 13, 14>, <3, 5, 9, 14>, <7, 8, 13, 14>, <9, 10, 12, 14>.
