Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 16) (4, 21) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 14) (8, 29) (8, 15) (13, 12) (13, 25) (13, 27) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 28) (27, 13) (27, 14) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 18) (26, 21) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 14) (17, 1) (17, 3) (28, 12) (28, 18) (20, 21) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 23) (11, 3) (23, 11) (23, 2) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 0) (2, 23) (2, 22) (2, 10) (2, 0) (22, 2) (22, 10) (22, 25) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 21) (16, 29) (21, 4) (21, 26) (21, 20) (21, 16) (6, 24) (24, 6) (24, 10) (25, 13) (25, 22) (25, 0) (25, 15) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 25) (15, 9) (15, 8) (15, 25) (15, 18) (29, 8) (29, 16) (29, 14) (18, 5) (18, 26) (18, 28) (18, 15) (14, 7) (14, 27) (14, 1) (14, 29) (10, 2) (10, 22) (10, 24) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighborhood sets for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 25}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 14, 16, 17, 28}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 10, 22, 23}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 11, 17}
- Node 4: {16, 21}
- Node 5: {1, 9, 11, 12, 18}
- Node 6: {24}
- Node 7: {9, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {15, 29}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 7, 15}
- Node 10: {2, 22, 24}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 5, 7, 23}
- Node 12: {5, 13, 28}
- Node 13: {12, 25, 27}
- Node 14: {1, 7, 27, 29}
- Node 15: {8, 9, 18, 25}
- Node 16: {1, 4, 21, 29}
- Node 17: {1, 3}
- Node 18: {5, 15, 26, 28}
- Node 19: {26}
- Node 20: {21}
- Node 21: {4, 16, 20, 26}
- Node 22: {2, 10, 25}
- Node 23: {2, 11}
- Node 24: {6, 10}
- Node 25: {13, 15, 22, 0}
- Node 26: {18, 19, 21}
- Node 27: {13, 14}
- Node 28: {1, 12, 18}
- Node 29: {8, 14, 16}

Next, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors to calculate the 3-stars they form:

- Node 1, Node 5, Node 9, Node 14, Node 15, and Node 16 have 6 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - <1, (5, 9, 16)>, <1, (5, 9, 17)>, <1, (5, 9, 14)>, <1, (5, 16, 28)>, <1, (9, 14, 28)>, <1, (16, 17, 28)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <5, (1, 9, 11)>, <5, (1, 9, 12)>, <5, (1, 11, 18)>, <5, (9, 11, 15)>, <5, (9, 15, 18)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <9, (1, 5, 15)>, <9, (1, 7, 15)>, <9, (5, 7, 15)>, <9, (7, 15, 29)>
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <14, (1, 7, 29)>, <14, (14, 7, 29)>, <14, (14, 27, 29)>, <14, (1, 27, 29)>
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <15, (9, 18, 25)>, <15, (15, 18, 25)>, <15, (15, 25, 0)>, <15, (15, 25, 8)>
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <16, (1, 4, 29)>, <16, (16, 4, 29)>, <16, (21, 16, 29)>, <16, (16, 21, 29)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 

\[ 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46 \]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars formed in the given graph is [46].
