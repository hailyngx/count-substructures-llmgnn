Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 6 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50\).

Therefore, the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <5, (0, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- <7, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>
