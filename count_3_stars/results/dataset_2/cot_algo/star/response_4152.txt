Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 2) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 17) (1, 10) (1, 15) (1, 16) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 12) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 9) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 18) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 12) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 14) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 9) (12, 15) (12, 3) (18, 10) (18, 11) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 16) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {8, 3, 6}
Node 1: Neighbors {10, 15, 16}
Node 2: Neighbors {8, 13, 17}
Node 3: Neighbors {17, 5, 0, 16, 12}
Node 4: Neighbors {10, 11}
Node 5: Neighbors {10, 15, 19, 3}
Node 6: Neighbors {19, 0, 14}
Node 7: Neighbors {17, 11, 14}
Node 8: Neighbors {2, 0}
Node 9: Neighbors {19, 14, 16}
Node 10: Neighbors {18, 1, 4, 5}
Node 11: Neighbors {4, 7, 18}
Node 12: Neighbors {15, 3}
Node 13: Neighbors {2}
Node 14: Neighbors {15, 7, 6, 9}
Node 15: Neighbors {1, 5, 14, 12}
Node 16: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
Node 17: Neighbors {3, 2, 7}
Node 18: Neighbors {10, 11}
Node 19: Neighbors {5, 6, 9}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for these nodes:
\[
\text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 29
\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the provided graph is [29].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: <0, (8, 3, 6)>, <1, (10, 15, 16)>, <2, (8, 13, 17)>, <3, (17, 5, 0)>, <3, (17, 5, 16)>, <5, (10, 15, 19)>, <6, (19, 0, 14)>, <7, (17, 11, 14)>, <10, (18, 1, 4)>, <10, (18, 1, 5)>, <10, (18, 4, 5)>, <10, (1, 4, 5)>, <14, (15, 7, 6)>, <14, (15, 9, 6)>, <14, (15, 9, 7)>, <14, (15, 7, 9)>, <15, (1, 5, 14)>, <15, (1, 12, 15)>, <15, (3, 12, 15)>, <15, (3, 5, 15)>, <16, (1, 3, 9)>, <16, (1, 9, 16)>, <16, (3, 9, 16)>, <17, (3, 2, 17)>, <19, (5, 6, 9)>
