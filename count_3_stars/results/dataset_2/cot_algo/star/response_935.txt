Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 7}
Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6}
Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 7, 8}
Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 7, 8}
Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 9}
Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 5}
Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 7}
Node 9: Neighbors {4, 5, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4 ways
Node 1: 4 choose 3 = 4 ways
Node 2: 4 choose 3 = 4 ways
Node 3: 4 choose 3 = 4 ways
Node 4: 4 choose 3 = 4 ways
Node 5: 5 choose 3 = 10 ways
Node 7: 5 choose 3 = 10 ways
Node 8: 4 choose 3 = 4 ways

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
