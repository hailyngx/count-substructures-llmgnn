Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 8, 11, 7, 12, 6, 9
Node 1: 8, 2, 9
Node 2: 10, 3, 14, 1, 4
Node 3: 7, 6, 4, 2
Node 4: 11, 3, 2
Node 5: 7, 14
Node 6: 3, 0, 12
Node 7: 8, 3, 0, 9, 5
Node 8: 13, 0, 12, 1, 7
Node 9: 0, 7, 14, 1, 12
Node 10: 13, 11, 2
Node 11: 10, 14, 0, 4
Node 12: 8, 0, 14, 9, 6
Node 13: 8, 10
Node 14: 11, 9, 12, 2, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 12: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 14: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Adding them all up, we get a total of 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 84.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [84]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 14)>, <3, (4, 7, 2)>, <7, (0, 9, 8)>, <8, (1, 7, 12)>, <9, (1, 0, 14)>, <12, (0, 6, 14)>, <14, (2, 5, 11)>.
