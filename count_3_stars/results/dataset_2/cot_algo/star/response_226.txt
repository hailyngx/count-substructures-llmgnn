Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create an adjacency list based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 4
Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7
Node 2: 1, 3, 7, 8
Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 9
Node 5: 3, 7, 9
Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8
Node 8: 2, 6, 7
Node 9: 3, 4, 5, 6

Next, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 4
Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7
Node 2: 1, 3, 7, 8
Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 9
Node 5: 3, 7, 9
Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8
Node 8: 2, 6, 7
Node 9: 3, 4, 5, 6

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 44, which can be written as [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<(0, 1, 4), 6>
<(3, 5, 9), 6>
