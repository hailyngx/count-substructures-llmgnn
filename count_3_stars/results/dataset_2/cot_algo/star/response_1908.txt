Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 6) (0, 10) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 1) (7, 3) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 6) (13, 14) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {10, 9, 4, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 11, 14, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {9, 12, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 11, 7, 5, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {3, 9, 12, 0, 5, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {3, 11, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {8, 12, 2, 14, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {1, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {10, 9, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {8, 4, 2, 0}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {0, 12, 8, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {10, 11, 4, 2, 6}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {10, 0, 6, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 13}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: 2 3-stars
  - <0, (10, 9, 4)>
  - <0, (10, 13, 6)>

- Node 1: 1 3-star
  - <1, (3, 11, 7)>

- Node 3: 1 3-star
  - <3, (1, 11, 5)>

- Node 4: 2 3-stars
  - <4, (3, 9, 12)>
  - <4, (3, 5, 11)>
  
- Node 6: 1 3-star
  - <6, (8, 12, 2)>

- Node 12: 1 3-star
  - <12, (10, 11, 2)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [8].
