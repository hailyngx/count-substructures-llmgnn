Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 18) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 1) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 19) (4, 8) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 19) (5, 11) (6, 10) (6, 2) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 18) (0, 1) (16, 17) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 14) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 11) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 19) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 2) (15, 4) (15, 14) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 15) (3, 4) (3, 16) (3, 19) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify all the nodes that are connected to each node. 

Node 0: {13, 16, 18, 1}
Node 1: {10, 0, 2}
Node 2: {7, 6, 1, 14}
Node 3: {4, 16, 19}
Node 4: {8, 15, 3}
Node 5: {11}
Node 6: {10, 2}
Node 7: {18, 2}
Node 8: {4, 18}
Node 9: {17, 16, 11}
Node 10: {17, 6, 1}
Node 11: {13, 5, 9, 19}
Node 12: {19}
Node 13: {17, 11, 0}
Node 14: {2, 18, 15}
Node 15: {4, 14}
Node 16: {17, 0, 3, 9}
Node 17: {13, 10, 16, 9, 19}
Node 18: {8, 7, 0, 14}
Node 19: {17, 12, 11, 3}

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 27 \). 

Therefore, the final answer is [27].

Listing the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (13, 16, 18)>
<2, (7, 6, 1)>
<16, (17, 0, 3)>
<17, (13, 10, 11)>
<18, (8, 7, 0)>
<1, (10, 2, 1)>
