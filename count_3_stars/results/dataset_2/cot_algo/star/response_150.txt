Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 9) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by finding the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 7, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 8, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 12, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 10, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 3, 9, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 6, 7}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {4, 7, 13}

Now, we can identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors to see if any 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 0, with 6 neighbors, can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 2, with 5 neighbors, can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 3, with 5 neighbors, can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 6, with 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7, with 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8, with 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 13, with 6 neighbors, can form 20 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 72 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [72]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 13)>, <0, (4, 8, 13)>, <0, (6, 13, 14)>, <0, (8, 13, 14)>, 
<2, (3, 7, 13)>, <2, (7, 10, 13)>, 
<3, (2, 8, 10)>, <3, (2, 8, 11)>, 
<6, (0, 12, 13)>, 
<7, (12, 13, 14)>, 
<8, (0, 4, 14)>, 
<13, (6, 11, 14)>.
