Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: No 3-star formation with less than 3 neighbors
- Node 2: No 3-star formation with less than 3 neighbors
- Node 3: No 3-star formation with less than 3 neighbors
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: No 3-star formation with less than 3 neighbors
- Node 8: No 3-star formation with less than 3 neighbors
- Node 9: No 3-star formation with less than 3 neighbors

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (7, 1, 8)>
<4, (7, 1, 0)>
<4, (7, 1, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 9, 0)>
<6, (1, 9, 4)>
