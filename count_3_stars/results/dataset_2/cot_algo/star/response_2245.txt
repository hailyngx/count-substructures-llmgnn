Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 10) (15, 27) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 22) (27, 26) (27, 19) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 12) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 12) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 20) (8, 25) (8, 22) (13, 8) (13, 2) (26, 27) (26, 24) (26, 29) (26, 25) (4, 16) (4, 22) (4, 23) (18, 9) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 29) (17, 23) (17, 7) (29, 26) (29, 17) (29, 3) (29, 14) (3, 29) (3, 14) (3, 23) (3, 12) (24, 26) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (19, 27) (19, 6) (19, 5) (19, 25) (22, 27) (22, 8) (22, 4) (22, 10) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 5) (14, 29) (14, 3) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 20) (2, 28) (10, 16) (10, 5) (10, 22) (10, 12) (10, 28) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 10) (20, 8) (20, 2) (25, 8) (25, 26) (25, 19) (23, 4) (23, 17) (23, 3) (28, 2) (28, 10) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list form:

1: 7

2: 9, 13, 20, 28

3: 6, 12, 14, 23, 29

4: 16, 22, 23

5: 0, 7, 10, 19

6: 3, 9, 12, 17, 19

7: 1, 5, 11, 17

8: 16, 13, 20, 25

9: 2, 6, 12, 17, 18

10: 5, 10, 12, 16, 22, 28

11: 7

12: 3, 6, 9, 10, 15

13: 2, 8

14: 3, 29

15: 12, 27

16: 4, 8, 10

17: 6, 7, 9, 17, 23, 29

18: 9

19: 5, 6, 19, 25, 27

20: 2, 8

22: 4, 8, 10, 16, 27

23: 3, 4, 17

24: 26

25: 8, 19, 26

26: 27, 24, 25, 29

27: 15, 19, 22, 26

28: 2, 10

29: 3, 14, 17, 26

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 5: (0, 5, 7), (5, 7, 10), (0, 5, 10)
- Node 6: (3, 6, 12), (6, 9, 12), (6, 12, 19), (6, 17, 19)
- Node 7: (1, 7, 11), (5, 7, 17), (7, 17, 23), (7, 11, 17)
- Node 8: (8, 16, 22), (8, 16, 10), (8, 16, 4), (8, 13, 2), (8, 13, 20), (8, 20, 2), (8, 20, 25)
- Node 9: (2, 9, 13), (2, 9, 17), (9, 17, 29), (2, 9, 12), (6, 9, 12)
- Node 10: (10, 16, 4), (10, 16, 22), (10, 22, 27), (10, 22, 8), (10, 5, 19), (10, 5, 7), (10, 12, 3), (10, 12, 28)
- Node 12: (3, 12, 15), (12, 15, 27)
- Node 16: (4, 16, 22)
- Node 17: (17, 6, 3), (17, 3, 14), (17, 3, 23), (17, 14, 29)
- Node 19: (5, 19, 25), (5, 19, 27), (19, 27, 22), (19, 27, 15), (19, 6, 12)
- Node 22: (8, 22, 4), (22, 4, 23)
- Node 25: (19, 25, 26), (25, 26, 27)
- Node 26: (24, 26, 29)

Only nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 25, and 26 have 3 or more neighbors, so we have 29 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 10>, <0, 5, 10>, <3, 6, 12>, <6, 9, 12>, <6, 12, 19>, <6, 17, 19>, <1, 7, 11>, <5, 7, 17>, <7, 17, 23>, <7, 11, 17>, <8, 16, 22>, <8, 16, 10>, <8, 16, 4>, <8, 13, 2>, <8, 13, 20>, <8, 20, 2>, <8, 20, 25>, <2, 9, 13>, <2, 9, 17>, <9, 17, 29>, <2, 9, 12>, <6, 9, 12>, <10, 16, 4>, <10, 16, 22>, <10, 22, 27>, <10, 22, 8>, <10, 5, 19>, <10, 5, 7>, <10, 12, 3>, <10, 12, 28>, <3, 12, 15>, <12, 15, 27>, <4, 16, 22>, <17, 6, 3>, <17, 3, 14>, <17, 3, 23>, <17, 14, 29>, <5, 19, 25>, <5, 19, 27>, <19, 27, 22>, <19, 27, 15>, <19, 6, 12>, <8, 22, 4>, <22, 4, 23>, <19, 25, 26>, <25, 26, 27>, <24, 26, 29>
