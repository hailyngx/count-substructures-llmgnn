Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 2) (1, 17) (1, 18) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 18) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 10) (17, 1) (17, 6) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 19) (12, 5) (12, 19) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 17) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 12) (9, 16) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 7) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 1) (18, 13) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 7, 14
Node 1: 17, 18
Node 2: 14, 15, 19
Node 3: 6, 14, 15
Node 4: 5, 8, 19
Node 5: 4, 11, 12
Node 6: 3, 7, 11, 17
Node 7: 0, 6, 10, 19
Node 8: 4, 10, 13, 15
Node 9: 16
Node 10: 7, 8, 13
Node 11: 5, 6, 16, 18
Node 12: 5, 19
Node 13: 8, 10, 18
Node 14: 0, 2, 3
Node 15: 2, 3, 8
Node 16: 9, 11, 18
Node 17: 1, 6
Node 18: 1, 11, 13
Node 19: 2, 4, 7, 12

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Node 6: <6, (3, 7, 11)>
Node 11: <11, (5, 16, 18)>
Node 14: <14, (2, 3, 15)>
Node 19: <19, (2, 4, 7)>
  
Now, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: [4].
