Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 19) (22, 13) (22, 6) (22, 10) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 18) (27, 23) (27, 6) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 16) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 17) (4, 2) (6, 22) (6, 27) (28, 11) (28, 3) (28, 1) (19, 13) (19, 26) (19, 14) (19, 20) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 7) (11, 28) (3, 0) (3, 28) (3, 7) (9, 10) (29, 24) (2, 4) (2, 15) (17, 4) (17, 25) (17, 5) (25, 17) (25, 15) (25, 21) (25, 10) (23, 27) (23, 26) (16, 8) (16, 21) (16, 14) (21, 25) (21, 16) (21, 12) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 20) (10, 22) (10, 8) (10, 26) (10, 9) (10, 25) (7, 26) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 28) (1, 7) (1, 24) (20, 19) (20, 18) (20, 24) (12, 13) (12, 21) (24, 0) (24, 29) (24, 1) (24, 20) (24, 14) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 15) (15, 2) (15, 25) (15, 18) (15, 5) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 7) (14, 24) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {3, 18, 24}
Node 1: {7, 24, 28}
Node 2: {4, 15}
Node 3: {0, 7, 28}
Node 4: {2, 5, 8, 17}
Node 5: {4, 15, 17}
Node 6: {22, 27}
Node 7: {1, 3, 14, 26}
Node 8: {4, 10, 16}
Node 9: {10}
Node 10: {8, 9, 22, 25, 26}
Node 11: {28}
Node 12: {13, 21}
Node 13: {12, 19, 22}
Node 14: {7, 16, 19, 24}
Node 15: {2, 5, 18, 25}
Node 16: {8, 14, 21}
Node 17: {4, 5, 25}
Node 18: {0, 15, 20}
Node 19: {13, 14, 20, 26}
Node 20: {18, 19, 24}
Node 21: {12, 16, 25}
Node 22: {6, 10, 13}
Node 23: {26, 27}
Node 24: {0, 1, 14, 20, 29}
Node 25: {10, 15, 17, 21}
Node 26: {7, 10, 19, 23}
Node 27: {6, 23, 26}
Node 28: {1, 3, 11, 24}
Node 29: {24}

Now let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
Number of 3-stars for each node with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 12, 22

Number of 3-stars for each node with more than 3 neighbors:
\[
\binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3}
\]

Summing up all the 3-stars possible, we get:
[180]

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 18, 24)>
<1, (7, 24, 28)>
<5, (2, 15, 25)>
<12, (13, 19, 22)>
<22, (6, 10, 25)>
<22, (10, 13, 26)>
<22, (10, 25, 26)>
<22, (10, 22, 25)>
<24, (0, 1, 14)>
<24, (1, 7, 28)>
<24, (14, 19, 20)>
<24, (14, 20, 24)>
<25, (15, 17, 21)>
<26, (7, 10, 26)>
<28, (1, 3, 24)>
