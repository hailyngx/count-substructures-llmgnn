Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 12) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 11) (8, 18) (0, 5) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 18) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 7) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 16) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 16) (4, 9) (4, 11) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 16) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 7) (16, 18) (18, 3) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 16) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {12, 15, 17}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {2, 15, 18}
- Node 4: {9, 11}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 12, 18}
- Node 7: {16, 17, 19}
- Node 8: {2, 11, 18, 19}
- Node 9: {4}
- Node 10: {2, 15, 16}
- Node 11: {4, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {1, 6, 11, 15}
- Node 14: {2, 5, 18}
- Node 15: {1, 3, 10, 12}
- Node 16: {7, 10, 19}
- Node 17: {1, 7}
- Node 18: {2, 3, 6, 8, 14, 16}
- Node 19: {7, 8, 16}

Now, let's identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to potentially form a 3-star:

- Nodes 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, 15, and 18 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: Not applicable as it has exactly 3 neighbors.
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 15: Not applicable as it has exactly 3 neighbors.
- For node 18: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42].

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 18)>, <2, (3, 8, 18)>, <2, (6, 8, 18)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 18)>, <3, (2, 8, 18)>, <3, (6, 8, 18)>, <6, (2, 5, 14)>, <6, (2, 5, 18)>, <6, (2, 14, 18)>, <6, (5, 14, 18)>, <8, (2, 11, 18)>, <8, (2, 11, 19)>, <8, (2, 18, 19)>, <8, (11, 18, 19)>, <12, (1, 11, 15)>, <12, (1, 11, 12)>, <12, (1, 12, 15)>, <12, (11, 15, 12)>, <18, (2, 8, 14)>, <18, (2, 8, 16)>, <18, (2, 14, 16)>, <18, (8, 14, 16)>, <18, (3, 14, 16)>, <18, (6, 8, 14)>, <18, (6, 8, 16)>, <18, (6, 14, 16)>, <18, (8, 14, 16)>
