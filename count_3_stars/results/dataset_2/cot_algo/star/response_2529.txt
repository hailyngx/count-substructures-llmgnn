Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 10) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 13) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and the provided edges, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 14} (Degree = 4)
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 11, 13} (Degree = 5)
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 6, 10} (Degree = 3)
- Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 10} (Degree = 2)
- Node 4: Neighbors = {6, 14} (Degree = 2)
- Node 5: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14} (Degree = 6)
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5, 13} (Degree = 5)
- Node 7: Neighbors = {1, 8, 13} (Degree = 3)
- Node 8: Neighbors = {5, 7, 9} (Degree = 3)
- Node 9: Neighbors = {5, 8, 11, 14} (Degree = 4)
- Node 10: Neighbors = {2, 3, 12, 13} (Degree = 4)
- Node 11: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 9} (Degree = 4)
- Node 12: Neighbors = {5, 10, 13} (Degree = 3)
- Node 13: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7, 10, 12} (Degree = 5)
- Node 14: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 9, 13} (Degree = 5)

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 11, 14}. There is only 1 such 3-star.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 11, 14}. There is only 1 such 3-star.
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 9, 13}. There is only 1 such 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<5, 9, 11, 14>
<9, 5, 11, 14>
<14, 5, 9, 13>
