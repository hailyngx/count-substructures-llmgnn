Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 11) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 18) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 6) (16, 2) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 9) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 3) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 18) (3, 19) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 18) (14, 8) (14, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 19) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 2) (18, 10) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 3) (0, 12) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {8, 12}
- Node 1: {11, 17, 18}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 16}
- Node 3: {5, 14, 18, 19}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 12}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 19}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 13}
- Node 10: {17, 18, 19}
- Node 11: {1, 8, 12, 18}
- Node 12: {5, 7, 11, 0}
- Node 13: {4, 7, 9, 17}
- Node 14: {3, 8}
- Node 16: {2}
- Node 17: {1, 10, 13}
- Node 18: {1, 3, 10, 11}
- Node 19: {3, 6, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 26. 

Therefore, the final answer is [26] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (11, 17, 18), (17, 1, 13), (17, 10, 18), (17, 1, 11), (3, 18, 10), (3, 18, 11), (3, 18, 1), (3, 18, 14), (6, 7, 12), (7, 12, 11), (7, 12, 5), (7, 12, 0), (8, 6, 19), (4, 7, 13), (4, 7, 9), (4, 7, 6), (4, 9, 13), (8, 14, 3), (12, 7, 13), (12, 7, 11), (12, 7, 5), (12, 7, 0), (8, 0, 12), (9, 4, 13), (10, 17, 18), (10, 17, 19), (10, 18, 11)>
