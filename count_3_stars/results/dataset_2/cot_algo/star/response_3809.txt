Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 19) (27, 25) (27, 11) (27, 19) (27, 13) (14, 0) (14, 25) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 9) (8, 2) (8, 28) (13, 27) (13, 17) (13, 23) (13, 18) (22, 2) (22, 20) (22, 1) (23, 13) (23, 21) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (11, 27) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 21) (28, 8) (28, 29) (28, 26) (28, 16) (29, 28) (29, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 12) (12, 29) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 18) (20, 15) (20, 22) (20, 26) (20, 2) (2, 8) (2, 22) (2, 20) (2, 5) (2, 6) (26, 28) (26, 20) (26, 21) (26, 16) (16, 28) (16, 26) (16, 19) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (21, 23) (21, 11) (21, 26) (21, 25) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 19) (25, 27) (25, 14) (25, 21) (5, 2) (3, 18) (1, 22) (19, 15) (19, 27) (19, 16) (19, 4) (9, 17) (9, 0) (18, 13) (18, 12) (18, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {10, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 1: {22}
- Node 2: {8, 20, 6, 5, 22}
- Node 3: {18}
- Node 4: {12, 6, 19}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {17, 10, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {11, 0, 12}
- Node 8: {2, 28}
- Node 9: {17, 0}
- Node 10: {15, 11, 0, 6}
- Node 11: {27, 10, 7, 21}
- Node 12: {29, 7, 4, 18}
- Node 13: {27, 17, 23, 18}
- Node 14: {0, 25}
- Node 15: {10, 20, 19}
- Node 16: {28, 19, 26}
- Node 17: {13, 6, 9}
- Node 18: {13, 12, 3}
- Node 19: {15, 27, 16, 4}
- Node 20: {15, 2, 22, 26}
- Node 21: {23, 11, 25, 26}
- Node 22: {1, 2, 20}
- Node 23: {13, 21}
- Node 25: {27, 14, 21}
- Node 26: {28, 20, 21, 16}
- Node 27: {15, 11, 25, 13}
- Node 28: {8, 29, 26, 16}
- Node 29: {28, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. <15, (10, 20, 19)>
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. <27, (11, 25, 13)>
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. <28, (26, 20, 16)>

The total number of 3-stars is 3, so the final answer is [3].
