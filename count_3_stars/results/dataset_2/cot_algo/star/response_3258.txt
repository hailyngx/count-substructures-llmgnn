Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 7) (12, 9) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are as follows: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}.

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 3: {9, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {2, 8, 10}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 12: {9, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {3, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: Not enough neighbors
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 2 3-stars
- Node 6: Not enough neighbors
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: Not enough neighbors
- Node 10: Not enough neighbors
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: Not enough neighbors
- Node 13: Not enough neighbors
- Node 14: Not enough neighbors

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 11)>
<1, (0, 5, 10)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 8, 10)>
<5, (1, 2, 14)>
<5, (2, 6, 11)>
<7, (0, 8, 14)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
