Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 5) (26, 8) (26, 27) (5, 9) (5, 18) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 6) (27, 26) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 16) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 18) (3, 13) (22, 2) (22, 15) (22, 8) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 13) (23, 12) (8, 26) (8, 22) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 23) (13, 28) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 21) (2, 1) (2, 22) (2, 18) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 14) (28, 13) (28, 29) (28, 19) (28, 25) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 15) (14, 0) (14, 10) (14, 18) (14, 25) (17, 1) (17, 23) (17, 19) (7, 0) (7, 23) (7, 8) (7, 29) (7, 15) (6, 0) (6, 21) (6, 15) (21, 27) (21, 11) (21, 6) (21, 25) (12, 23) (12, 16) (16, 27) (16, 10) (16, 12) (24, 19) (24, 20) (4, 20) (15, 22) (15, 29) (15, 7) (15, 6) (20, 24) (20, 4) (20, 19) (19, 28) (19, 17) (19, 24) (19, 20) (25, 28) (25, 14) (25, 21) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 6, 7, 14, 27
- Node 1: 2, 17, 18
- Node 2: 1, 18, 22
- Node 3: 13
- Node 4: 20
- Node 5: 9, 18
- Node 6: 0, 15, 21
- Node 7: 0, 8, 15, 23, 29
- Node 8: 7, 22, 26
- Node 9: 5
- Node 10: 11, 14, 16
- Node 11: 10, 21
- Node 12: 16, 23
- Node 13: 3, 23, 28
- Node 14: 0, 10, 18, 25
- Node 15: 6, 7, 15, 22, 29
- Node 16: 10, 12, 27
- Node 17: 1, 19, 23
- Node 18: 1, 2, 5, 14
- Node 19: 17, 20, 24, 28
- Node 20: 4, 19, 24
- Node 21: 6, 11, 25, 27
- Node 22: 2, 8, 15
- Node 23: 7, 12, 13, 17
- Node 24: 19, 20
- Node 25: 14, 21, 28
- Node 26: 8, 27
- Node 27: 0, 16, 21, 26
- Node 28: 13, 19, 25, 29
- Node 29: 7, 15, 28

From the list above, only nodes 0, 7, 14, 18, 27, 28, and 29 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 ways to form a 3-star.
- For node 7, there are inom{5}{3} = 10 ways to form a 3-star.
- For node 14, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 ways to form a 3-star.
- For node 18, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 ways to form a 3-star.
- For node 27, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 ways to form a 3-star.
- For node 28, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 ways to form a 3-star.
- For node 29, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 ways to form a 3-star.

Adding these up, we get 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 34. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 7, 14>
- <0, 7, 27>
- <0, 14, 18>
- <0, 7, 15>
- <7, 15, 29>
- <14, 18, 25>
- <18, 2, 5>
- <27, 21, 25>
- <27, 26, 8>
- <28, 19, 25>
- <28, 19, 24>
- <28, 25, 29>
