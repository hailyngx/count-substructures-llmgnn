Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 5) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more visual way to easily identify the 3-star structures:

```
   1 -- 2 -- 7
   |    |    |
   3 -- 8 -- 4
   |    |    | \
   6 -- 9 -- 10 12
    \        / 
      14 -- 5
```

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 6 has neighbors: {9, 14, 3, 11, 13}. It forms 1 3-star: <6, 9, 13>.
2. Node 9 has neighbors: {6, 10, 13, 0, 12}. It forms 1 3-star: <9, 10, 12>.
3. Node 1 has neighbors: {3, 2, 8}. It forms no 3-stars.
4. Node 3 has neighbors: {6, 1, 14, 5}. It forms no 3-stars.
5. Node 10 has neighbors: {9, 11, 7, 4}. It forms no 3-stars.
6. Node 11 has neighbors: {6, 10, 5}. It forms no 3-stars.
7. Node 2 has neighbors: {1, 8, 13, 7, 4}. It forms 1 3-star: <2, 8, 4>.
8. Node 8 has neighbors: {1, 2, 14, 7}. It forms no 3-stars.
9. Node 0 has neighbors: {9, 12, 5}. It forms no 3-stars.
10. Node 14 has neighbors: {6, 3, 8, 13}. It forms 6 3-stars: <14, 6, 3>, <14, 6, 8>, <14, 6, 13>, <14, 3, 8>, <14, 3, 13>, <14, 8, 13>.
11. Node 5 has neighbors: {3, 11, 0, 13, 4}. It forms 1 3-star: <5, 0, 13>.
12. Node 13 has neighbors: {6, 9, 2, 14, 5}. It forms 1 3-star: <13, 6, 9>.
13. Node 7 has neighbors: {10, 2, 8}. It forms no 3-stars.
14. Node 4 has neighbors: {10, 2, 5, 12}. It forms no 3-stars.
15. Node 12 has neighbors: {9, 0, 4}. It forms no 3-stars.

In total, there are 10 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<6, 9, 13>, 
<9, 10, 12>, 
<2, 8, 4>, 
<14, 6, 3>, 
<14, 6, 8>, 
<14, 6, 13>, 
<14, 3, 8>, 
<14, 3, 13>, 
<14, 8, 13>, 
<5, 0, 13>.
