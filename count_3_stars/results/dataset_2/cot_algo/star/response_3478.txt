Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 11) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 9) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 3) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (15, 17) (15, 8) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 12) (16, 2) (7, 18) (7, 10) (7, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 13) (9, 0) (9, 4) (6, 17) (6, 18) (19, 2) (19, 10) (5, 11) (5, 7) (8, 1) (8, 15) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 19) (2, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {16, 12, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 16, 19, 13}
- Node 3: {18, 11, 16, 2}
- Node 4: {18, 9, 13, 1}
- Node 5: {11, 7}
- Node 6: {17, 18}
- Node 7: {18, 10, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 15}
- Node 9: {0, 4}
- Node 10: {7, 19, 13}
- Node 11: {17, 3, 5}
- Node 12: {14, 0, 16, 13}
- Node 13: {4, 12, 2, 10}
- Node 14: {17, 12}
- Node 15: {17, 8}
- Node 16: {0, 3, 12, 2}
- Node 17: {14, 17, 6, 15, 11}
- Node 18: {4, 18, 7, 3, 6}
- Node 19: {2, 10}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 16: 4 neighbors
- Node 17: 5 neighbors
- Node 18: 5 neighbors

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: [\binom{3}{3} = 1]
- Node 7: [\binom{3}{3} = 1]
- Node 10: [\binom{3}{3} = 1]
- Node 11: [\binom{3}{3} = 1]

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 9, 12>
- <7, 5, 10>
- <10, 13, 2>
- <11, 3, 5>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
