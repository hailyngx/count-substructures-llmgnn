Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first construct the adjacency list for each node:

- Node 0: 5, 6, 2, 7
- Node 1: 9, 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 0
- Node 3: 9, 7, 4, 2, 8
- Node 4: 9, 1, 3, 2
- Node 5: 9, 6, 0, 7
- Node 6: 5, 9, 0
- Node 7: 5, 9, 3, 8, 0
- Node 8: 3, 7
- Node 9: 5, 6, 4, 3, 1, 7

For each node with at least 3 neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars. 

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.

Summing up all the possible 3-stars from the nodes, we get a total of 53 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 6, 5>
- <0, 7, 5>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <2, 4, 1>
- <2, 4, 3>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <3, 8, 7>
- <3, 9, 4>
- <4, 1, 9>
- <4, 2, 1>
- <4, 2, 3>
- <4, 2, 9>
- <4, 3, 9>
- <5, 6, 0>
- <5, 7, 0>
- <5, 9, 6>
- <5, 9, 7>
- <6, 0, 5>
- <6, 5, 9>
- <7, 0, 5>

- <7, 9, 5>
- <8, 3, 7>
- <9, 4, 1>
- <9, 4, 3>
- <9, 5, 6>
- <9, 5, 7>
