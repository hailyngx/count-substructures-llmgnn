Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 3) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 7, 10}
- Node 1: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 10}
- Node 4: {10, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {6, 10, 11}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 4, 5, 12}
- Node 11: {4, 5, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {4, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 14: {8, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, and Node 13.

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 82

Therefore, the final answer is [82].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 3> 
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 10, 11>
<6, 9, 11>
<8, 9, 13>
