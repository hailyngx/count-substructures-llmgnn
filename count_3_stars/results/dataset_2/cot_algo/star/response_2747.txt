Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 10) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (12, 1) (12, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {8, 3, 14, 10}
- Node 1: neighbors {9, 8, 13, 3, 12}
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 14, 11, 5}
- Node 3: neighbors {6, 7, 1, 0}
- Node 4: neighbors {6, 7, 13, 5, 2}
- Node 5: neighbors {4, 7, 8, 11, 2}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 11, 4}
- Node 7: neighbors {4, 3, 14, 13, 5}
- Node 8: neighbors {13, 5, 0, 1}
- Node 9: neighbors {14, 1}
- Node 10: neighbors {0, 14}
- Node 11: neighbors {6, 5, 12, 2}
- Node 12: neighbors {1, 11}
- Node 13: neighbors {4, 7, 8, 1, 14}
- Node 14: neighbors {9, 7, 13, 0, 2, 10}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14

For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 83

Therefore, the final answer is [83], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 3, 14>
<0, 8, 13>
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 13, 1>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 0>
<1, 3, 12>
<1, 8, 13>
<2, 4, 14>
<2, 4, 11>
<2, 4, 5>
<4, 7, 13>
<4, 7, 5>
<4, 7, 3>
<4, 13, 1>
<5, 7, 13>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 4>
<7, 13, 1>
<13, 1, 12>
<14, 9, 7>
<14, 9, 13>
<14, 9, 0>
<14, 9, 2>
<14, 9, 10>
