Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 14) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 10) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 11) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 5) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (3, 8) (3, 10) (4, 9) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 5, 6, 9, 12
- Node 1: 11, 12, 13
- Node 2: 6, 8, 9, 10
- Node 3: 8, 10
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7, 13
- Node 6: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5, 11, 14
- Node 8: 2, 3, 6, 8, 11, 12
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 14
- Node 10: 2, 3, 13
- Node 11: 1, 7, 8, 13
- Node 12: 0, 1, 8, 9, 12, 14
- Node 13: 1, 5, 10, 11, 13, 14
- Node 14: 7, 9, 12, 13

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 10: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 13: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Adding all the 3-stars together: 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [59].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 5, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 8, 9>
<0, 6, 9, 12>
<0, 9, 12, 14>
<2, 6, 8, 9>
<2, 6, 9, 12>
<2, 8, 9, 12>
<2, 9, 12, 14>
<6, 8, 9, 12>
<8, 9, 12, 14>
