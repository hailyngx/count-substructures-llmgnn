Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges provided, let's first find the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {1, 5, 7, 9}
Node 1 neighbors: {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
Node 2 neighbors: {1, 9}
Node 3 neighbors: {4, 7, 8}
Node 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 7, 9}
Node 5 neighbors: {0, 7, 8}
Node 6 neighbors: {1, 7, 8, 9}
Node 7 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Node 8 neighbors: {1, 3, 5, 6}
Node 9 neighbors: {0, 2, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and check if they form a 3-star:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 56. Therefore, the final answer is [56].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
