Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 15) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 18) (9, 2) (9, 7) (3, 4) (7, 9) (7, 10) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 4) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 11) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 18) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 12) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 16) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 1) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 6) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 18) (15, 5) (15, 13) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 0) (16, 14) (16, 10) (12, 19) (12, 1) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 11) (18, 0) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 16) 

Response:
To begin solving this problem, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {11, 15, 18}
Node 1: Neighbors {2, 12, 13}
Node 2: Neighbors {1, 9, 17}
Node 3: Neighbors {4}
Node 4: Neighbors {3, 6, 13}
Node 5: Neighbors {8, 10, 15, 18}
Node 6: Neighbors {4, 14, 19}
Node 7: Neighbors {9, 10}
Node 8: Neighbors {5, 14, 15, 18}
Node 9: Neighbors {2, 7}
Node 10: Neighbors {5, 7, 16}
Node 11: Neighbors {0, 17, 18, 19}
Node 12: Neighbors {1, 19}
Node 13: Neighbors {1, 4, 15}
Node 14: Neighbors {6, 8, 16}
Node 15: Neighbors {0, 5, 8, 13, 17}
Node 16: Neighbors {10, 14}
Node 17: Neighbors {2, 11, 15, 19}
Node 18: Neighbors {0, 5, 8, 11}
Node 19: Neighbors {6, 11, 12, 17}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors since those are the only nodes that can potentially form a 3-star. 
Nodes 5, 8, 15, and 17 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 19

Thus, the final answer is [19], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (8, 18, 15)>
<8, (5, 18, 15)>
<15, (5, 8, 17)>
<17, (11, 19, 15)>
