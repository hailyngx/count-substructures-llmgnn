Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 15) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 15) (16, 7) (16, 6) (1, 19) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 19) (5, 2) (5, 10) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 19) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 4) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 4) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 4) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 18) (4, 17) (4, 11) (4, 19) (15, 2) (15, 9) (15, 13) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 15) (13, 10) (18, 11) (18, 14) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 13) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {19}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 14, 15}
- Node 3: {0, 17, 19}
- Node 4: {11, 17, 19}
- Node 5: {2, 10}
- Node 6: {12, 14, 16, 19}
- Node 7: {10, 12, 16, 17}
- Node 8: {0, 9, 12}
- Node 9: {8, 15}
- Node 10: {5, 7, 13}
- Node 11: {4, 13, 18}
- Node 12: {6, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {10, 12, 15, 11}
- Node 14: {2, 6, 18}
- Node 15: {2, 9, 13}
- Node 16: {6, 7}
- Node 17: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 18: {11, 14}
- Node 19: {1, 3, 4, 6}

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [31].

Unique 3-stars found: 

<0, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 14)>, <2, (0, 5, 15)>, 
<2, (5, 14, 15)>, <3, (0, 17, 19)>, <4, (11, 17, 19)>, 
<6, (12, 14, 19)>, <6, (16, 19, 12)>, <7, (10, 12, 17)>, 
<12, (13, 15, 11)>, <13, (10, 12, 15)>, <13, (10, 15, 11)>, 
<13, (12, 15, 11)>, <19, (1, 4, 6)>, <19, (1, 3, 4)>, 
<19, (3, 4, 6)>, <19, (3, 4, 11)>
