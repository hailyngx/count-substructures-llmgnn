Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 18) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 12) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 14) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 10) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 17) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 19) (16, 4) (16, 6) (16, 19) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 19) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 18) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 15) (14, 3) (0, 1) (0, 5) (3, 14) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 12) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 5) (5, 0) (5, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 10, 18}
- Node 3: {14}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 14, 16, 19}
- Node 5: {0, 10}
- Node 6: {9, 16}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 18}
- Node 8: {1, 11, 17}
- Node 9: {6, 12}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 18}
- Node 11: {8, 13, 18}
- Node 12: {9, 15, 19}
- Node 13: {11, 14, 17}
- Node 14: {3, 4, 13, 15}
- Node 15: {12, 14, 17}
- Node 16: {4, 6, 19}
- Node 17: {8, 11, 13, 15, 19}
- Node 18: {2, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 19: {4, 12, 16, 17}

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes, we get:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for node 2
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for node 4
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for node 7
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for node 8
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for node 10
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for node 11
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for node 12
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for node 13
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for node 14
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for node 15
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for node 16
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for node 17
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for node 18
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for node 19

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 67

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [67]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

<2, (14, 15, 13)>
<2, (16, 4, 19)>
<4, (2, 7, 14)>
<4, (7, 16, 6)>
<4, (16, 6, 19)>
<7, (2, 4, 18)>
<8, (17, 11, 13)>
<10, (2, 7, 18)>
<10, (5, 0, 1)>
<11, (13, 18, 17)>
<13, (15, 12, 19)>
<14, (3, 15, 17)>
<15, (12, 17, 19)>
<16, (19, 4, 12)>
<17, (8, 15, 11)>
<18, (11, 13, 17)>
<19, (12, 16, 17)>
