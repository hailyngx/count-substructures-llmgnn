Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {4, 2, 7}
Node 1: {5, 9, 6}
Node 2: {6, 8, 7}
Node 3: {5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 4: {5, 9, 6, 8, 0}
Node 5: {9, 1, 4, 3}
Node 6: {9, 1, 3, 2, 4}
Node 7: {9, 3, 2, 0}
Node 8: {3, 4, 2}
Node 9: {5, 1, 6, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<3, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<4, (5, 1, 3)>, 
<6, (9, 1, 2)>, 
<7, (9, 3, 2)>, 
<9, (5, 1, 6)>.
