Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors (6, 3, 4, 7)
- Node 1: Neighbors (6, 3, 4)
- Node 2: Neighbors (5, 9, 4, 7)
- Node 3: Neighbors (5, 1, 0)
- Node 4: Neighbors (5, 1, 8, 0, 2)
- Node 5: Neighbors (6, 2, 4, 3, 7)
- Node 6: Neighbors (5, 1, 7, 8, 0)
- Node 7: Neighbors (5, 6, 8, 0, 2)
- Node 8: Neighbors (9, 6, 4, 7)
- Node 9: Neighbors (8, 2)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: inom(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: inom(3, 3) = 1 3-star
- Node 2: inom(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: inom(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: inom(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: inom(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: inom(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: inom(4, 3) = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 53

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [53].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 3, 4>
- <5, 7, 6>
- <5, 6, 0>
- <5, 6, 1>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <2, 7, 5>
- <2, 7, 6>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <4, 8, 6>
