Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars, we first need to determine the number of neighbors for each node. Then we will identify the 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {1, 8, 16}
Node 1 has 5 neighbors: {0, 19, 27, 15, 3}
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {23, 14, 4, 23}
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {19, 28, 14, 15}
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {23, 10, 28, 21}
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {6, 13, 27, 6}
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {22, 20, 5, 22}
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {20, 18, 18}
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {0, 18, 0}
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {18, 10, 12, 12}
Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {21, 4, 9, 12}
Node 11 has 1 neighbor: {17}
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: {22, 17, 9, 10}
Node 13 has 3 neighbors: {21, 5, 14}
Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {2, 13, 16, 3}
Node 15 has 4 neighbors: {25, 19, 26, 29}
Node 16 has 3 neighbors: {0, 14, 16}
Node 17 has 4 neighbors: {29, 12, 27, 11}
Node 18 has 5 neighbors: {7, 22, 9, 8, 18}
Node 19 has 5 neighbors: {1, 15, 26, 3, 23}
Node 20 has 4 neighbors: {7, 25, 6, 6}
Node 21 has 4 neighbors: {10, 13, 23, 21}
Node 22 has 4 neighbors: {18, 6, 12, 22}
Node 23 has 5 neighbors: {21, 4, 2, 19, 23}
Node 25 has 4 neighbors: {20, 27, 15, 28}
Node 26 has 3 neighbors: {15, 19, 26}
Node 27 has 5 neighbors: {1, 25, 17, 5, 27}
Node 28 has 4 neighbors: {4, 25, 3, 28}
Node 29 has 3 neighbors: {15, 17, 29}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {19, 15, 3}: <1, (19, 15, 3)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {23, 10, 21}: <4, (23, 10, 21)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 27, 6}: <5, (6, 27, 6)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {22, 20, 22}: <6, (22, 20, 22)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {18, 10, 12}: <9, (18, 10, 12)>
Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 9, 12}: <10, (4, 9, 12)>
Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors {22, 17, 9}: <12, (22, 17, 9)>
Node 13 forms a 3-star with neighbors {21, 5, 14}: <13, (21, 5, 14)>
Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 13, 16}: <14, (2, 13, 16)>
Node 15 forms a 3-star with neighbors {25, 19, 29}: <15, (25, 19, 29)>
Node 17 forms a 3-star with neighbors {27, 11, 29}: <17, (27, 11, 29)>
Node 18 forms a 3-star with neighbors {22, 9, 8}: <18, (22, 9, 8)>
Node 19 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 15, 3}: <19, (1, 15, 3)>
Node 25 forms a 3-star with neighbors {28, 15, 27}: <25, (28, 15, 27)>
Node 27 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 5, 17}: <27, (1, 5, 17)>
Node 29 forms a 3-star with neighbors {15, 17, 29}: <29, (15, 17, 29)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find the total number of 3-stars is [15].
