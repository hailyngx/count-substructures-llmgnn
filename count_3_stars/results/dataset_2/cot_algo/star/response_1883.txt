Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 13) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 14) (15, 24) (27, 15) (27, 23) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 7) (8, 5) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 24) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (21, 12) (21, 5) (21, 29) (22, 23) (22, 4) (23, 15) (23, 27) (23, 22) (4, 22) (4, 26) (9, 18) (9, 10) (9, 16) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 11) (26, 4) (26, 28) (26, 25) (26, 6) (26, 12) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 0) (28, 18) (20, 29) (20, 11) (29, 1) (29, 21) (29, 20) (6, 26) (18, 9) (18, 28) (18, 0) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 24) (16, 2) (16, 10) (24, 15) (24, 13) (24, 16) (11, 17) (11, 20) (11, 0) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 21) (5, 17) (0, 17) (0, 28) (0, 18) (0, 11) (14, 15) (12, 13) (12, 21) (12, 26) (12, 10) (12, 25) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 16) (10, 12) (25, 26) (25, 12) (2, 7) (2, 16) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 17, 28, 18, 11
- Node 1 neighbors: 3, 17, 29, 7
- Node 2 neighbors: 7, 16
- Node 3 neighbors: 1, 28, 13
- Node 4 neighbors: 22, 26
- Node 5 neighbors: 8, 7, 21, 17
- Node 6 neighbors: 26
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 10, 2, 5
- Node 8 neighbors: 5
- Node 9 neighbors: 18, 10, 16
- Node 10 neighbors: 7, 9, 16, 12
- Node 11 neighbors: 17, 20, 0
- Node 12 neighbors: 13, 21, 26, 10, 25
- Node 13 neighbors: 3, 12, 16, 24
- Node 14 neighbors: 15
- Node 15 neighbors: 27, 23, 14, 24
- Node 16 neighbors: 13, 9, 24, 2, 10
- Node 17 neighbors: 1, 0, 5, 11
- Node 18 neighbors: 9, 28, 0
- Node 20 neighbors: 29, 11
- Node 21 neighbors: 12, 5, 29
- Node 22 neighbors: 23, 4
- Node 23 neighbors: 15, 27, 22
- Node 24 neighbors: 15, 13, 16
- Node 25 neighbors: 26, 12
- Node 26 neighbors: 4, 28, 25, 6, 12
- Node 27 neighbors: 15, 23
- Node 28 neighbors: 3, 26, 0, 18
- Node 29 neighbors: 1, 21, 20

Now, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 3: <3, 1, 13, 28>
- Node 15: <15, 27, 23, 24>
- Node 16: <16, 13, 9, 24>
- Node 24: <24, 15, 13, 16>
- Node 26: <26, 4, 28, 25>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
