Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (17, 19) (17, 5) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 16) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 16) (18, 7) (18, 6) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 0) (11, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 15) (14, 5) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 15) (9, 1) (9, 13) (15, 12) (15, 14) (15, 16) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 19) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 18) (19, 17) (19, 14) (19, 16) (19, 0) 

Response:
The 3-star graph can be visualized as follows:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: Node 1, Node 19
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: Node 0, Node 12, Node 9, Node 0
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: Node 7, Node 8, Node 16
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: Node 5, Node 10, Node 12, Node 14
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: Node 5, Node 10, Node 16
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: Node 3, Node 4, Node 14, Node 17
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: Node 8, Node 12, Node 18
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: Node 2, Node 13, Node 18
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: Node 2, Node 6, Node 10
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: Node 1, Node 13
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: Node 3, Node 4, Node 8
- Node 11 has 1 neighbor: Node 13
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: Node 1, Node 3, Node 6, Node 15
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: Node 7, Node 9, Node 11
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: Node 3, Node 5, Node 15, Node 19
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: Node 12, Node 14, Node 16
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: Node 2, Node 4, Node 15, Node 19
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors: Node 5, Node 19
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: Node 6, Node 7, Node 18
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: Node 0, Node 14, Node 16, Node 17

Since all nodes have less than 3 neighbors, there are no 3-stars in this graph. Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [0].
