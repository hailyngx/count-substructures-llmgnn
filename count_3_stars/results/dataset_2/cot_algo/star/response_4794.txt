Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 11) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 19) (7, 4) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 19) (11, 15) (11, 10) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 19) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 18) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 13) (18, 0) (18, 16) (18, 1) (5, 3) (5, 15) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 1) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 13) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {2, 12, 18}
- Node 1: {10, 13, 18}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 12}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 14, 15}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 9, 19}
- Node 5: {3, 15}
- Node 6: {2, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 12, 16}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 11, 17, 19}
- Node 11: {10, 15}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 13: {1, 9, 14, 19}
- Node 14: {3, 13}
- Node 15: {3, 5, 11}
- Node 16: {8, 17, 18}
- Node 17: {10, 16, 19}
- Node 18: {0, 1, 16}
- Node 19: {4, 10, 13, 17}

From the list of neighbor sets, we see that nodes 3, 4, 10, 13, and 19 each have at least three neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of them:

1. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20 \) 3-stars. So, the final answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, 4, 15>
- <3, 4, 14>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 14, 13>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <4, 9, 6>
- <4, 9, 13>
- <10, 17, 19>
- <10, 17, 16>
- <10, 17, 1>
- <10, 17, 19>
- <13, 9, 6>
- <13, 9, 4>
- <13, 9, 19>
- <13, 9, 19>
- <13, 19, 10>
- <13, 19, 17>
- <13, 19, 4>
- <13, 19, 10>
- <19, 17, 10>
