Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 2, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7, 4}
- Node 2: {9, 0, 8, 5, 1}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 7, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 6, 3}
- Node 5: {1, 9, 8, 2, 3, 0}
- Node 6: {4, 8, 3}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 0, 3}
- Node 8: {6, 2, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 56, so the final answer is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 7, 3)>, <1, (2, 5, 4)>, <2, (9, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 9, 8)>.
