Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 6) (0, 7) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 7) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (10, 4) (10, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 4) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {6, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {3, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {4, 8, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 9, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {1, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {4, 12}
- Node 11: {3, 4, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {2, 5, 6, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {7, 9, 13}

Now, let's apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 80
Therefore, the final answer is [80].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 8, 12)>
<1, (3, 8, 12)>
<3, (1, 11, 12)>
<3, (1, 11, 13)>
<8, (1, 3, 12)>
<8, (1, 3, 13)>
<12, (1, 3, 8)>
<12, (1, 4, 10)>
<13, (3, 11, 14)>
