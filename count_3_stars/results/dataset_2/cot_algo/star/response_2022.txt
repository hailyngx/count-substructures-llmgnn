Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 0) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 23) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 8) (27, 15) (27, 11) (7, 21) (7, 25) (7, 6) (7, 24) (3, 21) (3, 16) (3, 9) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 2) (13, 11) (17, 1) (17, 8) (25, 7) (25, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 22) (20, 29) (20, 19) (20, 6) (20, 10) (18, 19) (18, 28) (19, 29) (19, 20) (19, 18) (19, 22) (6, 7) (6, 20) (6, 24) (6, 2) (24, 7) (24, 6) (22, 29) (22, 19) (22, 12) (22, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 28) (23, 21) (23, 15) (23, 4) (12, 5) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 26) (10, 20) (10, 28) (14, 5) (14, 12) (0, 1) (0, 25) (0, 9) (0, 4) (4, 23) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 26) (11, 27) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 26) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 8) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 22) (8, 16) (28, 18) (28, 2) (28, 10) (26, 12) (26, 4) (26, 11) 

Response:
Given the graph information, we will first identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 4, 9, 25}
Node 1: {0, 17}
Node 2: {6, 13, 28}
Node 3: {9, 16, 21}
Node 4: {0, 16, 23, 26}
Node 5: {12, 14}
Node 6: {2, 7, 20, 24}
Node 7: {6, 21, 24, 25}
Node 8: {15, 16, 17, 22}
Node 9: {0, 3, 11}
Node 10: {20, 28}
Node 11: {9, 13, 26, 27}
Node 12: {5, 14, 22, 26}
Node 13: {2, 11}
Node 14: {5, 12}
Node 15: {8, 23, 27}
Node 16: {3, 4, 8}
Node 17: {1, 8}
Node 18: {19, 28}
Node 19: {18, 20, 22, 29}
Node 20: {6, 10, 19, 29}
Node 21: {3, 7, 23}
Node 22: {8, 12, 19}
Node 23: {4, 15, 21}
Node 24: {6, 7}
Node 25: {0, 7}
Node 26: {4, 11, 12}
Node 27: {11, 15}
Node 28: {2, 10, 18}
Node 29: {19, 20}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars formed with the nodes having 3 or more neighbors:

\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = \binom{22}{3} + \binom{23}{3} + \binom{24}{3} + \binom{22}{3} + \binom{23}{3} + \binom{23}{3} + \binom{23}{3} + \binom{24}{3} + \binom{22}{3} + \binom{22}{3} + \binom{22}{3} + \binom{23}{3} + \binom{23}{3} + \binom{24}{3} + \binom{23}{3} + \binom{23}{3} + \binom{23}{3} + \binom{24}{3} = 975 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [975].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 25>, <0, 9, 25>, <0, 4, 26>, <1, 8, 17>, <3, 8, 16>, <6, 24, 7>, <11, 13, 26>, <12, 14, 5>, <19, 20, 29>, <19, 22, 29>, <19, 18, 28>, <19, 20, 28>, <20, 28, 10>, <21, 23, 4>, <22, 12, 26>, <23, 15, 27>, <24, 6, 7>, <25, 0, 7>, <26, 11, 12>
