Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 7) (15, 27) (15, 26) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 14) (27, 5) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 26) (8, 6) (23, 8) (23, 17) (23, 16) (23, 19) (20, 17) (20, 29) (20, 7) (20, 12) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 25) (14, 27) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 24) (14, 10) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 26) (18, 4) (18, 24) (18, 29) (9, 7) (11, 7) (11, 6) (28, 6) (28, 3) (17, 23) (17, 20) (6, 13) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 28) (29, 20) (29, 0) (29, 18) (10, 14) (10, 21) (10, 24) (10, 16) (21, 27) (21, 10) (12, 20) (12, 4) (3, 4) (3, 28) (26, 15) (26, 8) (26, 4) (7, 22) (7, 20) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 1) (5, 27) (5, 2) (5, 25) (16, 23) (16, 10) (16, 24) (24, 14) (24, 18) (24, 10) (24, 16) (1, 14) (1, 7) (19, 23) (25, 13) (25, 0) (25, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {14, 25, 29}
- Node 1: {7, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 28}
- Node 4: {3, 12, 18, 26}
- Node 5: {2, 25, 27}
- Node 6: {8, 11, 13, 28}
- Node 7: {1, 9, 11, 20, 22}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 13, 26}
- Node 9: {7}
- Node 10: {14, 16, 21, 24}
- Node 11: {6, 7}
- Node 12: {4, 20}
- Node 13: {6, 8, 22, 25}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 10, 24, 27}
- Node 15: {26, 27}
- Node 16: {10, 24}
- Node 17: {20, 23}
- Node 18: {4, 24, 29}
- Node 19: {23}
- Node 20: {7, 12, 17, 29}
- Node 21: {10, 27}
- Node 22: {7, 13}
- Node 23: {8, 17, 19}
- Node 24: {10, 14, 16, 18}
- Node 25: {0, 5, 13}
- Node 26: {4, 8, 15}
- Node 27: {5, 14, 15, 21}
- Node 28: {3, 6}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 13: {6, 8, 22, 25} => [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4 3-stars
- Node 14: {0, 1, 10, 24, 27} => [\( \binom{5}{3} \)] = 10 3-stars
- Node 24: {4, 10, 14, 16, 18} => [\( \binom{5}{3} \)] = 10 3-stars
- Node 27: {5, 14, 15, 21} => [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: {2, 6, 13, 26} => [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: {3, 12, 18, 26} => [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the final answer is [36], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <13, (6, 8, 22)>
- <14, (0, 10, 24)>
- <24, (4, 10, 14)>
- <27, (5, 15, 21)>
- <8, (2, 6, 13)>
- <4, (3, 12, 18)>
