Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 26) (22, 19) (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 1) (26, 22) (26, 9) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 27) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 23) (17, 27) (17, 11) (5, 0) (5, 27) (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 28) (11, 26) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 25) (28, 10) (28, 27) (28, 15) (29, 7) (4, 14) (4, 27) (4, 0) (4, 25) (27, 26) (27, 17) (27, 5) (27, 28) (27, 4) (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 8) (21, 14) (21, 10) (21, 12) (2, 3) (2, 24) (12, 14) (12, 21) (12, 25) (19, 22) (19, 3) (19, 15) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 15) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (15, 28) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 24) (7, 29) (20, 26) (20, 6) (6, 20) (6, 0) (24, 17) (24, 2) (24, 15) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) (23, 17) (23, 25) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 16) (8, 25) (16, 8) (25, 11) (25, 4) (25, 12) (25, 23) (25, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: neighbors {5, 4, 6}
- Node 1: neighbors {9, 11, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 24}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 19, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {14, 27, 0, 25}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 27}
- Node 6: neighbors {20, 0}
- Node 7: neighbors {29}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 1, 25, 16}
- Node 9: neighbors {26, 18, 1}
- Node 10: neighbors {11, 21, 18, 28}
- Node 11: neighbors {26, 17, 10, 1, 25}
- Node 12: neighbors {14, 21, 25}
- Node 14: neighbors {17, 4, 21, 12}
- Node 15: neighbors {28, 19, 18, 24}
- Node 16: neighbors {8}
- Node 17: neighbors {14, 24, 23, 27, 11}
- Node 18: neighbors {9, 10, 15}
- Node 19: neighbors {22, 3, 15}
- Node 20: neighbors {26, 6}
- Node 21: neighbors {14, 10, 12}
- Node 22: neighbors {26, 19}
- Node 23: neighbors {17, 25}
- Node 24: neighbors {17, 2, 15}
- Node 25: neighbors {11, 4, 12, 23, 8}
- Node 26: neighbors {22, 9, 20, 11, 27}
- Node 27: neighbors {26, 17, 5, 28, 4}
- Node 28: neighbors {10, 27, 15}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {14, 27, 25}: <4, 14, 27>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 1, 25}: <8, 3, 1>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with neighbors {17, 25, 26}: <11, 17, 25>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors {17, 21, 12}: <14, 17, 21>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with neighbors {28, 19, 24}: <15, 28, 19>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with neighbors {27, 23, 25}: <17, 27, 23>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
