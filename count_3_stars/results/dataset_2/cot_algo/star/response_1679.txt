Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 17) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 13) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 19) (15, 10) (15, 18) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 19) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 18) (9, 2) (18, 15) (18, 9) (18, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 17) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 3) (16, 8) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 1) (13, 0) (13, 18) (13, 2) (8, 16) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 3, 13}
- Node 1: {6, 2, 12}
- Node 2: {5, 1, 11, 13, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 14, 17}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 17}
- Node 5: {6, 2, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 12}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 19, 17}
- Node 8: {16}
- Node 9: {4, 11, 18, 2}
- Node 10: {15, 12, 19}
- Node 11: {14, 9, 2}
- Node 12: {6, 10, 1}
- Node 13: {0, 18, 2}
- Node 14: {5, 11, 3, 19}
- Node 15: {10, 18}
- Node 16: {8}
- Node 17: {4, 7, 3}
- Node 18: {15, 13, 9}
- Node 19: {7, 10, 14}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors, as they have the potential to form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 7, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 10: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 11: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 17: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 18: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 19: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 3, 13>
- <2, 1, 11>
- <2, 1, 13>
- <2, 1, 9>
- <2, 11, 9>
- <2, 11, 13>
- <2, 9, 13>
- <4, 9, 17>
- <7, 0, 17>
- <7, 4, 9>
- <7, 4, 17>
- <7, 17, 3>
- <9, 4, 11>
- <9, 4, 18>
- <9, 11, 2>
- <9, 11, 18>
- <9, 18, 13>
- <14, 3, 19>
- <14, 5, 11>
- <14, 5, 19>
