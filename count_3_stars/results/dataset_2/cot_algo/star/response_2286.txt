Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first determine the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5}, 4 neighbors
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 9}, 4 neighbors
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}, 5 neighbors
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 6, 9}, 5 neighbors
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 8}, 4 neighbors
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}, 5 neighbors
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5}, 4 neighbors
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 9}, 2 neighbors
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 5, 9}, 3 neighbors
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 8}, 4 neighbors

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: No 3-star possible (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: No 3-star possible (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: [1] <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 3: [1] <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 4: [1] <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 5: No 3-star possible (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: [1] <6, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 7: No 3-star possible (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: [1] <8, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 9: No 3-star possible (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
