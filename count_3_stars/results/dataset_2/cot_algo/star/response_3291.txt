Node 19 is connected to node 20.
Node 20 is connected to nodes 7, 19.
Node 21 is connected to nodes 22, 26.
Node 22 is connected to nodes 3, 8, 21.
Node 23 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 14, 16.
Node 24 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 13, 14.
Node 25 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 28.
Node 26 is connected to nodes 9, 15, 21.
Node 27 is connected to nodes 6, 13, 4.
Node 28 is connected to nodes 16, 17, 25.
Node 29 is connected to node 18.

Next, let's identify the nodes that form 3-star graphs:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 9, 10, 22, 25.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 7, 11, 13, 18.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 5, 8, 14, 20.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 7, 10, 12, 17, 22.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 5, 14, 24, 27.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 7, 13, 23, 24.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 15, 23, 28.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 8, 10, 28.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 29.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 13, 14.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star graphs formed by each node:
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding all the 3-stars formed by the nodes, we get: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 34 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].
