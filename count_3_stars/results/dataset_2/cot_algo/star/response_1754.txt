Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars. Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each.

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5, 7, 9: Not applicable as they have exactly 3 neighbors

Adding up the 3-stars formed by nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4, we get a total of \(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16\) 3-stars. So, the final answer is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
