Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 3) (0, 6) (0, 11) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {6, 11}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 2: {1, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 9, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {3, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {9, 11}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 6, 12, 14, 9}
- Node 8: {9, 11, 13}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 4, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 13: {4, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 6, 7, 13}

Now we will calculate how many 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with itself at the center. <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 10)>, <9, (3, 6, 14)>, <9, (3, 7, 10)>, <9, (3, 7, 14)>, <9, (3, 10, 14)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 10)>, <9, (5, 6, 14)>, <9, (5, 7, 10)>, <9, (5, 7, 14)>, <9, (5, 10, 14)>, <9, (6, 7, 10)>, <9, (6, 7, 14)>, <9, (6, 10, 14)>, <9, (7, 10, 14)>, <9, (6, 7, 14)>, <9, (6, 10, 14)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 \), so the final answer is [20].
