Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 15) (9, 6) (9, 8) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 10) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 8) (18, 14) (18, 13) (17, 15) (17, 1) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 10) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 2) (16, 4) (16, 2) (12, 8) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 11) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 12) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 10) (13, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 13) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
The node 3 has 4 neighbors: 15, 2, 8, and 2. So, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars formed with node 3 as the center: <3, (15, 2, 8)>, <3, (15, 2, 2)>, <3, (15, 8, 2)>, <3, (2, 8, 2)>.

The node 15 has 5 neighbors: 3, 9, 17, and 4. So, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars formed with node 15 as the center: <15, (3, 9, 17)>, <15, (3, 9, 4)>, <15, (3, 17, 4)>, <15, (9, 17, 4)>, <15, (3, 9, 17)>, <15, (3, 9, 4)>, <15, (3, 17, 4)>, <15, (9, 17, 4)>, <15, (9, 17, 4)>, <15, (3, 17, 4)>.

The node 4 has 4 neighbors: 15, 13, 16, and 16. So, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars formed with node 4 as the center: <4, (15, 13, 16)>, <4, (15, 13, 16)>, <4, (15, 13, 16)>, <4, (13, 16, 16)>.

The node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it does not participate in forming any 3-stars.

The node 9 has 4 neighbors: 15, 6, 8, and 8. So, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars formed with node 9 as the center: <9, (15, 6, 8)>, <9, (15, 6, 8)>, <9, (15, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 8)>.

The node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it does not participate in forming any 3-stars.

The node 17 has 2 neighbors, so it does not participate in forming any 3-stars.

The node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it does not participate in forming any 3-stars.

The node 19 has 4 neighbors: 6, 7, 5, and 13. So, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars formed with node 19 as the center: <19, (6, 7, 5)>, <19, (6, 7, 13)>, <19, (6, 5, 13)>, <19, (7, 5, 13)>.

The node 8 has 4 neighbors: 3, 9, 7, and 12. So, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars formed with node 8 as the center: <8, (3, 9, 7)>, <8, (3, 9, 12)>, <8, (3, 7, 12)>, <8, (9, 7, 12)>.

The node 0 has 1 neighbor, so it does not participate in forming any 3-stars.

The node 16 has 2 neighbors, so it does not participate in forming any 3-stars.

The node 12 has 2 neighbors, so it does not participate in forming any 3-stars.

The node 14 has 4 neighbors: 1, 7, 18, and 12. So, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars formed with node 14 as the center: <14, (12, 7, 18)>, <14, (12, 7, 12)>, <14, (12, 18, 12)>, <14, (7, 18, 12)>.

The node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it does not participate in forming any 3-stars.

The node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it does not participate in forming any 3-stars.

The node 13 has 5 neighbors: 4, 18, 19, 10, and 11. So, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars formed with node 13 as the center: <13, (4, 18, 19)>, <13, (4, 18, 10)>, <13, (4, 18, 11)>, <13, (4, 19, 10)>, <13, (4, 19, 11)>, <13, (4, 10, 11)>, <13, (18, 19, 10)>, <13, (18, 19, 11)>, <13, (18, 10, 11)>, <13, (19, 10, 11)>.

The node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it does not participate in forming any 3-stars.

Counting all the 3-stars, we found a total of 38 of them: <3, (15, 2, 8)>, <3, (15, 2, 2)>, <3, (15, 8, 2)>, <3, (2, 8, 2)>, <15, (3, 9, 17)>, <15, (3, 9, 4)>, <15, (3, 17, 4)>, <15, (9, 17, 4)>, <15, (3, 9, 17)>, <15, (3, 9, 4)>, <15, (3, 17, 4)>, <15, (9, 17, 4)>, <15, (9, 17, 4)>, <15, (3, 17, 4)>, <4, (15, 13, 16)>, <4, (15, 13, 16)>, <4, (15, 13, 16)>, <4, (13, 16, 16)>, <9, (15, 6, 8)>, <9, (15, 6, 8)>, <9, (15, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 8)>, <19, (6, 7, 5)>, <19, (6, 7, 13)>, <19, (6, 5, 13)>, <19, (7, 5, 13)>, <8, (3, 9, 7)>, <8, (3, 9, 12)>, <8, (3, 7, 12)>, <8, (9, 7, 12)>, <14, (12, 7, 18)>, <14, (12, 7, 12)>, <14, (12, 18, 12)>, <14, (7, 18, 12)>, <13, (4, 18, 19)>, <13, (4, 18, 10)>, <13, (4, 18, 11)>, <13, (4, 19, 10)>, <13, (4, 19, 11)>, <13, (4, 10, 11)>, <13, (18, 19, 10)>, <13, (18, 19, 11)>, <13, (18, 10, 11)>, <13, (19, 10, 11)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].
