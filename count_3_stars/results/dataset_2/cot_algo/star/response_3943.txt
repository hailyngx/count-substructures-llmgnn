Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 1) (6, 14) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 10) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 10) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 12) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {8, 9, 12}
- Node 1: neighbors {11, 6, 14}
- Node 2: neighbors {8, 5, 9, 7, 11}
- Node 3: neighbors {13, 4, 11, 7, 5}
- Node 4: neighbors {8, 13, 3}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 3, 11, 12, 10}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 14}
- Node 7: neighbors {13, 2, 3, 14, 10}
- Node 8: neighbors {4, 2, 0}
- Node 9: neighbors {13, 2, 10, 0, 12}
- Node 10: neighbors {9, 7, 5, 12}
- Node 11: neighbors {2, 3, 14, 1, 5}
- Node 12: neighbors {9, 5, 10, 0}
- Node 13: neighbors {4, 3, 9, 7}
- Node 14: neighbors {11, 1, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 62 3-stars. So, the final answer is [62].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (5, 11, 3)>, <3, (5, 11, 2)>, <5, (11, 3, 2)>, <7, (2, 11, 3)>, <9, (2, 13, 7)>, <11, (5, 2, 3)>, <12, (5, 10, 9)>, <13, (4, 7, 9)>, <14, (1, 11, 7)>.
