Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 2) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 8, 12}
- Node 1: {10, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {7, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {4, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 9, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {4, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 4, 8, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 3, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 6, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 8, 12}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [2]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 8: [2]
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 10: [1]
- Node 11: [1]
- Node 12: [1]
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 14: [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 8, 12)>
- <1, (10, 11, 14)>
- <2, (7, 12, 13, 14)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6, 11, 12)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11)>
- <8, (0, 9, 10, 11, 14)>
- <9, (4, 8, 10, 13)>
- <10, (1, 4, 8, 9)>
- <11, (1, 3, 4, 8, 13)>
- <12, (0, 2, 3, 13, 14)>
- <13, (2, 6, 9, 11, 12)>
- <14, (1, 2, 8, 12)>
