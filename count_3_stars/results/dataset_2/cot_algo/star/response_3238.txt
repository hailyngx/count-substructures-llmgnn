Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 7}
Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 7, 8, 9}
Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 9}
Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 8}
Node 5: Neighbors {2, 6}
Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}
Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 6}
Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 9}
Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 2: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: Does not have at least 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: Does not have at least 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: Does not have at least 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: Does not have at least 3 neighbors

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
