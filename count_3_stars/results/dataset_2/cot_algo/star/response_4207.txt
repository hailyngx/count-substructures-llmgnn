Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 21) (3, 14) (3, 6) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 28) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 29) (0, 24) (0, 11) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 11) (15, 1) (15, 20) (15, 26) (15, 6) (15, 12) (13, 26) (13, 25) (13, 29) (13, 28) (13, 7) (26, 15) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 8) (26, 4) (9, 22) (9, 11) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 20) (11, 9) (21, 3) (21, 18) (21, 2) (29, 23) (29, 13) (29, 19) (29, 8) (18, 26) (18, 21) (18, 14) (18, 27) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 16) (7, 1) (7, 20) (7, 13) (16, 6) (16, 25) (8, 26) (8, 29) (28, 22) (28, 13) (28, 19) (2, 21) (2, 5) (2, 24) (2, 17) (5, 2) (5, 10) (17, 2) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 12) (4, 26) (4, 19) (19, 29) (19, 28) (19, 4) (19, 10) (25, 13) (25, 16) (25, 24) (27, 18) (24, 0) (24, 2) (24, 25) (10, 5) (10, 19) (12, 15) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {11, 24}
- Node 1: {7, 15}
- Node 2: {5, 17, 21, 24}
- Node 3: {6, 11, 14, 21}
- Node 4: {19, 26}
- Node 5: {2, 10}
- Node 6: {3, 6, 15, 16}
- Node 7: {1, 13, 20}
- Node 8: {26, 29}
- Node 9: {11, 22}
- Node 10: {5, 19}
- Node 11: {0, 3, 9, 20, 23}
- Node 12: {14, 15}
- Node 13: {7, 13, 26, 28}
- Node 14: {3, 12, 18}
- Node 15: {1, 6, 12, 15, 20}
- Node 16: {6, 25}
- Node 17: {2}
- Node 18: {14, 18, 21, 27}
- Node 19: {4, 10, 19, 28}
- Node 20: {7, 11, 15}
- Node 21: {2, 3, 18}
- Node 22: {9, 23,28}
- Node 23: {11, 22, 29}
- Node 24: {0, 2, 25}
- Node 25: {13, 16, 24}
- Node 26: {4, 8, 13, 18, 26}
- Node 27: {18}
- Node 28: {13, 19, 22}
- Node 29: {8, 13, 19, 23}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars:  
  <2, (21, 5, 17)>, <2, (21, 5, 24)>, <2, (21, 17, 24)>, <2, (5, 17, 24)>
- Node 3 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars:  
  <3, (6, 21, 14)>, <3, (6, 21, 14)>, <3, (6, 14, 21)>, <3, (21, 14, 18)>
- Node 26 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars:  
  <26, (4, 13, 18)>, <26, (4, 13, 26)>, <26, (4, 18, 13)>, <26, (4, 18, 26)>, <26, (4, 26, 13)>, <26, (13, 18, 26)>, <26, (13, 26, 18)>, <26, (18, 13, 26)>, <26, (18, 26, 13)>, <26, (13, 18, 26)>
- Node 19 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars:  
  <19, (4, 10, 19)>, <19, (4, 19, 28)>, <19, (10, 19, 28)>, <19, (4, 10, 28)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 22, so [22].
