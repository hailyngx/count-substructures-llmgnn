Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, first let's identify the neighbors for each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors (4, 3)
2. Node 1: Neighbors (4, 6, 9, 3, 2, 8)
3. Node 2: Neighbors (1, 5, 8)
4. Node 3: Neighbors (4, 9, 1, 5, 0)
5. Node 4: Neighbors (7, 0, 3, 5, 1)
6. Node 5: Neighbors (4, 3, 2, 8)
7. Node 6: Neighbors (7, 9, 1)
8. Node 7: Neighbors (4, 6, 8)
9. Node 8: Neighbors (7, 9, 1, 5, 2)
10. Node 9: Neighbors (6, 8, 1, 3)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars formed:

Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: 1 unique 3-star
Node 5: 1 unique 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 46

Therefore, the final answer is [46], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 8, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 7, 5)>
<5, (2, 8, 3)>
<8, (2, 1, 5)>
