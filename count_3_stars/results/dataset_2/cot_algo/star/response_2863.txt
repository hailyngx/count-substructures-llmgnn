Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 11) (9, 18) (9, 10) (9, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 11) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 18) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 8) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 10) (15, 11) (13, 17) (13, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 7) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 4) (4, 19) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 2) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 8) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 8) (2, 1) (2, 12) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 0) (6, 4) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 15) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8, 14, 18}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 12}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 8, 18}
- Node 4: {6, 12, 19}
- Node 5: {11, 18}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {8, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 7, 16, 19}
- Node 9: {10, 12, 18}
- Node 10: {7, 9, 15, 16, 19}
- Node 11: {5, 15, 17}
- Node 12: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 13: {7, 17}
- Node 14: {0, 1}
- Node 15: {10, 11}
- Node 16: {8, 10, 17}
- Node 17: {11, 13, 16}
- Node 18: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 19: {4, 8, 10}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of unique 3-stars = \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 34 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 3, 18>
- <0, 8, 18>
- <0, 14, 18>
- <3, 8, 18>
- <10, 8, 19>
- <10, 8,14>
- <10, 8, 16>
- <10, 8, 19>
- <10, 16, 17>
- <11, 5, 18>
- <10, 16, 17>
- <12, 2, 4>
- <18, 9, 5>
- <18, 9, 3>
