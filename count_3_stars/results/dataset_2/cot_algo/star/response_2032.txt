Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 2) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (13, 9) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 1) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 3) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 1) 

Response:
To identify the 3-star graphs in this network, we first need to find the neighbors of each node. Then we can determine how many 3-star graphs can be formed around each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 14, 1}
- Node 1: {0, 14, 8, 6, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 11, 1}
- Node 3: {11, 12, 4}
- Node 4: {9, 12, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 12, 7}
- Node 6: {10, 11, 1}
- Node 7: {5, 10, 12, 14, 8}
- Node 8: {9, 11, 7, 12, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 4, 13, 0, 12}
- Node 10: {11, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 11: {10, 3, 6, 8, 2}
- Node 12: {5, 9, 7, 4, 3, 8}
- Node 13: {9}
- Node 14: {10, 7, 0, 1}

Nodes 13 and 14 have less than three neighbors, so no 3-star is formed around these nodes.

Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 6 have exactly three neighbors, so each forms one 3-star.

Nodes 4 and 8 have four neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Nodes 3 and 5 have five neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

Nodes 7, 9, 10, and 12 have six neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in this network is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 102 \).

Thus, the final answer is [102], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 9, 14, 1>
- <1, 0, 14, 8>
- <2, 5, 11, 1>
- <6, 10, 11, 1>
- <4, 9, 12, 3>
- <8, 9, 11, 7>
- <3, 11, 12, 4>
- <5, 9, 12, 7>
- <7, 5, 10, 12>
- <9, 5, 12, 7>
- <10, 7, 14, 0>
- <12, 7, 4, 3>
