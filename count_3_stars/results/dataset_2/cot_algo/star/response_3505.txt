Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 24) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 7) (22, 18) (22, 4) (22, 14) (22, 16) (22, 5) (7, 18) (7, 26) (21, 6) (21, 10) (21, 19) (21, 26) (20, 12) (20, 16) (25, 29) (25, 15) (28, 3) (28, 9) (28, 12) (29, 25) (29, 5) (29, 3) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 1) (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 14) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 10) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 26) (4, 27) (4, 22) (4, 24) (4, 16) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (23, 26) (23, 13) (8, 11) (19, 18) (19, 21) (10, 21) (10, 1) (16, 22) (16, 20) (16, 4) (16, 2) (26, 7) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 23) (26, 14) (3, 28) (3, 29) (3, 17) (24, 27) (24, 6) (24, 4) (24, 13) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 26) (12, 20) (12, 28) (9, 28) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 2) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 13) (13, 23) (13, 24) (13, 15) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {27}
- Node 1: {5, 10, 17}
- Node 2: {9, 11, 16}
- Node 3: {17, 28, 29}
- Node 4: {16, 22, 24, 27}
- Node 5: {1, 22, 29}
- Node 6: {14, 21, 24}
- Node 7: {18, 26}
- Node 8: {11}
- Node 9: {2, 9, 11, 15, 28}
- Node 10: {1, 21}
- Node 11: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 12: {20, 28}
- Node 13: {15, 23, 24}
- Node 14: {6, 22, 26}
- Node 15: {9, 13, 17, 25}
- Node 16: {2, 4, 22, 20}
- Node 17: {1, 3, 15, 26}
- Node 18: {7, 19, 21, 22}
- Node 19: {18, 21}
- Node 20: {12, 16}
- Node 21: {6, 10, 19, 26}
- Node 22: {4, 5, 14, 16, 18}
- Node 23: {13, 26}
- Node 24: {4, 6, 13, 27}
- Node 25: {15, 29}
- Node 26: {7, 14, 17, 21, 23}
- Node 27: {0, 4, 24}
- Node 28: {3, 9, 12}
- Node 29: {5, 25, 3}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find 3-stars:
- Node 4, 16 and 22 each have 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 1, 5, 9, 15, 17, 21, 24, 26 each have 3 neighbors, forming \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.

Total number of 3-stars = (4 * 3) + (8 * 1) = 12 + 8 = 20

Therefore, the final answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (16, 22, 24, 27)>, <16, (2, 4, 20, 22)>, <22, (4, 5, 14, 16)>, <1, (5, 10, 17)>, <5, (1, 22, 29)>, <9, (2, 11, 15, 28)>, <15, (9, 13, 17, 25)>, <17, (1, 3, 15, 26)>, <21, (6, 10, 19, 26)>, <24, (4, 6, 13, 27)>
