Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 5, and Node 9 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form 10 possible 3-stars each.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 possible 3-stars.
- Node 4, Node 6, and Node 7 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form 4 possible 3-stars each.
- Node 3 and Node 8 have 3 neighbors each, so they can form 1 possible 3-star each.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 44

Hence, we can put the final number inside brackets as [44].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 5)>
