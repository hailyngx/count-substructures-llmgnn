Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 19) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 18) (6, 12) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 8) (2, 17) (8, 1) (8, 2) (15, 10) (15, 19) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 13) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 4) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 17) (7, 3) (17, 2) (17, 16) (17, 18) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 9) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 18) (13, 10) (13, 16) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: {3, 8, 9, 16}
2: {11, 14, 17}
3: {1, 7, 19}
4: {9, 14, 19}
5: {6, 11, 18}
6: {5, 12, 18}
7: {3}
8: {1, 2}
9: {1, 4, 9, 18}
10: {13, 15, 16}
11: {2, 5, 12}
12: {6, 11, 18}
13: {10, 16}
14: {0, 2, 4}
15: {10, 19}
16: {1, 10, 13, 17}
17: {2, 16, 18}
18: {5, 6, 9, 12, 17}
19: {3, 4, 15}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 13, 15, 17, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each such node:
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 cannot form 3-star.
- Node 13 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6], and the unique 3-stars are:
<2, (11, 14, 17)>, <13, (10, 16, 17)>, <15, (10, 19, 15)>, <17, (2, 16, 18)>, <19, (3, 4, 15)>
