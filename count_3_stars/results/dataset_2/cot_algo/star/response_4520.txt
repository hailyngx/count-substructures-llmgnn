Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 12}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 11}
- Node 6: {4, 11, 12}
- Node 7: {1, 8, 14}
- Node 8: {2, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {4, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 4, 6, 10}
- Node 13: {2, 8, 10}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 11, 12} as <4, (1, 11, 12)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 3, 11} as <5, (1, 3, 11)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 13, 14} as <8, (2, 13, 14)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 12, 13} as <10, (4, 12, 13)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 6, 10} as <12, (4, 6, 10)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 7, 9} as <14, (1, 7, 9)>

There are 5 unique 3-stars in total, thus the final count is [5].
