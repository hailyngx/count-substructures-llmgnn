Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 24) (27, 18) (7, 21) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 20) (21, 8) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 16) (22, 18) (22, 28) (8, 21) (8, 23) (8, 11) (23, 8) (28, 21) (28, 22) (28, 26) (28, 25) (26, 28) (26, 25) (26, 0) (26, 17) (9, 29) (9, 2) (29, 9) (29, 13) (29, 0) (29, 3) (19, 17) (19, 12) (11, 8) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 17) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 14) (1, 25) (1, 12) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 14) (25, 28) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 10) (0, 15) (0, 26) (0, 29) (20, 21) (20, 6) (20, 10) (20, 16) (3, 29) (3, 5) (10, 25) (10, 20) (10, 5) (13, 7) (13, 29) (16, 18) (16, 20) (16, 6) (14, 24) (14, 2) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 11) (17, 4) (6, 20) (6, 16) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 10) (4, 11) (4, 17) (12, 15) (12, 19) (12, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {15, 26, 29}
- Node 1: {12, 25}
- Node 2: {7, 9, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 29}
- Node 4: {11, 17}
- Node 5: {7, 10, 15, 3}
- Node 6: {16, 20}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 13, 21}
- Node 8: {21, 11, 23}
- Node 9: {2, 29}
- Node 10: {5, 20, 25}
- Node 11: {8, 17, 24, 4}
- Node 12: {1, 15, 19}
- Node 13: {7, 29}
- Node 14: {2, 24}
- Node 15: {0, 5, 27, 12}
- Node 16: {6, 18, 20}
- Node 17: {4, 11, 26, 19}
- Node 18: {16, 27, 22}
- Node 19: {12, 17}
- Node 20: {6, 10, 16, 21}
- Node 21: {7, 20, 28, 8}
- Node 22: {18, 28}
- Node 23: {8}
- Node 24: {11, 14, 27}
- Node 25: {1, 10, 26, 28}
- Node 26: {0, 17, 25, 28}
- Node 27: {15, 18, 24}
- Node 28: {21, 22, 25, 26}
- Node 29: {0, 3, 9, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 15, 27, and 21 each have 4 neighbor nodes, so they can each form \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5, 7, 20, and 11 each have 4 neighbor nodes, so they can each form 4 3-stars.
- Node 12, 17, 25, 28, 18, and 0 each have 4 neighbor nodes, so they can each form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2, 24, 16, 10, 29, 26, and 4 each have 3 neighbor nodes, so they can each form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45].
