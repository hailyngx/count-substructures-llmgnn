Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 8) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {7, 10, 12, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 4, 11, 13, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 3, 12}
- Node 3: {14, 2, 12}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 14, 1, 2}
- Node 5: {8, 1, 4, 11, 10}
- Node 6: {7, 12, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 11, 13, 6}
- Node 8: {5, 0, 1, 6}
- Node 9: {10, 1}
- Node 10: {5, 9, 11, 0}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 10, 1}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 3, 6, 13}
- Node 13: {7, 14, 12, 1}
- Node 14: {4, 3, 13}

Now let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, therefore no 3-stars can be formed.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, therefore no 3-stars can be formed.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, therefore no 3-stars can be formed.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, therefore no 3-stars can be formed.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, therefore no 3-stars can be formed.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars:
\[ 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 62 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 10, 12)>, <0, (7, 10, 8)>, <0, (7, 12, 8)>, <0, (10, 12, 8)>, <1, (5, 11, 13)>, <1, (5, 4, 13)>, <1, (11, 7, 13)>, <1, (4, 7, 13)>, <1, (4, 11, 13)>, <4, (5, 7, 1)>, <4, (5, 14, 1)>, <4, (7, 11, 1)>, <4, (7, 14, 1)>, <5, (1, 11, 10)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>.
