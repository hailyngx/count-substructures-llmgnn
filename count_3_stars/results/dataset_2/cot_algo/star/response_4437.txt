Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 9) (1, 13) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 10) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 11) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 2) (19, 13) (19, 14) (9, 16) (9, 2) (12, 18) (12, 15) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 17) (15, 12) (15, 14) (18, 1) (18, 12) (14, 19) (14, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8, 11}
- Node 1: {7, 13, 18}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 9, 17}
- Node 3: {10}
- Node 4: {0, 8, 17}
- Node 5: {6, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 10, 11, 17}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 4}
- Node 9: {2, 16}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 6, 11}
- Node 11: {0, 6, 10, 16, 17}
- Node 12: {15, 18}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 7, 19}
- Node 14: {15, 19}
- Node 15: {12, 14}
- Node 16: {9, 11, 17}
- Node 17: {2, 4, 6, 11, 16}
- Node 18: {1, 12}
- Node 19: {13, 14}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1, 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2, 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6, 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 10, 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 11, 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 13, 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 15, 2 neighbors: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 16, 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 17, 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 19, 2 neighbors: [inom{2}{3}] = 0

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 0 = 34

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 8, 11)>
- <1, (7, 13, 18)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (5, 10, 13)>
- <6, (2, 10, 17)>
- <10, (3, 5, 6)>
- <11, (0, 6, 17)>
- <13, (1, 7, 19)>
- <17, (2, 6, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [34].
