Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (17, 9) (17, 1) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 14) (3, 1) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 13) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 8) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 15) (16, 7) (16, 6) (6, 1) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (19, 2) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 6) (8, 11) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 10}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 6, 17}
- Node 2: {1, 18, 19}
- Node 3: {1, 14}
- Node 4: {11, 13, 15}
- Node 5: {1, 12}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 11, 16}
- Node 7: {8, 13, 15, 16}
- Node 8: {6, 7, 11, 14, 18}
- Node 9: {0, 12, 14, 17}
- Node 10: {0, 12}
- Node 11: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 12: {5, 9, 10, 18}
- Node 13: {4, 7, 15}
- Node 14: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 15: {4, 7, 13}
- Node 16: {6, 7}
- Node 17: {1, 9}
- Node 18: {2, 8, 12}
- Node 19: {2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars formed: 10 + 10 + 4 = 24

Therefore, the final answer is [24].

Unique 3-stars found: <1, (2, 6, 17)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 18)>, <1, (3, 14, 17)>, <1, (3, 14, 8)>, <1, (5, 9, 12)>, <1, (5, 12, 18)>, <1, (9, 14, 17)>, <1, (9, 17, 18)>, <1, (12, 18, 10)>, <8, (6, 11, 14)>, <8, (6, 13, 15)>, <8, (6, 13, 7)>, <8, (6, 15, 7)>, <8, (6, 15, 13)>, <8, (6, 7, 13)>, <8, (11, 4, 15)>, <8, (11, 6, 15)>, <8, (11, 6, 7)>, <8, (13, 4, 7)>, <8, (13, 7, 15)>, <12, (5, 9, 10)>, <12, (9, 14, 17)>, <12, (9, 17, 18)>, <12, (12, 18, 10)>
