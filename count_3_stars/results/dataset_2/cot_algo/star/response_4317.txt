Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 10) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 11) (5, 7) (5, 16) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 6) (3, 18) (3, 13) (3, 17) (3, 16) (11, 18) (11, 4) (1, 12) (15, 9) (15, 8) (17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (6, 8) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 9) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 16) (10, 7) (10, 14) (8, 15) (8, 6) (16, 5) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {12, 14, 17}
- Node 1: {12}
- Node 2: {12, 18, 19}
- Node 3: {13, 16, 17, 18}
- Node 4: {11, 13, 18}
- Node 5: {7, 16}
- Node 6: {8, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 8: {6, 15}
- Node 9: {7, 15, 16, 19}
- Node 10: {7, 14}
- Node 11: {4, 18}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 6, 17}
- Node 14: {0, 6, 10, 19}
- Node 15: {8, 9}
- Node 16: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 17: {0, 3, 13}
- Node 18: {2, 3, 4, 11}
- Node 19: {2, 9, 14}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Counting the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <2, 12, 18, 19>
- <7, 5, 9, 10>
- <9, 7, 15, 16>
