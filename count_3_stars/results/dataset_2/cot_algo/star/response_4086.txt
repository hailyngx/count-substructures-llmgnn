Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 7 have 5 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>
