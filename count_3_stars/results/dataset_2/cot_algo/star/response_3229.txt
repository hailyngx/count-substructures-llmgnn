Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 14) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 14) (2, 13) (4, 14) (4, 13) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {11, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 5}
- Node 2: {13, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 4: {13, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 12, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {5, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 10, 12}
- Node 8: {3, 11, 5, 6, 0, 9}
- Node 9: {12, 0, 8, 14}
- Node 10: {11, 12, 7}
- Node 11: {1, 10, 14, 0, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {10, 11, 7, 5, 9}
- Node 13: {3, 0, 14, 2, 4}
- Node 14: {11, 9, 4, 2, 13}

Next, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars. These are:
- Node 0 (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 3 (has 5 neighbors)
- Node 5 (has 5 neighbors)
- Node 8 (has 6 neighbors)
- Node 9 (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 10 (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 11 (has 6 neighbors)
- Node 12 (has 5 neighbors)
- Node 13 (has 5 neighbors)
- Node 14 (has 5 neighbors)

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- 3-star count for Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-star count for Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-star count for Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-star count for Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- 3-star count for Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-star count for Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- 3-star count for Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-star count for Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-star count for Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is:
\[ 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 98 \]

Therefore, the final answer is [98].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 8, 9>
- <3, 5, 13>
- <3, 8, 13>
- <3, 13, 14>
- <5, 8, 12>
- <8, 11, 12>
- <8, 11, 14>
- <8, 12, 14>
- <11, 12, 14>
- <13, 14, 2>
