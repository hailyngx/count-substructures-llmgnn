Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {8, 6, 7, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 9, 1}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {8, 9, 0, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {4, 8, 2}
- Node 6: {4, 1, 0, 2}
- Node 7: {8, 1}
- Node 8: {4, 9, 5, 3, 1, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 8, 0, 2, 3}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 8 has inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 9 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 20 + 10 = 50.

Therefore, the answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (8, 9, 0)>
<4, (8, 9, 3)>
<4, (8, 5, 0)>
<4, (8, 5, 3)>
<4, (9, 0, 3)>
<8, (4, 9, 5)>
<8, (4, 9, 3)>
<8, (4, 5, 3)>
<9, (4, 8, 0)>
<9, (4, 8, 3)>
