Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 2) (4, 1) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 14) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 10
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6, 9, 12, 13
- Node 2: 0, 4, 8, 14
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2
- Node 5: 6, 12, 13
- Node 6: 1, 5, 8, 13
- Node 7: 9, 12, 14
- Node 8: 2, 3, 6, 7, 11, 13
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 7, 10, 14
- Node 10: 0, 9, 11, 14
- Node 11: 8, 10, 12
- Node 12: 1, 5, 7, 11, 13
- Node 13: 1, 5, 6, 8, 12
- Node 14: 2, 7, 9, 10

Following the procedure described in the prompt, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Summing up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 77 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [77], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 4, 9>
- <1, 5, 6, 13>
- <1, 6, 12, 13>
- <1, 7, 9, 14>
- <1, 12, 13, 14>
- <2, 8, 11, 13>
- <2, 9, 10, 14>
