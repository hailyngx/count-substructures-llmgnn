Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 13, 24
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8, 13
- Node 2: 16, 17, 25, 26
- Node 3: 12, 13, 21, 26
- Node 4: 12, 22
- Node 5: 1, 10, 20, 24
- Node 6: 16, 18, 22, 23, 25
- Node 7: 1, 29
- Node 8: 1, 11, 13, 19
- Node 9: 14
- Node 10: 5, 17, 18, 21
- Node 11: 8, 18, 19
- Node 12: 3, 4, 19, 25
- Node 13: 0, 1, 3, 8, 27
- Node 14: 9, 28
- Node 16: 2, 6, 16, 29
- Node 17: 2, 10
- Node 18: 6, 10, 11
- Node 19: 8, 11, 12, 27
- Node 20: 5
- Node 21: 3, 10
- Node 22: 4, 6, 22, 24, 26, 28
- Node 23: 6
- Node 24: 0, 5, 22, 28
- Node 25: 2, 6, 12
- Node 26: 2, 3, 22
- Node 27: 13, 19
- Node 28: 14, 22, 24, 29
- Node 29: 7, 16, 28

There are 24 nodes that have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the 3-stars for these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33]. Unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 7, 13>, <2, 16, 26>, <2, 17, 25>, <2, 17, 26>, <2, 25, 26>, <3, 12, 13>, <5, 1, 24>, <6, 16, 25>, <8, 1, 13>, <10, 5, 24>, <11, 8, 18>, <12, 3, 19>, <12, 4, 22>, <13, 0, 27>, <22, 6, 28>, <22, 16, 29>, <22, 24, 28>, <22, 26, 28>, <22, 26, 29>, <24, 0, 5>, <25, 2, 6>, <27, 13, 19>, <28, 14, 22>, <29, 16, 28>
