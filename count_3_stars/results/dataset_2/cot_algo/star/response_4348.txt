Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {1, 4, 5}
Node 1: {0, 5}
Node 2: {5, 6, 8}
Node 3: {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 4: {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 7}
Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 6}
Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: 0
Node 2: 3
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: 0

Total number of 3-stars: 0 + 3 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 0 = 53

So, the final result is [53].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
