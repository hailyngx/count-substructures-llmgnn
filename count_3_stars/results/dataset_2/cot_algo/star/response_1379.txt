Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {6, 2}
Node 1: {5, 9, 4, 8, 7}
Node 2: {9, 6, 7, 0}
Node 3: {6, 4, 7}
Node 4: {5, 8, 1, 3}
Node 5: {9, 1, 4}
Node 6: {9, 7, 3, 2, 0}
Node 7: {6, 8, 3, 2, 1}
Node 8: {9, 4, 7, 1}
Node 9: {5, 6, 8, 2, 1}

Now, we can easily see that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

Node 1: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 6: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 7: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 8: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 9: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 44 3-stars. Hence, the final answer is [44].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (5, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 4, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 4)>
<1, (4, 9, 8)>
<1, (9, 8, 4)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (5, 9, 8)>
<1, (9, 8, 5)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<6, (9, 3, 2)>
<6, (9, 2, 0)>
<6, (7, 3, 2)>
<6, (7, 2, 9)>
<6, (3, 2, 0)>
<7, (8, 3, 4)>
<7, (8, 1, 4)>
<7, (8, 1, 2)>
<7, (8, 4, 1)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (3, 4, 1)>
<7, (3, 6, 4)>
<7, (4, 1, 8)>
<7, (4, 1, 3)>

<8, (8, 1, 4)>
<8, (8, 1, 7)>
<8, (4, 1, 7)>
<9, (5, 8, 1)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>
<9, (5, 1, 4)>
<9, (8, 1, 4)>
<9, (5, 4, 9)>
<9, (5, 4, 8)>
<9, (5, 9, 8)>
<9, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (4, 8, 5)>
<9, (9, 8, 5)> 

These are the unique 3-stars formed in the given graph.
