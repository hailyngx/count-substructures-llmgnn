Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 22) (27, 18) (4, 7) (4, 25) (4, 11) (4, 29) (7, 4) (7, 29) (7, 10) (7, 22) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 29) (22, 27) (22, 7) (22, 18) (22, 23) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 5) (20, 25) (20, 10) (25, 4) (25, 20) (25, 8) (25, 0) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 6) (0, 25) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 14) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (1, 14) (1, 17) (1, 26) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 21) (3, 11) (3, 28) (3, 29) (11, 4) (11, 3) (16, 17) (16, 21) (28, 3) (8, 14) (8, 25) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) (19, 14) (21, 27) (21, 26) (21, 16) (21, 12) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 10) (29, 4) (29, 7) (29, 18) (29, 3) (29, 24) (24, 29) (24, 12) (12, 21) (12, 24) (13, 2) (13, 10) (6, 23) (6, 0) (10, 7) (10, 20) (10, 5) (10, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 6, 9, 25}
- Node 1: Neighbors {14, 17, 26}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 5, 13, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {11, 28, 29}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 11, 25, 29}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 10, 17}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 23}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 7, 10, 22, 29}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 14, 25}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 10: Neighbors {5, 7, 13, 20}
- Node 11: Neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 12: Neighbors {21, 24}
- Node 13: Neighbors {2, 10}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 2, 8, 19, 17}
- Node 15: Neighbors {27}
- Node 16: Neighbors {17, 21}
- Node 17: Neighbors {1, 5, 14, 16}
- Node 18: Neighbors {22, 27, 29}
- Node 19: Neighbors {14}
- Node 20: Neighbors {10, 25}
- Node 21: Neighbors {12, 16, 26, 27}
- Node 22: Neighbors {7, 18, 27, 23}
- Node 23: Neighbors {6, 22, 26}
- Node 24: Neighbors {12, 29}
- Node 25: Neighbors {0, 4, 8, 20}
- Node 26: Neighbors {1, 21, 23}
- Node 27: Neighbors {15, 18, 21, 22}
- Node 28: Neighbors {3}
- Node 29: Neighbors {4, 7, 18, 24, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 29

For these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 56

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [56]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, 14, 17>, <4, 7, 25>, <7, 4, 29>, <7, 10, 13>, <14, 8, 25>, <17, 1, 16>, 
<21, 12, 24>, <22, 7, 29>, <27, 18, 29>, <29, 3, 24>.
