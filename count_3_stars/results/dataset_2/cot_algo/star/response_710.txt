Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 16) (4, 14) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 16) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 16) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 0) (18, 11) (18, 0) (18, 7) (19, 12) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 7) (7, 18) (7, 11) (7, 13) (3, 9) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 13) (15, 4) (15, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 15) (0, 12) (10, 13) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 19) (12, 0) (1, 9) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 12, 15, 18}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {0, 8}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 8, 14, 15}
- Node 5: {6, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 13, 16}
- Node 7: {11, 13, 18}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 16}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 10: {13}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 14, 18}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 14, 19}
- Node 13: {6, 7, 10, 16}
- Node 14: {4, 11, 12, 17}
- Node 15: {0, 4}
- Node 16: {6, 8, 13, 17}
- Node 17: {14, 16}
- Node 18: {0, 7, 11}
- Node 19: {12}

Now, we need to identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors in order to form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, and 16 have 3 or more neighbors.

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: Only 1 3-star possible
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: Only 1 3-star possible
- Node 13: Only 1 3-star possible
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 4, 15)>, <4, (6, 14, 15)>, <5, (6, 9, 11)>, <6, (4, 13, 16)>, <12, (0, 14, 19)>, <13, (7, 16, 10)>, <16, (6, 8, 13)>.
