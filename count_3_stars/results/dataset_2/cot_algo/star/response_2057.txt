Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 8) (3, 16) (3, 1) (3, 4) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 14) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 5) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 0) (7, 17) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 7) (17, 2) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 18) (19, 12) (18, 15) (18, 19) (9, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 2) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 6) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 6) (12, 19) (12, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) 

Response:
Considering the given graph:

For node 0: Neighbors {2, 7}, no 3-star possible.
For node 1: Neighbors {3, 13, 14}, 1 3-star. 
For node 2: Neighbors {0, 6, 10, 17}, 1 3-star.
For node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 16}, 1 3-star.
For node 4: Neighbors {3, 5}, no 3-star possible.
For node 5: Neighbors {4, 8, 12}, 1 3-star.
For node 6: Neighbors {2, 10, 14}, 1 3-star.
For node 7: Neighbors {0, 17}, no 3-star possible.
For node 8: Neighbors {5, 13, 16, 19}, 1 3-star.
For node 9: Neighbors {14}, no 3-star possible.
For node 10: Neighbors {2, 6, 15, 19}, 1 3-star.
For node 11: Neighbors {16, 17}, no 3-star possible.
For node 12: Neighbors {5, 19}, no 3-star possible.
For node 13: Neighbors {1, 8, 14, 17}, 1 3-star.
For node 14: Neighbors {1, 6, 9, 13, 15}, 1 3-star.
For node 15: Neighbors {10, 14, 18}, 1 3-star.
For node 16: Neighbors {3, 8, 11}, 1 3-star.
For node 17: Neighbors {2, 7, 13, 17}, 1 3-star.
For node 18: Neighbors {15, 19}, no 3-star possible.
For node 19: Neighbors {8, 10, 12, 18}, 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 9
Therefore, the answer is [9].
Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 13, 14)>, <2, (6, 10, 17)>, <3, (1, 4, 16)>, <5, (8, 12, 5)>, <8, (13, 16, 19)>, <10, (2, 15, 6)>, <13, (1, 17, 14)>, <15, (14, 18, 15)>, <19, (10, 12, 8)>.
