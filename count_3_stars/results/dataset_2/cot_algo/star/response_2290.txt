Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
Node 2: 1, 4, 6
Node 3: 1, 4, 8
Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 7, 9
Node 5: 1, 7
Node 6: 0, 2, 7
Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 9
Node 9: 4, 7, 8

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 60, which we will represent as [60]. 

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, 1, 7>
- <1, 4, 7>
