Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 2) (15, 22) (15, 4) (2, 15) (2, 29) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 9) (4, 15) (4, 24) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 12) (9, 29) (9, 19) (22, 15) (22, 10) (26, 24) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 17) (28, 3) (28, 2) (28, 0) (28, 7) (24, 3) (24, 4) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 1) (7, 28) (7, 14) (7, 27) (25, 17) (25, 13) (20, 1) (17, 26) (17, 25) (17, 8) (17, 21) (23, 18) (23, 26) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 26) (11, 24) (11, 6) (11, 8) (1, 24) (1, 20) (1, 5) (1, 12) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 8) (8, 17) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 8) (21, 17) (21, 0) (19, 9) (19, 16) (19, 12) (27, 7) (27, 6) (13, 25) (13, 12) (13, 16) (12, 18) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 13) (12, 6) (16, 19) (16, 13) (5, 3) (5, 1) (6, 11) (6, 27) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {28, 21, 8}
- Node 1: {24, 20, 5, 12}
- Node 2: {15, 29, 28}
- Node 3: {15, 28, 24, 5}
- Node 4: {15, 24}
- Node 5: {3, 1}
- Node 6: {11, 27, 12}
- Node 7: {28, 14, 27}
- Node 8: {17, 11, 0, 14}
- Node 9: {29, 19}
- Node 10: {18, 22, 26}
- Node 11: {24, 8, 6}
- Node 12: {18, 1, 19, 13, 6}
- Node 13: {25, 12, 16}
- Node 14: {18, 7, 8}
- Node 15: {3, 2, 22, 4}
- Node 16: {19, 13}
- Node 17: {26, 25, 8, 21}
- Node 18: {23, 14, 10, 12}
- Node 19: {9, 16, 12}
- Node 20: {1}
- Node 21: {0, 17}
- Node 22: {15, 10}
- Node 23: {18, 26}
- Node 24: {3, 4, 26, 11, 1}
- Node 25: {17, 13}
- Node 26: {24, 23, 10, 17}
- Node 27: {7, 6}
- Node 28: {3, 2, 0, 7}
- Node 29: {2, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and count the total number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 18: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 24: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Total 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 47

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [47].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
