Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {4, 7, 8}
Node 1: {5, 6, 8, 3, 9}
Node 2: {4, 8}
Node 3: {5, 6, 1, 9, 8}
Node 4: {2, 6, 0}
Node 5: {9, 8, 1, 3, 7}
Node 6: {9, 1, 3, 4}
Node 7: {5, 0, 8}
Node 8: {5, 1, 3, 7, 2, 0}
Node 9: {5, 6, 3, 1}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
Node 8: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 
Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 

Summing up these results: 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 55

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 8, 9)> 
<3, (1, 5, 9)> 
<5, (1, 3, 9)> 
<6, (1, 3, 9)> 
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
