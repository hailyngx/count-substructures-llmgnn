Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 24) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 13) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 27) (21, 17) (6, 8) (6, 27) (9, 25) (9, 2) (9, 20) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (20, 9) (20, 13) (20, 10) (25, 9) (25, 17) (25, 19) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 24) (12, 23) (27, 21) (27, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 19) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 10) (28, 29) (28, 19) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 0) (10, 21) (10, 20) (10, 26) (10, 13) (10, 14) (0, 16) (0, 21) (0, 29) (19, 25) (19, 18) (19, 28) (23, 12) (23, 26) (23, 14) (17, 21) (17, 25) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (24, 16) (24, 12) (24, 8) (24, 4) (7, 29) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 22) (7, 13) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 24) (14, 10) (14, 23) (15, 7) (15, 22) (15, 4) (13, 1) (13, 20) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 7) (22, 7) (22, 15) (4, 24) (4, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {16, 21, 29}
- Node 1: {3, 13, 26}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 9, 18}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 12}
- Node 4: {15, 24}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {8, 27}
- Node 7: {5, 13, 15, 22, 29}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 24}
- Node 9: {2, 20, 25}
- Node 10: {13, 14, 20, 21, 26}
- Node 11: {16}
- Node 12: {3, 13, 24, 23}
- Node 13: {1, 7, 10, 12, 20}
- Node 14: {10, 23}
- Node 15: {4, 7, 22}
- Node 16: {0, 11, 24}
- Node 17: {21, 25}
- Node 18: {2, 19}
- Node 19: {18, 25, 28}
- Node 20: {9, 10, 13}
- Node 21: {0, 10, 17, 27}
- Node 22: {7, 15}
- Node 23: {12, 14, 26}
- Node 24: {8, 12, 16, 4}
- Node 25: {9, 17, 19}
- Node 26: {1, 10, 23}
- Node 27: {6, 21}
- Node 28: {19, 29}
- Node 29: {0, 7, 28}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 0, 11, 14, 17, 18, 22, 28
    - Total 3-stars: 7

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 16, 21, 29>
- <11, 16, 24>
- <14, 10, 23>
- <17, 21, 25>
- <18, 2, 19>
- <22, 7, 15>
- <28, 19, 29>
