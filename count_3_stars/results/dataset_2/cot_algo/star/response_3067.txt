Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 5, 8}

Next, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 48, so the answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 6>

- <1, 4, 5>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 7>

- <4, 5, 9>
- <4, 6, 8>
