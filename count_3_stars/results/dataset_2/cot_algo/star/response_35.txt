Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 28) (22, 15) (15, 22) (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 26) (27, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 23) (3, 6) (3, 19) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 12) (2, 9) (2, 20) (2, 4) (18, 20) (18, 12) (19, 3) (19, 26) (19, 29) (19, 14) (26, 27) (26, 19) (26, 20) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 0) (17, 9) (17, 21) (17, 7) (4, 2) (4, 25) (4, 6) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 25) (16, 21) (16, 24) (21, 13) (21, 17) (21, 16) (21, 29) (29, 19) (29, 1) (29, 21) (29, 7) (29, 11) (24, 16) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 29) (7, 14) (20, 2) (20, 18) (20, 26) (0, 1) (0, 11) (25, 8) (25, 1) (25, 4) (25, 12) (6, 27) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 11) (28, 22) (28, 14) (28, 23) (23, 9) (23, 28) (11, 13) (11, 29) (11, 0) (11, 6) (14, 5) (14, 19) (14, 7) (14, 28) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 25, 29}
- Node 2: {4, 9, 20}
- Node 3: {6, 19}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 25}
- Node 5: {7, 8, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 11, 27}
- Node 7: {5, 14, 17, 29}
- Node 8: {5, 12, 13, 25}
- Node 9: {2, 17, 23}
- Node 11: {0, 6, 13, 29}
- Node 12: {8, 18, 25}
- Node 13: {8, 11, 21, 22}
- Node 14: {5, 7, 19, 28}
- Node 15: {22, 27}
- Node 16: {21, 24}
- Node 17: {7, 9, 21}
- Node 18: {12, 20}
- Node 19: {3, 14, 26, 29}
- Node 20: {2, 18, 26}
- Node 21: {13, 16, 17, 29}
- Node 22: {13, 15, 28}
- Node 23: {9, 28}
- Node 24: {16}
- Node 25: {1, 4, 8, 12}
- Node 26: {19, 20, 27}
- Node 27: {6, 15, 26}
- Node 28: {14, 22, 23}
- Node 29: {1, 11, 14, 19, 21}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 1: [1]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 11: [3]
  - <0, 11, 29>
  - <6, 11, 29>
  - <11, 13, 29>
- Node 12: [1]
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 14: [1]
- Node 19: [1]
- Node 20: [1]
- Node 21: [1]
- Node 22: [1]
- Node 25: [1]
- Node 26: [1]
- Node 27: [1]
- Node 28: [1]
- Node 29: [1]

Total number of 3-stars: [17]
