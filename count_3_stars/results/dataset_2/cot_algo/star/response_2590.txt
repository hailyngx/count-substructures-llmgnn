Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 18) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 4) (8, 17) (8, 13) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 15) (10, 14) (10, 17) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 16) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 4) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 16) (11, 5) (15, 9) (15, 16) (19, 14) (19, 1) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 12) (7, 14) (7, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```plaintext
  0 -- 6 -- 1 -- 18 -- 17 -- 10 --14 -- 19
  |    |         |         |    |     |
  9 -- 4 -- 3 -- 7         8    |
       |                       | 
       15 -- 16 -- 12 -- 13-- 2
            |         |        |
            11        5        |
                               |
                               17
```

Now, let's calculate the neighbor nodes for each node:

0: {6}
1: {6, 18, 19}
2: {5, 12, 13, 16}
3: {4, 7, 16}
4: {3, 5, 9, 16, 18}
5: {2, 4, 11}
6: {0, 1, 9}
7: {3, 14}
8: {10, 13, 17}
9: {4, 6, 15}
10: {8, 14, 17}
11: {5}
12: {2, 13, 16}
13: {2, 8, 12, 17}
14: {7, 10, 17, 19}
15: {9, 16}
16: {3, 4, 12, 15}
17: {8, 10, 13, 14, 18}
18: {1, 4, 17}
19: {1, 14}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 4 forms a 3-star with the neighbors {3, 5, 16}
<4, (3, 5, 16)>

Node 13 forms a 3-star with the neighbors {2, 12, 17}
<13, (2, 12, 17)>

The total number of 3-stars is [2].
