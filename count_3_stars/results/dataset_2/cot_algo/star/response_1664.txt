Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 7) (11, 4) (11, 0) (14, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 11) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 8, 9, 4, 12, 11
- Node 1: 6, 9, 12, 2, 7
- Node 2: 5, 6, 9, 1, 3, 7
- Node 3: 6, 13, 12, 2, 10
- Node 4: 12, 0, 14, 11
- Node 5: 6, 2, 8
- Node 6: 5, 1, 3, 2, 0
- Node 7: 8, 1, 2, 10
- Node 8: 5, 0, 7
- Node 9: 2, 10, 1, 0
- Node 10: 13, 9, 3, 7
- Node 11: 4, 0
- Node 12: 13, 4, 0, 3, 1
- Node 13: 12, 3, 10
- Node 14: 4

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 0
- Node 10: 0
- Node 11: 0
- Node 12: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 13: 0
- Node 14: 0

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 20 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 12, 11)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 12, 11)>
<2, (4, 0, 14)>
<2, (4, 12, 11)>
<5, (6, 1, 3)>
<5, (6, 2, 9)>
<5, (6, 3, 13)>
<6, (1, 9, 12)>
<8, (5, 0, 7)>
