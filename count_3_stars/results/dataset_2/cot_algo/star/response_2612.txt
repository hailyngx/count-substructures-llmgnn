Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 14) (15, 13) (15, 12) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 5) (10, 16) (10, 14) (17, 16) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 8) (16, 10) (16, 17) (18, 9) (18, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (6, 0) (6, 8) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 7) (19, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (8, 6) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 1) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 13) (13, 15) (13, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Let's calculate the number of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {1, 6, 7, 8, 19} (Degree: 5)
Node 1: {0, 2, 7, 14} (Degree: 4)
Node 2: {1, 5} (Degree: 2)
Node 3: {11, 14} (Degree: 2)
Node 4: {11, 13, 19} (Degree: 3)
Node 5: {2, 7, 9, 10} (Degree: 4)
Node 6: {0, 8} (Degree: 2)
Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 19} (Degree: 4)
Node 8: {0, 6, 12, 18} (Degree: 4)
Node 9: {5, 12, 14, 18} (Degree: 4)
Node 10: {5, 14, 16} (Degree: 3)
Node 11: {3, 4, 19} (Degree: 3)
Node 12: {8, 9, 15} (Degree: 3)
Node 13: {4, 15} (Degree: 2)
Node 14: {1, 3, 9, 10} (Degree: 4)
Node 15: {12, 13} (Degree: 2)
Node 16: {10, 17} (Degree: 2)
Node 17: {16} (Degree: 1)
Node 18: {8, 9} (Degree: 2)
Node 19: {0, 4, 7, 11} (Degree: 4)

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 19

\( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 32\]

Therefore, there are a total of 32 unique 3-stars in this graph: <0, 7, 19>, <1, 0, 7>, <1, 0, 19>, <1, 7, 14>, <4, 11, 19>, <4, 13, 15>, <4, 19, 11>, <4, 19, 7>, <4, 7, 19>, <7, 0, 1>, <7, 0, 19>, <7, 1, 14>, <7, 19, 4>, <8, 12, 18>, <8, 18, 9>, <8, 9, 12>, <9, 12, 15>, <9, 14, 10>, <9, 14, 3>, <9, 14, 10>, <10, 14, 1>, <10, 14, 9>, <10, 16, 17>, <11, 19, 4>, <12, 15, 13>, <12, 8, 18>, <12, 9, 14>, <13, 15, 12>, <14, 1, 10>, <14, 1, 3>, <14, 9, 10>, <16, 10, 14>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32].
