Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 19) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 17) (12, 19) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (14, 18) (4, 16) (4, 18) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 15) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 2) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 2) (19, 9) (19, 12) (19, 2) (2, 13) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 19) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (8, 16) (8, 3) (6, 15) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 15}
- Node 2: {13, 15, 17, 19}
- Node 3: {8, 9, 10, 11, 17}
- Node 4: {8, 16, 18}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 13, 17}
- Node 6: {15}
- Node 7: {0, 10, 17}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 16}
- Node 9: {3, 10, 16, 19}
- Node 10: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 11: {3, 15, 16, 18}
- Node 12: {19}
- Node 13: {2, 5}
- Node 14: {18}
- Node 15: {1, 2, 6, 11}
- Node 16: {4, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 17: {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 18: {4, 11, 14}
- Node 19: {2, 9, 12}

Now, we'll identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22
So, the answer is [22]

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (8, 9, 11)>
<9, (3, 16, 19)>
<11, (3, 15, 16)>
<15, (1, 2, 6)>
