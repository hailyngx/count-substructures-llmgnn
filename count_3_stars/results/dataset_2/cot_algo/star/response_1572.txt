Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {5, 9}
Node 1: {5, 4, 6, 3}
Node 2: {4, 6, 3, 8}
Node 3: {9, 7, 1, 2, 8}
Node 4: {7, 1, 6, 2, 8}
Node 5: {9, 1, 0}
Node 6: {9, 4, 7, 1, 2}
Node 7: {4, 3, 6, 8}
Node 8: {4, 3, 7, 2}
Node 9: {5, 6, 3, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 1 and Node 3 have 5 neighbors, so each can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (5, 6, 4)>, <3, (9, 7, 2)>, and <6, (9, 4, 7)>.
