Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 1, 4, 7, and 9 each have 6 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 0 and 2 each have 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 and 8 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 5 and 6 each have 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 20 \times 4 + 10 \times 2 = 100 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [100], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
