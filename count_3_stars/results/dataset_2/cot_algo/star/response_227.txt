Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Node 1: {2, 5, 6, 8}
Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 9}
Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 7}
Node 4: {0, 5, 6}
Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 7: {0, 3, 9}
Node 8: {1, 6}
Node 9: {2, 5, 6, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 5, Node 6, Node 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 44 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [44] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <9, (2, 5, 7)>
