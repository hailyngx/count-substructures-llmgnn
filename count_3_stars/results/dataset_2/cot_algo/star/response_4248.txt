Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 14) 

Response:
The graph described has the following neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 1: {8, 9, 12}
- Node 2: {5, 11, 12}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 10}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 6, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 12}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {10, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 11, 13}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 6, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 8, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 13}
- Node 13: {8, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {7, 9, 10, 11, 13}

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 9, Node 12, and Node 14

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 62 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [62].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 5, 12)>
- <5, (0, 2, 12)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 1, 14)>
- <12, (1, 4, 13)>
- <14, (7, 9, 10)>
