Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 6, 9
Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 7
Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 7
Node 5: 1, 2, 7
Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Node 8: 2, 3, 9
Node 9: 0, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the 3-stars formed: 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 55

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
