Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 neighbors: 1, 3, 11, 7, 4, 8
- Node 1 neighbors: 0, 12, 7
- Node 2 neighbors: 5, 3, 10, 13
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 14, 2
- Node 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 6, 0, 13
- Node 5 neighbors: 9, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6 neighbors: 11, 14, 4, 13
- Node 7 neighbors: 5, 1, 12, 0
- Node 8 neighbors: 9, 0, 14
- Node 9 neighbors: 5, 8, 4, 10, 12
- Node 10 neighbors: 9, 2, 14
- Node 11 neighbors: 14, 0, 6
- Node 12 neighbors: 9, 1, 7, 14
- Node 13 neighbors: 6, 2, 4
- Node 14 neighbors: 3, 10, 11, 12, 6, 8

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node with more than 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \text{inom}{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \text{inom}{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 76 3-stars.
Therefore, the final answer is [76], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 7, 12>, <0, 7, 1>, <2, 13, 4>, <5, 2, 10>, <5, 2, 3>, <5, 2, 13>, <9, 5, 4>, <9, 5, 7>, <9, 5, 8>, <9, 5, 10>, <9, 12, 7>, <9, 12, 1>, <9, 10, 14>, <12, 7, 1>, <12, 7, 14>, <12, 14, 10>, <14, 0, 11>, <14, 0, 6>
