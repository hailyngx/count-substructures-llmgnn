Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 8, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7, 3, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 7, 8, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 1, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 7, 8, 1, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 8, 0, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 4, 6, 2, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 4, 1, 3, 2, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 4, 2, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 58

So, the final answer is [58].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (5, 8, 2)>
- <1, (4, 7, 3)>
- <2, (9, 7, 8)>
- <4, (7, 1, 8)>
- <7, (5, 4, 2)>
- <8, (5, 4, 3)>
