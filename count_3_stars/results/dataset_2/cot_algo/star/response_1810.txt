Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 13) (3, 0) (3, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 11) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 12, 10, 11}
- Node 1: {9, 13}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 12, 10, 11, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 8, 11, 4}
- Node 6: {5, 13, 7, 11, 4}
- Node 7: {8, 6, 10}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 2, 10, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 14, 10, 1}
- Node 10: {9, 8, 13, 2, 0, 7}
- Node 11: {5, 6, 2, 0, 14}
- Node 12: {2, 0}
- Node 13: {1, 10, 6}
- Node 14: {9, 11}

Now, we need to find nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 2: 6 choose 3 = 20
- Node 4: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 5: 6 choose 3 = 20
- Node 6: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 8: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 9: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 10: 6 choose 3 = 20
- Node 11: 5 choose 3 = 10

Summing these up: 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 108

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [108].

The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 10, 11)>, <2, (5, 8, 11)>, <2, (5, 8, 10)>, <2, (5, 11, 10)>, <2, (8, 11, 10)>, <4, (5, 6, 2)>, <5, (9, 8, 4)>, <5, (9, 4, 6)>, <5, (8, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 8, 4)>, <6, (5, 2, 11)>, <8, (9, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (5, 10, 1)>, <10, (8, 13, 2)>.
