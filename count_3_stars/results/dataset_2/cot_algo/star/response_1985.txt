Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 25) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 15) (22, 24) (22, 12) (20, 29) (20, 26) (20, 2) (25, 18) (25, 15) (25, 21) (8, 5) (8, 0) (23, 4) (23, 17) (3, 21) (3, 5) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 29) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 6) (17, 23) (17, 27) (29, 20) (29, 0) (29, 19) (29, 26) (21, 25) (21, 3) (21, 12) (21, 14) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 16) (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 10) (15, 28) (19, 29) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 9) (6, 7) (24, 22) (24, 11) (24, 4) (12, 22) (12, 21) (12, 16) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 5) (26, 20) (26, 29) (14, 21) (14, 16) (14, 2) (2, 20) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 2) (1, 27) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 16) (4, 23) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 2) (4, 28) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 13) (9, 11) (9, 19) (28, 15) (28, 4) (13, 19) (13, 27) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {8, 7, 29}
- Node 1: {2, 27}
- Node 2: {20, 14, 4}
- Node 3: {21, 5}
- Node 4: {23, 19, 24, 2, 28}
- Node 5: {8, 3, 10, 16}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {11, 0, 6}
- Node 8: {5, 0}
- Node 9: {11, 19}
- Node 10: {15, 5, 16}
- Node 11: {7, 24, 9}
- Node 12: {22, 21, 16}
- Node 13: {19, 27}
- Node 14: {21, 16, 2}
- Node 15: {22, 25, 10, 28}
- Node 16: {10, 12, 14, 5}
- Node 17: {23, 27}
- Node 18: {22, 25}
- Node 19: {29, 4, 13, 9}
- Node 20: {29, 26, 2}
- Node 21: {25, 3, 12, 14}
- Node 22: {18, 27, 15, 24, 12}
- Node 23: {4, 17}
- Node 24: {22, 11, 4}
- Node 25: {18, 15, 21}
- Node 26: {20, 29}
- Node 27: {22, 17, 1, 13}
- Node 28: {15, 4}
- Node 29: {20, 0, 19, 26}

Next, we check nodes that have three or more neighbors to see if they can form a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <0, 7, 29>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <2, 20, 14>
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars: <4, 23, 19>, <4, 23, 24>, <4, 23, 28>, <4, 19, 24>, <4, 19, 13>, <4, 19, 28>, <4, 24, 28>, <4, 24, 28>, <4, 13, 27>, <4, 28, 15>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <5, 8, 3>, <5, 8, 10>, <5, 8, 16>, <5, 3, 10>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <7, 11, 0>
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <10, 15, 5>
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <11, 24, 7>
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <12, 22, 21>
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <14, 21, 16>
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <15, 22, 25>, <15, 22, 28>, <15, 25, 28>, <15, 10, 16>
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <16, 10, 5>, <16, 10, 14>, <16, 14, 2>, <16, 14, 5>
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <19, 29, 4>, <19, 29, 13>, <19, 29, 9>, <19, 4, 13>
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <20, 29, 2>
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <21, 25, 12>, <21, 25, 14>, <21, 12, 14>, <21, 12, 16>
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars: <22, 18, 27>, <22, 18, 15>, <22, 18, 24>, <22, 18, 12>, <22, 27, 17>, <22, 27, 13>, <22, 15, 24>, <22, 15, 12>, <22, 24, 12>, <22, 12, 16>
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <24, 22, 11>
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <27, 22, 17>, <27, 22, 13>, <27, 17, 1>, <27, 17, 13>
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <29, 20, 26>, <29, 20, 2>, <29, 20, 4>, <29, 26, 2>

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors, the total number of unique 3-stars is [26].
