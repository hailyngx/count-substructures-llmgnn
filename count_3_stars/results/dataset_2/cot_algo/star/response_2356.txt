Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 4) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 10) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 10) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 13) (12, 1) (12, 6) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 9) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 11, 13, 14
- Node 1: 3, 9, 12
- Node 2: 3, 6, 9, 10
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 3, 10, 11
- Node 5: 3, 10
- Node 6: 2, 8, 12, 13
- Node 7: 0, 3, 10, 11, 13, 14
- Node 8: 6, 10, 14
- Node 9: 1, 2, 11, 13
- Node 10: 4, 5, 7, 8, 2
- Node 11: 0, 4, 7, 9, 14
- Node 12: 1, 6
- Node 13: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 14: 0, 7, 8, 11

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 11, 13)>, <7, (0, 10, 11)>, <10, (4, 7, 8)>, <11, (0, 4, 7)>
