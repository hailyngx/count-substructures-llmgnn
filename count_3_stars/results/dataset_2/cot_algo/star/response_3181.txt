Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9, 2, 3
- Node 1: 4, 7
- Node 2: 4, 7, 6, 0, 3
- Node 3: 9, 4, 8, 2, 0
- Node 4: 5, 7, 8, 1, 3, 2
- Node 5: 8, 4, 0
- Node 6: 9, 7, 2, 0
- Node 7: 4, 6, 2, 1
- Node 8: 5, 4, 3
- Node 9: 6, 3, 0

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([10 + 10 + 10 + 20] = [50]\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>,
<2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 1)>, <2, (3, 7, 1)>, <2, (4, 7, 1)>,
<3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 1)>.
