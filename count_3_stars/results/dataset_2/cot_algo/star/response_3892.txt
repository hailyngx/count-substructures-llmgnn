Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 1) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, the nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: (10, 6, 12, 8)
- Node 1: (5, 6, 4, 2)
- Node 2: (6, 12, 4, 1)
- Node 3: (11, 5, 7, 9, 8)
- Node 4: (1, 2, 9)
- Node 5: (6, 1, 3, 13)
- Node 6: (5, 1, 2, 0)
- Node 7: (3, 13, 9, 8)
- Node 8: (0, 12, 7, 3)
- Node 9: (4, 12, 14, 7, 3)
- Node 10: (11, 0, 14)
- Node 11: (10, 3, 13, 14, 12)
- Node 12: (11, 2, 0, 8, 9)
- Node 13: (11, 5, 7)
- Node 14: (10, 11, 9)

To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes is a part of.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 62 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [62].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (10, 12, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 4)>, <2, (6, 12, 4)>, <3, (11, 8, 7)>, <5, (6, 1, 3)>, <9, (12, 14, 7)>, <11, (13, 14, 12)>, <13, (11, 7, 5)>, <14, (10, 9, 11)>.
