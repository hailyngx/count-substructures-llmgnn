Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 11) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (0, 2) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 1) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {2}
Node 1: {7, 10, 11, 13, 14}
Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 10, 12, 14}
Node 3: {2, 6, 10, 14}
Node 4: {6, 7, 10, 11, 12}
Node 5: {2, 6, 12, 14}
Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 8, 11}
Node 7: {1, 4, 11, 12, 13}
Node 8: {6}
Node 9: {11}
Node 10: {1, 2, 3, 4, 13}
Node 11: {1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12}
Node 12: {2, 4, 5, 7, 11}
Node 13: {1, 7, 10}
Node 14: {1, 2, 3, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 2: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 11: [inom{7}{3}] = 35
Node 12: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 35 + 10 + 4 = 117

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [117], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (11, 13, 14)>, <2, (10, 12, 14)>, <3, (2, 5, 14)>, <4, (6, 10, 11)>, <5, (2, 12, 14)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 11, 13)>, <10, (1, 2, 13)>, <11, (1, 4, 7)>, <12, (4, 5, 7)>, <14, (1, 2, 3)>
