Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 5, 9, 7, 2
- Node 1: 9, 3, 2, 8
- Node 2: 9, 1, 4, 6, 0, 7
- Node 3: 5, 1
- Node 4: 5, 8, 2
- Node 5: 9, 8, 4, 0, 3
- Node 6: 8, 7, 2
- Node 7: 8, 6, 0, 2
- Node 8: 5, 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 5, 2, 1, 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 52, so the final answer is [52].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 7, 2>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 9, 5>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <2, 9, 5>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <5, 8, 9>
