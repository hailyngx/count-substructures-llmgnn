Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 5) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 0) (15, 13) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (5, 16) (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 19) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 2) (8, 16) (8, 10) (6, 11) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 13) (1, 14) (1, 17) (1, 0) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 18) (19, 17) (19, 9) (19, 4) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 10) (0, 15) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (7, 9) 

Response:
The graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to first determine the neighbor set for each node. 

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 10, 15}
- Node 1: {0, 14, 17}
- Node 2: {4, 11, 12, 14, 18}
- Node 3: {10, 12}
- Node 4: {2, 9, 14, 19}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 16}
- Node 6: {11}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {10, 16}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 7, 19}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 8, 12}
- Node 11: {2, 6, 14, 16, 18}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 10}
- Node 13: {5, 17, 18}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 4, 11}
- Node 15: {0, 13}
- Node 16: {5, 8, 11}
- Node 17: {1, 13, 19}
- Node 18: {2, 11, 13}
- Node 19: {4, 9, 17}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 33 \). 

So, the final answer is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (4, 11, 18)>, <4, (2, 9, 19)>, <9, (4, 5, 19)>, <10, (0, 12, 8)>, <11, (2, 14, 16)>, <13, (5, 17, 18)>
