Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 10) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 6) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first list out the neighbors for each node:

1: {4, 7, 3, 14, 0}
2: {5, 9, 0, 14, 10}
3: {4, 1, 10, 6}
4: {3, 14, 1}
5: {9, 6, 2, 11, 10, 14}
6: {5, 7, 3, 13, 11, 12}
7: {11, 6, 10, 8, 1}
8: {9, 7}
9: {5, 8, 2, 11, 13}
10: {5, 7, 3, 2}
11: {5, 9, 7, 6}
12: {6, 0}
13: {9, 6}
14: {5, 4, 1, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed by each one:

1. Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
4. Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
5. Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars: <5, (2, 9, 14)>, <5, (6, 11, 10)>, <5, (2, 10, 14)>
6. Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars: <6, (5, 7, 3)>, <6, (5, 13, 9)>, <6, (11, 7, 10)>
7. Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
10. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
11. Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph = 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 80

Therefore, the final answer is [80].
