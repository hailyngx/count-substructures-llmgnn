Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 9} -> <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 7} -> <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 6} -> <9, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 4, 6} -> <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 9} -> <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 9} -> <7, (2, 4, 9)>

There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [6].
