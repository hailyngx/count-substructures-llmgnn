Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 8}
Node 1: {5, 6, 8, 9}
Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 6}
Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
Node 6: {1, 3, 5}
Node 7: {2, 4}
Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 9}
Node 9: {1, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 4: has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1: has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42

Thus, the final answer is [42]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (5, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 2, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
