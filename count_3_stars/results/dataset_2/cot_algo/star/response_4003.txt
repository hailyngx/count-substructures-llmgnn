Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 13) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 1) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 1) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first calculate the number of neighbors for each node and then determine the number of 3-stars in the graph.

The number of neighbors for each node is as follows:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 3, 4, 8, and 10 have 5 neighbors, so each can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1, 2, 12, and 14 have 4 neighbors, so each can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 \times 4 + 4 \times 10 = 64 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [64]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 10)>
<(6, 9, 12), 8>
<10, (2, 3, 4)>
<(1, 2, 14), 12>
<(2, 5, 11), 10>
