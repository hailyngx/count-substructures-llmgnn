Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 0) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 9, 10}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 8, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 8, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 5, 10, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors {6, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {8, 9, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 10}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 5, 7}

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14

For nodes with 3 neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For 3 neighbors, there is exactly 1 3-star.
- Total number of 3-stars = 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <5, (1, 8, 14)>
- <6, (1, 10, 11)>
- <7, (0, 9, 14)>
- <8, (4, 5, 12)>
- <9, (3, 11, 12)>
- <10, (3, 6, 13)>
- <11, (6, 9, 10)>
- <12, (8, 9, 11)>
- <14, (0, 5, 7)>
