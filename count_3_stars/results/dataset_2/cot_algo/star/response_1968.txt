Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 12) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (12, 11) (12, 1) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 13) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 4) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {9, 2, 4}
- Node 1: {5, 12, 14, 13, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 7, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 6, 13, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 10, 13, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 1, 4, 3}
- Node 6: {10, 11, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {10, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {10, 3, 14, 7, 6, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 2, 10, 0}
- Node 10: {9, 6, 8, 7, 4}
- Node 11: {6, 12}
- Node 12: {11, 1}
- Node 13: {3, 14, 1, 4}
- Node 14: {8, 1, 13}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 20 = 34 \), so the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (5, 12, 14)>, <1, (5, 14, 13)>, <1, (5, 13, 8)>, <1, (12, 14, 13)>, <1, (12, 14, 8)>, <1, (14, 13, 8)>, <4, (5, 10, 13)>, <4, (5, 13, 1)>, <4, (5, 13, 8)>, <4, (10, 13, 1)>, <4, (13, 1, 8)>, <8, (10, 3, 14)>, <8, (10, 3, 7)>, <8, (10, 3, 6)>, <8, (10, 14, 7)>, <8, (10, 14, 6)>, <8, (10, 7, 6)>, <8, (3, 14, 7)>, <8, (3, 14, 6)>, <8, (3, 7, 6)>, <8, (14, 7, 6)>.
