Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 10) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 1) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 14) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {7, 8, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 9, 10}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 8, 10}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 13}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 4, 5, 13}
- Node 11: {6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 7, 11}
- Node 13: {8, 10, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 11}

By examining the neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 11, and 14 have 3 or more neighbors, thus potentially forming 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 55 \).

So, the final number to be put inside brackets is [55], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 10>, <0, 4, 10>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 10, 12>, <2, 4, 10>, <2, 4, 11>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 11>, <4, 5, 10>, <4, 5, 14>, <5, 6, 11>, <5, 8, 13>, <11, 12, 14>
