Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 2) (16, 10) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 18) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 17) (8, 13) (8, 19) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 18) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 5) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 19) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 10) (12, 3) (12, 19) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 18) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 14) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 1) (9, 18) (9, 2) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 9) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 5) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 0) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 17}
- Node 1: {6, 15, 18}
- Node 2: {0, 9, 16}
- Node 3: {12, 14, 18}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 11, 19}
- Node 5: {0, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 15}
- Node 7: {10}
- Node 8: {13, 19}
- Node 9: {2, 18}
- Node 10: {5, 7, 16, 17}
- Node 11: {4, 13}
- Node 12: {3, 19}
- Node 13: {8, 11, 18}
- Node 14: {3, 5, 19}
- Node 15: {1, 6, 17}
- Node 16: {2, 10}
- Node 17: {0, 10, 15, 19}
- Node 18: {1, 3, 9, 13}
- Node 19: {4, 8, 12, 14, 17}

Next, we will check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 4, Node 10, Node 15, and Node 17 each have 4 neighbors, so we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 unique 3-stars with these nodes.

Putting it all together, the total number of unique 3-stars formed is [20]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 6, 19)>
<10, (5, 16, 17)>
<15, (1, 6, 17)>
<17, (0, 10, 15)>
