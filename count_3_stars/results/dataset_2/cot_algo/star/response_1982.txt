Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 17) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 12) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 2) (19, 15) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 0) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 19) (11, 1) (11, 18) (16, 3) (16, 17) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 16) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 18) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 13) (0, 19) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {19}
- Node 1: {11, 14}
- Node 2: {6, 10}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 15, 16, 18}
- Node 4: {7, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 6: {2, 5}
- Node 7: {4, 9, 14}
- Node 8: {3, 9, 17}
- Node 9: {7, 8, 12}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 13, 19}
- Node 11: {1, 18, 19}
- Node 12: {5, 9, 13}
- Node 13: {10, 12, 14, 18}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 7, 13}
- Node 15: {3, 17, 19}
- Node 16: {3, 17}
- Node 17: {8, 15, 16}
- Node 18: {3, 11, 13}
- Node 19: {0, 10, 15, 11}

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors or more: 3, 5, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 (10 nodes)
- Number of 3-stars for each node: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \) (for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 \times 1 = 10 \), which we can represent as [10].

List of unique 3-stars:
<3, 5, 8>
<5, 3, 6>
<10, 13, 18>
<13, 10, 14>
<14, 13, 18>
<15, 3, 17>
<16, 3, 17>
<17, 15, 19>
<18, 3, 11>
<19, 15, 11>
