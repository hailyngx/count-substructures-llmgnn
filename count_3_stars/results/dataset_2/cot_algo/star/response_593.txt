Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 10) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 12) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 4) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {14, 7, 4}
- Node 1: {14, 11, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {14, 13, 12, 10, 4}
- Node 3: {5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 14, 2, 11, 10}
- Node 5: {6, 13, 8, 12, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 10}
- Node 7: {0, 10, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 12, 11}
- Node 9: {11, 3, 13}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 1, 2, 12, 4}
- Node 11: {9, 1, 8, 4}
- Node 12: {5, 13, 1, 2, 10, 8}
- Node 13: {5, 9, 12, 2}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 4, 2}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 78

Therefore, the final answer is [78].
