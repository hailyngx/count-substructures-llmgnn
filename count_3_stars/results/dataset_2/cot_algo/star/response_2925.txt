This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 28) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 25) (9, 21) (1, 3) (1, 29) (1, 23) (1, 22) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 22) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 27) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 27) (0, 17) (0, 2) (20, 26) (20, 24) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 18) (2, 28) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 17) (18, 25) (7, 16) (7, 23) (12, 15) (12, 26) (26, 20) (26, 12) (26, 24) (28, 5) (28, 2) (24, 20) (24, 26) (24, 22) (15, 10) (15, 12) (15, 25) (15, 29) (15, 4) (4, 15) (16, 5) (16, 7) (16, 23) (21, 9) (21, 22) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 19) (29, 1) (29, 15) (25, 9) (25, 18) (25, 15) (27, 10) (27, 11) (27, 14) (14, 27) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 23) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 22) (23, 1) (23, 7) (23, 16) (23, 19) (22, 1) (22, 3) (22, 24) (22, 21) (22, 17) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {17, 2}
Node 1 neighbors: {3, 29, 23, 22, 18}
Node 2 neighbors: {13, 0, 18, 28}
Node 3 neighbors: {1, 6, 22}
Node 4 neighbors: {15}
Node 5 neighbors: {9, 28, 16}
Node 6 neighbors: {3, 10, 19}
Node 7 neighbors: {16, 23}
Node 8 neighbors: {13, 11, 18}
Node 9 neighbors: {5, 25, 21}
Node 10 neighbors: {11, 15, 6, 27}
Node 11 neighbors: {8, 10, 27}
Node 12 neighbors: {15, 26}
Node 13 neighbors: {8, 2, 19}
Node 14 neighbors: {27}
Node 15 neighbors: {10, 12, 25, 29, 4}
Node 16 neighbors: {5, 7, 23}
Node 17 neighbors: {0, 18, 22}
Node 18 neighbors: {1, 8, 2, 17, 25}
Node 19 neighbors: {13, 6, 23}
Node 20 neighbors: {26, 24}
Node 21 neighbors: {9, 22}
Node 22 neighbors: {1, 3, 24, 21, 17}
Node 23 neighbors: {1, 7, 16, 19}
Node 24 neighbors: {20, 26, 22}
Node 25 neighbors: {9, 18, 15}
Node 26 neighbors: {20, 12, 24}
Node 27 neighbors: {10, 11, 14}
Node 28 neighbors: {5, 2}
Node 29 neighbors: {1, 15}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 29 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 29, 23>, <1, 29, 15>, <1, 23, 18>, <1, 23, 17>, <1, 22, 18>, <1, 22, 17>, <1, 18, 17>, <1, 13, 2>, <1, 8, 18>, <1, 3, 22>, <2, 13, 19>, <2, 18, 25>, <3, 6, 19>, <8, 11, 27>, <10, 15, 29>, <15, 25, 9>, <15, 25, 18>, <18, 25, 9>, <16, 5, 7>, <16, 5, 23>, <16, 7, 23>, <17, 18, 25>, <22, 21, 9>, <22, 21, 5>, <22, 23, 19>, <22, 24, 20>, <23, 16, 7>, <23, 16, 19>, <23, 7, 19>, <24, 26, 20>, <28, 5, 2>
