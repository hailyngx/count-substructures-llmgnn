Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 4, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 7, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 0}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 6, 2, 1, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 7, 2, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 6, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 1, 3, 7, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 0}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors (3, 4, 8) <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 7, 8) <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 3, 7) <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors (5, 6, 8) <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 3, 7) <8, (1, 3, 7)>

Since each of these nodes has exactly 3 neighbors forming a 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
