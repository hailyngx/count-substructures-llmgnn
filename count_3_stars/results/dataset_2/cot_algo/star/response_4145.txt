Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 11) (7, 9) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 1) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 3) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 16) (0, 6) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 19) (1, 10) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 19) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (18, 14) (18, 15) (19, 16) (19, 1) (12, 6) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 11) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 8) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 15) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 11) (15, 13) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 15) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 5, 10, 16, 6
- Node 1: 10, 6, 14, 19
- Node 2: 5, 16, 11
- Node 3: 17, 13, 8
- Node 4: 11
- Node 5: 2, 17, 0
- Node 6: 0, 1, 12, 8
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 10, 6, 3
- Node 9: 11, 7, 13
- Node 10: 17, 0, 8, 1
- Node 11: 9, 4, 2, 15
- Node 12: 6
- Node 13: 9, 3, 14, 15
- Node 14: 1, 18, 15, 13
- Node 15: 18, 14, 11, 13
- Node 16: 0, 2, 19
- Node 17: 5, 10, 3
- Node 18: 14, 15
- Node 19: 16, 1

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 1: 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars
- Node 2: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 3: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 6: 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 9: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 10: 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars
- Node 11: 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars
- Node 13: 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars
- Node 14: 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars
- Node 15: 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars
- Node 16: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 17: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 18: 2 neighbors
- Node 19: 2 neighbors

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 34

Therefore, the final result is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (5, 10, 16)>
- <1, (6, 10, 14)>
- <1, (6, 10, 19)>
- <1, (10, 14, 19)>
- <2, (5, 16, 11)>
- <3, (17, 13, 8)>
- <6, (0, 8, 10)>
- <6, (1, 8, 10)>
- <6, (8, 10, 14)>
- <6, (10, 14, 19)>
- <8, (0, 10, 6)>
- <9, (11, 13, 9)>
- <10, (0, 8, 6)>
- <10, (1, 8, 6)>
- <10, (6, 8, 14)>
- <10, (6, 14, 19)>
- <11, (2, 15, 11)>
- <13, (15, 14, 13)>
- <13, (15, 15, 13)>
- <13, (15, 18, 13)>
- <13, (15, 15, 13)>
