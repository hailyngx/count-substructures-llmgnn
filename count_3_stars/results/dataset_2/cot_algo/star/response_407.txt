Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 4, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 1 and Node 2 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars each.
- Node 3, Node 5, and Node 8 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars each.
- The total number of 3-stars is \(10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32\).

Therefore, the final answer is [32], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
