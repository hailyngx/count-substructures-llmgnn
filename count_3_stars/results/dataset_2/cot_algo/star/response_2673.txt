Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we will identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 7}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with more than 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 58 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [58], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 2)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
