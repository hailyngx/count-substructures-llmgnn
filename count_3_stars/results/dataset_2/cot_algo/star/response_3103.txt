Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 13) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 19) (1, 3) (1, 18) (12, 14) (18, 4) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 17) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 9) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 6) (9, 15) (9, 18) (9, 8) (9, 0) (13, 15) (13, 17) (0, 11) (0, 17) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 18) (10, 5) (10, 0) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 19) (14, 16) (14, 12) (14, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 11, 17, 9, 10
- Node 1: 3, 18
- Node 2: 16, 5, 14
- Node 3: 15, 1, 4
- Node 4: 3, 7, 18
- Node 5: 2, 19, 10
- Node 6: 15, 17, 19
- Node 7: 16, 4, 19
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 15, 18, 8, 0
- Node 10: 18, 5, 0
- Node 11: 16, 0
- Node 12: 14
- Node 13: 15, 17
- Node 14: 16, 12, 2
- Node 15: 3, 9, 6, 13
- Node 16: 11, 7, 2, 14
- Node 17: 18, 13, 6, 0
- Node 18: 4, 1, 9, 10, 17
- Node 19: 7, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 16: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 18: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 27

Therefore, the final answer is [27], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (9, 10, 17)>
- <4, (3, 7, 18)>
- <15, (9, 13, 17)>
- <16, (2, 14, 7)>
- <17, (0, 6, 18)>
- <18, (1, 10, 17)>
- <18, (4, 9, 10)>
