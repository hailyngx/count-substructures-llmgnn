Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 15) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 14) (19, 4) (19, 10) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 7) (4, 19) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 6) (1, 2) (6, 12) (6, 14) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 16) (7, 2) (7, 17) (7, 9) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 16) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 11) (15, 8) (18, 14) (18, 10) (10, 19) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 18) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
First, let's start by finding the neighbor nodes of each node:

Node 0: {4, 11, 12}
Node 1: {2}
Node 2: {1, 7, 8}
Node 3: {5, 16}
Node 4: {0, 9, 10, 12, 19}
Node 5: {3, 13, 17}
Node 6: {12, 14}
Node 7: {2, 9, 17}
Node 8: {2, 15}
Node 9: {4, 7, 11, 13, 16}
Node 10: {4, 14, 18, 19}
Node 11: {0, 9, 14}
Node 12: {0, 4, 6, 13}
Node 13: {5, 9, 12, 14, 17}
Node 14: {6, 10, 11, 13, 18}
Node 15: {8}
Node 16: {3, 9}
Node 17: {5, 7, 13}
Node 18: {10, 14}
Node 19: {4, 10}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

Nodes with 3 neighbors or more: 
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 57

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [57].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 11, 12)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 9, 10)>, <9, (4, 11, 13)>, <10, (4, 14, 18)>, <12, (0, 4, 13)>, <13, (9, 12, 14)>, <14, (6, 10, 18)>, <17, (5, 7, 13)>
