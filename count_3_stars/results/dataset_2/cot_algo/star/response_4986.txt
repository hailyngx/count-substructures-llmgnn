Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 17) (16, 4) (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 19) (10, 11) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 17) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 18) (13, 14) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 6) (2, 15) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (15, 11) (15, 14) (15, 2) (6, 19) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {11, 1}
- Node 1: {9, 17, 0}
- Node 2: {15}
- Node 3: {14, 10, 19}
- Node 4: {16, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {9, 8, 4, 10}
- Node 6: {19, 12}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 14}
- Node 8: {11, 5, 9, 18}
- Node 9: {5, 1, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 10: {11, 5, 3, 17}
- Node 11: {10, 0, 8, 15}
- Node 12: {9, 18, 6}
- Node 13: {14}
- Node 14: {7, 3, 15, 13}
- Node 15: {11, 14, 2}
- Node 16: {17, 4}
- Node 17: {16, 1, 10}
- Node 18: {8, 19, 12}
- Node 19: {3, 18, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 19, so the final answer is [19].

Unique 3-stars:
1. <5, (4, 8, 10)>
2. <9, (5, 7, 12)>
3. <14, (3, 7, 15)>
4. <18, (8, 12, 19)>
