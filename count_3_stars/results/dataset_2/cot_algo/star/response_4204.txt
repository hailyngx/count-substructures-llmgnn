Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 0) (15, 8) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 16) (19, 0) (19, 12) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 12) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 18) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 1) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 17) (9, 15) (9, 13) (12, 19) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 11) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (0, 2) (0, 19) (1, 7) (1, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 1) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) 

Response:
Given the edge list provided, we can first create the adjacency list to determine the neighbor nodes for each node. 

Node 0 neighbors: [2, 19]
Node 1 neighbors: [7, 10]
Node 2 neighbors: [0, 8, 10, 14]
Node 3 neighbors: [7, 13, 17, 18]
Node 4 neighbors: [5]
Node 5 neighbors: [4, 7]
Node 6 neighbors: [8, 11, 12, 18]
Node 7 neighbors: [1, 3, 5, 10, 11]
Node 8 neighbors: [2, 6, 15, 16]
Node 9 neighbors: [13, 15]
Node 10 neighbors: [1, 2, 7]
Node 11 neighbors: [6, 7, 12]
Node 12 neighbors: [6, 11, 17, 19]
Node 13 neighbors: [3, 9, 14]
Node 14 neighbors: [2, 13]
Node 15 neighbors: [8, 9, 15, 16, 18]
Node 16 neighbors: [8, 15, 17]
Node 17 neighbors: [3, 12, 16]
Node 18 neighbors: [3, 6, 15]
Node 19 neighbors: [0, 12]

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <2, (0, 10, 14)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <3, (7, 13, 17)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <6, (8, 11, 12)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <7, (1, 10, 11)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <8, (6, 15, 16)>
Node 12 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <12, (6, 17, 19)>
Node 15 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <15, (8, 9, 16)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
