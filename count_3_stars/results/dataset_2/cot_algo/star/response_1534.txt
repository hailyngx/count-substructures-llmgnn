Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 15) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 17) (18, 2) (19, 5) (19, 12) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (15, 5) (15, 11) (13, 16) (13, 14) (17, 2) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 7) (0, 17) (0, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 14) (7, 6) (7, 17) (7, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 16) (16, 2) (16, 13) (16, 4) (16, 8) (8, 17) (8, 16) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 1) (12, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated as follows:

1. For node 5, the neighbors are {9, 19, 15, 3}. Since node 5 has 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center. These 3-stars are: <5, 9, 19>, <5, 9, 15>, <5, 9, 3>, <5, 19, 15>.

2. For node 9, the neighbors are {5, 6, 4, 12}. Since node 9 has 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center. These 3-stars are: <9, 5, 6>, <9, 5, 4>, <9, 5, 12>, <9, 6, 4>.

3. For node 6, the neighbors are {9, 1, 14, 7}. Since node 6 has 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center. These 3-stars are: <6, 9, 1>, <6, 9, 14>, <6, 9, 7>, <6, 1, 14>.

4. For node 4, the neighbors are {9, 10, 0, 16}. Since node 4 has 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center. These 3-stars are: <4, 9, 10>, <4, 9, 0>, <4, 9, 16>, <4, 10, 0>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from all nodes with at least 3 neighbors, we get: 

\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, 9, 19>, <5, 9, 15>, <5, 9, 3>, <9, 5, 6>, <9, 5, 4>, <9, 5, 12>, <9, 6, 4>, <6, 9, 1>, <6, 9, 14>, <6, 9, 7>, <6, 1, 14>, <4, 9, 10>, <4, 9, 0>, <4, 9, 16>, <4, 10, 0>.
