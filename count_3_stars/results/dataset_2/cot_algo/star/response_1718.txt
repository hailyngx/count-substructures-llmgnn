Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 0) (4, 2) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node.

1. Node 0: Neighbors {6, 3, 2, 7}, 4 neighbors
2. Node 1: Neighbors {3, 14, 5, 8}, 4 neighbors
3. Node 2: Neighbors {0, 8, 13, 4}, 4 neighbors
4. Node 3: Neighbors {1, 0, 10, 7}, 4 neighbors
5. Node 4: Neighbors {2}, 1 neighbor
6. Node 5: Neighbors {1, 11, 13, 7, 14}, 5 neighbors
7. Node 6: Neighbors {9, 7, 0}, 3 neighbors
8. Node 7: Neighbors {6, 3, 10, 11, 5, 0}, 6 neighbors
9. Node 8: Neighbors {9, 1, 2, 12}, 4 neighbors
10. Node 9: Neighbors {6, 8, 11, 13}, 4 neighbors
11. Node 10: Neighbors {3, 11, 12, 7}, 4 neighbors
12. Node 11: Neighbors {9, 10, 7, 5, 12}, 5 neighbors
13. Node 12: Neighbors {10, 11, 8, 14}, 4 neighbors
14. Node 13: Neighbors {9, 2, 5}, 3 neighbors

Now, we can find the number of 3-stars by applying the combinatorial formula to nodes with 3 or more neighbors.

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 2 nodes with 1 3-star each
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 5 nodes with \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 3 nodes with \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each
Nodes with 6 neighbors: 1 node with \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 2 + (5 * 4) + (3 * 10) + (1 * 20) = 2 + 20 + 30 + 20 = 72

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [72].
