Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 8) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 4) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 12) (27, 18) (27, 20) (27, 26) (2, 16) (2, 21) (29, 28) (29, 25) (29, 22) (18, 27) (18, 14) (22, 29) (22, 6) (22, 21) (10, 11) (10, 25) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 19) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (23, 8) (23, 24) (5, 24) (5, 21) (6, 22) (6, 17) (6, 26) (28, 29) (28, 9) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 20) (9, 7) (19, 8) (19, 12) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 9) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 12) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 0) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 3) (20, 27) (20, 9) (20, 3) (20, 26) (26, 27) (26, 6) (26, 20) (26, 12) (1, 13) (1, 25) (25, 29) (25, 10) (25, 1) (25, 0) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 25) (0, 24) (0, 4) (24, 23) (24, 5) (24, 0) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 0) (21, 2) (21, 22) (21, 5) (12, 15) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 26) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {15, 17, 25, 24, 4}
- Node 1: {13, 25}
- Node 2: {16, 21}
- Node 3: {17, 14, 20, 12}
- Node 4: {16, 13, 0}
- Node 5: {24, 21}
- Node 6: {22, 17, 26}
- Node 7: {16, 15, 9}
- Node 8: {11, 13, 23, 19}
- Node 9: {28, 14, 20, 7}
- Node 10: {11, 25}
- Node 11: {10, 8}
- Node 12: {15, 19, 3, 26}
- Node 13: {8, 4, 1}
- Node 14: {18, 9, 3}
- Node 15: {7, 16, 12}
- Node 16: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 17: {6, 3, 0}
- Node 18: {27, 14}
- Node 19: {8, 12}
- Node 20: {27, 9, 3, 26}
- Node 21: {2, 22, 5}
- Node 22: {29, 6, 21}
- Node 23: {8, 24}
- Node 24: {23, 5, 0}
- Node 25: {29, 1, 10, 0}
- Node 26: {27, 6, 20, 12}
- Node 27: {18, 20, 26}
- Node 28: {29, 9}
- Node 29: {28, 25, 22}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 4, Node 6, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 20, Node 25, and Node 26

For each of these nodes, we can form a 3-star. There are 9 such 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (15, 17, 24)>
<4, (16, 13, 0)>
<6, (22, 17, 26)>
<15, (7, 16, 12)>
<16, (2, 4, 7)>
<17, (6, 3, 0)>
<20, (27, 9, 26)>
<25, (29, 1, 10)>
<26, (27, 6, 20)>
