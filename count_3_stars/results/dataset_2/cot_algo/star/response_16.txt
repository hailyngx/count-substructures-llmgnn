Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 15) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 16) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 3) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 19) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 8) (17, 1) (17, 7) (15, 5) (15, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 16) (10, 6) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 19) (7, 17) (16, 9) (16, 8) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 13) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {18, 14, 11, 19}
- Node 1: {5, 17, 15, 8}
- Node 2: {9, 18, 12, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 4}
- Node 4: {18, 19, 3}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 15, 1}
- Node 6: {5, 14, 10, 3, 13}
- Node 7: {17}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 1, 16}
- Node 9: {8, 2, 16}
- Node 10: {6}
- Node 11: {0, 13, 12}
- Node 12: {2, 14, 11}
- Node 13: {6, 11, 19}
- Node 14: {6, 0, 12}
- Node 15: {5, 1}
- Node 16: {9, 8}
- Node 17: {1, 7}
- Node 18: {2, 4, 0}
- Node 19: {4, 0, 13}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 1
- Node 10: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: 1
- Node 12: 1
- Node 13: 1
- Node 14: 1
- Node 15: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 17: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 18: 1
- Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 19

So, the final answer is [19], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 14, 18>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 12, 14>
<2, 3, 18>
<2, 9, 16>
<4, 18, 19>
<5, 6, 15>
<6, 10, 13>
<11, 12, 13>
<13, 19, 0>
