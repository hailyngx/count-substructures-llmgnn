Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (6, 17) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 1) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 16) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 15) (8, 6) (8, 5) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 15) (0, 3) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (1, 9) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 1) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 7) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 3) (16, 10) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 3) (11, 13) (11, 19) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

Node 0: {3}
Node 1: {2, 9, 15}
Node 2: {1, 7, 12, 14, 19}
Node 3: {0, 7, 12, 13}
Node 4: {9, 15, 18}
Node 5: {8, 10, 13}
Node 6: {8, 10, 17}
Node 7: {2, 3, 19}
Node 8: {5, 6}
Node 9: {1, 4, 15}
Node 10: {5, 6, 12, 13, 16, 17}
Node 11: {13, 19}
Node 12: {2, 3, 10}
Node 13: {3, 5, 10, 11}
Node 14: {2, 17}
Node 15: {1, 4, 9, 18}
Node 16: {10}
Node 17: {6, 10, 14}
Node 18: {4, 15, 19}
Node 19: {2, 7, 11, 18}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 9, 15}.
Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 7, 19}.
Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 15, 18}.
Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {8, 10, 13}.
Node 6 forms two 3-stars with neighbors {8, 10, 17} and {10, 12, 16}.
Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 19}.
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 15}.
Node 10 forms five 3-stars with neighbors {5, 13, 17}, {6, 12, 16}, {10, 12, 17}, {10, 13, 16}, and {10, 13, 17}.
Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 10}.
Node 13 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 10, 11}.
Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 17, 19}.
Node 15 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 9, 18}.
Node 17 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 10, 14}.
Node 18 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 15, 19}.
Node 19 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 7, 11}.

Counting all unique 3-stars gives us a total of $\boxed{16}$. 

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<1, 2, 9, 15>, <2, 1, 7, 19>, <4, 9, 15, 18>, <5, 8, 10, 13>, <6, 8, 10, 17>, <6, 10, 12, 16>, <7, 2, 3, 19>, <10, 5, 13, 17>, <10, 6, 12, 16>, <10, 12, 13, 17>, <10, 13, 16, 17>, <12, 2, 3, 10>, <13, 3, 5, 10>, <14, 2, 17, 19>, <15, 4, 9, 18>, <17, 6, 10, 14>, <18, 4, 15, 19>.
