Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in terms of its adjacency list:

Node 0: {5, 9}
Node 1: {9, 3, 2, 4, 8}
Node 2: {9, 1, 4}
Node 3: {1, 7, 6, 4, 8}
Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 2}
Node 5: {9, 8, 0}
Node 6: {3, 7, 8, 4}
Node 7: {3, 6, 8}
Node 8: {5, 9, 1, 3, 6, 7}
Node 9: {5, 8, 2, 1, 0}

Now, let's go through each node to find the neighbors and count the number of 3-stars.

Node 0 has 2 neighbors: {5, 9}
Node 1 has 5 neighbors: {9, 3, 2, 4, 8}
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: {9, 1}
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: {1, 7, 6, 4, 8}
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 6, 2}
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {9, 8, 0} - forms a 3-star <5, (9, 8, 0)>
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {3, 7, 8} - forms a 3-star <6, (3, 7, 8)>
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {3, 6, 8} - forms a 3-star <7, (3, 6, 8)>
Node 8 has 6 neighbors: {5, 9, 1, 3, 6, 7} - forms 6 3-stars: <8, (5, 9, 1)>, <8, (5, 9, 3)>, <8, (5, 9, 6)>, <8, (5, 9, 7)>, <8, (5, 9, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: {5, 8, 2, 1, 0} - forms 5 3-stars: <9, (5, 8, 2)>, <9, (5, 8, 1)>, <9, (5, 8, 0)>, <9, (8, 2, 1)>, <9, (8, 2, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 3 + 6 + 5 = 15, so the final answer is [15].
