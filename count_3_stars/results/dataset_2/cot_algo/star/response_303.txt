Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 9
Node 1: 5, 7, 8
Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 3: 0, 4, 8, 9
Node 4: 2, 3, 7, 9
Node 5: 1, 2, 7, 8
Node 6: 0, 2, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 5
Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5
Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 6

Next, we need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars. These nodes are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4+20+4+4+4+4+4+4 = 48

Thus, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 2, 3, 9>
<0, 2, 6, 9>
<0, 3, 4, 9>
<0, 2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 7, 5>
<3, 4, 7, 5>
<3, 4, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 1, 8>
<5, 7, 2, 8>
<7, 1, 8, 2>
