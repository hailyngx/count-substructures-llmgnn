Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 22) (3, 25) (3, 27) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 15) (25, 21) (20, 25) (20, 23) (0, 21) (0, 15) (0, 11) (4, 12) (4, 26) (4, 2) (18, 19) (18, 8) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 16) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 1) (28, 7) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 16) (26, 4) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 23) (24, 6) (24, 26) (24, 5) (24, 29) (1, 17) (1, 28) (1, 8) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 22) (5, 26) (5, 24) (5, 8) (5, 10) (2, 4) (23, 20) (23, 26) (23, 13) (23, 27) (16, 6) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 9) (7, 28) (7, 11) (11, 0) (11, 7) (8, 14) (8, 18) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 10) (21, 25) (21, 0) (21, 15) (21, 29) (15, 25) (15, 0) (15, 21) (15, 29) (9, 28) (9, 16) (9, 27) (10, 5) (10, 8) (22, 17) (22, 12) (27, 3) (27, 23) (27, 9) (13, 23) (29, 24) (29, 21) (29, 15) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {11, 15, 21}
- Node 1: {8, 17, 28}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {25, 27}
- Node 4: {2, 12, 26}
- Node 5: {8, 10, 24, 26}
- Node 6: {16, 24, 28}
- Node 7: {11, 28}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 10, 14, 18}
- Node 9: {16, 27, 28}
- Node 10: {5, 8}
- Node 11: {0, 7}
- Node 12: {4, 16, 22}
- Node 13: {23}
- Node 14: {8, 17}
- Node 15: {0, 21, 25, 29}
- Node 16: {6, 9, 12, 19}
- Node 17: {1, 14, 22}
- Node 18: {8, 19}
- Node 19: {16, 18, 26}
- Node 20: {23, 25}
- Node 21: {0, 15, 25, 29}
- Node 22: {12, 17}
- Node 23: {13, 20, 26, 27}
- Node 24: {5, 6, 26, 29}
- Node 25: {3, 15, 20, 21}
- Node 26: {4, 5, 19, 23, 24}
- Node 27: {3, 9, 23}
- Node 28: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 29: {15, 21, 24}

Now, we can see which nodes can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: Can form a 3-star with neighbors {8, 17, 28} -> In this case, the 3-star is <1, (8, 17, 28)>
- Node 5: Can form a 3-star with neighbors {8, 10, 24, 26} -> In this case, the 3-star is <5, (8, 10, 26)> and <5, (24, 26, 8)>
- Node 8: Can form a 3-star with neighbors {1, 5, 10, 14, 18} -> In this case, the 3-star is <8, (1, 5, 14)> and <8, (1, 10, 18)>
- Node 15: Can form a 3-star with neighbors {0, 21, 25, 29} -> In this case, the 3-star is <15, (0, 21, 25)>
- Node 16: Can form a 3-star with neighbors {6, 9, 12, 19} -> In this case, the 3-star is <16, (6, 9, 12)> and <16, (6, 9, 19)> and <16, (12, 19, 6)>
- Node 21: Can form a 3-star with neighbors {0, 15, 25, 29} -> In this case, the 3-star is <21, (0, 15, 25)>
- Node 24: Can form a 3-star with neighbors {5, 6, 26, 29} -> In this case, the 3-star is <24, (5, 6, 26)> and <24, (5, 26, 29)> and <24, (6, 26, 29)>
- Node 26: Can form a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 19, 23, 24} -> In this case, the 3-star is <26, (4, 5, 19)> and <26, (4, 5, 23)> and <26, (19, 23, 24)> and <26, (5, 23, 24)>

Therefore, there are a total of 12 unique 3-stars formed in this graph. So, the final answer is [12].
