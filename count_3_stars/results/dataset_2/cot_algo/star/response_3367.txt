Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 12) (9, 16) (26, 9) (26, 25) (26, 8) (3, 17) (3, 12) (15, 7) (15, 6) (2, 23) (2, 28) (2, 21) (29, 7) (29, 6) (29, 18) (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 3) (17, 14) (17, 11) (20, 18) (20, 5) (20, 28) (25, 26) (25, 22) (5, 20) (5, 12) (5, 1) (8, 26) (8, 0) (23, 2) (23, 1) (23, 24) (13, 22) (13, 19) (13, 18) (13, 6) (22, 25) (22, 13) (22, 7) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 18) (7, 15) (7, 29) (7, 22) (7, 0) (7, 11) (6, 15) (6, 29) (6, 13) (6, 21) (6, 12) (21, 2) (21, 6) (21, 24) (4, 12) (27, 10) (27, 1) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 4) (11, 17) (11, 7) (16, 9) (16, 18) (1, 5) (1, 23) (1, 27) (10, 27) (10, 19) (10, 24) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 28) (28, 2) (28, 20) (28, 19) (18, 29) (18, 20) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 16) (24, 23) (24, 21) (24, 10) 

Response:
The 3-star graph formed from the given data is as follows:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 7, 14, and 18: <0, (7, 14, 18)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5 and 23: <1, (5, 23, 27)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 13, and 15: <6, (12, 13, 15)>
- Node 7 forms 3-stars with nodes 11, 15, and 22: <7, (11, 15, 22)> and <7, (0, 11, 15)> 
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 9 and 18: <16, (9, 18, 16)>
- Node 18 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 13, and 29: <18, (0, 13, 29)> and <18, (16, 20, 29)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 13, and 28: <19, (10, 13, 28)>

The total number of 3-stars formed is [9].
