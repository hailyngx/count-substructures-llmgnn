Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 2) (1, 11) (1, 27) (21, 6) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 2) (14, 15) (17, 25) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 15) (22, 24) (22, 29) (22, 25) (22, 8) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 25) (0, 12) (27, 1) (27, 0) (27, 4) (8, 22) (8, 19) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 15) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 6) (4, 27) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 29) (29, 22) (29, 4) (29, 23) (29, 11) (13, 26) (13, 19) (13, 23) (6, 21) (6, 19) (6, 20) (10, 21) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 16) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 10) (15, 11) (16, 10) (16, 23) (3, 12) (28, 8) (28, 7) (25, 17) (25, 22) (25, 0) (7, 28) (11, 1) (11, 29) (11, 15) (24, 22) (24, 5) (24, 20) (20, 6) (20, 24) (2, 26) (2, 21) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 24) (23, 29) (23, 13) (23, 16) (23, 12) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 23) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are 0, 4, 8, 10, 12, 15, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (27, 1, 10), (27, 25, 0), (12, 0, 21)
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (29, 4, 22), (27, 4, 8), (5, 18, 4)
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (19, 8, 22), (8, 15, 10), (8, 28, 4), (8, 4, 27)
Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (21, 10, 15), (10, 16, 23)
Node 12 has 5 neighbors: (9, 12, 21), (27, 12, 0), (12, 23, 16)
Node 15 has 5 neighbors: (15, 14, 18), (11, 15, 1)
Node 22 has 4 neighbors: (24, 22, 5), (29, 22, 8), (25, 22, 0)
Node 23 has 4 neighbors: (16, 23, 10), (13, 23, 29)
Node 25 has 3 neighbors: (17, 25, 22)
Node 26 has 3 neighbors: (13, 26, 9)
Node 27 has 3 neighbors: (1, 27, 0)
Node 29 has 4 neighbors: (23, 29, 12), (11, 29, 4)

Adding these up, we have a total of 13 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [13].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <27, 1, 0>
- <27, 4, 8>
- <5, 18, 4>
- <19, 8, 22>
- <8, 15, 10>
- <8, 28, 4>
- <21, 10, 15>
- <10, 16, 23>
- <9, 12, 21>
- <12, 0, 27>
- <12, 23, 16>
- <15, 14, 18>
- <11, 15, 1>
