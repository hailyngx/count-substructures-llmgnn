Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 24) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (22, 2) (22, 16) (22, 0) (23, 3) (23, 16) (23, 20) (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 8) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 3) (12, 28) (12, 21) (12, 15) (27, 21) (2, 6) (2, 22) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 28) (18, 2) (18, 17) (15, 12) (15, 20) (15, 13) (15, 17) (15, 4) (20, 23) (20, 15) (20, 4) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 2) (28, 8) (28, 13) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 28) (0, 22) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 26) (7, 17) (25, 10) (25, 26) (25, 14) (3, 23) (3, 11) (3, 14) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 27) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 4) (24, 5) (24, 16) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 7) (8, 10) (8, 28) (16, 22) (16, 23) (16, 1) (16, 24) (14, 25) (14, 3) (14, 19) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 14) (26, 7) (26, 25) (26, 29) (29, 26) (4, 15) (4, 20) (4, 1) 

Response:
Since the graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges, it means that each node has exactly 3 edges incident to it. 
Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 2: {(2, 6, 1), (2, 22, 16), (2, 28, 11), (2, 19, 7)}
For node 9: {(9, 5, 24), (9, 6, 1), (9, 13, 15), (9, 13, 28)}
For node 15: {(15, 12, 28), (15, 20, 23), (15, 17, 18), (15, 4, 1)}
For node 16: {(16, 22, 2), (16, 23, 3), (16, 1, 6), (16, 24, 5)}
For node 17: {(17, 18, 2), (17, 15, 12), (17, 7, 0)}
For node 19: {(19, 2, 6), (19, 7, 0), (19, 14, 25)}
For node 20: {(20, 23, 3), (20, 15, 12), (20, 4, 1)}
For node 21: {(21, 10, 11), (21, 12, 15), (21, 27, 26)}
For node 22: {(22, 2, 6), (22, 16, 23), (22, 0, 7)}
For node 24: {(24, 5, 9), (24, 16, 1), (24, 16, 23)}
For node 26: {(26, 7, 0), (26, 25, 14), (26, 29, 26)}
For node 28: {(28, 11, 10), (28, 12, 15), (28, 8, 10), (28, 13, 15)}

Counting all the 3-stars formed by these nodes: 4 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [35].
