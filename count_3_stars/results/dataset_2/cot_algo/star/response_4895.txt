Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 6) (4, 16) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 15) (8, 0) (13, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 17) (1, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 18) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 6) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 12) (14, 16) (14, 4) (14, 3) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 2) (6, 16) (6, 15) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 0) (12, 10) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 19) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 17) 

Response:
First, let's create an adjacency list for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {8, 5, 10, 12}
Node 1: {4, 17, 18}
Node 2: {7, 13, 3}
Node 3: {17, 14, 2}
Node 4: {16, 7, 14, 1}
Node 5: {8, 0}
Node 6: {16, 15}
Node 7: {4, 10, 9, 2}
Node 8: {19, 5, 15, 0}
Node 9: {7, 17, 19}
Node 10: {7, 0, 12}
Node 11: {16, 18}
Node 12: {0, 10}
Node 13: {2}
Node 14: {16, 4, 3}
Node 15: {8, 19, 6}
Node 16: {11, 4, 14, 6}
Node 17: {1, 3, 9, 18}
Node 18: {11, 1, 17}
Node 19: {8, 15, 9}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars by examining each node that has three or more neighbors:

For simplicity, let's only consider nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Nodes: 0, 4, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 23 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 8, 10)>, <4, (1, 7, 14)>, <7, (2, 9, 17)>, <8, (0, 15, 19)>, <15, (6, 8, 19)>, <16, (4, 6, 14)>, <17, (3, 9, 18)>, <18, (1, 17, 11)>, <19, (8, 15, 9)>.
