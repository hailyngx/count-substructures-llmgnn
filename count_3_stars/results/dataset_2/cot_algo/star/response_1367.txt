Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 10) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

1: {6, 9, 3, 8}
2: {8, 11, 14}
3: {1, 4, 8, 14}
4: {6, 3, 7, 10, 14, 11}
5: {6, 13, 10}
6: {9, 5, 1, 12, 4}
7: {9, 4, 0, 11, 14}
8: {9, 1, 3, 13, 2}
9: {6, 8, 1, 7}
10: {4, 12, 5}
11: {4, 7, 13, 2}
12: {6, 10, 0}
13: {8, 5, 11, 14}
14: {3, 4, 7, 13, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 68

Therefore, the final answer is [68].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (6, 9, 3)>
<1, (6, 9, 8)>
<1, (6, 3, 8)>

<14, (7, 13, 2)>
<14, (3, 7, 13)>
