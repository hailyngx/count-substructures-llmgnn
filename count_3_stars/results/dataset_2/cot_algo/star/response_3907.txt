Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 6, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 0, 4}
- Node 4: {5, 1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 8, 1, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 6, 4, 2}
- Node 8: {5, 1, 4, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 1, 7}

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors, which are nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. We can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 52 3-stars in the graph. 

Thus, the final answer is [52], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>
