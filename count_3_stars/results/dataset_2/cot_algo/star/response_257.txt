Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighborhood sets for each node:

Node 0: {1, 3, 9}
Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 7}
Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 8}
Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 8}
Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 8}
Node 6: {5, 7}
Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 9}
Node 9: {0, 3, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 0)>, <1, (4, 5, 0)>, <1, (5, 7, 0)>
Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>
Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>
Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, 
<7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].
