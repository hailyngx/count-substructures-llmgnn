Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 14) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 7, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6, 11}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {8, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 11}
- Node 13: {7, 10}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 5, 6, 10}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 \). 
Therefore, the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 14)>
- <6, (7, 8, 10)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- <14, (1, 5, 10)>
