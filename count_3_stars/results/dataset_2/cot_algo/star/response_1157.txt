Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 10) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 10) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (13, 1) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 12
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7, 8, 13
- Node 2: 1, 10, 11, 14
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12
- Node 4: 3, 5, 10, 13
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 9, 11, 14
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 11, 14
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6, 8, 10
- Node 9: 5
- Node 10: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 11: 2, 5, 7, 12
- Node 12: 0, 3, 11, 14
- Node 13: 1, 4
- Node 14: 2, 5, 7, 12

Next, we identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 3, 5, and 14 each have 5 neighbors. So, they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, and 12 have 4 neighbors each. So, they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\( (10 * 4) + (8 * 4) = 40 + 32 = 72 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [72].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 3, 5, 6>, 
<0, 3, 5, 12>, 
<0, 3, 5, 14>, 
<0, 5, 12, 14>, 
<3, 5, 11, 14>, 
<1, 3, 8, 10>, 
<1, 4, 10, 13>, 
<1, 6, 8, 13>, 
<2, 10, 11, 14>, 
<4, 5, 10, 13>, 
<5, 6, 9, 11>.
