Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 2) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 7) 

Response:
The graph has the following neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {1, 8, 14, 4}
Node 1: {0, 6, 11}
Node 2: {13, 6, 14, 7}
Node 3: {7, 8}
Node 4: {9, 13, 10, 11, 0, 12}
Node 5: {9, 6}
Node 6: {5, 1, 8, 10, 2}
Node 7: {3, 10, 11, 2}
Node 8: {9, 3, 13, 0, 6, 12}
Node 9: {5, 8, 4, 10}
Node 10: {9, 11, 6, 7, 4}
Node 11: {1, 10, 7, 12, 4}
Node 12: {8, 11, 14, 4}
Node 13: {8, 4, 2}
Node 14: {0, 12, 2}

We can see that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by each node gives a total of 73 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [73].

And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 12>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 4, 14>, <1, 10, 11>, <2, 7, 11>, <2, 7, 14>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 11>, <4, 6, 10>, <4, 6, 12>, <4, 7, 11>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 8, 11>, <4, 8, 12>, <4, 9, 10>, <6, 8, 10>, <6, 8, 12>, <8, 9, 10>, <8, 9, 11>.
