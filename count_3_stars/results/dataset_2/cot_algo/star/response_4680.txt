Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 11) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (11, 15) (11, 9) (0, 5) (0, 13) (7, 10) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 12) (17, 16) (4, 15) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 18) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 4) (19, 18) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (8, 5) (8, 10) (16, 3) (16, 6) (16, 17) (16, 2) (2, 9) (2, 16) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 5, 13  
Node 1: 3, 4, 13  
Node 2: 9, 16  
Node 3: 1, 14, 15  
Node 4: 1, 12, 15, 19  
Node 5: 0, 6, 8, 10  
Node 6: 5, 9, 12, 16  
Node 7: 10  
Node 8: 5, 10  
Node 9: 2, 6, 11, 14  
Node 10: 5, 7, 8, 15  
Node 11: 9, 15  
Node 12: 4, 6, 13, 14, 18  
Node 13: 1, 0, 12  
Node 14: 3, 9, 12  
Node 15: 3, 4, 10, 11  
Node 16: 2, 6, 17  
Node 17: 16  
Node 18: 12, 19  
Node 19: 4, 18  

Now we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of them:

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (1, 14, 15)>
<4, (1, 12, 15)>
<5, (6, 8, 10)>
<6, (5, 9, 12)>
<9, (6, 11, 15)>
<10, (5, 8, 15)>
<12, (4, 13, 18)>
<14, (3, 9, 12)>
<15, (3, 10, 11)>
<16, (6, 17, 2)>
