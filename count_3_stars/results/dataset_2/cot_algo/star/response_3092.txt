Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (14, 8) (14, 6) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (1, 11) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 12) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 9, 11, 12, 13
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 6, 7, 8, 10
- Node 3: Neighbors are 6, 7, 13
- Node 4: Neighbors are 5, 7, 8, 13
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 4, 6
- Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 3, 5, 7, 14
- Node 7: Neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 6, 11
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 14
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, 8, 11
- Node 10: Neighbors are 2, 8, 10, 11
- Node 11: Neighbors are 1, 7, 8, 9, 10
- Node 12: Neighbors are 1, 13
- Node 13: Neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 12
- Node 14: Neighbors are 6, 8

Next, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 11: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 12: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 14: [inom{2}{3}] = 0

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars gives: 
4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 0 = 78

Thus, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [78], and they are:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 1, 13>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 11, 9>
<1, 12, 13>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 13>
<4, 7, 11>
<6, 7, 14>
<7, 8, 10>
<7, 8, 11>
<8, 9, 11>
<8, 9, 14>
<10, 11, 8>
