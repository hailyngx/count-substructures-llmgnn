Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 5)>, <0, (2, 7, 5)>, <0, (3, 7, 5)>, <0, (3, 2, 5)>, <0, (5, 4, 8)>, <0, (7, 1, 9)>, <0, (7, 6, 5)>, <0, (7, 2, 5)>, <0, (7, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>.
