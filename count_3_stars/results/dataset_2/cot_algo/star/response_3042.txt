Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 7, 3
- Node 1: 4, 3, 9
- Node 2: 4, 8, 6, 9
- Node 3: 7, 1, 0, 9, 5, 8
- Node 4: 7, 8, 2, 5, 1
- Node 5: 4, 7, 3, 6
- Node 6: 8, 5, 2
- Node 7: 4, 0, 3, 5
- Node 8: 4, 3, 2, 9, 6
- Node 9: 1, 3, 8, 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 3: <3, (1, 9, 8)>, <3, (1, 9, 2)>, <3, (1, 8, 2)>, <3, (3, 9, 8)>, <3, (3, 9, 2)>, <3, (3, 8, 2)>
- Node 4: <4, (7, 8, 2)>, <4, (7, 8, 5)>, <4, (7, 2, 5)>
- Node 8: <8, (3, 9, 2)>
- Node 9: <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 2)>, <9, (1, 8, 2)>, <9, (3, 8, 2)>

There are a total of 12 unique 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [12].
