Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 11) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 10) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 13) (12, 8) (12, 11) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 14}
- Node 5: {4, 8, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 6: {8, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 11}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {5, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {2, 5, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {8, 11}
- Node 13: {6, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {4, 9, 11, 13}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14
- Number of 3-stars:
  - Node 2: \(inom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - Node 3: \(inom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Node 4: not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
  - Node 5: \(inom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - Node 7: not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
  - Node 8: \(inom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - Node 9: \(inom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Node 11: \(inom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - Node 14: \(inom{4}{3}\) = 4

Adding them up, we get 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 5, 14)>
- <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- <5, (4, 9, 11)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- <9, (5, 13, 14)>
- <11, (2, 7, 14)>
- <14, (9, 11, 13)>
