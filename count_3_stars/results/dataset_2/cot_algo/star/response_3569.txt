Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 22) (11, 15) (12, 21) (12, 29) (12, 6) (27, 28) (27, 17) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 5) (18, 20) (17, 10) (17, 27) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 14) (0, 24) (0, 6) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 26) (21, 12) (21, 20) (28, 27) (28, 9) (28, 22) (1, 29) (1, 19) (26, 14) (26, 23) (26, 20) (7, 15) (25, 19) (20, 18) (20, 21) (20, 26) (20, 29) (20, 22) (29, 12) (29, 1) (29, 20) (29, 23) (23, 11) (23, 26) (23, 29) (23, 24) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 1) (19, 25) (19, 8) (19, 16) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 24) (24, 0) (24, 23) (24, 6) (24, 5) (24, 15) (13, 4) (13, 3) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 9) (5, 18) (5, 8) (5, 24) (5, 16) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 24) (15, 16) (22, 11) (22, 28) (22, 20) (9, 28) (9, 3) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 13) (16, 19) (16, 5) (16, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {6, 14, 24}
- Node 1: {19, 29}
- Node 2: {3, 14, 17}
- Node 3: {2, 9, 13}
- Node 4: {10, 13, 17}
- Node 5: {8, 16, 18, 24}
- Node 6: {0, 12, 24}
- Node 7: {15}
- Node 8: {5, 19}
- Node 9: {3, 28}
- Node 10: {4, 11, 17}
- Node 11: {10, 15, 22, 23}
- Node 12: {6, 21, 29}
- Node 13: {3, 4}
- Node 14: {2, 26}
- Node 15: {7, 11, 16, 24}
- Node 16: {5, 15, 19}
- Node 17: {2, 4, 10, 27}
- Node 18: {5, 20}
- Node 19: {1, 8, 16, 25}
- Node 20: {18, 21, 22, 26, 29}
- Node 21: {12, 20}
- Node 22: {11, 20, 28}
- Node 23: {11, 24, 26, 29}
- Node 24: {0, 5, 6, 15, 23},
- Node 25: {19}
- Node 26: {14, 20, 23}
- Node 27: {17, 28}
- Node 28: {9, 22, 27}
- Node 29: {1, 12, 20, 23}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 28, and 29.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 * 18 = 18
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: \( \binom{n}{3} \)
  - Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up: 18 (from nodes with 3 neighbors) + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 55

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (6, 14, 24)>, <2, (3, 14, 17)>, <3, (2, 9, 13)>, <4, (10, 13, 17)>, <5, (8, 16, 18)>, <6, (0, 12, 24)>, <10, (4, 11, 17)>, <11, (15, 22, 23)>, <15, (7, 16, 24)>, <16, (5, 19, 16)>, <17, (2, 4, 10)>, <19, (8, 16, 25)>, <20, (18, 21, 22)>, <23, (11, 26, 29)>, <24, (5, 6, 15)>.
