Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: 1, 5, 7
Node 1: 0, 6, 8, 9
Node 2: 3, 4, 7, 9
Node 3: 2, 4, 7, 8
Node 4: 2, 3, 7, 9
Node 5: 0, 6, 9
Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
Node 8: 1, 3, 6, 7
Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 5

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 44 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [44].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 6, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 9, 1>, <7, 8, 9, 3>, <7, 8, 9, 6>, <7, 9, 1, 6>, <7, 9, 2, 3>, <7, 9, 2, 4>, <7, 9, 2, 6>, <7, 9, 4, 6>, <7, 9, 5, 6>, <8, 1, 6, 9>, <8, 3, 7, 9>, <8, 6, 7, 9>, <9, 1, 2, 4>, <9, 1, 2, 5>, <9, 1, 4, 6>, <9, 2, 4, 5>, <9, 2, 4, 7>, <9, 5, 6, 7>
