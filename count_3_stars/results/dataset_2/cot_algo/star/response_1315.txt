Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 18) (10, 15) (10, 16) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 19) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 11) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 13) (8, 18) (8, 6) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 19) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 15) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 5) (11, 2) (11, 1) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 16) (3, 13) (16, 10) (16, 3) (9, 0) (9, 13) (5, 4) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 13) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list out the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {17, 18, 14, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 14, 11, 5}
- Node 2: {4, 3, 11}
- Node 3: {17, 2, 16, 13}
- Node 4: {7, 5, 1, 2}
- Node 5: {4, 1}
- Node 6: {8, 13}
- Node 7: {4, 12, 15, 19, 18}
- Node 8: {18, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 13}
- Node 10: {15, 16}
- Node 11: {2, 1}
- Node 12: {7, 14}
- Node 13: {14, 3, 9, 6}
- Node 14: {12, 0, 1, 13}
- Node 15: {7, 10, 19}
- Node 16: {10, 3}
- Node 17: {3, 0, 19}
- Node 18: {7, 0, 8}
- Node 19: {7, 17, 15}

Next, we identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 3, 4, 7, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 19 each have 4 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed:

- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (3-stars):

    - Node 4: [1]
    - Node 5: [0]
    - Node 11: [0]
    - Node 16: [0]

- For nodes with 4 neighbors:

    - Node 0: [1]
    - Node 3: [1]
    - Node 13: [1]
    - Node 14: [3]
    - Node 17: [1]
    - Node 19: [1]

- For the node with 5 neighbors:

    - Node 7: [6]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 6] = [14].

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <4, (7, 5, 1)>
- <0, (17, 18, 14)>
- <3, (17, 2, 11)>
- <13, (14, 3, 9)>
- <14, (12, 0, 1)>
- <17, (3, 0, 19)>
- <19, (7, 17, 15)>
- <7, (4, 12, 15)>
- <0, (18, 14, 9)>
- <14, (1, 13, 6)>
- <14, (0, 13, 6)>
- <14, (0, 1, 13)>
- <7, (15, 19, 18)>
- <4, (2, 3, 11)>
