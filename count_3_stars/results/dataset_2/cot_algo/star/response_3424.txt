Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 0) (15, 14) (6, 7) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 11) (17, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (0, 15) (0, 7) (14, 15) (14, 1) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 18) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (19, 4) (8, 3) (8, 17) (8, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 19) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 8) (16, 3) (18, 10) (18, 13) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node. Then, for nodes with three or more neighbors, we will count the number of 3-stars.

Here are the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {15, 7}
- Node 1: {14, 7, 2}
- Node 2: {10, 5, 1}
- Node 3: {15, 16, 13, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {9, 10, 17, 19}
- Node 5: {3, 2, 12}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {15, 9, 0, 1, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 17, 12}
- Node 9: {15, 4, 7, 12}
- Node 10: {18, 4, 2}
- Node 11: {17, 13}
- Node 12: {9, 5, 8}
- Node 13: {3, 17, 11, 18}
- Node 14: {15, 1}
- Node 15: {3, 7, 9, 0, 14}
- Node 16: {3}
- Node 17: {13, 8, 11, 4}
- Node 18: {10, 13}
- Node 19: {4}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 3, 15, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors, so we have: \( \text{inom{5}{3} = 10} \) 3-stars.
  - <3, 15, 7>
- Node 13 and 17 have 3 or more neighbors, so we have: \( \text{inom{4}{3} = 4} \) 3-stars.
  - <13, 17, 11>
  - <13, 17, 4>
  - <13, 17, 18>
- Node 1 also has 3 neighbors, so we have 1 3-star.
  - <1, 14, 7>

Adding these up, we have a total of [15] 3-stars in the graph.
