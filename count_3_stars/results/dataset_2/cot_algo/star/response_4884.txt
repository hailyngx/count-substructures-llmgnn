Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {9, 4, 3}
Node 1: {5, 3, 2}
Node 2: {5, 9, 1, 6}
Node 3: {5, 1, 0}
Node 4: {5, 7, 8, 0, 6}
Node 5: {2, 1, 4, 7, 3}
Node 6: {9, 4, 2, 8}
Node 7: {5, 9, 4, 8}
Node 8: {9, 4, 7, 6}
Node 9: {6, 8, 2, 7, 0}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get a total of 46 3-stars. So, the final answer is [46].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are as follows:
<2, (5, 1, 3)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 1, 4)>, <6, (9, 4, 2)>, <7, (5, 9, 4)>, <8, (9, 4, 6)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>
