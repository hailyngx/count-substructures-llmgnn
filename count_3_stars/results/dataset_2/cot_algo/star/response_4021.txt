Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up, we get a total of 44 3-stars.  
Therefore, the final answer to this problem is: [44]  
The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 5, 2)>
- <1, (0, 5, 4)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 5, 0)>
- <1, (2, 5, 4)>
...
- (listing all unique 3-stars would be quite extensive)
