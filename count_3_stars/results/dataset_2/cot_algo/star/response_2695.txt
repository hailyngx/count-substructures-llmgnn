Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 3) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 4) (20, 23) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 0) (15, 20) (6, 25) (6, 27) (6, 0) (28, 1) (28, 27) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (3, 29) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 27) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 17) (13, 14) (24, 2) (24, 26) (24, 14) (26, 2) (26, 24) (26, 21) (26, 0) (26, 4) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 21) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 12) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 22) (7, 18) (21, 26) (21, 17) (0, 25) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 26) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 14) (23, 20) (23, 1) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 24) (14, 18) (14, 16) (22, 12) (22, 1) (10, 27) (27, 6) (27, 28) (27, 11) (27, 10) (1, 28) (1, 9) (1, 23) (1, 22) (16, 3) (16, 14) (19, 3) (19, 9) (4, 20) (4, 26) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's first determine the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors (25, 6, 8, 26)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (28, 23, 22, 9)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (29, 8, 12, 26, 24)
- Node 3: 5 neighbors (29, 11, 16, 19, 12)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (20, 26)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (12, 14)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (25, 27, 0)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (18, 14)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (2, 9, 0)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (8, 17, 1, 19, 12)
- Node 10: 1 neighbor (27)
- Node 11: 3 neighbors (3, 18, 27)
- Node 12: 5 neighbors (2, 3, 5, 9, 22)
- Node 13: 2 neighbors (17, 14)
- Node 14: 5 neighbors (5, 13, 24, 18, 16)
- Node 15: 1 neighbor (20)
- Node 16: 2 neighbors (3, 14)
- Node 17: 3 neighbors (13, 21, 9)
- Node 18: 3 neighbors (11, 7, 14)
- Node 19: 2 neighbors (3, 9)
- Node 20: 4 neighbors (25, 15, 4, 23)
- Node 21: 2 neighbors (26, 17)
- Node 22: 2 neighbors (12, 1)
- Node 23: 2 neighbors (20, 1)
- Node 24: 3 neighbors (2, 26, 14)
- Node 25: 3 neighbors (20, 6, 0)
- Node 26: 5 neighbors (2, 24, 4, 21, 0)
- Node 27: 4 neighbors (6, 28, 11, 10)
- Node 28: 2 neighbors (1, 27)
- Node 29: 2 neighbors (2, 3)

Now, we will identify the total number of 3-stars formed by each node:

From the above calculations, the nodes that can form 3-stars are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 12, 14, 20, 25, 26, and 27. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 68 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [68]. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (25, 6, 26)>, <1, (28, 23, 22)>, <2, (29, 12, 24)>, <3, (29, 16, 19)>, <8, (2, 9, 0)>, <9, (8, 17, 19)>, <12, (2, 5, 22)>, <14, (5, 13, 24)>, <20, (25, 15, 23)>, <25, (20, 6, 0)>, <26, (24, 4, 21)>, <27, (6, 28, 11)>
