Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 9) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 7) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (4, 15) (4, 3) (18, 9) (18, 1) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 9) (8, 5) (8, 1) (19, 3) (19, 6) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 13) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 10) (10, 13) (10, 6) (1, 12) (1, 18) (1, 8) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 13) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    4 -- 15 -- 11
  / |        \   |
 3  |   13     16
 |  |    |       |
 19 - 6 - 7 - 9 - 18
    |   | X   |  
    5 - 3    17 - 14
     \ |     /  
       2 - 0 
        |   |
        8 - 1
       /
      12
      |
      10
```

We will first determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 12}
- Node 1: {8, 12, 18}
- Node 2: {0, 5}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 7, 16, 19}
- Node 4: {3, 15}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {7, 10, 11, 12, 19}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 11, 12, 13, 17}
- Node 8: {1, 5}
- Node 9: {13, 16, 18}
- Node 10: {6, 13}
- Node 11: {6, 7, 15, 16}
- Node 12: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 13: {9, 10, 15, 17}
- Node 14: {17}
- Node 15: {4, 11, 13}
- Node 16: {3, 9, 11}
- Node 17: {7, 13, 14}
- Node 18: {1, 9}
- Node 19: {3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 unique 3-stars: <3, (4, 5, 19)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 16, 11)>, <3, (5, 7, 12)>, <3, (5, 7, 19)>, <3, (7, 11, 16)>, <3, (7, 13, 17)>, <3, (7, 16, 9)>, <3, (13, 15, 17)>, and <3, (15, 11, 16)>
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 unique 3-stars: <6, (7, 10, 13)>, <6, (7, 10, 6)>, <6, (7, 12, 1)>, <6, (7, 12, 6)>, <6, (7, 12, 0)>, <6, (10, 13, 15)>, <6, (10, 13, 17)>, <6, (10, 13, 7)>, <6, (10, 6, 11)>, and <6, (12, 1, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20].
