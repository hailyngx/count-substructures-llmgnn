Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 8) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 15) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (0, 16) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 15) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (17, 4) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 10) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 10) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 9) (12, 5) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 16}
- Node 1: {8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 13, 18}
- Node 3: {7, 18, 19}
- Node 4: {10, 17, 19}
- Node 5: {6, 10, 12, 19}
- Node 6: {5, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {3, 10}
- Node 8: {1, 13, 15, 16}
- Node 9: {1, 10, 15}
- Node 10: {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 11: {6, 14, 15, 16}
- Node 12: {5}
- Node 13: {2, 8}
- Node 14: {6, 11, 15}
- Node 15: {8, 9, 11, 14, 18}
- Node 16: {0, 8, 11}
- Node 17: {4}
- Node 18: {2, 3, 15, 19}
- Node 19: {3, 4, 5, 18}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, 8, 9>
