Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 15) (5, 7) (9, 6) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 22) (6, 15) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 26) (20, 25) (20, 13) (20, 18) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 7) (0, 29) (0, 23) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 12) (21, 12) (21, 18) (21, 17) (28, 16) (28, 15) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 29) (7, 5) (7, 25) (7, 11) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 26) (14, 6) (14, 20) (14, 26) (26, 3) (26, 16) (26, 14) (26, 15) (27, 22) (27, 24) (27, 19) (2, 11) (2, 19) (22, 6) (22, 27) (17, 6) (17, 21) (17, 24) (17, 15) (24, 27) (24, 17) (24, 29) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 28) (15, 26) (15, 17) (18, 20) (18, 21) (18, 16) (18, 23) (18, 13) (23, 0) (23, 18) (23, 13) (23, 19) (19, 4) (19, 27) (19, 2) (19, 23) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 21) (13, 20) (13, 18) (13, 23) (29, 0) (29, 11) (29, 24) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 29, 23
Node 1: 3
Node 2: 11, 19
Node 3: 1, 11, 26
Node 4: 8, 11, 19
Node 5: 12, 15, 7
Node 6: 9, 17, 14, 22, 15
Node 7: 5, 25, 11
Node 8: 4, 12
Node 9: 6
Node 11: 3, 4, 7, 2, 29
Node 12: 5, 8, 21
Node 13: 20, 18, 23
Node 14: 6, 20, 26
Node 15: 5, 6, 28, 26, 17
Node 16: 28, 18, 26
Node 17: 6, 21, 24, 15
Node 18: 20, 21, 16, 23, 13
Node 19: 4, 27, 2, 23
Node 20: 25, 13, 18, 14
Node 21: 12, 18, 17
Node 22: 6, 27
Node 23: 0, 18, 13, 19
Node 24: 27, 17, 29
Node 25: 20, 7
Node 26: 3, 16, 14, 15
Node 27: 22, 24, 19
Node 28: 16, 15
Node 29: 0, 11, 24

Now we can identify the 3-stars formed:

1. Node 4: <4, (8, 11, 19)>
2. Node 5: <5, (12, 15, 7)>
3. Node 6: <6, (9, 17, 14)>, <6, (9, 17, 22)>, <6, (9, 14, 22)>, <6, (17, 14, 22)>, <6, (17, 14, 15)>, <6, (17, 22, 15)>, <6, (14, 22, 15)>, <6, (14, 22, 26)>, <6, (14, 15, 26)>, <6, (22, 15, 26)>
4. Node 15: <15, (5, 6, 28)>, <15, (5, 6, 26)>, <15, (5, 6, 17)>, <15, (5, 28, 26)>, <15, (5, 26, 17)>, <15, (5, 17, 28)>, <15, (6, 28, 26)>, <15, (6, 28, 17)>
5. Node 18: <18, (20, 13, 23)>, <18, (20, 13, 19)>, <18, (20, 23, 19)>, <18, (13, 23, 19)>, <18, (21, 17, 24)>, <18, (16, 26, 14)>
6. Node 23: <23, (0, 13, 19)>, <23, (18, 13, 19)>
7. Node 24: <24, (27, 17, 29)>
8. Node 26: <26, (3, 16, 14)>, <26, (3, 14, 15)>, <26, (3, 16, 15)>, <26, (16, 14, 15)>, <26, (16, 14, 28)>
9. Node 29: <29, (0, 11, 24)>

The total number of 3-stars is 24, so the final answer is [24].
