Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
Firstly, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 94

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [94].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <9, (0, 1, 4)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <1, (4, 8, 3)>
- <1, (4, 8, 5)>
- <1, (3, 8, 5)>
- <3, (4, 8, 5)>
- <5, (0, 2, 8)>
