Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 17) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 11) (15, 8) (10, 6) (10, 13) (5, 19) (19, 8) (19, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 18) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 14) (12, 2) (12, 16) (14, 11) (14, 16) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 3) (18, 0) (13, 4) (13, 10) (17, 9) (17, 4) (17, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {6, 8, 3, 18}
- Node 1: {9, 7, 11}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 3: {11, 0, 18}
- Node 4: {7, 13, 17}
- Node 5: {19}
- Node 6: {9, 10, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 2, 1, 17}
- Node 8: {2, 19, 15, 0, 18}
- Node 9: {6, 18, 17, 16, 1}
- Node 10: {6, 13}
- Node 11: {3, 14, 1}
- Node 12: {2, 16}
- Node 13: {4, 10}
- Node 14: {11, 16}
- Node 15: {8}
- Node 16: {9, 12, 14}
- Node 17: {9, 4, 7}
- Node 18: {9, 8, 3, 0}
- Node 19: {8, 5}

Nodes 0, 1, 2, 8, 9, 18 have 5 or more neighbors, resulting in a total of \( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 48 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (6, 8, 18)>
- <1, (9, 7, 11)>
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <8, (2, 19, 15)>
- <9, (6, 18, 17)>
- <18, (8, 3, 0)>
