Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 10) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 0) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's identify the 3-star structures:

1. Node 0 has neighbors: {9, 1, 8, 12, 4}
    - There are 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
2. Node 2 has neighbors: {13, 12, 14}
    - There are 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
3. Node 3 has neighbors: {1, 14, 13}
    - There are 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
4. Node 4 has neighbors: {5, 9, 1, 13, 0}
    - There are 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
5. Node 6 has neighbors: {5, 9, 10, 11, 12}
    - There are 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
6. Node 8 has neighbors: {10, 13, 14, 0}
    - There are 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
7. Node 12 has neighbors: {9, 6, 1, 2, 0}
    - There are 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
1. <0, (9, 1, 8)>
2. <0, (9, 1, 12)>
3. <0, (9, 8, 12)>
4. <0, (1, 8, 12)>
5. <0, (1, 12, 4)>
6. <2, (13, 12, 14)>
7. <3, (1, 13, 14)>
8. <4, (5, 9, 13)>
9. <4, (9, 1, 13)>
10. <4, (9, 1, 0)>
11. <4, (1, 13, 0)>
12. <6, (5, 9, 12)>
13. <6, (5, 10, 11)>
14. <6, (9, 10, 11)>
15. <6, (9, 11, 12)>
16. <6, (10, 11, 12)>
17. <8, (10, 13, 14)>
18. <12, (9, 1, 0)>
19. <12, (9, 1, 4)>
20. <12, (1, 2, 0)>
21. <12, (1, 2, 4)>
