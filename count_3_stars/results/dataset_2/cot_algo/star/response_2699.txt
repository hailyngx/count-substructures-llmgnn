Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 4) (16, 18) (15, 27) (15, 13) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 7) (27, 9) (27, 23) (27, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 20) (9, 11) (9, 27) (9, 6) (9, 18) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 29) (25, 13) (25, 4) (10, 12) (10, 1) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 17) (22, 12) (23, 27) (4, 11) (4, 25) (4, 18) (8, 27) (8, 20) (1, 10) (1, 26) (26, 22) (26, 1) (26, 28) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 22) (14, 0) (14, 24) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 17) (28, 26) (28, 2) (28, 20) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 5) (21, 20) (21, 2) (7, 11) (7, 27) (7, 13) (7, 17) (2, 6) (2, 28) (2, 5) (2, 21) (20, 6) (20, 8) (20, 28) (20, 21) (24, 14) (24, 17) (29, 3) (29, 13) (13, 15) (13, 25) (13, 7) (13, 29) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 22) (12, 18) (17, 22) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 7) (17, 24) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {14, 17}
- Node 1: {10, 26}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 21, 28}
- Node 3: {5, 12, 13, 29}
- Node 4: {11, 18, 25}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 19}
- Node 6: {2, 9, 20}
- Node 7: {11, 13, 17, 27}
- Node 8: {20, 27}
- Node 9: {6, 11, 18, 27}
- Node 10: {1, 12}
- Node 11: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 12: {3, 10, 18, 22}
- Node 13: {7, 15, 25, 29}
- Node 14: {0, 22, 24}
- Node 15: {12, 13, 27}
- Node 16: {18}
- Node 17: {7, 14, 18, 24}
- Node 18: {4, 9, 12, 17}
- Node 19: {5}
- Node 20: {6, 8, 21, 28}
- Node 21: {2, 20}
- Node 22: {12, 14, 16, 26}
- Node 23: {27}
- Node 24: {14, 17}
- Node 25: {4, 13}
- Node 26: {1, 22, 28}
- Node 27: {7, 8, 9, 15, 23}
- Node 28: {2, 20, 26}
- Node 29: {3, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 46

Therefore, the final answer is [46] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (5, 6, 21)>, <2, (5, 6, 28)>, <2, (5, 21, 28)>, <2, (6, 21, 28)>, <3, (5, 12, 13)>, <7, (11, 13, 17)>, <12, (10, 18, 22)>, <13, (7, 15, 25)>, <17, (7, 14, 18)>, <18, (9, 12, 17)>, <20, (6, 8, 21)>, <22, (12, 14, 16)>, <27, (9, 15, 23)>.
