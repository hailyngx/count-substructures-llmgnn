Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 12) (13, 24) (22, 28) (0, 27) (0, 25) (0, 18) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 7) (27, 19) (2, 19) (2, 20) (2, 14) (8, 25) (17, 29) (17, 9) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 21) (26, 25) (26, 6) (26, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (18, 0) (6, 26) (6, 21) (6, 20) (21, 13) (21, 29) (21, 6) (21, 16) (21, 23) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 16) (19, 27) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 5) (19, 7) (15, 25) (16, 21) (16, 5) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 10) (28, 22) (28, 24) (28, 23) (7, 27) (7, 19) (7, 11) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 9) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 12) (14, 2) (14, 12) (12, 13) (12, 26) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 20) (20, 2) (20, 6) (20, 12) (20, 24) (9, 17) (9, 11) (9, 23) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 23) (24, 13) (24, 27) (24, 28) (24, 20) (23, 21) (23, 28) (23, 9) (23, 10) (25, 0) (25, 8) (25, 26) (25, 15) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 27, 25, 18
- Node 1: 4, 11, 10
- Node 2: 19, 20, 14
- Node 3: 4, 10, 12
- Node 4: 1, 3
- Node 5: 19, 11, 16
- Node 6: 26, 21, 20
- Node 7: 27, 19, 11
- Node 8: 25
- Node 9: 17, 11, 23
- Node 10: 1, 3, 23
- Node 11: 5, 1, 7, 9
- Node 12: 13, 26, 3, 14, 20
- Node 13: 21, 12, 24
- Node 14: 2, 12
- Node 15: 25
- Node 16: 21, 5
- Node 17: 29, 9
- Node 18: 0
- Node 19: 27, 2, 29, 5, 7
- Node 20: 2, 6, 12, 24
- Node 21: 13, 29, 6, 16, 23
- Node 22: 28
- Node 23: 21, 28, 9, 10
- Node 24: 13, 27, 28, 20
- Node 25: 0, 8, 26, 15
- Node 26: 25, 6, 12
- Node 27: 0, 24, 7, 19
- Node 28: 22, 24, 23
- Node 29: 17, 19, 21

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 13: (12, 24, 21)
- Node 19: (27, 29, 7), <5, 19, 29>
- Node 21: (13, 29, 6), (16, 21, 23)
- Node 24: (27, 28, 20)

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [7].
