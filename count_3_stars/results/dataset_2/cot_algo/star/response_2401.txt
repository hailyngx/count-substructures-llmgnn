Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (14, 17) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 10) (18, 5) (18, 2) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 16) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 15) (0, 5) (0, 6) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 13) (19, 2) (15, 16) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 12) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (10, 2) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 1
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 6
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 1

Now, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {5, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 8, 15}
- Node 2: {6, 10, 11, 18, 19}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 4: {11, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 9, 18}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {12, 15, 16}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6, 8, 17}
- Node 9: {3, 5}
- Node 10: {2}
- Node 11: {2, 4}
- Node 12: {4, 7, 15, 16}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 14}
- Node 14: {13, 17}
- Node 15: {1, 7, 12, 15, 16, 17}
- Node 16: {7, 12, 15}
- Node 17: {8, 14, 15}
- Node 18: {2, 5, 19}
- Node 19: {2, 18}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 8, 17>, <2, 12, 15>, <2, 15, 17>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 8, 17>, <3, 13, 7>, <3, 13, 4>, <4, 13, 14>, <6, 2, 8>, <6, 3, 8>, <8, 1, 15>, <12, 15, 16>, <14, 13, 17>, <15, 7, 16>, <15, 12, 16>.
