Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 6, 2}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 5, 6, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 0, 1, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {9, 5, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 5: {4, 1, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 2, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {8, 1}
- Node 8: {7, 6, 1}
- Node 9: {4, 2, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

1. Node 1: Selecting 3 neighbors out of {4, 7, 5, 6, 2, 8} gives only one combination: {4, 5, 7} forming <1, (4, 5, 7)>.
2. Node 2: Selecting 3 neighbors out of {4, 6, 0, 1, 9} gives \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) combinations. However, when we check these combinations, we see that none of them form a 3-star.
3. Node 6: Selecting 3 neighbors out of {1, 3, 2, 8, 0} gives \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) combinations. None of these combinations form a 3-star.
4. Node 9: Selecting 3 neighbors out of {4, 2, 3} gives only one combination: {2, 3, 4} forming <9, (2, 3, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (4, 5, 7)> and <9, (2, 3, 4)>.
