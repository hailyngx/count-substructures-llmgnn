Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (10, 9) (10, 12) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (11, 6) (11, 2) 

Response:
In this graph, each node has the following neighbors:
- Node 0: {6, 9, 14, 8}
- Node 1: {6, 9, 4, 12, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 3, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {5, 2, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 12, 1}
- Node 5: {6, 12, 4, 3, 7, 14}
- Node 6: {5, 1, 11, 0, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 5, 1, 13, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 14, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 10, 1, 13, 0}
- Node 10: {9, 12}
- Node 11: {6, 2}
- Node 12: {5, 4, 10, 1}
- Node 13: {9, 14, 7, 2}
- Node 14: {5, 0, 8, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 74

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [74].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 6, 9, 14>
- <1, 6, 9, 4>
- <1, 6, 9, 12>
- <1, 9, 4, 12>
- <1, 6, 4, 12>
- <1, 5, 7, 6>
- <1, 12, 4, 5>
- <5, 6, 7, 14>
- <5, 7, 6, 14>
- <5, 6, 4, 12>
- <5, 6, 3, 14>
- <5, 12, 4, 1>
- <5, 14, 0, 8>
- <7, 6, 1, 13>
- <7, 6, 5, 13>
- <9, 2, 13, 14>
- <9, 13, 14, 7>
