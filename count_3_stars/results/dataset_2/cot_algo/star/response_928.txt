Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 7) (27, 3) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 18) (0, 27) (0, 17) (0, 22) (0, 5) (22, 0) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 2) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 17) (1, 20) (1, 14) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 29) (20, 28) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 24) (26, 22) (26, 13) (26, 5) (26, 10) (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 25) (13, 16) (11, 2) (28, 20) (28, 9) (4, 27) (4, 6) (7, 15) (7, 25) (25, 13) (25, 7) (25, 10) (17, 0) (17, 23) (17, 5) (17, 8) (9, 28) (9, 29) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 5) (2, 22) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 16) (5, 0) (5, 26) (5, 17) (5, 29) (10, 26) (10, 25) (10, 6) (10, 8) (18, 27) (18, 14) (18, 6) (18, 21) (19, 2) (19, 12) (24, 14) (21, 18) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 12) (12, 22) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 8) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 18) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: 27, 22, 5, 17
- Node 1: 20, 14
- Node 2: 22, 11, 19, 16
- Node 3: 15, 27, 16
- Node 4: 27, 6
- Node 5: 0, 26, 17, 29
- Node 6: 4, 10, 18
- Node 7: 15, 25
- Node 8: 17, 10, 12
- Node 9: 28, 29
- Node 10: 26, 25, 6, 8
- Node 11: 2
- Node 12: 22, 13, 19, 8
- Node 13: 26, 12, 25, 16
- Node 14: 1, 18, 24
- Node 15: 3, 20, 7
- Node 16: 3, 2, 13
- Node 17: 0, 23, 5, 8
- Node 18: 27, 14, 6, 21
- Node 19: 2, 12
- Node 20: 15, 1, 29, 28
- Node 21: 18
- Node 22: 0, 23, 26, 2, 12
- Node 23: 22, 17
- Node 24: 14
- Node 25: 13, 7, 10
- Node 26: 22, 13, 5, 10
- Node 27: 3, 0, 4, 18
- Node 28: 20, 9
- Node 29: 20, 9, 5

Now, let's count the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 45 \).

Therefore, the final result is [45], and the unique 3-stars are:

<0, (17, 22, 27)>, <0, (5, 22, 26)>, <0, (17, 22, 5)>, <0, (17, 5, 29)>, <2, (12, 19, 22)>, <5, (0, 26, 29)>, <10, (6, 8, 10)>, <12, (12, 19, 22)>, <13, (13, 16, 26)>, <15, (3, 7, 20)>, <16, (2, 13, 16)>, <18, (18, 21, 27)>, <20, (1, 28, 29)>, <22, (12, 19, 22)>, <26, (10, 13, 26)>, <27, (4, 18, 27)>, <29, (9, 20, 29)>
