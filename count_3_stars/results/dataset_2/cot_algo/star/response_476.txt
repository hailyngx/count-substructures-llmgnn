Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (3, 18) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 8) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 10) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 6) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 19) (0, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 13) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 16) (16, 14) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 9) (19, 3) (19, 6) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 13) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 18) (18, 3) (18, 16) (18, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {10}
Node 1: {4, 10}
Node 2: {6, 7, 9, 14}
Node 3: {18, 19}
Node 4: {1, 5, 8, 11}
Node 5: {4, 6, 12, 17}
Node 6: {2, 5, 8, 19}
Node 7: {2}
Node 8: {4, 6, 17}
Node 9: {2, 13, 16}
Node 10: {0, 1, 12, 16}
Node 11: {4, 13, 14}
Node 12: {5, 10, 13}
Node 13: {9, 11, 12, 18}
Node 14: {2, 11, 16, 17}
Node 16: {10, 14, 18, 9}
Node 17: {5, 8, 14, 6}
Node 18: {3, 13, 16}
Node 19: {3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [33].
