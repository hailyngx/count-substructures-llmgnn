Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 13) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:

1: 5, 4, 8
2: 7, 6, 10, 3, 13
3: 2, 12, 8
4: 9, 7, 10, 1, 14
5: 9, 6, 12, 1, 0, 14
6: 5, 2, 8
7: 4, 10, 14, 0, 2
8: 6, 10, 3, 1
9: 5, 4, 0
10: 4, 7, 11, 8, 2, 14
11: 10, 14
12: 5, 3, 13
13: 2, 12, 0
14: 4, 7, 10, 11, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the final number inside brackets [] is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 1, 4)>, <4, (9, 10, 7)>, <10, (4, 14, 7)>, <14, (4, 10, 11)>
