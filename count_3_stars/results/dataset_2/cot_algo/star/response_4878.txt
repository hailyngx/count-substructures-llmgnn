Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 15) (1, 19) (3, 18) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 11) (17, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 15) (4, 12) (4, 11) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 7) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 9) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 11) (15, 1) (15, 13) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 0) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 19) (16, 14) (16, 18) (18, 3) (18, 14) (18, 0) (18, 16) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 20 nodes with 60 edges, let's first list the neighbors for each node:

1: 15, 19
2: 8, 17, 7
3: 18
4: 12, 11
5: 7, 19, 10
6: 9, 10
7: 17, 11, 2, 5
8: 2, 0
9: 6, 19, 12
10: 6, 5, 0
11: 14, 17, 4, 7, 19
12: 9, 13, 4, 0
13: 12, 15
14: 17, 11, 18, 16
15: 1, 13
16: 14, 18
17: 14, 2, 11, 7
18: 3, 14, 0, 16
19: 9, 1, 5, 11

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2, 4, 5, 7, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, and 19 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star (with 17, 7, 2) 
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star (with 19, 7, 5)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (with 17, 11, 2), (17, 11, 4), (17, 11, 19), (11, 4, 19)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (with 17, 7, 4), (17, 7, 19), (17, 4, 19), (7, 4,19)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star (with 9, 4, 13)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (with 17, 18, 16), (17, 18, 14), (17, 16, 14), (18, 16, 14)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (with 14, 11, 7), (14, 11, 19), (14, 7, 19), (11, 7, 19)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (with 14, 16, 3), (14, 16, 18), (14, 3, 18), (16, 3, 18)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (with 9, 11, 5), (9, 11, 19), (9, 5, 19), (11, 5, 19)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 25.

Therefore, the final answer is [25].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, 17, 7>, <5, 19, 7>, < 9, 4, 13 >, < 17, 18, 16 >, < 14, 16, 18 >, < 14, 3, 18 >, < 16, 3, 18 >, < 14, 11, 7 >, < 14, 11, 19 >, < 14, 7, 19 >, < 16, 18, 14 >, < 9, 11, 19 >, < 9, 5, 19 >, < 11, 5, 19 >.
