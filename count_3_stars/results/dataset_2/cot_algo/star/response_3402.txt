Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4
- Node 6: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

Thus, the final answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <3, 5, 4>
- <6, 8, 7>
- <6, 8, 0>
