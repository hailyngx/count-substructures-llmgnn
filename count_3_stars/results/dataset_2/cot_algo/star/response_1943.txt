Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 12) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) 

Response:
First, letâ€™s find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 14}
- Node 1: {11, 2, 12}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 10, 14, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {5, 4, 10, 2, 12}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 13, 3, 2}
- Node 5: {12, 11, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 6, 4, 8, 2}
- Node 8: {6, 7, 12}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 11, 13, 7}
- Node 10: {3, 13, 2}
- Node 11: {5, 9, 1}
- Node 12: {5, 8, 13, 1, 3}
- Node 13: {9, 4, 10, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 5, 9, 12 have 3 neighbors each, so they can form 1, 1, and 1 3-stars respectively.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars found: 
- <5, (12, 11, 0)>
- <9, (6, 4, 11)>
- <12, (8, 13, 1)>
