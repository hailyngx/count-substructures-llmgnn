Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 10) (21, 7) (21, 19) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 27) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 26) (27, 13) (27, 12) (27, 20) (4, 8) (4, 0) (2, 12) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 23) (19, 21) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 6) (26, 12) (26, 19) (26, 10) (1, 5) (1, 28) (1, 24) (17, 28) (17, 9) (17, 15) (9, 17) (9, 29) (9, 23) (22, 28) (22, 10) (22, 0) (22, 15) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 20) (16, 12) (16, 20) (28, 1) (28, 17) (28, 22) (28, 23) (29, 9) (29, 5) (29, 23) (29, 24) (10, 7) (10, 26) (10, 22) (10, 15) (15, 17) (15, 22) (15, 10) (0, 4) (0, 22) (0, 3) (11, 19) (11, 3) (6, 19) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 25) (24, 1) (24, 29) (24, 6) (24, 25) (14, 6) (14, 5) (23, 18) (23, 9) (23, 28) (23, 29) (5, 1) (5, 29) (5, 14) (20, 27) (20, 3) (20, 16) (25, 6) (25, 24) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 22}
- Node 1: {5, 24, 28}
- Node 2: {12, 18}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 11, 20}
- Node 4: {0, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 14, 29}
- Node 6: {14, 19, 24, 25}
- Node 7: {10, 21}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 13}
- Node 9: {15, 17, 23, 29}
- Node 10: {7, 15, 22, 26}
- Node 11: {3, 19}
- Node 12: {2, 16, 26, 27}
- Node 13: {8, 27}
- Node 14: {5, 6}
- Node 15: {9, 10, 17, 22}
- Node 16: {12, 20}
- Node 17: {9, 15, 28}
- Node 18: {2, 23}
- Node 19: {6, 11, 21, 26}
- Node 20: {3, 16, 27}
- Node 21: {7, 19}
- Node 22: {0, 10, 15, 28}
- Node 23: {9, 18, 28, 29}
- Node 24: {1, 6, 25, 29}
- Node 25: {6, 24}
- Node 26: {10, 12, 19}
- Node 27: {12, 13, 20}
- Node 28: {1, 17, 22, 23}
- Node 29: {5, 9, 23, 24}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 22, and 28 each have 3 neighbors, so they can each form a 3-star. (3 3-stars)
- Node 3, 8, 15, 19, 23, and 29 each have 4 neighbors, so they can each form 4 3-stars. (24 3-stars)
- Node 12, 16, 20, and 27 each have 4 neighbors, so they can each form 4 3-stars. (16 3-stars)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. (4 3-stars)
- Node 5, 9, and 24 each have 4 neighbors, so they can each form 4 3-stars. (12 3-stars)
- Node 1, 10, and 26 each have 4 neighbors, so they can each form 4 3-stars. (12 3-stars)
- Node 4, 7, 11, 14, 17, 18, and 21 each have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 3 + 24 + 16 + 4 + 12 + 12 = 71

Therefore, the final answer is [71]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 3, 22, 28>, <3, 8, 11, 19>, <3, 8, 15, 20>, <3, 8, 15, 27>, <3, 8, 19, 23>, <3, 8, 19, 29>, <3, 15, 17, 22>, <3, 15, 17, 28>, <3, 19, 21, 26>, <3, 19, 26, 27>, <8, 12, 16, 20>, <8, 12, 16, 27>, <8, 12, 20, 27>, <8, 16, 20, 27>, <15, 22, 24, 28>, <15, 23, 24, 29>, <19, 24, 25, 29>, <5, 24, 25, 29>, <5, 6, 24, 29>, <5, 6, 24, 25>, <1, 6, 24, 25>, <1, 6, 24, 29>, <1, 5, 24, 29>, <1, 5, 14, 29>, <1, 5, 14, 6>, <10, 12, 26, 27>, <10, 12, 19, 26>, <10, 19, 21, 26>, <10, 19, 21, 21>, <10, 26, 21, 27>.
