Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 2) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 4) (7, 11) (7, 15) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 14) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 13) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 3) (19, 11) (19, 18) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 15) (2, 11) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 16) (15, 14) (4, 17) (4, 6) (4, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 0) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 15) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 13, 17}
- Node 1: {6, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 2: {11}
- Node 3: {6, 8, 18}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 17}
- Node 5: {9, 14, 18}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {11, 15}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 9, 15}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 8, 16}
- Node 10: {11, 17}
- Node 11: {2, 7, 10, 19}
- Node 12: {13, 14, 16}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 12}
- Node 14: {5, 12, 15}
- Node 15: {7, 8, 14, 16}
- Node 16: {9, 12, 15}
- Node 17: {0, 4, 10}
- Node 18: {3, 5, 19}
- Node 19: {11, 18}

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1, Node 5, Node 8, and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars each. (4 choose 3 = 4)
- Node 0, Node 4, Node 6, Node 11, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, and Node 18 have 3 neighbors each, so they can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star each. (3 choose 3 = 1)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
4 * 4 + 9 * 1 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (6, 8, 13)>
- <5, (9, 14, 18)>
- <8, (1, 9, 15)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 13, 17)>
- <4, (0, 6, 17)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <11, (2, 7, 10)>
- <13, (0, 12, 1)>
- <14, (5, 12, 15)>
- <15, (7, 8, 16)>
