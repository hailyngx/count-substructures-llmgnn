Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 20) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 10) (13, 22) (13, 24) (13, 7) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 25) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 6) (29, 15) (18, 28) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 2) (10, 14) (23, 22) (23, 2) (23, 3) (23, 21) (23, 0) (12, 27) (12, 15) (27, 12) (27, 3) (3, 23) (3, 27) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 9) (25, 22) (25, 3) (0, 23) (0, 24) (6, 29) (6, 1) (6, 19) (28, 18) (28, 3) (5, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (20, 11) (20, 29) (20, 1) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 15) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 21) (19, 17) (14, 10) (14, 26) (14, 4) (14, 15) (26, 14) (26, 21) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 20) (1, 24) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 9) (24, 13) (24, 0) (24, 8) (24, 1) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 21) (15, 29) (15, 12) (15, 8) (15, 14) (21, 23) (21, 19) (21, 26) (21, 9) (4, 16) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {23, 24}
- Node 1: {6, 7, 20, 24}
- Node 2: {10, 23, 29}
- Node 3: {9, 23, 25, 27, 28}
- Node 4: {14, 16}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {1, 19, 29}
- Node 7: {1, 13}
- Node 8: {5, 15, 19, 24}
- Node 9: {3, 17, 21}
- Node 10: {2, 11, 14, 16}
- Node 11: {10, 20}
- Node 12: {15, 27}
- Node 13: {7, 22, 24}
- Node 14: {4, 10, 15, 26}
- Node 15: {8, 12, 14, 29}
- Node 16: {4, 10, 17}
- Node 17: {9, 16, 19}
- Node 18: {28}
- Node 19: {6, 8, 17, 21}
- Node 20: {1, 11, 29}
- Node 21: {9, 19, 23, 26}
- Node 22: {13, 23, 25}
- Node 23: {0, 2, 3, 21, 22}
- Node 24: {0, 1, 8, 13}
- Node 25: {3, 22}
- Node 26: {14, 21}
- Node 27: {3, 12}
- Node 28: {3, 18}
- Node 29: {2, 6, 15, 20}

Now let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars around them:

- Node 2, Node 3, Node 10, Node 14, Node 15, and Node 19 each have 4 neighbors, so they can each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( 6 \times 4 = 24 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (10, 23, 29)>
- <3, (9, 23, 25)>
- <10, (2, 14, 16)>
- <14, (10, 14, 15)>
- <15, (8, 14, 29)>
- <19, (6, 17, 21)>
