Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 62

Therefore, the final answer is [62].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <5, (2, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
