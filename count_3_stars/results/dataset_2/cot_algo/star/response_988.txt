Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 26) (11, 17) (16, 22) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 6) (3, 25) (3, 0) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 12) (25, 10) (2, 16) (2, 8) (2, 28) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 20) (8, 21) (8, 27) (9, 22) (9, 4) (9, 21) (22, 16) (22, 9) (22, 10) (22, 15) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 16) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 18) (1, 23) (1, 19) (1, 7) (17, 11) (17, 24) (17, 18) (29, 26) (29, 14) (29, 24) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 15) (27, 25) (27, 8) (26, 11) (26, 29) (26, 23) (23, 1) (23, 26) (15, 22) (15, 13) (15, 19) (0, 3) (0, 12) (4, 9) (20, 8) (20, 21) (21, 8) (21, 9) (21, 20) (21, 14) (7, 1) (7, 24) (7, 28) (24, 17) (24, 29) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 14) (28, 2) (28, 7) (28, 18) (12, 25) (12, 0) (12, 24) (10, 25) (10, 22) (10, 18) (18, 13) (18, 17) (18, 28) (18, 10) (6, 16) (14, 29) (14, 21) (14, 24) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:

  - Node 8: <8, (2, 19, 27)>, <8, (19, 21, 27)>, <8, (2, 21, 27)>, <8, (8, 19, 27)>
  - Node 24: <24, (17, 29, 7)>, <24, (7, 14, 24)>, <24, (7, 28, 24)>, <24, (7, 24, 28)>, <24, (14, 21, 24)>, <24, (14, 29, 24)>
  - Node 25: <25, (3, 10, 27)>, <25, (3, 12, 27)>, <25, (10, 12, 25)>
  - Node 26: <26, (11, 23, 29)>, <26, (29, 23, 26)>, <26, (11, 26, 29)>, <26, (11, 23, 26)>
  - Node 18: <18, (10, 13, 28)>, <18, (10, 17, 18)>, <18, (13, 17, 18)>
  
Counting all the unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
