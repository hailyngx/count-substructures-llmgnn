Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 7}

Next, we will identify nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us [42].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
