Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 4) (14, 16) (14, 13) (17, 19) (17, 15) (17, 18) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 11) (4, 15) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 15) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 3) (16, 14) (16, 19) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 18) (10, 12) (10, 19) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 15) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 10) (1, 5) (1, 0) (15, 17) (15, 4) (15, 2) (15, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 9, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 5}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 12, 15}
- Node 3: {7, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {11, 14, 15, 18}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 9, 11}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 9: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 10: {12, 18, 19}
- Node 11: {0, 4, 7, 15}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 10}
- Node 13: {3, 8, 14}
- Node 14: {4, 13, 16}
- Node 15: {2, 4, 11, 17}
- Node 16: {14, 19}
- Node 17: {15, 18, 19}
- Node 18: {4, 10, 17}
- Node 19: {10, 16, 17}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 0 3-stars
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 0 3-stars
- Node 10: 0 3-stars
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 0 3-stars
- Node 13: 0 3-stars
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 0 3-stars
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 0 3-stars

Adding them up, we have a total of 10 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 9, 11>
- <1, 5, 2>
- <2, 8, 5>
- <3, 7, 12>
- <4, 14, 13>
- <5, 1, 0>
- <7, 0, 11>
- <8, 9, 2>
- <11, 0, 4>
- <15, 4, 11>
