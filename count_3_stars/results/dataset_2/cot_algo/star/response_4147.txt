Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) 

Response:
The 3-star graph formed by the given data is as follows:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 5, 4, 2, 6
- Node 1 has neighbors: 5, 4, 8, 2, 6
- Node 2 has neighbors: 9, 0, 1
- Node 3 has neighbors: 5, 4, 0, 6
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3
- Node 5 has neighbors: 9, 8, 1, 0, 3
- Node 6 has neighbors: 7, 0, 1, 3
- Node 7 has neighbors: 9, 6
- Node 8 has neighbors: 5, 9, 1
- Node 9 has neighbors: 5, 8, 2, 7, 0

Node 0, with 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1, with 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3, with 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5, with 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6, with 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9, with 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 42 \). 

Therefore, the answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 4, 2)>
<1, (5, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 4, 2)>
<1, (5, 8, 2)>
<1, (4, 8, 2)>
<3, (5, 4, 0)>
<5, (9, 8, 1)>
<5, (9, 1, 0)>
<5, (8, 1, 0)>
<6, (7, 1, 0)>
<9, (8, 2, 7)>
<9, (2, 1, 0)>
<9, (1, 7, 0)>
