Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 24) (15, 3) (15, 5) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 19) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 16) (1, 27) (1, 26) (1, 7) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 29) (26, 11) (26, 4) (4, 26) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 8) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 25) (8, 18) (8, 2) (8, 28) (19, 0) (19, 26) (19, 23) (19, 9) (17, 27) (17, 4) (17, 13) (17, 9) (11, 0) (11, 26) (11, 23) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 29) (23, 19) (23, 11) (16, 0) (16, 27) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 5) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 6) (6, 12) (6, 29) (24, 3) (24, 25) (9, 19) (9, 17) (9, 20) (29, 26) (29, 13) (29, 6) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 10) (7, 1) (7, 14) (21, 13) (21, 5) (20, 9) (14, 16) (14, 7) (14, 25) (22, 0) (22, 27) (22, 10) (25, 2) (25, 24) (25, 14) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 21) (10, 2) (10, 28) (10, 22) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 16, 11, 22, 19
Node 1: 27, 26, 7
Node 2: 8, 10, 25
Node 3: 15, 28, 24
Node 4: 26, 18, 12, 17
Node 5: 15, 16, 21
Node 6: 12, 29
Node 7: 1, 14
Node 8: 18, 2, 28
Node 9: 19, 17, 20
Node 10: 2, 28, 22
Node 11: 0, 26, 23
Node 12: 4, 16, 6
Node 13: 17, 21, 29
Node 14: 16, 7, 25
Node 15: 3, 5
Node 16: 0, 27, 12, 5, 14
Node 17: 27, 4, 13, 9
Node 18: 4, 8
Node 19: 0, 26, 23, 9
Node 20: 9
Node 21: 13, 5
Node 22: 0, 27, 10
Node 23: 19, 11
Node 24: 3, 25
Node 25: 2, 14, 24
Node 26: 1, 19, 29, 11, 4
Node 27: 22, 17, 1, 16
Node 28: 8, 10, 3
Node 29: 26, 13, 6

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors (1 3-star)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (no 3-star)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (no 3-star)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (no 3-star)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (1 3-star)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (no 3-star)
- Node 16: 5 neighbors (10 3-stars)
- Node 17: 4 neighbors (1 3-star)
- Node 19: 4 neighbors (1 3-star)
- Node 26: 5 neighbors (10 3-stars)
- Node 27: 4 neighbors (1 3-star)
- Node 28: 3 neighbors (no 3-star)
- Node 29: 3 neighbors (no 3-star)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

Unique 3-stars found:

- <16, (27, 5, 5)>
- <16, (27, 7, 14)>
