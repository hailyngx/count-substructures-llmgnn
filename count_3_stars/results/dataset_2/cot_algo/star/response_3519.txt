Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node. Then, for nodes with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of.

Here is the neighbor set for each node:

1. Node 0 neighbors: 11, 24, 28, 19
2. Node 1 neighbors: 28, 13
3. Node 2 neighbors: 18
4. Node 3 neighbors: 5, 23, 27
5. Node 4 neighbors: 7, 24
6. Node 5 neighbors: 29, 28, 3
7. Node 6 neighbors: 22, 12, 19, 26
8. Node 7 neighbors: 4, 29, 23
9. Node 8 neighbors: 15, 22, 26
10. Node 9 neighbors: 25, 12
11. Node 10 neighbors: 15, 27, 19, 23
12. Node 11 neighbors: 24, 0
13. Node 12 neighbors: 17, 6, 9, 21
14. Node 13 neighbors: 16, 20, 1, 19
15. Node 14 neighbors: 17, 27, 28
16. Node 15 neighbors: 10, 8, 24
17. Node 16 neighbors: 13
18. Node 17 neighbors: 14, 12, 26
19. Node 18 neighbors: 2
20. Node 19 neighbors: 10, 25, 0, 13, 6
21. Node 20 neighbors: 23, 13
22. Node 21 neighbors: 25, 27, 12
23. Node 22 neighbors: 8, 6
24. Node 23 neighbors: 10, 7, 3, 20
25. Node 25 neighbors: 9, 19, 21
26. Node 26 neighbors: 6, 17, 8
27. Node 27 neighbors: 29, 10, 21, 3, 14
28. Node 28 neighbors: 5, 0, 1, 14
29. Node 29 neighbors: 7, 27, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 15: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 19: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 21: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 23: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 24: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 27: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 28: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 29: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
