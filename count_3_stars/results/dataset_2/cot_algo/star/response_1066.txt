Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 20) (1, 24) (1, 18) (1, 7) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 26) (21, 17) (5, 22) (5, 28) (5, 16) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 24) (8, 13) (8, 25) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 14) (22, 5) (22, 23) (22, 2) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 19) (4, 9) (28, 5) (28, 7) (28, 15) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 26) (7, 1) (7, 28) (7, 12) (12, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 18) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 27) (14, 19) (17, 21) (17, 29) (17, 6) (11, 23) (11, 25) (2, 9) (2, 22) (2, 16) (2, 25) (16, 21) (16, 5) (16, 0) (16, 2) (6, 17) (6, 26) (6, 27) (6, 20) (24, 1) (24, 9) (10, 26) (26, 21) (26, 29) (26, 6) (26, 10) (26, 20) (19, 23) (19, 29) (19, 14) (20, 1) (20, 6) (20, 26) (15, 28) (15, 18) (27, 14) (27, 6) (3, 13) (3, 18) (18, 1) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 3) (25, 8) (25, 11) (25, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first construct the neighborhood sets for each node:

1: {21, 20, 24, 18, 7}
2: {9, 22, 23, 16, 25}
3: {13, 18}
4: {9}
5: {22, 28, 16}
6: {17, 26, 27, 20}
7: {1, 28, 12}
8: {13, 25, 0}
9: {4, 2, 24}
10: {26}
11: {23, 25}
12: {7}
13: {8, 3, 14}
14: {13, 0, 27, 19}
15: {28, 18}
16: {21, 5, 0, 2}
17: {6, 29, 21}
18: {1, 0, 15, 3}
19: {23, 29, 14}
20: {6, 26, 1}
21: {1, 16, 26, 17}
22: {5, 23, 2}
23: {22, 11, 19}
24: {1, 9}
25: {8, 11, 2}
26: {21, 29, 6, 10, 20}
27: {14, 6}
28: {5, 7, 15}
29: {17, 19, 26}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 1: <1, (18, 7, 21)>, <1, (20, 1, 24)>, <1, (21, 1, 7)>, <1, (21, 16, 26)>, <1, (21, 17, 29)> (5 3-stars)
Node 5: <5, (16, 5, 22)> (1 3-star)
Node 6: <6, (26, 6, 20)>, <6, (26, 10, 21)>, <6, (26, 17, 29)> (3 3-stars)
Node 7: <7, (1, 7, 28)> (1 3-star)
Node 13: <13, (8, 13, 14)> (1 3-star)
Node 14: <14, (0, 14, 19)> (1 3-star)
Node 16: <16, (0, 16, 21)>, <16, (0, 16, 2)>, <16, (5, 16, 21)>, <16, (2, 16, 25)> (4 3-stars)
Node 17: <17, (21, 17, 29)> (1 3-star)
Node 18: <18, (1, 18, 0)>, <18, (1, 18, 3)>, <18, (18, 3, 13)> (3 3-stars)
Node 19: <19, (29, 19, 23)>, <19, (14, 19, 29)> (2 3-stars)
Node 20: <20, (1, 20, 6)>, <20, (6, 20, 26)> (2 3-stars)
Node 21: <21, (1, 21, 16)>, <21, (1, 21, 17)>, <21, (16, 21, 5)>, <21, (17, 21, 29)> (4 3-stars)
Node 22: <22, (5, 22, 23)>, <22, (2, 22, 23)> (2 3-stars)
Node 23: <23, (22, 23, 19)> (1 3-star)
Node 26: <26, (6, 26, 21)>, <26, (6, 26, 10)>, <26, (6, 26, 17)>, <26, (20, 26, 1)>, <26, (20, 26, 6)> (5 3-stars)
Node 29: <29, (17, 29, 21)>, <29, (17, 29, 19)> (2 3-stars)

Total number of 3-stars = 28
Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [28].
