Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:

- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 8 have 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 and Node 5 have 4 neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- For nodes with 5 neighbors, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- For nodes with 4 neighbors, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 48 \).

Thus, the final answer is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
