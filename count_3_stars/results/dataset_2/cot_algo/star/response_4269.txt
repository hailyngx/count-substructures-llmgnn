Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 14) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 9) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 9, 11}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 9, 11}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 8, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4, 13, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 13, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 10, 13}
- Node 10: Neighbors {4, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6, 10}
- Node 12: Neighbors {10, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors {2, 5, 8, 9, 6}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 6, 8}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 71

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [71].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 14>, <0, 6, 14>, <0, 9, 13>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 13>, <1, 5, 13>, <1, 11, 13>, <4, 6, 13>, <4, 11, 13>, <4, 11, 14>, <4, 13, 14>, <8, 9, 13>, <8, 10, 13>, <8, 11, 13>, <8, 13, 14>, <9, 10, 13>, <9, 11, 13>, <9, 13, 14>, <10, 11, 13>
