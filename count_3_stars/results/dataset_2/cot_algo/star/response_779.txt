Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 9) (16, 19) (5, 15) (9, 16) (9, 14) (9, 10) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (0, 7) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 8) (15, 5) (15, 10) (15, 14) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 19) (6, 11) (6, 19) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 18) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 3) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 3) (18, 10) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 8) (13, 7) (13, 18) (19, 16) (19, 12) (19, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 18) 

Response:
Given that there are 20 nodes and 60 edges in the graph, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {7, 14, 17, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 14, 17, 18}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 16}
- Node 5: {15}
- Node 6: {11, 19}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 8, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 7, 12, 18}
- Node 9: {10, 14, 16}
- Node 10: {9, 15, 18}
- Node 11: {2, 6}
- Node 12: {8, 16, 19}
- Node 13: {7, 18}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 3, 9, 15}
- Node 15: {5, 10, 14}
- Node 16: {4, 9, 12, 19}
- Node 17: {1, 3}
- Node 18: {3, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 19: {6, 12, 16}

Based on the neighbor sets, we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (1, 12, 18)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (1, 9, 15)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star: <18, (3, 10, 13)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
