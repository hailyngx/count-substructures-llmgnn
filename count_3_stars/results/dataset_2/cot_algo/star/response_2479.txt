Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 17) (14, 10) (17, 7) (17, 3) (10, 14) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 13) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 12) (18, 9) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 9) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 9) (5, 19) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 13) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 13) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 12) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 12) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 15) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 11, 10, 6, 9
- Node 1: 16, 6, 2
- Node 2: 7, 1, 12
- Node 3: 11, 17, 9
- Node 4: 7, 8
- Node 5: 19
- Node 6: 0, 15, 1, 12
- Node 7: 4, 15, 2, 17
- Node 8: 4, 19, 15, 12
- Node 9: 18, 0, 3, 12
- Node 10: 14, 15, 0, 13
- Node 11: 16, 3, 0
- Node 12: 8, 6, 2, 9
- Node 13: 10, 19, 15
- Node 14: 10
- Node 15: 7, 10, 8, 6, 13
- Node 16: 11, 1
- Node 17: 7, 3
- Node 18: 9
- Node 19: 8, 5, 13

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 15, and Node 19 have 4 neighbors.
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 12, and Node 13 have 3 neighbors.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- For nodes with 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed for each of them, which gives us a total of \( 8 \times 4 = 32 \) 3-stars.
- For nodes with 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star formed for each of them, which gives us a total of \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [32 + 5] = [37] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 9, 15)>, <6, (0, 12, 15)>, <7, (2, 15, 17)>, <8, (12, 15, 19)>, <9, (0, 3, 12)>, <10, (0, 13, 15)>, <15, (6, 10, 8)>, <19, (8, 13, 5)>, <1, (16, 6, 2)>, <2, (7, 1, 12)>, <3, (11, 17, 9)>, <12, (8, 6, 9)>, <13, (10, 19, 15)>
