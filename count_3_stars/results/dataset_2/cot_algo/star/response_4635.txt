Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 6) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 11) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 14) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 18) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 9) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 12) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 10) (12, 16) (12, 10) (9, 7) (18, 6) (18, 17) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 0) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 18) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 0) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (13, 14) (0, 19) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

1: {6, 5, 7}
2: {7, 10, 0}
3: {15, 11, 17, 5}
4: {8, 19}
5: {3, 1, 0}
6: {15, 1, 17, 18}
7: {1, 16, 10, 2, 9}
8: {4, 16, 14, 11}
9: {7}
10: {7, 14, 12, 2}
11: {3, 8, 14}
12: {16, 10}
13: {14}
14: {8, 11, 13, 10}
15: {3, 19, 6}
16: {8, 7, 12}
17: {3, 6, 18}
18: {6, 17}
19: {15, 4, 0}
0: {19, 5, 2}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-star subgraphs in this graph: 
1) Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
2) Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
3) Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, (15, 11, 17)>, <3, (15, 11, 5)>, <3, (15, 17, 5)>, <3, (11, 17, 5)>.
4) Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
5) Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
6) Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <6, (15, 1, 17)>, <6, (15, 1, 18)>, <6, (15, 17, 18)>, <6, (1, 17, 18)>.
7) Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
8) Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <8, (4, 16, 14)>, <8, (4, 16, 11)>, <8, (4, 14, 11)>, <8, (16, 14, 11)>.
9) Node 9 has only 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
10) Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <10, (7, 14, 12)>, <10, (7, 14, 2)>, <10, (7, 12, 2)>, <10, (14, 12, 2)>.
11) Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
12) Node 12 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
13) Node 13 has only 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
14) Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <14, (8, 11, 13)>, <14, (8, 11, 10)>, <14, (8, 13, 10)>, <14, (11, 13, 10)>.
15) Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
16) Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
17) Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
18) Node 18 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
19) Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
20) Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 36

Therefore, the final answer inside brackets is [36].
