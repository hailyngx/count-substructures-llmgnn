Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}


Nodes 4 and 9 have 6 neighbors each, so they can potentially form 3-stars. We need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes.

For node 4:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

For node 9:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 20 + 20 = 40. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
