Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (12, 14) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 0) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 13) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 10) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 5, 9, 4, 2, 13
- Node 1: 3, 6, 11, 0
- Node 2: 13, 10, 7, 0
- Node 3: 1, 7, 10, 6, 5
- Node 4: 6, 0, 10
- Node 5: 3, 6, 11, 0, 10
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5, 4
- Node 7: 3, 8, 2, 13
- Node 8: 14, 7
- Node 9: 14, 13, 0
- Node 10: 3, 5, 4, 2, 14
- Node 11: 1, 5, 13
- Node 12: 14
- Node 13: 9, 2, 11, 14, 7, 0
- Node 14: 8, 9, 12, 13, 10

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

For nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 5)>

For nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 20 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 2, 13)>, <0, (1, 13, 0)>, <0, (1, 0, 5)>, <0, (5, 4, 6)>, <0, (5, 2, 13)>, <0, (5, 13, 0)>, <0, (5, 0, 1)>, <0, (9, 13, 14)>, <0, (9, 4, 6)>, <0, (9, 2, 13)>, <0, (9, 13, 0)>, <0, (2, 6, 4)>, <0, (2, 10, 14)>, <0, (2, 13, 0)>, <0, (13, 6, 4)>, <0, (13, 10, 14)>, <0, (13, 0, 1)>, <0, (13, 14, 9)>
- Node 5 forms 10 3-stars: <5, (3, 6, 1)>, <5, (3, 1, 11)>, <5, (3, 5, 0)>, <5, (3, 10, 6)>, <5, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (11, 1, 5)>, <5, (11, 13, 0)>, <5, (11, 5, 0)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (10, 3, 6)>
- Node 13 forms 10 3-stars: <13, (9, 2, 14)>, <13, (9, 14, 10)>, <13, (9, 0, 14)>, <13, (9, 13, 7)>, <13, (2, 7, 14)>, <13, (2, 10, 14)>, <13, (2, 0, 14)>, <13, (11, 14, 13)>, <13, (14, 7, 4)>, <13, (14, 10, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [41].
