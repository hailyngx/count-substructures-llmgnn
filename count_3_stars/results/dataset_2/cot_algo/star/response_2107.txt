Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {7, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 3, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 9, 7, 1, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 4, 1, 0, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 7, 1, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 9, 7, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 4, 6, 2, 1, 0}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 3, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 8, 2, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 2, 4>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <7, 1, 2>
- <8, 3, 9>
