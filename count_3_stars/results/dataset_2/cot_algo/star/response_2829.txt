Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star (0, 1, 8)
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars (1, 4, 5), (1, 4, 9), (1, 5, 9), (1, 0, 9)
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars (3, 4, 7), (3, 4, 8), (3, 7, 8), (3, 7, 9)
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars (5, 2, 7), (5, 2, 8), (5, 7, 8), (5, 1, 7)
- Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars (7, 3, 5), (7, 3, 6), (7, 3, 8), (7, 3, 9), (7, 5, 8), (7, 5, 9), (7, 6, 8), (7, 6, 9), (7, 8, 9), (7, 8, 0)
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars (8, 0, 3), (8, 0, 5), (8, 3, 5), (8, 5, 7)
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars (9, 1, 0), (9, 1, 4), (9, 1, 5), (9, 3, 7)

Total 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 27

Therefore, the final answer is [27].
