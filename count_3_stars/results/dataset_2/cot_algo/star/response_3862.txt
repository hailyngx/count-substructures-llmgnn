Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 14) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 14) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 10) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 7, 9, 10
- Node 1: 2, 4, 9, 11, 12
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 6, 9, 14
- Node 4: 0, 1, 7, 9, 11, 14
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7, 10
- Node 6: 3, 5, 8, 14
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 13
- Node 8: 2, 6, 14
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 12
- Node 10: 0, 5, 14
- Node 11: 1, 4, 13
- Node 12: 1, 9, 13
- Node 13: 7, 11, 12
- Node 14: 3, 4, 6, 8, 10

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: forms 3-stars with nodes (9, 10, 4), (1, 4, 12)
- Node 1: forms 3-stars with nodes (2, 4, 9), (12, 13, 4)
- Node 9: forms 3-stars with nodes (0, 4, 10), (1, 4, 12), (3, 6, 14)
- Node 4: forms 3-stars with nodes (0, 1, 12), (9, 12, 13)
- Node 14: forms 3-stars with nodes (6, 8, 10)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 12>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 12>, <4, 9, 12>, <9, 10, 0>, <9, 12, 1>, <6, 8, 14>.
