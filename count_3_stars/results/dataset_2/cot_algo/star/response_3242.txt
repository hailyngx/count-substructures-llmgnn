Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:
1: 29, 6
2: 4, 8, 19, 20, 24
3: 18, 26
4: 2, 7, 17, 19
5: 8, 18, 27
6: 1
7: 4, 0, 17
8: 2, 5
9: 11, 17, 22
10: 11, 17, 19
11: 9, 10, 18
12: 26
13: 14, 28
14: 13, 19, 23
15: 16, 29
16: 15, 18
17: 4, 7, 9, 10
18: 3, 5, 11, 16
19: 2, 4, 10, 14
20: 2, 26
21: 0, 27, 23, 28
22: 9, 27, 25, 28
23: 21, 24, 14
24: 2, 23, 27
25: 1, 22
26: 3, 12, 20
27: 5, 21, 22, 24, 28
28: 13, 21, 22, 27
29: 1, 15

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars:
1. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
3. Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
6. Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
7. Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
8. Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
9. Node 13 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
10. Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
11. Node 15 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
12. Node 16 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
13. Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
14. Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
15. Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
16. Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
17. Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
18. Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
19. Node 25 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
20. Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
21. Node 27 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
22. Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
23. Node 29 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 55

Therefore, the final total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [55].
