Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 6, and 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 2, so the final answer is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>
