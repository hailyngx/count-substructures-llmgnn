Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 14) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (10, 8) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 8, 11, 2}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 6, 11, 14, 0}
- Node 3: {1, 13, 12, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 13, 12, 11}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 2, 11}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 8, 4}
- Node 7: {9, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {6, 3, 13, 10, 0, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 2, 11, 7}
- Node 10: {8}
- Node 11: {5, 9, 7, 4, 0, 2}
- Node 12: {3, 4, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 8, 4, 5}
- Node 14: {7, 12, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 11: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding these up, we get a total of 81 unique 3-stars: [81]

These 3-stars are:
<2, (5, 9, 11)>, <2, (5, 9, 0)>, <2, (5, 9, 14)>, <2, (5, 6, 11)>, <2, (5, 6, 0)>, <2, (5, 6, 14)>, <2, (9, 6, 0)>, <2, (9, 6, 14)>, <2, (6, 11, 14)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 13, 12)>, <5, (5, 13, 11)>, <6, (8, 3, 13)>, <8, (8, 0, 11)>, <9, (2, 9, 11)>, <11, (5, 7, 11)>, <13, (3, 8, 13)>, <14, (12, 7, 14)>
