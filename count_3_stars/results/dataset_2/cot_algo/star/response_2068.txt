Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 13) (8, 7) (8, 11) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 13) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 13) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first find the neighbors for each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 12, 14}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 13}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 9}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {7, 10, 14}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 9}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 13, 14}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 8, 10}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {7, 11}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 11}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {4, 7, 9, 11}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {8, 10, 14}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {0, 2, 13}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {1, 6, 12, 14}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 11, 13}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars from the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

1. Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
2. Node 5: Only 3 neighbors, not a 3-star
3. Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
4. Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
5. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
7. Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
8. Node 12: Only 3 neighbors, not a 3-star
9. Node 13: Only 4 neighbors, not a 3-star
10. Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [59].

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (3, 9, 10)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 14)>, <7, (1, 4, 10)>, <7, (4, 6, 14)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <10, (4, 7, 11)>, <11, (8, 10, 14)>, <14, (0, 4, 6)>, <14, (6, 11, 13)>
