Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 18) (16, 4) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 3) (9, 13) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 0) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 10) (1, 15) (1, 14) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 3) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 0) (8, 5) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 0) (7, 16) (7, 15) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 4) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 18) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 3) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 3) (12, 14) (12, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with the edges incident to them are as follows:

- Node 0: {6, 15, 17, 18}
- Node 1: {14, 15}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {3, 11, 14, 16}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 17, 19}
- Node 6: {0, 10, 14, 19}
- Node 7: {15, 16}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {13}
- Node 10: {3, 6, 19}
- Node 11: {4, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {3, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 9, 11, 17}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 15: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 16: {4, 7, 18}
- Node 17: {0, 5, 13}
- Node 18: {16, 18, 19}
- Node 19: {5, 6, 10, 18}

Now, we need to count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 3, Node 13, Node 14, and Node 19 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they are involved in.
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 13: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 14: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 19: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Summing these up, we have a total of \(4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 32\) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (6, 15, 17)>
- <3, (4, 5, 12)>
- <13, (3, 9, 17)>
- <13, (3, 11, 17)>
- <13, (3, 13, 17)>
- <14, (1, 4, 6)>
- <14, (4, 11, 13)>
- <14, (4, 11, 6)>
- <14, (4, 12, 3)>
- <19, (5, 6, 10)>
