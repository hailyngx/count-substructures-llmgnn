Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's find the 3-stars present in the graph:

For each node, let's first identify its neighbors:
- Node 0 neighbors: 10, 4, 14, 2
- Node 1 neighbors: 5, 9, 10, 13, 7
- Node 2 neighbors: 8, 4, 6, 0, 7
- Node 3 neighbors: 9, 10, 8
- Node 4 neighbors: 9, 8, 12, 0, 2
- Node 5 neighbors: 9, 6, 8, 1
- Node 6 neighbors: 5, 11, 14, 2
- Node 7 neighbors: 13, 12, 2, 1
- Node 8 neighbors: 5, 4, 2, 3
- Node 9 neighbors: 5, 4, 14, 3, 1
- Node 10 neighbors: 0, 3, 1, 13
- Node 11 neighbors: 6
- Node 12 neighbors: 4, 7
- Node 13 neighbors: 10, 2, 1, 14, 7
- Node 14 neighbors: 9, 13, 6, 0

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars using the inom{n}{3} formula for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 13: 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 14: 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 56

Thus, the final count of unique 3-stars found in the graph is [56]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 14>
- <0, 4, 14>
- <0, 7, 12>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <1, 9, 13>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 6, 14>
- <3, 8, 10>
- <4, 9, 14>
- <7, 12, 13>
- <8, 9, 5>
- <13, 1, 7>
- <13, 10, 14>
