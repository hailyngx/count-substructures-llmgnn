Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (2, 9) (2, 11) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 11) (1, 9) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 5) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 5) (15, 8) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 5) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 16) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 5) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 16) (12, 13) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 18) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 19) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 18) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 13) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can first identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7}
- Node 1: {9, 17}
- Node 2: {9, 11}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {0, 13, 19}
- Node 5: {10, 14, 15, 17}
- Node 6: {8, 10, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 3}
- Node 8: {6, 11, 15, 19}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 11}
- Node 10: {5, 6, 15}
- Node 11: {2, 8, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {11, 13, 14, 16}
- Node 13: {4, 6, 12, 18}
- Node 14: {5, 11, 12}
- Node 15: {5, 8, 10, 18}
- Node 16: {12, 18, 19}
- Node 17: {1, 5}
- Node 18: {13, 15, 16}
- Node 19: {4, 8, 16}

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 4, 5, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 16 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate \({n \choose 3}\) for each of these nodes.
- Node 4: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 5: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 8: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 11: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 12: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 13: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 15: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 16: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Total 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 35

Thus, there are a total of 35 3-stars in the graph. 
Listing them as unique 3-stars found:
<4, (0, 19, 13)>, <5, (10, 15, 14)>, <8, (6, 11, 15)>, <11, (2, 14, 8)>, <12, (11, 16, 13)>, <13, (6, 4, 18)>, <15, (5, 8, 18)>, <16, (19, 12, 18)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [35].
