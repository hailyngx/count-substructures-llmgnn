Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors for forming 3-stars:
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
