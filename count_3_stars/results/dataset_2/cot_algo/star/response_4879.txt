Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 10) (6, 12) (6, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 9) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 8, 12, 3, 9
- Node 1: 13, 12, 10
- Node 2: 4, 12, 10, 11
- Node 3: 13, 11, 0, 6, 14
- Node 4: 7, 8, 9, 10, 2
- Node 5: 8, 12
- Node 6: 12, 3
- Node 7: 4, 12, 9, 13
- Node 8: 4, 5, 0
- Node 9: 4, 7, 14, 0, 10
- Node 10: 4, 13, 2, 14, 1, 9
- Node 11: 2, 3, 14
- Node 12: 7, 2, 5, 0, 6, 1
- Node 13: 7, 3, 1, 10, 9
- Node 14: 3, 11, 9, 10

Node 4, 9, 10, and 12 have 5 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars using the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula.

For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars formed gives us: 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, 7, 9>
- <4, 7, 10>
- <4, 7, 12>
- <4, 9, 10>
- <4, 9, 12>
- <4, 10, 12>
- <9, 10, 12>
- <4, 7, 13>
- <4, 10, 13>
- <7, 9, 13>
- <9, 10, 13>
- <4, 12, 7>
- <7, 9, 12>
- <9, 10, 12>
- <10, 1, 13>
