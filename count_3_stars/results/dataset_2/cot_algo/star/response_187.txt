Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 15) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 14) (16, 10) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 13) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 13) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 13) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 18) (7, 5) (7, 2) (19, 17) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 18) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, the first step is to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {4, 17, 18}
- Node 1: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 11}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 12, 18}
- Node 6: {8, 9, 12}
- Node 7: {2, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6, 10}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 8, 13, 16}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 14}
- Node 12: {5, 6}
- Node 13: {3, 10, 18}
- Node 14: {9, 11, 15}
- Node 15: {14, 17, 18}
- Node 16: {10}
- Node 17: {0, 15, 19}
- Node 18: {5, 13, 15}
- Node 19: {17}

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars based on the neighbor sets that have three or more elements:
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (2, 7, 12)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star: <10, (3, 13, 18)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star: <14, (11, 15, 9)>
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star: <18, (5, 13, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
