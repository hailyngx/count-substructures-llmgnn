Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 1) (13, 23) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 27) (22, 1) (22, 21) (23, 13) (23, 4) (0, 16) (0, 24) (20, 26) (20, 21) (20, 19) (2, 5) (2, 17) (1, 13) (1, 22) (1, 15) (1, 10) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 16) (9, 4) (9, 14) (29, 24) (4, 23) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 21) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 25) (3, 28) (3, 19) (3, 26) (3, 5) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 18) (28, 25) (17, 2) (17, 28) (17, 19) (25, 12) (25, 28) (25, 19) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 6) (10, 1) (10, 26) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 24) (26, 20) (26, 3) (26, 10) (14, 9) (14, 27) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (11, 19) (11, 18) (19, 20) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 25) (19, 11) (27, 13) (27, 22) (27, 14) (21, 22) (21, 20) (21, 4) (6, 15) (6, 16) (6, 10) (24, 0) (24, 29) (24, 10) (18, 28) (18, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {16, 24}
- Node 1: {13, 15, 22, 10}
- Node 2: {5, 17}
- Node 3: {5, 19, 26, 28}
- Node 4: {9, 12, 21, 23}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {10, 15, 16}
- Node 7: {5, 10, 16}
- Node 9: {4, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 6, 7, 24, 26}
- Node 11: {18, 19}
- Node 12: {4, 15, 25}
- Node 13: {1, 22, 23, 27}
- Node 14: {9, 27}
- Node 15: {1, 6, 12, 16}
- Node 16: {0, 6, 7, 15}
- Node 17: {2, 3, 19, 28}
- Node 18: {11, 28}
- Node 19: {3, 11, 17, 20, 25}
- Node 20: {19, 21, 26}
- Node 21: {4, 20, 22}
- Node 22: {1, 21, 27}
- Node 23: {4, 13}
- Node 24: {0, 10, 29}
- Node 25: {12, 19, 28}
- Node 26: {3, 10, 20}
- Node 27: {13, 14, 22}
- Node 28: {3, 17, 18, 25}
- Node 29: {24}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, 10, 15, 22>, <1, 10, 15, 16>, <1, 10, 16, 24>, <1, 15, 16, 6>, <3, 5, 17, 19>, <3, 5, 17, 28>, <3, 19, 25, 28>, <3, 19, 25, 11>, <4, 9, 12, 21>, <10, 24, 0, 29>, <12, 19, 25>, <22, 1, 27>, <26, 3, 10>
