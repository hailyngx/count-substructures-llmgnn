Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7}

Now, we will check for nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars each can form:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 51

Therefore, the final answer is [51], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
