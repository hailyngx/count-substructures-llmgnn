Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: Not enough neighbors
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: Not enough neighbors
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: Not enough neighbors
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
