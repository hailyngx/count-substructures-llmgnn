Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 6) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 9) (4, 8) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 16) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 19) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 18) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 12) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 15) (13, 16) (13, 7) (13, 18) (1, 7) (1, 15) (1, 14) (15, 5) (15, 1) (15, 19) (10, 2) (10, 14) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 19) (18, 9) (18, 13) (19, 6) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 17) (0, 11) (0, 12) (3, 2) (3, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 0) (17, 4) (17, 5) (17, 19) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 11, 12
Node 1: 7, 14, 15
Node 2: 3, 4, 10
Node 3: 2, 14
Node 4: 2, 8, 17
Node 5: 8, 15, 17
Node 6: 9, 11, 12, 19
Node 7: 1, 8, 13, 16
Node 8: 4, 5, 7, 12
Node 9: 6, 16, 18
Node 10: 2, 14
Node 11: 0, 6
Node 12: 0, 6, 8
Node 13: 7, 16, 18
Node 14: 1, 3, 10, 19
Node 15: 1, 5, 19
Node 16: 7, 9, 13
Node 17: 4, 5, 19
Node 18: 9, 13
Node 19: 6, 14, 15, 17

Based on the neighbors, we can see that nodes 6, 8, 14, and 19 each have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each.

For node 6: inom(4, 3) = 4
For node 8: inom(4, 3) = 4
For node 14: inom(4, 3) = 4
For node 19: inom(4, 3) = 4

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<6, (11, 12, 0)>, <8, (4, 12, 0)>, <14, (1, 19, 3)>, <19, (6, 17, 15)>.
