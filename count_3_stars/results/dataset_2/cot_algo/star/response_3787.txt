Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for the given graph:

Node 0: 7, 1
Node 1: 4, 8, 0
Node 2: 6, 9, 5
Node 3: 4, 7, 8, 5
Node 4: 7, 9, 5, 1, 3
Node 5: 4, 2, 8, 3
Node 6: 7, 9, 2, 8
Node 7: 4, 0, 3, 6, 9
Node 8: 6, 9, 5, 3, 1
Node 9: 4, 7, 6, 8, 2

Now, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 7, 1
- Node 1: 4, 8, 0
- Node 2: 6, 9, 5
- Node 3: 4, 7, 8, 5
- Node 4: 7, 9, 5, 1, 3
- Node 5: 4, 2, 8, 3
- Node 6: 7, 9, 2, 8
- Node 7: 4, 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 6, 9, 5, 3, 1
- Node 9: 4, 7, 6, 8, 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4, 7, 9, and 8 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (7, 9, 5)>
<7, (4, 9, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 6)>
<8, (6, 9, 5)>
