Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 6) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 5) (10, 2) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {8, 10, 11, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 9, 10}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 10}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 9, 12}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 8, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 11: {0, 3, 6, 14}
- Node 12: {4, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {6, 7, 12}
- Node 14: {3, 6, 7, 9, 11}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 1 unique 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 7 forms 1 unique 3-star: <7, (4, 13, 14)>
- Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 1 unique 3-star: <9, (0, 14, 2)>
- Node 12 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 14 forms 1 unique 3-star: <14, (3, 6, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 46. 
So, the final answer is [46].
