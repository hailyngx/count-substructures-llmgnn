Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (3, 8) (3, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 6) (4, 2) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, let's identify the 3-stars formed in this graph:

1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 9, 13, 7, 12, 10
   Number of unique 3-stars formed with node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
   <0, (9, 13, 7)>, <0, (9, 13, 12)>, <0, (9, 13, 10)>, <0, (9, 7, 12)>, <0, (9, 7, 10)>, <0, (9, 12, 10)>, <0, (13, 7, 12)>, <0, (13, 7, 10)>, <0, (13, 12, 10)>, <0, (7, 12, 10)>

2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 7, 11, 10, 2
   Number of unique 3-stars formed with node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
   <1, (7, 11, 10)>, <1, (7, 11, 2)>, <1, (7, 10, 2)>, <1, (11, 10, 2)>

3. Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 8, 7, 0, 10, 14, 2
   Number of unique 3-stars formed with node 6: [inom{6}{3}] = [20]
   <6, (8, 7, 0)>, <6, (8, 7, 10)>, <6, (8, 7, 14)>, <6, (8, 7, 2)>, <6, (8, 0, 10)>, <6, (8, 0, 14)>, <6, (8, 0, 2)>, <6, (8, 10, 14)>, <6, (8, 10, 2)>, <6, (8, 14, 2)>, <6, (7, 0, 10)>, <6, (7, 0, 14)>, <6, (7, 0, 2)>, <6, (7, 10, 14)>, <6, (7, 10, 2)>, <6, (7, 14, 2)>, <6, (0, 10, 14)>, <6, (0, 10, 2)>, <6, (0, 14, 2)>, <6, (10, 14, 2)>

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 4 + 20] = [34]
