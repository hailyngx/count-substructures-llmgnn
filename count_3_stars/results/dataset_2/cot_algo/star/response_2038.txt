Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 27) (3, 12) (15, 21) (15, 11) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 18) (20, 0) (20, 22) (20, 14) (28, 29) (28, 27) (28, 13) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 6) (29, 23) (5, 23) (5, 8) (5, 25) (5, 11) (6, 29) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 25) (18, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 9) (21, 15) (21, 4) (21, 11) (13, 28) (13, 17) (13, 24) (17, 13) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 22) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 25) (16, 8) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 24) (19, 27) (25, 5) (25, 4) (25, 16) (10, 3) (10, 14) (12, 3) (12, 16) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 22) (23, 29) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 2) (8, 5) (8, 16) (27, 3) (27, 28) (27, 29) (27, 19) (2, 23) (2, 7) (7, 2) (7, 14) (11, 15) (11, 5) (11, 21) (11, 22) (22, 20) (22, 17) (22, 1) (22, 11) (22, 24) (14, 20) (14, 10) (14, 7) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 22) 

Response:
The nodes are as follows: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29}

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {16, 18, 9, 20}
\[[inom{4}{3} = 4\]
<0, (16, 18, 9)>
<0, (16, 18, 20)>
<0, (16, 9, 20)>
<0, (18, 9, 20)>

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {23, 8, 25, 11}
\[[inom{4}{3} = 4\]
<5, (23, 8, 25)>
<5, (23, 8, 11)>
<5, (23, 25, 11)>
<5, (8, 25, 11)>

Node 11 has 4 neighbors: {15, 5, 21, 22}
\[[inom{4}{3} = 4\]
<11, (15, 5, 21)>
<11, (15, 5, 22)>
<11, (15, 21, 22)>
<11, (5, 21, 22)>

Node 16 has 4 neighbors: {0, 12, 25, 8}
\[[inom{4}{3} = 4\]
<16, (0, 12, 25)>
<16, (0, 12, 8)>
<16, (0, 25, 8)>
<16, (12, 25, 8)>

Node 18 has 4 neighbors: {0, 4, 9, 19}
\[[inom{4}{3} = 4\]
<18, (0, 4, 9)>
<18, (0, 4, 19)>
<18, (0, 9, 19)>
<18, (4, 9, 19)>

Node 22 has 5 neighbors: {20, 17, 1, 11, 24}
\[[inom{5}{3} = 10\]
<22, (20, 17, 1)>
<22, (20, 17, 11)>
<22, (20, 17, 24)>
<22, (20, 1, 11)>
<22, (20, 1, 24)>
<22, (20, 11, 24)>
<22, (17, 1, 11)>
<22, (17, 1, 24)>
<22, (17, 11, 24)>
<22, (1, 11, 24)>

Node 27 has 4 neighbors: {3, 28, 29, 19}
\[[inom{4}{3} = 4\]
<27, (3, 28, 29)>
<27, (3, 28, 19)>
<27, (3, 29, 19)>
<27, (28, 29, 19)>

Node 29 has 4 neighbors: {28, 27, 6, 23}
\[[inom{4}{3} = 4\]
<29, (28, 27, 6)>
<29, (28, 27, 23)>
<29, (28, 6, 23)>
<29, (27, 6, 23)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 34

So, the final answer is [34].
