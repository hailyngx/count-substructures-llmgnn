Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 18) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 19) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 17) (6, 5) (6, 16) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 10) (14, 8) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 8) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 11) (15, 19) (15, 8) (8, 14) (8, 18) (8, 15) (8, 19) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 13) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 13) (2, 3) (2, 19) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 16) 

Response:
The nodes can be represented in sets based on their edges as follows:

Node 0: {5, 6, 12}

Node 1: {3, 12, 17}

Node 2: {3, 19}

Node 3: {1, 2, 10, 19}

Node 4: {7, 16, 17}

Node 5: {0, 6, 9}

Node 6: {0, 5, 16}

Node 7: {4}

Node 8: {14, 15, 18, 19}

Node 9: {5, 18}

Node 10: {3, 11, 14}

Node 11: {10, 13, 17}

Node 12: {0, 1, 16}

Node 13: {11, 16, 18, 19}

Node 14: {8, 10}

Node 15: {8, 19}

Node 16: {4, 6, 12, 13}

Node 17: {1, 4, 11}

Node 18: {8, 9, 13}

Node 19: {2, 3, 8, 13, 15}

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed. 

For nodes with three neighbors:
- Node 0 has 1 3-star
- Node 1 has 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 1 3-star
- Node 11 has 1 3-star
- Node 13 has 1 3-star
- Node 16 has 1 3-star
- Node 17 has 1 3-star
- Node 18 has 1 3-star
- Node 19 has 1 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 13 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [13]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 12)>, <1, (3, 12, 17)>, <3, (1, 2, 10)>, <4, (7, 16, 17)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 16)>, <8, (14, 15, 18)>, <11, (10, 13, 17)>, <13, (11, 16, 18)>, <16, (4, 6, 12)>, <17, (1, 4, 11)>, <18, (8, 9, 13)>, <19, (2, 3, 8)>.
