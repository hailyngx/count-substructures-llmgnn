Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the adjacency list for each node is as follows:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 7, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 4, 3, 6}
- Node 2: {5, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 1, 6}
- Node 4: {5, 0, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 1, 4}
- Node 6: {5, 1, 3, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 0, 8}
- Node 8: {9, 7, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 2, 1, 7, 0}

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <4, 5, 9>

- <1, 9, 5>
- <0, 9, 5>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 7, 9>
