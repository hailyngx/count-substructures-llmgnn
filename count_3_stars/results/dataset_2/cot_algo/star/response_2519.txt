Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 8}

Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 8 each have three or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing these up: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>.
