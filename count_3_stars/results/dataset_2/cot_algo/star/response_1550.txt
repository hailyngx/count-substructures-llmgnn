Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 18) (16, 4) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (15, 18) (15, 17) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 18) (19, 11) (19, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 17) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (18, 16) (18, 15) (18, 8) (18, 5) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 5) (17, 12) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 17) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 0) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 10}
- Node 4: {0, 11, 16}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 17, 18}
- Node 6: {0, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 13}
- Node 8: {12, 17, 18}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 6}
- Node 11: {4, 19}
- Node 12: {8, 17, 19}
- Node 13: {1, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 9, 13}
- Node 15: {17, 18}
- Node 16: {4, 18}
- Node 17: {5, 8, 12, 15}
- Node 18: {5, 8, 15, 16}
- Node 19: {11, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total = 1
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total = 2
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Total = 6
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. Total = 10
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. Total = 14
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total = 15
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total = 16
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total = 17
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. Total = 21
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total = 22
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. Total = 26
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. Total = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 30, which is represented as [30]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 6, 9>, 
<1, 3, 13, 14>, 
<3, 5, 17, 18>, 
<5, 8, 15, 18>, 
<6, 9, 10, 13>, 
<13, 1, 6, 14>, 
<17, 5, 8, 12>.
