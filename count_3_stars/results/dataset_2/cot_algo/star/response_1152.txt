Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9, 7
- Node 1: 6, 3
- Node 2: 5, 6, 4, 7, 3
- Node 3: 9, 4, 1, 2
- Node 4: 5, 7, 3, 2
- Node 5: 9, 6, 2, 8, 4, 0
- Node 6: 5, 1, 2, 8, 0
- Node 7: 9, 4, 0, 8, 2
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 5, 3, 7, 0

Next, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, which is enough to form a 3-star. Number of 3-stars involving node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, which is enough to form a 3-star. Number of 3-stars involving node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, which is enough to form a 3-star. Number of 3-stars involving node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, which is enough to form a 3-star. Number of 3-stars involving node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, which is enough to form a 3-star. Number of 3-stars involving node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, which is enough to form a 3-star. Number of 3-stars involving node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 52 \). So, the answer is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- <9, (3, 5, 7)>
