Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 28) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 8) (3, 13) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 27) (10, 17) (10, 5) (10, 20) (7, 12) (7, 20) (7, 18) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 0) (29, 14) (29, 17) (29, 5) (24, 26) (24, 1) (26, 24) (26, 21) (26, 16) (6, 25) (6, 8) (6, 16) (21, 26) (21, 20) (21, 2) (11, 23) (11, 0) (23, 11) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 19) (16, 26) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 20) (4, 22) (4, 3) (4, 25) (19, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 29) (8, 22) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 27) (9, 28) (25, 6) (25, 4) (20, 10) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 21) (20, 16) (1, 24) (1, 2) (1, 28) (2, 13) (2, 15) (2, 21) (2, 1) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 28) (28, 13) (28, 9) (28, 1) (28, 18) (27, 17) (27, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph by listing the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {12, 11, 16, 8, 19}
- Node 1: {24, 2, 28}
- Node 2: {13, 15, 21, 1}
- Node 3: {13, 15, 4}
- Node 4: {22, 3, 25}
- Node 5: {10, 7, 29}
- Node 6: {25, 8, 16}
- Node 7: {12, 20, 18, 5}
- Node 8: {22, 6, 0, 27}
- Node 9: {28}
- Node 10: {17, 5, 20}
- Node 11: {23, 0}
- Node 12: {7, 20, 0}
- Node 13: {22, 2, 3, 28}
- Node 14: {17, 18, 29}
- Node 15: {3, 2}
- Node 16: {26, 6, 0, 20}
- Node 17: {14, 10, 29, 27}
- Node 18: {14, 7, 28}
- Node 19: {0}
- Node 20: {10, 7, 12, 21, 16}
- Node 21: {26, 20, 2}
- Node 22: {13, 4, 8}
- Node 23: {11}
- Node 24: {26, 1}
- Node 25: {6, 4}
- Node 26: {24, 21, 16}
- Node 27: {17, 8}
- Node 28: {13, 9, 1, 18}
- Node 29: {14, 17, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars. These are the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 28, 29

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of unique 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Each neighbor pair forms a unique 3-star)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us: \(10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 62\)

Therefore, the final count of the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (11, 16, 19)>

- <0, (12, 16, 8)>
- <0, (16, 20, 21)>
- <0, (16, 20, 7)>
- <0, (16, 6, 25)>
- <0, (16, 8, 27)>
