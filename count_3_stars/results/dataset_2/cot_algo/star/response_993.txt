Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 4) (15, 11) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 10) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 16) (12, 5) (4, 15) (4, 18) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (17, 7) (17, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 16) (19, 0) (0, 19) (0, 16) (0, 2) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 0) (1, 2) (6, 10) (6, 17) (6, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (14, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (9, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {2, 16, 19}
Node 1: {2}
Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 13}
Node 3: {8, 11, 15}
Node 4: {15, 18}
Node 5: {2, 7, 10, 12, 14}
Node 6: {8, 10, 17}
Node 7: {5, 13, 17, 18}
Node 8: {3, 6, 10, 14, 19}
Node 9: {13}
Node 10: {5, 6, 8, 11}
Node 11: {3, 10, 15}
Node 12: {5, 16}
Node 13: {2, 7, 9}
Node 14: {5, 8, 18}
Node 15: {3, 4, 11}
Node 16: {0, 12, 19}
Node 17: {6, 7}
Node 18: {4, 7, 14}
Node 19: {0, 8, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

Node 3: 1 3-star
Node 5: 1 3-star
Node 8: 1 3-star
Node 10: 1 3-star
Node 13: 1 3-star
Node 15: 1 3-star
Node 16: 1 3-star
Node 18: 1 3-star
Node 19: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [9]

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (8, 11, 15)>
<5, (2, 7, 10)>
<8, (6, 10, 14)>
<10, (5, 6, 8)>
<13, (2, 7, 9)>
<15, (3, 11, 4)>
<16, (0, 12, 19)>
<18, (4, 7, 14)>
<19, (0, 8, 16)>
