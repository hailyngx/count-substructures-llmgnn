Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
This graph forms the following 3-stars:

1. Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves (0, 2, 5) <4, (0, 2, 5)>
2. Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves (0, 2, 4) <5, (0, 2, 4)>
3. Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves (0, 2, 5) <7, (0, 2, 5)>
4. Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves (1, 4, 7) <9, (1, 4, 7)>
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves (1, 2, 5) <6, (1, 2, 5)>

There are 5 unique 3-stars formed in this graph, so the total number of 3-stars is [5].
