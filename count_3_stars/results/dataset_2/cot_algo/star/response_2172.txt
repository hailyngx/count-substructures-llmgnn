Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 16) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 10) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 5) (17, 2) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 19) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 11) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 15) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 12) (11, 14) (11, 13) (12, 19) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 17) (5, 17) (5, 15) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 5) (10, 9) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {15, 18, 19}
- Node 1: {4, 13, 18, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 17}
- Node 3: {16}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 13, 2}
- Node 5: {15, 17}
- Node 6: {7, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 2}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 19, 16, 15}
- Node 9: {10, 19}
- Node 10: {9}
- Node 11: {14, 13}
- Node 12: {19, 16}
- Node 13: {4, 1, 17, 11}
- Node 14: {17, 11, 18, 19}
- Node 15: {0, 8, 5}
- Node 16: {3, 8, 12}
- Node 17: {14, 13, 5, 2}
- Node 18: {1, 14, 0}
- Node 19: {9, 14, 0, 8, 12}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding them up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 13, 18)>
<4, (1, 7, 13)>
<8, (1, 6, 19)>
<13, (4, 1, 17)>
<14, (17, 11, 18)>
<17, (14, 13, 5)>
<19, (9, 14, 0)>
