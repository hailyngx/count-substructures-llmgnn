Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 12) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (10, 7) (10, 3) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 12) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {2, 3, 7, 12}
Node 1: {7, 11, 12}
Node 2: {0, 6, 11, 13, 14}
Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 10, 13}
Node 4: {7, 9, 12}
Node 5: {3, 6, 8, 13}
Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 13}
Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 10, 13}
Node 8: {5, 11, 12}
Node 9: {4, 14}
Node 10: {3, 7}
Node 11: {1, 2, 8, 14}
Node 12: {0, 4, 8, 14}
Node 13: {2, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14}
Node 14: {2, 9, 11, 12, 13}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 80

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [80].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<0, 7, 12>, <0, 7, 13>, <2, 11, 14>, <3, 7, 13>
