Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 4: forms 1 3-star with neighbors {1, 7, 9}
- Node 6: forms 1 3-star with neighbors {3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: forms 1 3-star with neighbors {3, 7, 9}

Total number of 3-stars = 3, so the answer is [3].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
