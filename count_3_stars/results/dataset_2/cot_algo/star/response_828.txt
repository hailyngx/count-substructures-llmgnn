Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 2) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 11) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 5) (10, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {13, 10, 14}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 3, 6}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 4, 5, 8, 14}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 7, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 6, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 4, 8, 11}
- Node 7: neighbors {3, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 6, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 10: neighbors {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 11: neighbors {3, 4, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 12: neighbors {5, 8, 13}
- Node 13: neighbors {0, 4, 5, 11, 12}
- Node 14: neighbors {0, 2, 3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: none (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: none (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: <(1, 2, 14)>
- Node 3: <(1, 3, 14)>, <(3, 7, 11)>
- Node 4: <(2, 4, 13)>, <(4, 7, 11)>, <(4, 10, 13)>
- Node 5: <(2, 5, 13)>
- Node 6: <(1, 6, 11)>, <(4, 6, 11)>
- Node 7: <(3, 7, 11)>, <(4, 7, 11)>, <(7, 10, 11)>
- Node 8: <(4, 8, 13)>, <(6, 8, 11)>, <(7, 8, 11)>, <(8, 12, 13)>
- Node 9: none (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 10: <(4, 10, 13)>, <(7, 10, 11)>
- Node 11: <(3, 7, 11)>, <(4, 7, 11)>, <(6, 8, 11)>, <(11, 13, 4)>
- Node 12: <(5, 12, 13)>, <(8, 12, 13)>
- Node 13: none (has 5 neighbors)
- Node 14: none (has 3 neighbors)

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have 16 in total. So, the final answer is [16].
