Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 12) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 4, 8, 13  
Node 1: 0, 2, 7, 14  
Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 12  
Node 3: 2, 7, 8, 12, 13  
Node 4: 0, 6, 7  
Node 5: 2, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14  
Node 6: 4, 5, 10, 11, 12  
Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 9, 14  
Node 8: 0, 3, 13  
Node 9: 7, 13  
Node 10: 5, 6, 13, 14  
Node 11: 5, 6  
Node 12: 2, 3, 6  
Node 13: 0, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10  
Node 14: 1, 5, 7, 10  

Now, we can identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 13, and 14 have 4 or more neighbors.

For the nodes above, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are involved in:

Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
Node 5: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)  
Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
Node 13: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)  
Node 14: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  

Adding these up: \(4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 78\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [78].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 5, 12>, <3, 5, 13>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 13>, <5, 6, 10>, <5, 6, 11>, <5, 6, 13>, <5, 10, 14>, <5, 11, 13>, <6, 10, 14>, <7, 9, 13>, <13, 5, 10>, <13, 5, 11>, <13, 5, 14>.

Each 3-star is listed only once, even if it can be formed in multiple ways from different perspectives.
