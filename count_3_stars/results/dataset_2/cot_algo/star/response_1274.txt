Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 2}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 8}

Next, we need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 have three or more neighbors.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Now sum up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 44 \]

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, 3, 8>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <1, 2, 3>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <6, 8, 9>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 5, 7>
