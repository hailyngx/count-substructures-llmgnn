Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (13, 19) (13, 6) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 7) (15, 18) (15, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 17) (8, 12) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 6) (0, 18) (0, 3) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 19) (17, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 3) (16, 18) (16, 2) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 16) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:
- Node 0: 18, 3
- Node 1: 15, 14, 7
- Node 2: 11, 14, 16
- Node 3: 10, 0, 19
- Node 4: 18, 19, 14
- Node 5: 9, 8, 7
- Node 6: 13, 7
- Node 7: 5, 9, 11, 1, 6
- Node 8: 5, 9, 17, 12
- Node 9: 5, 8, 10, 7
- Node 10: 9, 11, 3, 19
- Node 11: 10, 7, 12, 2
- Node 12: 11, 8
- Node 13: 19, 6
- Node 14: 4, 1, 2
- Node 15: 1, 18
- Node 16: 18, 2
- Node 17: 8
- Node 18: 4, 15, 16, 0
- Node 19: 10, 4, 13, 3

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (5, 9, 11)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (5, 9, 17)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (5, 8, 10)>
- Node 11 forms two 3-stars: <11, (10, 7, 12)> and <11, (7, 1, 2)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star: <19, (10, 4, 13)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, so the final answer is [5].
