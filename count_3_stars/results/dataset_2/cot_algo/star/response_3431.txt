Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 13) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 13) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 13) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node using the given edges:

1: 9, 7, 6
2: 8, 12, 14, 0
3: 8, 0, 14, 13
4: 5, 9, 10, 11
5: 9, 11, 4
6: 7, 1
7: 8, 12, 0, 6, 1
8: 11, 2, 7, 3
9: 5, 4, 1, 0, 12
10: 11, 0, 4, 13
11: 5, 10, 8, 4
12: 9, 7, 2
13: 10, 0, 1, 14, 3
14: 2, 3, 13

Next, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it participates in 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it participates in 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it participates in 4 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it participates in 4 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it participates in 5 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it participates in 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it participates in 5 3-stars.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it participates in 4 3-stars.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it participates in 4 3-stars.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it participates in 1 3-star.
Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it participates in 5 3-stars.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it participates in 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 37.

Therefore, the final answer is [37]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 12>
<2, 8, 14>
<2, 12, 14>
<2, 0, 3>
<3, 8, 14>
<3, 0, 13>
<4, 5, 9>
<7, 8, 12>
<7, 8, 3>
<7, 12, 2>
<7, 12, 0>
<9, 5, 11>
<9, 4, 10>
<9, 1, 7>
<9, 1, 6>
<10, 11, 5>
