Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by generating the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5, 6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \text{inom}{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [60]\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
