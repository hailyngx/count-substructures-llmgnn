Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 19) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 0) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 17) (7, 16) (7, 18) (12, 13) (12, 15) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 14) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (19, 16) (19, 8) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 5) (17, 18) (17, 9) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 4) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 15) (9, 17) (10, 5) (10, 6) (15, 11) (15, 12) (15, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 11, 18}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 13, 16}
- Node 2: {8, 14, 18}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {1, 13, 14, 15}
- Node 5: {0, 10}
- Node 6: {10, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {16, 18}
- Node 8: {2, 14, 19}
- Node 9: {17}
- Node 10: {5, 6}
- Node 11: {0, 6, 15, 16}
- Node 12: {13, 15}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 12}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 6, 8, 18}
- Node 15: {4, 11, 12}
- Node 16: {1, 7, 11, 19}
- Node 17: {9, 18}
- Node 18: {0, 2, 7, 14, 17}
- Node 19: {8, 16}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives \([30]\).

Unique 3-stars found:
<4, (1, 13, 14)>, <4, (1, 14, 15)>, <4, (6, 14, 15)>, <4, (8, 14, 15)>, <6, (10, 11, 14)>, <11, (0, 6, 11)>, <11, (6, 11, 15)>, <11, (6, 11, 16)>, <11, (6, 10, 11)>, <14, (2, 8, 14)>, <14, (2, 14, 18)>, <14, (4, 14, 15)>, <14, (6, 14, 18)>, <14, (8, 14, 18)>, <16, (1, 11, 16)>, <16, (6, 11, 16)>, <16, (7, 16, 19)>, <18, (7, 16, 18)>, <18, (14, 16, 18)>, <18, (14, 18, 19)>
