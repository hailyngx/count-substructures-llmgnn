Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 7
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

So, the final answer is [30]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 3, 4, 8>
<0, 3, 6, 8>
<0, 3, 6, 9>
<0, 4, 6, 8>
<0, 4, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 9, 7>
<2, 5, 7, 9>
<6, 1, 9, 7>
<6, 5, 2, 9>
<6, 5, 3, 9>
