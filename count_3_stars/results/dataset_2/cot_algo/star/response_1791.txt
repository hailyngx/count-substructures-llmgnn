Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 19) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 15) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 18) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 12) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 14) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 11) (15, 11) (15, 13) (16, 0) (16, 1) (12, 2) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 5) (19, 9) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 13) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 16) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, the information provided can be used to find the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph.

First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

1. Node 0: {2, 6, 16, 18}
2. Node 1: {5, 8, 13, 16}
3. Node 2: {0, 4, 12}
4. Node 3: {4, 10, 11}
5. Node 4: {2, 3, 7, 17}
6. Node 5: {1, 7, 14, 18}
7. Node 6: {0, 14, 17}
8. Node 7: {4, 5, 8}
9. Node 8: {1, 7, 9}
10. Node 9: {8, 18, 19}
11. Node 10: {3, 13}
12. Node 11: {3, 14, 15, 17}
13. Node 12: {2}
14. Node 13: {1, 5, 14, 15}
15. Node 14: {5, 6, 11, 13}
16. Node 15: {11, 13}
17. Node 16: {0, 1}
18. Node 17: {4, 6, 11}
19. Node 18: {0, 5, 9}
20. Node 19: {9}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
2. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3. Node 2: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
4. Node 3: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
5. Node 4: 1
6. Node 5: 1
7. Node 6: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
8. Node 7: 1
9. Node 8: 1
10. Node 9: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
11. Node 10: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
12. Node 11: 1
13. Node 12: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
14. Node 13: 1
15. Node 14: 1
16. Node 15: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
17. Node 16: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
18. Node 17: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
19. Node 18: 1
20. Node 19: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6.
Therefore, the final answer to the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 17>
<5, 13, 14>
<8, 5, 1>
<11, 13, 14>
