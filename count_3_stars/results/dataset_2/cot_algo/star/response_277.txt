Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node. Then, for nodes with three or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed around that node. 

Let's start by identifying the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 4, 8, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 4, 8, 7}
- Node 4: {8, 0, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 1, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 8: {6, 4, 2, 0, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 1, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 8, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 3)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>
