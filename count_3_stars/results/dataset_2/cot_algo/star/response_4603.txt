Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Since it is not explicitly stated in the question, we can assume the graph is undirected. Given the edges provided, the adjacency list representation of the graph is as follows:

Node 0: {5, 2, 1, 3}

Node 1: {9, 4, 2, 0}

Node 2: {5, 4, 3, 0}

Node 3: {5, 9, 8, 2, 0}

Node 4: {9, 6, 8, 2, 1}

Node 5: {9, 8, 0, 3, 7}

Node 6: {9, 4}

Node 7: {5, 8}

Node 8: {5, 4, 3, 7}

Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 3, 1}

For each node, we calculate the number of combinations of its neighbors taken 3 at a time to determine how many 3-stars can be formed around that node.

Calculating for each node:
- Node 0: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 1: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 2: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 3: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 4: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 5: inom(5, 3) = 10
- Node 6: inom(2, 3) = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: inom(2, 3) = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: inom(4, 3) = 4
- Node 9: inom(5, 3) = 10

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 10 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 2, 1)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<2, (5, 4, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 8)>
<4, (9, 6, 8)>
<5, (9, 8, 0)>
<8, (5, 4, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
