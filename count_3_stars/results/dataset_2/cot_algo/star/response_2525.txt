Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 26) (15, 18) (27, 28) (27, 5) (1, 22) (3, 18) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 12) (17, 10) (17, 25) (17, 0) (17, 4) (20, 15) (20, 22) (20, 24) (20, 6) (20, 11) (5, 27) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (6, 20) (6, 5) (6, 29) (6, 19) (6, 0) (13, 26) (13, 4) (13, 23) (26, 15) (26, 10) (26, 13) (26, 7) (9, 29) (9, 14) (9, 16) (22, 1) (22, 20) (22, 7) (21, 19) (21, 8) (21, 24) (11, 20) (11, 23) (23, 13) (23, 11) (23, 16) (29, 6) (29, 9) (29, 0) (29, 25) (14, 5) (14, 9) (28, 27) (28, 8) (28, 19) (25, 17) (25, 29) (2, 24) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 28) (8, 12) (0, 17) (0, 6) (0, 29) (0, 12) (18, 15) (18, 3) (16, 9) (16, 23) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 19) (4, 17) (4, 13) (4, 24) (24, 20) (24, 21) (24, 2) (24, 4) (19, 6) (19, 21) (19, 28) (19, 12) (7, 26) (7, 22) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {17, 6, 29, 12}
- Node 1: {22}
- Node 2: {24}
- Node 3: {18}
- Node 4: {17, 13, 24}
- Node 5: {27, 6, 8, 14}
- Node 6: {20, 5, 29, 19, 0}
- Node 7: {26, 22}
- Node 8: {5, 21, 28, 12}
- Node 9: {29, 14, 16}
- Node 10: {17, 26, 12}
- Node 11: {20, 23}
- Node 12: {10, 8, 0, 19}
- Node 13: {26, 4, 23}
- Node 14: {5, 9}
- Node 15: {20, 26, 18}
- Node 16: {9, 23}
- Node 17: {10, 25, 0, 4}
- Node 18: {15, 3}
- Node 19: {6, 21, 28, 12}
- Node 20: {15, 22, 24, 6, 11}
- Node 21: {19, 8, 24}
- Node 22: {1, 20, 7}
- Node 23: {13, 11, 16}
- Node 24: {20, 2, 4, 21}
- Node 25: {17, 29}
- Node 26: {15, 10, 13, 7}
- Node 27: {28, 5}
- Node 28: {27, 8, 19}
- Node 29: {6, 9, 0, 25}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0, Node 6, Node 8, Node 12, Node 17, Node 19, and Node 29 each have 4 or more neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (17, 6, 29)>
- <6, (20, 5, 0)>
- <8, (5, 21, 28)>
- <12, (10, 8, 0)>
- <17, (10, 25, 0)>
- <19, (6, 21, 28)>
- <29, (6, 9, 25)>
