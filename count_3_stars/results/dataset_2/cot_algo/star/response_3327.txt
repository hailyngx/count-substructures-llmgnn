Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 15) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 17) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 12) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 8) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (15, 16) (15, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 5) (5, 7) (5, 10) (17, 7) (17, 3) (19, 11) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 12) (14, 16) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 19) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 14) (12, 8) (8, 6) (8, 18) (8, 3) (8, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 10}
- Node 1: Neighbors {10, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {15, 16}
- Node 3: Neighbors {8, 11, 13, 17, 19}
- Node 4: Neighbor {14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7, 10}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 6, 17}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 6, 12, 18}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 6, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 18}
- Node 11: Neighbors {3, 6, 19}
- Node 12: Neighbors {8, 9, 14, 19}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 3, 19}
- Node 14: Neighbors {4, 12, 16, 18}
- Node 15: Neighbors {2, 16}
- Node 16: Neighbors {2, 14, 15}
- Node 17: Neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 18: Neighbors {8, 10, 14}
- Node 19: Neighbors {3, 11, 12, 13}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
  
Total 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 27

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [27], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (11, 17, 19)>, 
<3, (13, 17, 19)>, 
<3, (13, 17, 3)>, 
<3, (13, 19, 12)>, 
<3, (3, 11, 19)>, 
<3, (12, 14, 19)>, 
<6, (8, 9, 12)>, 
<10, (0, 5, 10)>, 
<14, (14, 16, 18)>, 
<16, (15, 16, 2)>.
