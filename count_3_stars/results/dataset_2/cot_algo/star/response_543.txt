Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 4) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 8}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- From the list of neighbors, only nodes 2 and 8 have 7 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes.

For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 8: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 35 = 39

Therefore, the final answer is [39], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
