Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 8}

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1: \(inom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \(inom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(inom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 5: The node has exactly 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8: \(inom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Adding them up, we get a total of 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 35 3-stars in the graph. 

Thus, the final answer is [35], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
