Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 16) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 15) (8, 9) (8, 19) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 7) (13, 16) (13, 10) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 14) (9, 8) (9, 18) (17, 19) (17, 15) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 17) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 10) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 10) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 15) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 17) (15, 16) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 19}
- Node 2: {5, 12, 15}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 11, 18}
- Node 5: {0, 2}
- Node 6: {4, 16}
- Node 7: {0, 11, 14, 15}
- Node 8: {9, 19}
- Node 9: {8, 18}
- Node 10: {12, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {4, 7, 14}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 10, 16}
- Node 13: {10, 16}
- Node 14: {7, 10, 11}
- Node 15: {2, 7, 16, 17}
- Node 16: {6, 12, 13, 15}
- Node 17: {15, 19}
- Node 18: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 19: {1, 8, 17}

Based on the neighbor sets, the nodes with three or more neighbors that can form 3-stars are nodes 0, 3, 7, 12, 15, and 16.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of unique 3-stars they form:

- Node 0: inom(3,3) = 1
- Node 3: inom(3,3) = 1
- Node 7: inom(4,3) = 4
- Node 12: inom(4,3) = 4
- Node 15: inom(4,3) = 4
- Node 16: inom(4,3) = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [18].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 3, 5>
- <3, 1, 12>
- <7, 11, 14>
- <7, 14, 15>
- <12, 10, 16>
- <15, 2, 7>
- <16, 6, 13>
- <16, 12, 15>
