Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8, 2, 5}
- Node 1: {6, 9, 4, 3, 5}
- Node 2: {6, 9, 7, 8, 5, 0}
- Node 3: {6, 1, 0, 5}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 8, 5, 1}
- Node 5: {4, 1, 3, 8, 2}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {4, 2}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 0, 2, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 1}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 61

So, the final number of 3-stars is [61].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
