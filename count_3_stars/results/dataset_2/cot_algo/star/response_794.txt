Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 4
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7
- Node 5: 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 2
- Node 9: 2, 3, 6, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 6 neighbors
- Node 3: 6 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 63 3-stars. So, the final answer is [63].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 3)>, <9, (3, 7, 6)>.
