Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 1, 7, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8, 0}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 8, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 3, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 9, 6, 3, 4, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9, 6, 1, 4, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 1, 7, 0}

Now, we'll look for 3-stars by calculating the number of unique combinations of 3 neighbors for each node that has 3 or more neighbors.

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
    - <1, (3, 2, 8)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
    - <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
    - <3, (6, 1, 7)>
- Node 4: No 3-stars formed (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-stars formed (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: No 3-stars formed (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed
    - <7, (5, 9, 6)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (9, 1, 3)>, <7, (9, 3, 2)>, <7, (6, 3, 2)>, <7, (6, 8, 2)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed
    - <8, (5, 9, 6)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (9, 1, 3)>, <8, (9, 1, 2)>, <8, (9, 3, 2)>, <8, (6, 3, 2)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed
    - <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 2)>, <9, (7, 6, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [62].
