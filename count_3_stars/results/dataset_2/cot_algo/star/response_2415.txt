Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 7) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 7) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {9, 11, 4}
Node 1: {5, 14, 4, 12, 7}
Node 2: {10, 11, 12, 13}
Node 3: {9, 11, 7}
Node 4: {5, 1, 8, 0}
Node 5: {8, 12, 1, 4}
Node 6: {11, 7, 13}
Node 7: {1, 3, 6, 14, 13}
Node 8: {5, 4, 14}
Node 9: {14, 3, 0}
Node 10: {11, 13, 2, 14}
Node 11: {3, 10, 0, 6, 2}
Node 12: {5, 1, 2, 13}
Node 13: {10, 7, 2, 12, 6}
Node 14: {9, 1, 10, 8, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 66 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [66].
