Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 21) (5, 14) (9, 7) (27, 4) (27, 13) (27, 16) (27, 6) (20, 0) (20, 21) (20, 19) (25, 1) (25, 28) (0, 20) (0, 3) (0, 28) (0, 4) (28, 25) (28, 0) (28, 29) (28, 24) (29, 28) (29, 13) (17, 5) (17, 21) (2, 18) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 7) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 6) (22, 11) (22, 16) (26, 2) (26, 18) (26, 13) (26, 8) (13, 27) (13, 29) (13, 26) (13, 7) (4, 27) (4, 0) (4, 19) (4, 24) (8, 26) (8, 12) (10, 21) (10, 3) (10, 1) (21, 5) (21, 20) (21, 17) (21, 10) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 23) (3, 12) (6, 27) (6, 18) (6, 7) (14, 5) (14, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 6) (19, 20) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 16) (1, 25) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 16) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 23) (11, 22) (16, 27) (16, 22) (16, 19) (16, 1) (24, 28) (24, 4) (23, 3) (23, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 20, 3, 28, 4
- Node 1 has neighbors: 25, 10, 14, 16
- Node 2 has neighbors: 18, 26, 19, 7
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 10, 23, 12
- Node 4 has neighbors: 27, 0, 19, 24
- Node 5 has neighbors: 18, 17, 21, 14
- Node 6 has neighbors: 27, 18, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 9, 2, 13, 6
- Node 8 has neighbors: 26, 12
- Node 9 has neighbor: 7
- Node 10 has neighbors: 21, 3, 1
- Node 11 has neighbor: 22
- Node 12 has neighbors: 8, 3, 23
- Node 13 has neighbors: 27, 29, 26, 7
- Node 14 has neighbors: 5, 1
- Node 16 has neighbors: 27, 22, 19, 1
- Node 17 has neighbors: 5, 21
- Node 18 has neighbors: 5, 2, 26, 6
- Node 19 has neighbors: 20, 2, 4, 16
- Node 20 has neighbors: 0, 21, 19
- Node 21 has neighbors: 5, 20, 17, 10
- Node 22 has neighbors: 11, 16
- Node 23 has neighbors: 3, 12
- Node 24 has neighbors: 28, 4
- Node 25 has neighbors: 1, 28
- Node 26 has neighbors: 2, 18, 13, 8
- Node 27 has neighbors: 4, 13, 16, 6
- Node 28 has neighbors: 25, 0, 29, 24
- Node 29 has neighbors: 28, 13

Now, let's identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 13, Node 16, Node 18, Node 19, Node 20, Node 21, Node 26, Node 27, Node 28

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 0: C(4, 3) = 4
- For Node 1: C(4, 3) = 4
- For Node 2: C(4, 3) = 4
- For Node 3: C(4, 3) = 4
- For Node 4: C(4, 3) = 4
- For Node 5: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- For Node 6: C(3, 3) = 1
- For Node 7: C(4, 3) = 4
- For Node 13: C(4, 3) = 4
- For Node 16: C(4, 3) = 4
- For Node 18: C(4, 3) = 4
- For Node 19: C(4, 3) = 4
- For Node 20: C(3, 3) = 1
- For Node 21: C(4, 3) = 4
- For Node 26: C(4, 3) = 4
- For Node 27: C(4, 3) = 4
- For Node 28: C(4, 3) = 4

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52].

List of unique 3-stars found:
