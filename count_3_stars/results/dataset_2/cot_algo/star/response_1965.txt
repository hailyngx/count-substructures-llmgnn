Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 22) (9, 22) (9, 1) (9, 12) (22, 5) (22, 9) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 21) (23, 29) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 6) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 20) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 2) (17, 25) (17, 24) (17, 4) (3, 22) (3, 27) (3, 26) (11, 23) (11, 1) (11, 25) (16, 28) (16, 8) (16, 26) (16, 6) (28, 14) (28, 16) (18, 5) (18, 29) (26, 3) (26, 16) (26, 27) (26, 7) (8, 0) (8, 16) (8, 19) (8, 7) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 27) (29, 23) (29, 18) (10, 0) (10, 27) (6, 0) (6, 16) (6, 24) (24, 17) (24, 6) (24, 4) (24, 20) (25, 17) (25, 11) (25, 21) (25, 2) (2, 1) (2, 25) (2, 7) (21, 23) (21, 25) (7, 26) (7, 8) (7, 2) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (13, 4) (13, 20) (20, 14) (20, 24) (20, 13) (27, 3) (27, 26) (27, 19) (27, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {6, 8, 10}
Node 1: {2, 9, 11}
Node 2: {1, 7, 25}
Node 3: {22, 26, 27}
Node 4: {13, 17, 19, 24}
Node 5: {12, 18, 22}
Node 6: {0, 16, 24}
Node 7: {2, 7, 8, 26}
Node 8: {0, 7, 16, 19}
Node 9: {1, 12, 22}
Node 10: {0, 27}
Node 11: {1, 23, 25}
Node 12: {5, 9}
Node 13: {4, 20}
Node 14: {20, 22, 28}
Node 16: {6, 8, 16, 26, 28}
Node 17: {4, 24, 25}
Node 18: {5, 29}
Node 19: {4, 8, 19, 27}
Node 20: {13, 14, 24}
Node 21: {23, 25}
Node 22: {3, 5, 9, 14, 23, 29}
Node 23: {11, 21, 22, 29}
Node 24: {4, 6, 20, 24}
Node 25: {2, 11, 17, 21}
Node 26: {3, 7, 16, 26, 27}
Node 27: {3, 10, 19, 26, 27}
Node 28: {14, 16}
Node 29: {18, 22, 23}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4, Node 24, Node 26, Node 27 have 4 neighbors
- Node 2, Node 8, Node 14 have 3 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 \times 4 + 3 \times 1 = 16 + 3 = 19 \)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].

Unique 3-stars: 
<4, (17, 19, 24)>
<24, (4, 6, 20)>
<26, (7, 16, 27)>
<27, (3, 19, 26)>
<2, (1, 7, 25)>
<8, (0, 7, 16)>
<14, (20, 22, 28)>
<4, (13, 17, 24)>
<24, (4, 17, 25)>
<26, (3, 7, 27)>
<27, (10, 19, 26)>
<22, (3, 23, 29)>
