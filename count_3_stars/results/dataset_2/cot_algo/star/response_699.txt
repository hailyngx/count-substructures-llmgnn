Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 8
Node 1: 4, 5, 6, 2
Node 2: 1, 5, 9, 3, 8, 0
Node 3: 2, 8
Node 4: 1, 6, 7, 9
Node 5: 1, 2, 9
Node 6: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 4, 6, 9
Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 6, 9
Node 9: 5, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, as they have the potential to form 3-stars:

Node 1: 4, 5, 6, 2 (4 neighbors)
Node 2: 1, 5, 9, 3, 8, 0 (6 neighbors)
Node 4: 1, 6, 7, 9 (4 neighbors)
Node 6: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9 (5 neighbors)
Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 6, 9 (5 neighbors)
Node 9: 5, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 (6 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 2 and Node 9 each have 6 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 6 and Node 8 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 1 and Node 4 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Adding them up: \( 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 68 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
