Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first find all the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 4

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get:

\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 2>
<6, 7, 5>
