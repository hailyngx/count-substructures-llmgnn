Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 21) (5, 3) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 20) (17, 10) (17, 18) (17, 11) (2, 27) (2, 3) (2, 28) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 20) (18, 29) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 24) (12, 25) (0, 6) (0, 13) (14, 23) (14, 15) (8, 21) (16, 1) (16, 13) (19, 7) (19, 22) (19, 27) (19, 23) (22, 19) (22, 24) (22, 25) (26, 10) (26, 29) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 13) (1, 16) (1, 11) (1, 13) (11, 17) (11, 1) (20, 10) (20, 18) (20, 23) (21, 5) (21, 8) (21, 29) (29, 18) (29, 26) (29, 21) (29, 25) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 24) (24, 12) (24, 22) (24, 13) (24, 4) (25, 12) (25, 22) (25, 29) (23, 14) (23, 19) (23, 20) (4, 6) (4, 24) (4, 28) (28, 2) (28, 4) (28, 27) (27, 5) (27, 2) (27, 19) (27, 28) 

Response:
Since this graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges, it is not a 3-star graph. To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 5 (neighbors: 9, 21, 3, 27)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 5, 6, 3)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 9, 4, 0)
- Node 27 (neighbors: 5, 2, 19, 28)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 17, 15, 20, 29)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 0, 16, 15, 1, 24)
- Node 24 (neighbors: 12, 22, 13, 4)
- Node 29 (neighbors: 18, 26, 21, 25)

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For Node 5:
- Only 1 3-star can be formed with Node 5: <5, (9, 21, 3)>

For Node 9:
- Only 1 3-star can be formed with Node 9: <9, (6, 5, 3)>

For Node 6:
- No 3-stars can be formed with Node 6 as it only has 3 neighbors.

For Node 27:
- Only 1 3-star can be formed with Node 27: <27, (5, 28, 2)>

For Node 18:
- inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars can be formed with Node 18:
   - <18, (17, 15, 20)>
   - <18, (17, 15, 29)>
   - <18, (17, 20, 29)>
   - <18, (15, 20, 29)>

For Node 13:
- inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars can be formed with Node 13:
   - <13, (0, 16, 15)>
   - <13, (0, 16, 1)>
   - <13, (0, 16, 24)>
   - <13, (0, 15, 1)>
   - <13, (0, 15, 24)>
   - <13, (0, 1, 24)>
   - <13, (16, 15, 1)>
   - <13, (16, 15, 24)>
   - <13, (16, 1, 24)>
   - <13, (15, 1, 24)>

For Node 24:
- Only 1 3-star can be formed with Node 24: <24, (12, 22, 13)>

For Node 29:
- Only 1 3-star can be formed with Node 29: <29, (18, 26, 21)>

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 27) + 4 (Node 18) + 10 (Node 13) + 1 (Node 24) + 1 (Node 29) = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
