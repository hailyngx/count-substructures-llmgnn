The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 27) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 4) (6, 1) (6, 21) (6, 7) (9, 10) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 15) (17, 29) (17, 16) (17, 26) (17, 8) (17, 11) (29, 0) (29, 17) (4, 21) (4, 13) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 24) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 25) (24, 18) (24, 26) (24, 22) (26, 17) (26, 24) (26, 10) (26, 3) (7, 6) (7, 28) (7, 23) (25, 28) (25, 15) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 16) (10, 9) (10, 26) (10, 22) (10, 5) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 23) (16, 27) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 25) (22, 14) (22, 24) (22, 10) (8, 17) (8, 20) (20, 8) (20, 27) (2, 0) (2, 13) (23, 7) (23, 16) (23, 3) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 11) (27, 1) (27, 16) (27, 20) (27, 5) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 10) (5, 27) (5, 11) (3, 26) (3, 23) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {2, 14, 29}
- Node 1 neighbors: {6, 12, 19, 27}
- Node 2 neighbors: {0, 13}
- Node 3 neighbors: {23, 26}
- Node 4 neighbors: {13, 21}
- Node 5 neighbors: {10, 11, 27}
- Node 6 neighbors: {1, 7, 21}
- Node 7 neighbors: {6, 23, 28}
- Node 8 neighbors: {17, 20}
- Node 9 neighbors: {10}
- Node 10 neighbors: {5, 9, 22, 26}
- Node 11 neighbors: {5, 13, 17}
- Node 12 neighbors: {1, 14, 16}
- Node 13 neighbors: {2, 4, 11}
- Node 14 neighbors: {0, 12, 15, 18, 22}
- Node 15 neighbors: {14, 18, 25}
- Node 16 neighbors: {12, 16, 17, 23, 27}
- Node 17 neighbors: {8, 11, 16, 26, 29}
- Node 18 neighbors: {14, 15, 19, 24}
- Node 19 neighbors: {1, 18, 16}
- Node 20 neighbors: {8, 27}
- Node 21 neighbors: {4, 6, 28}
- Node 22 neighbors: {10, 14, 24}
- Node 23 neighbors: {3, 7, 16}
- Node 24 neighbors: {18, 22, 26}
- Node 25 neighbors: {15, 28}
- Node 26 neighbors: {10, 17, 24, 3}
- Node 27 neighbors: {1, 5, 16, 20}
- Node 28 neighbors: {7, 21, 25}
- Node 29 neighbors: {0, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 6, 16, 17, 18, 21, 24, 28

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 17 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 18 can form 3 3-stars.
- Node 21 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 24 can form 3 3-stars.
- Node 28 can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, 6, 12>
<4, 13, 21>

<16, 23, 3>
<16, 27, 5>
<16, 12, 1>
<16, 27, 20>
<17, 8, 20>
<17, 11, 5>
<17, 29, 0>
<17, 26, 24>
<18, 14, 22>
<18, 15, 25>
<18, 24, 26>
<24, 22, 10>
<24, 18, 15>
