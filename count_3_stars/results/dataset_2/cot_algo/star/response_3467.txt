Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 1) (16, 19) (5, 18) (5, 0) (9, 14) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 8) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 2) (6, 13) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 18) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 14) (19, 11) (19, 16) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 18) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 15) 

Response:
Calculating the degree of each node:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 1
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 2

Identifying the nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [29]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 18>, <0, 6, 13>, <0, 6, 17>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 12, 4>, <1, 12, 4>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 4, 12>, <1, 6, 17>, <1, 10, 8>, <1, 13, 12>, <3, 8, 10>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 11, 2>, <4, 12, 3>, <4, 12, 13>, <4, 13, 12>, <6, 13, 0>, <6, 13, 15>, <6, 17, 3>, <6, 18, 15>, <8, 3, 10>, <10, 12, 4>, <12, 4, 11>, <12, 13, 0>, <13, 0, 6>, <15, 6, 13>
