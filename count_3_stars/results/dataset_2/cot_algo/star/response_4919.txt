Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 28) (17, 5) (17, 21) (1, 28) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 27) (3, 25) (3, 0) (3, 16) (25, 3) (25, 5) (25, 6) (25, 22) (8, 23) (8, 21) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 18) (23, 10) (28, 17) (28, 1) (29, 5) (29, 24) (22, 25) (22, 11) (22, 12) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 27) (11, 23) (11, 22) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 2) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 20) (19, 9) (27, 1) (27, 13) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 5) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 9) (16, 20) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 2) (6, 14) (6, 25) (6, 18) (24, 29) (24, 10) (0, 3) (15, 9) (15, 18) (18, 23) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 15) (20, 19) (20, 16) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 2) (9, 19) (9, 16) (9, 15) (12, 1) (12, 22) (12, 13) (12, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 21) (10, 23) (10, 4) (10, 24) (10, 12) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 29) (5, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are connected to each node. Then, we will determine how many 3-stars can be formed around each central node.

### Node Neighbors:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {7, 12, 27, 28}
- Node 2: {4, 11, 21}
- Node 3: {0, 16, 25}
- Node 4: {2, 10, 19}
- Node 5: {7, 17, 25, 29}
- Node 6: {14, 18, 25}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 16}
- Node 8: {21, 23}
- Node 9: {15, 16, 19}
- Node 10: {4, 12, 23, 24}
- Node 11: {2, 18, 19, 22, 23}
- Node 12: {1, 10, 13, 22}
- Node 13: {12, 14, 27}
- Node 14: {6, 13, 17}
- Node 15: {9, 18}
- Node 16: {3, 7, 9, 20}
- Node 17: {5, 14, 21, 28}
- Node 18: {6, 11, 15, 23}
- Node 19: {4, 9, 11, 20}
- Node 20: {16, 19}
- Node 21: {2, 8, 17}
- Node 22: {11, 12, 25}
- Node 23: {8, 10, 11, 18}
- Node 24: {10, 29}
- Node 25: {3, 5, 6, 22}
- Node 27: {1, 13}
- Node 28: {1, 17}
- Node 29: {5, 24}

### Nodes with 3 or more Neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 10, 12
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 5, 11, 13, 17, 23

### Calculation for 3-Stars:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each

### Total 3-Stars:
- From nodes with 3 neighbors: 3 (1 for each node)
- From nodes with 4 neighbors: 20 (5 nodes with 4 neighbors)
- Total: 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].

### Unique 3-Stars:
- <1, 7, 12, 27>
- <10, 4, 12, 23>
- <12, 1, 13, 27>
- <5, 7, 17, 25>
- <11, 2, 18, 23>
