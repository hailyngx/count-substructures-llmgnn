Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:

1. For node 0: It has neighbors {6, 15, 17, 28}. Since it has 4 neighbors, the number of 3-stars involving node 0 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

2. For node 1: It has neighbors {13, 25}. Since it has only 2 neighbors, there are no 3-stars involving node 1.

3. For node 2: It has neighbors {8, 18, 25}. Since it has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star involving node 2: <2, (8, 18, 25)>.

4. For node 3: It has neighbors {4, 14, 20}. Since it has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star involving node 3: <3, (4, 14, 20)>.

5. For node 4: It has neighbors {3, 11, 26}. Since it has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star involving node 4: <4, (3, 11, 26)>.

6. For node 5: It has neighbors {22, 29}. Since it has only 2 neighbors, there are no 3-stars involving node 5.

7. For node 6: It has neighbors {0, 9, 12, 23}. Since it has 4 neighbors, the number of 3-stars involving node 6 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

8. For node 7: It has neighbors {18, 23, 29}. Since it has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star involving node 7: <7, (18, 23, 29)>.

9. For node 8: It has neighbors {2, 15}. Since it has only 2 neighbors, there are no 3-stars involving node 8.

13. For node 12: It has neighbors {6, 11, 24, 29}. Since it has 4 neighbors, the number of 3-stars involving node 12 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

14. For node 13: It has neighbors {1, 17}. Since it has only 2 neighbors, there are no 3-stars involving node 13.

15. For node 14: It has neighbors {3, 26}. Since it has only 2 neighbors, there are no 3-stars involving node 14.

17. For node 16: It has neighbor {26}. Since it has only 1 neighbor, there are no 3-stars involving node 16.

18. For node 17: It has neighbors {0, 13}. Since it has 2 neighbors, it does not form any 3-star.

19. For node 18: It has neighbors {2, 7, 23}. Since it has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star involving node 18: <18, (2, 7, 23)>.

20. For node 19: It has neighbors {15, 28}. Since it has only 2 neighbors, there are no 3-stars involving node 19.

21. For node 20: It has neighbor {3}. Since it has only 1 neighbor, there are no 3-stars involving node 20.

22. For node 21: It has neighbors {9, 25, 27, 29}. Since it has 4 neighbors, the number of 3-stars involving node 21 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

23. For node 22: It has neighbors {1, 5, 24, 27}. Since it has 4 neighbors, the number of 3-stars involving node 22 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

24. For node 23: It has neighbors {6, 10, 18, 7, 24}. Since it has 5 neighbors, the number of 3-stars involving node 23 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

25. For node 24: It has neighbors {11, 12, 22, 23}. Since it has 4 neighbors, the number of 3-stars involving node 24 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

26. For node 25: It has neighbors {2, 1, 21}. Since it has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star involving node 25: <25, (2, 1, 21)>.

27. For node 26: It has neighbors {4, 14, 28, 29, 16}. Since it has 5 neighbors, the number of 3-stars involving node 26 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

28. For node 27: It has neighbors {21, 22}. Since it has only 2 neighbors, there are no 3-stars involving node 27.

29. For node 28: It has neighbors {0, 26, 19}. Since it has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star involving node 28: <28, (0, 26, 19)>.

30. For node 29: It has neighbors {5, 7, 12, 21, 26}. Since it has 5 neighbors, the number of 3-stars involving node 29 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Adding up all the 3-stars formed from the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, we get a total of 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 59 3-stars.
Thus, the final result is [59].
