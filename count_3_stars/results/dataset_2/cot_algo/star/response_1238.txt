Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 7, 8}

For nodes with three or more neighbors, we will calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars formed with that node:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- <7, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
