Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 15) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 12) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 15) (18, 17) (18, 1) (5, 17) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 17) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 19) (1, 18) (1, 10) (17, 18) (17, 5) (17, 13) (0, 11) (0, 16) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 3) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 2) (10, 8) (10, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can start by identifying the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {11, 16}
- Node 1: {10, 18}
- Node 2: {9, 14, 15}
- Node 3: {7, 14, 16, 19}
- Node 4: {8, 14, 19}
- Node 5: {17}
- Node 6: {9, 12, 14, 15}
- Node 7: {3, 12, 16}
- Node 8: {4, 10, 12, 15}
- Node 9: {2, 6}
- Node 10: {1, 8}
- Node 11: {0, 13, 16, 19}
- Node 12: {6, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {11, 12, 17}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 15: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 16: {3, 7, 11, 0}
- Node 17: {5, 13, 18}
- Node 18: {1, 17}
- Node 19: {11, 3, 4}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, 3-stars: 1
- Node 2, 3-stars: 1
- Node 3, 3-stars: 1
- Node 4, 3-stars: 1
- Node 6, 3-stars: 1
- Node 8, 3-stars: 1
- Node 12, 3-stars: 1
- Node 14, 3-stars: 1
- Node 15, 3-stars: 1
- Node 16, 3-stars: 1
- Node 17, 3-stars: 1
- Node 19, 3-stars: 1

Counting the total number of 3-stars, [12], the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (11, 13, 16)>
<2, (9, 14, 15)>
<3, (7, 14, 19)>
<4, (14, 19, 3)>
<6, (12, 14, 15)>
<8, (10, 12, 15)>
<12, (13, 7, 16)>
<14, (2, 3, 6)>
<15, (2, 8, 6)>
<16, (0, 11, 7)>
<17, (5, 13, 18)>
<19, (3, 4, 11)>
