Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 13) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0 neighbors: 5, 9, 11, 6
Node 1 neighbors: 5, 4, 12, 8
Node 2 neighbors: 5, 10, 8, 6
Node 3 neighbors: 7, 6, 13
Node 4 neighbors: 10, 1, 14
Node 5 neighbors: 9, 2, 1, 11, 0
Node 6 neighbors: 3, 2, 13, 0
Node 7 neighbors: 12, 3, 14, 13
Node 8 neighbors: 9, 1, 2, 14
Node 9 neighbors: 5, 8, 0, 12
Node 10 neighbors: 4, 11, 13, 2
Node 11 neighbors: 5, 10, 0, 12
Node 12 neighbors: 9, 7, 1, 11
Node 13 neighbors: 7, 10, 14, 6, 3
Node 14 neighbors: 4, 7, 8, 13

Now, we need to identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 11: <5, (1, 2, 11)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 12, 8: <9, (0, 12, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 12, 8: <1, (4, 12, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 8, 6: <2, (10, 8, 6)>
- Node 3 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 4 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 6 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 7 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 8 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 10 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 11 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 12 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 13 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 14 does not form any 3-stars

Since there are 4 3-stars found in the graph, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
