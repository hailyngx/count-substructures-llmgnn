Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 22) (5, 21) (9, 5) (9, 11) (3, 28) (3, 2) (25, 17) (25, 26) (25, 16) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 22) (4, 20) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 29) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 15) (17, 25) (17, 29) (17, 23) (17, 18) (29, 8) (29, 17) (29, 6) (29, 16) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 14) (20, 4) (6, 29) (26, 25) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 27) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 27) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 21) (19, 18) (19, 13) (22, 5) (22, 4) (10, 7) (10, 26) (10, 27) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 26) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 1) (2, 3) (2, 24) (16, 25) (16, 29) (16, 24) (16, 0) (24, 2) (24, 16) (0, 28) (0, 16) (0, 1) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 21) (21, 5) (21, 4) (21, 18) (21, 13) (23, 17) (1, 28) (1, 14) (1, 0) (27, 26) (27, 28) (27, 10) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: node 4, node 8, node 17, and node 29.

For node 4:
- Neighbors: 8, 12, 21, 20, 22
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (8, 12, 21)>, <4, (8, 12, 20)>, <4, (8, 12, 22)>, <4, (8, 21, 20)>, <4, (8, 21, 22)>, <4, (8, 20, 22)>
- Total 3-stars: 10

For node 8:
- Neighbors: 4, 14, 29, 7
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <8, (4, 14, 29)>, <8, (4, 14, 7)>, <8, (4, 29, 7)>, <8, (14, 29, 7)>
- Total 3-stars: 4

For node 17:
- Neighbors: 25, 29, 23, 18
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <17, (25, 29, 23)>, <17, (25, 29, 18)>, <17, (25, 23, 18)>, <17, (29, 23, 18)>
- Total 3-stars: 4

For node 29:
- Neighbors: 8, 17, 6, 16
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <29, (8, 17, 6)>, <29, (8, 17, 16)>, <29, (8, 6, 16)>, <29, (17, 6, 16)>
- Total 3-stars: 4

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the final answer is [22].
