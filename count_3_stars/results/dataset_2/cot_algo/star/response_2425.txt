Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 22) (17, 14) (17, 27) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 16) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 8) (25, 15) (25, 18) (8, 25) (8, 13) (8, 27) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 29) (13, 11) (13, 15) (12, 27) (27, 17) (27, 8) (27, 12) (27, 22) (27, 5) (2, 19) (18, 25) (18, 26) (18, 29) (7, 17) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 1) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 29) (28, 0) (28, 11) (28, 24) (28, 20) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 0) (22, 14) (22, 27) (22, 21) (23, 15) (23, 10) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 28) (11, 19) (21, 6) (21, 22) (21, 5) (26, 18) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 10) (16, 3) (19, 2) (19, 11) (19, 4) (15, 25) (15, 13) (15, 23) (15, 5) (24, 3) (24, 28) (24, 10) (20, 7) (20, 28) (1, 7) (1, 5) (5, 27) (5, 21) (5, 15) (5, 1) (10, 23) (10, 4) (10, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {14, 28, 29}
- Node 1: {5, 7}
- Node 2: {19}
- Node 3: {16, 24, 25}
- Node 4: {9, 10, 19}
- Node 5: {1, 15, 21, 27}
- Node 6: {9, 11, 21}
- Node 7: {1, 17, 20, 25}
- Node 8: {13, 25, 27}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 13}
- Node 10: {4, 23, 24}
- Node 11: {6, 11, 13, 19, 28}
- Node 12: {27}
- Node 13: {8, 11, 13, 15, 29}
- Node 15: {5, 13, 23, 25}
- Node 16: {3}
- Node 17: {7, 14, 27}
- Node 18: {25, 26, 29}
- Node 19: {2, 4, 11}
- Node 20: {7, 28}
- Node 21: {5, 6, 22}
- Node 22: {14, 21, 27}
- Node 23: {10, 15}
- Node 24: {3, 10, 28}
- Node 25: {3, 7, 8, 15, 18}
- Node 26: {18}
- Node 27: {5, 8, 12, 17, 22}
- Node 28: {0, 11, 20, 24}
- Node 29: {0, 13, 18}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0: No 3-star (2 neighbors)
- Node 5: <5, (1, 15, 27)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 17, 25)>
- Node 11: <11, (6, 13, 19)> ;  <11, (13, 28, 19)>
- Node 13: <13, (8, 11, 15)> ;  <13, (11, 15, 29)>
- Node 15: <15, (5, 13, 25)> ;  <15, (13, 23, 25)>
- Node 18: <18, (25, 26, 29)>
- Node 19: <19, (4, 11, 2)>
- Node 21: No 3-star (3 neighbors)
- Node 22: No 3-star (3 neighbors)
- Node 24: No 3-star (3 neighbors)
- Node 25: No 3-star (4 neighbors)
- Node 27: <27, (5, 17, 22)> ;  <27, (8, 17, 22)> ;  <27, (12, 17, 22)>
- Node 28: No 3-star (3 neighbors)
- Node 29: No 3-star (3 neighbors)

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [11].
