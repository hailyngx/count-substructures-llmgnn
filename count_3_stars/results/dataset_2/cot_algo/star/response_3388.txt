Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 12) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 15) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 20) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 20) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 9) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 5) (17, 27) (4, 8) (4, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (28, 17) (28, 29) (28, 27) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 13) (29, 0) (6, 1) (6, 16) (6, 13) (21, 16) (21, 24) (7, 0) (12, 3) (27, 17) (27, 28) (27, 14) (0, 11) (0, 29) (0, 7) (0, 9) (9, 23) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 24) (14, 27) (14, 26) (14, 2) (14, 13) (26, 23) (26, 14) (16, 6) (16, 21) (16, 5) (1, 25) (1, 22) (1, 4) (1, 6) (19, 10) (19, 22) (19, 29) (19, 13) (15, 25) (15, 23) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 14) (13, 29) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 19) (5, 17) (5, 16) (24, 23) (24, 21) (24, 9) (24, 20) (20, 11) (20, 22) (20, 24) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {11, 29, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {25, 22, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {11, 9, 14}
- Node 3: {25, 12, 8}
- Node 4: {8, 1}
- Node 5: {17, 16}
- Node 6: {1, 16, 13}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {3, 4}
- Node 9: {23, 0, 2, 24}
- Node 10: {11, 17, 19}
- Node 11: {10, 0, 2, 20}
- Node 12: {3}
- Node 13: {29, 6, 14, 19}
- Node 14: {27, 26, 2, 13}
- Node 15: {25, 23}
- Node 16: {6, 21, 5}
- Node 17: {10, 28, 5, 27}
- Node 19: {10, 22, 29, 13}
- Node 20: {11, 22, 24}
- Node 21: {16, 24}
- Node 22: {23, 19, 20, 1}
- Node 23: {22, 26, 15, 24, 9}
- Node 24: {23, 21, 9, 20}
- Node 25: {3, 1, 15}
- Node 26: {23, 14}
- Node 27: {17, 28, 14}
- Node 28: {17, 29, 27}
- Node 29: {28, 19, 13, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0, 11, 29, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 11, 29>
- <0, 11, 9>
- <0, 29, 9>
- <11, 29, 9>
