Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 4) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 3) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 11) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 3) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 9, 14, 10
- Node 1: 7, 4, 11
- Node 2: 9, 14, 13, 11
- Node 3: 5, 8, 7, 13, 10
- Node 4: 6, 13, 10, 1, 11
- Node 5: 6, 13, 3
- Node 6: 5, 11, 4
- Node 7: 14, 3, 1
- Node 8: 10, 12, 3
- Node 9: 2, 10, 13, 0, 12
- Node 10: 9, 0, 8, 4, 3
- Node 11: 6, 2, 12, 4, 1
- Node 12: 9, 8, 11
- Node 13: 5, 9, 14, 2, 4, 3
- Node 14: 0, 7, 2, 13

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes <0, (9, 14, 10)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes <1, (7, 4, 11)>
- Node 2 does not form a 3-star as it has more than 3 neighbors
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes <3, (5, 8, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes <4, (6, 13, 10)>
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it has fewer than 3 neighbors
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star as it has fewer than 3 neighbors
- Node 7 does not form a 3-star as it has fewer than 3 neighbors
- Node 8 does not form a 3-star as it has fewer than 3 neighbors
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes <9, (2, 14, 13)>
- Node 10 does not form a 3-star as it has more than 3 neighbors
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes <11, (6, 2, 12)>
- Node 12 does not form a 3-star as it has fewer than 3 neighbors
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes <13, (5, 9, 14)>
- Node 14 does not form a 3-star as it has fewer than 3 neighbors

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars identified are <0, (9, 14, 10)>, <1, (7, 4, 11)>, <3, (5, 8, 7)>, <4, (6, 13, 10)>, <9, (2, 14, 13)>, and <13, (5, 9, 14)>.
