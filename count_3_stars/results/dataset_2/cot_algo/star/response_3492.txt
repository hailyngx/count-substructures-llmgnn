Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 9) (13, 6) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 7) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 18) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 12) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 9) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 18) (10, 15) (15, 0) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 16) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 1) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 19) (16, 13) (16, 15) (6, 13) (6, 15) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 12) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
By analyzing the given edge list, we can construct the following adjacency list for each node:

- Node 0: 7, 15, 4, 18
- Node 1: 14, 8, 12
- Node 2: 17, 8, 19, 7
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 0, 12
- Node 5: 11, 19, 18
- Node 6: 13, 15
- Node 7: 2, 0, 18, 9
- Node 8: 17, 13, 2, 1
- Node 9: 14, 13, 3, 7
- Node 10: 15
- Node 11: 5, 12
- Node 12: 11, 4, 1
- Node 13: 8, 16, 9, 6
- Node 14: 17, 1, 9
- Node 15: 0, 10, 6, 16
- Node 16: 13, 15
- Node 17: 14, 8, 2
- Node 18: 0, 7, 5, 19
- Node 19: 2, 5, 18

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 1: <1, (14, 8, 12)>
- Node 2: <2, (2, 8, 7)>
- Node 5: <5, (5, 11, 19)>
- Node 7: <7, (7, 2, 18)>
- Node 8: <8, (8, 17, 13)>
- Node 9: <9, (9, 14, 13)>
- Node 12: <12, (12, 4, 1)>
- Node 13: <13, (13, 8, 16)>
- Node 15: <15, (15, 0, 16)>
- Node 18: <18, (18, 0, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
