Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 53

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
