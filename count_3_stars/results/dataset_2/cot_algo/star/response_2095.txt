Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 6) (7, 11) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 1) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 6) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 14) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 6}
- Node 1: {9, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 10}
- Node 3: {10, 8, 4, 14}
- Node 4: {5, 13, 12, 3, 14}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 2, 4}
- Node 6: {11, 12, 14, 0}
- Node 7: {11, 12}
- Node 8: {10, 12, 0, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 13, 2, 10, 1}
- Node 10: {9, 11, 3, 8, 2, 1}
- Node 11: {10, 14, 7, 6}
- Node 12: {7, 4, 14, 6, 8}
- Node 13: {5, 9, 4, 1}
- Node 14: {11, 12, 4, 3, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars and count how many unique 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 1: Can form a 3-star with nodes {9, 10, 13} -> <1, (9, 10, 13)>
- Node 4: Can form a 3-star with nodes {5, 13, 12} -> <4, (5, 13, 12)>
- Node 12: Can form a 3-star with nodes {7, 4, 14} -> <12, (7, 4, 14)>
- Node 14: Can form a 3-star with nodes {11, 12, 4} -> <14, (11, 12, 4)>

The total number of unique 3-stars is 4, so the final answer is [4].
