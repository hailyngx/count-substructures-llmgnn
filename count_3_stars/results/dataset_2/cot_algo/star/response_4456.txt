Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 5) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (7, 14) (7, 12) (12, 17) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 1) (0, 16) (0, 13) (1, 12) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 11) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 5) (10, 8) (10, 18) (11, 14) (11, 15) (11, 5) (11, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 15) (5, 17) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 11) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 13) (3, 13) (3, 19) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 16) (8, 10) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 10) (13, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (19, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 16, 13
Node 1: 12, 15
Node 2: 6, 9, 15
Node 3: 13, 19
Node 4: 9, 11, 13
Node 5: 17, 15, 16, 11
Node 6: 9, 18, 2, 8
Node 7: 14, 12
Node 8: 6, 12, 16, 10
Node 9: 6, 2, 4
Node 10: 8, 18
Node 11: 14, 15, 5, 4
Node 12: 17, 7, 8, 1
Node 13: 0, 4, 3
Node 14: 17, 11, 7
Node 15: 1, 5, 2, 11
Node 16: 0, 8, 18, 5
Node 17: 14, 12, 5
Node 18: 6, 16, 10
Node 19: 3

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 25 3-stars. 

So, the final answer is [25], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (17, 15, 16)>
<6, (9, 18, 2)>
<8, (12, 16, 10)>
<9, (6, 2, 4)>
<11, (14, 15, 5)>
<12, (17, 8, 1)>
<13, (4, 3, 0)>
<15, (1, 5, 11)>
<16, (8, 18, 5)>
