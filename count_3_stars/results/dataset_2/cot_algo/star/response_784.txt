Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 4) (0, 29) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 3) (27, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 29) (9, 19) (14, 1) (14, 18) (17, 10) (17, 23) (17, 15) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 2) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 25) (15, 5) (20, 26) (28, 19) (29, 0) (29, 9) (29, 24) (21, 24) (21, 13) (21, 19) (24, 29) (24, 21) (24, 26) (24, 11) (19, 9) (19, 28) (19, 21) (19, 26) (19, 5) (26, 20) (26, 24) (26, 19) (26, 18) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 11) (22, 8) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 7) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 8) (11, 24) (11, 22) (11, 23) (11, 12) (23, 17) (23, 11) (23, 25) (25, 27) (25, 15) (25, 23) (25, 16) (25, 8) (7, 15) (7, 18) (16, 25) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 22) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 22) (2, 13) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 11) (12, 1) (13, 21) (13, 2) (8, 27) (8, 22) (8, 5) (8, 25) (3, 27) (3, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:

Node 0 neighbors: 4, 27, 29
Node 1 neighbors: 6, 12, 14
Node 2 neighbors: 6, 10, 13, 22
Node 3 neighbors: 6, 27
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 10, 22
Node 5 neighbors: 8, 15, 19
Node 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 3
Node 7 neighbors: 15, 18
Node 8 neighbors: 5, 8, 22, 25
Node 9 neighbors: 19, 29
Node 10 neighbors: 2, 4, 10, 17
Node 11 neighbors: 12, 22, 23, 24
Node 12 neighbors: 1, 11
Node 13 neighbors: 2, 21
Node 14 neighbors: 1, 18
Node 15 neighbors: 5, 7, 15, 17, 23, 25
Node 16 neighbors: 25
Node 17 neighbors: 10, 15, 17, 23
Node 18 neighbors: 7, 14, 18, 26
Node 19 neighbors: 5, 9, 19, 21, 26, 28
Node 20 neighbors: 26
Node 21 neighbors: 13, 19, 21, 24
Node 22 neighbors: 2, 4, 8, 11
Node 23 neighbors: 11, 15, 17, 23, 25
Node 24 neighbors: 11, 21, 24, 26, 29
Node 25 neighbors: 8, 15, 16, 23, 25, 27
Node 26 neighbors: 18, 19, 20, 24, 26
Node 27 neighbors: 0, 3, 25, 27
Node 28 neighbors: 19
Node 29 neighbors: 0, 9, 24, 29

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: Inom(3, 3) = 1
Node 2: Inom(4, 3) = 4
Node 4: Inom(3, 3) = 1
Node 5: Inom(4, 3) = 4
Node 8: Inom(4, 3) = 4
Node 10: Inom(4, 3) = 4
Node 11: Inom(4, 3) = 4
Node 15: Inom(6, 3) = 20
Node 17: Inom(4, 3) = 4
Node 18: Inom(4, 3) = 4
Node 19: Inom(6, 3) = 20
Node 21: Inom(4, 3) = 4
Node 22: Inom(4, 3) = 4
Node 23: Inom(5, 3) = 10
Node 24: Inom(5, 3) = 10
Node 25: Inom(6, 3) = 20
Node 26: Inom(5, 3) = 10
Node 27: Inom(4, 3) = 4
Node 29: Inom(4, 3) = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 118

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [118].

Unique 3-stars in the graph are:

<4, 10, 22>
<5, 8, 25>
