Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 27) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 29) (16, 20) (1, 11) (21, 7) (21, 10) (7, 21) (7, 29) (18, 22) (18, 6) (18, 17) (22, 18) (22, 15) (3, 25) (3, 12) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 2) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 24) (13, 23) (6, 18) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 0) (28, 6) (28, 2) (0, 6) (0, 23) (14, 9) (14, 10) (19, 26) (19, 10) (19, 24) (26, 19) (26, 24) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 26) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 5) (10, 21) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 9) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 17) (2, 25) (2, 28) (2, 5) (2, 20) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 20) (29, 11) (29, 16) (29, 7) (29, 27) (9, 14) (9, 10) (15, 22) (15, 23) (23, 25) (23, 13) (23, 0) (23, 15) (27, 11) (27, 29) (4, 5) (4, 20) (20, 16) (20, 2) (20, 5) (20, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by determining the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors = {6, 23}
Node 1: Neighbors = {11}
Node 2: Neighbors = {5, 20, 25, 28}
Node 3: Neighbors = {12, 25}
Node 4: Neighbors = {5}
Node 5: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8, 17, 20}
Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 10, 18, 28}
Node 7: Neighbors = {21, 29}
Node 8: Neighbors = {5, 12, 13}
Node 9: Neighbors = {10, 14}
Node 10: Neighbors = {6, 9, 14, 19, 21}
Node 11: Neighbors = {1, 16, 27, 29}
Node 12: Neighbors = {3, 8, 16, 17}
Node 13: Neighbors = {8, 13, 17, 23, 24}
Node 14: Neighbors = {9, 10}
Node 15: Neighbors = {22, 23}
Node 16: Neighbors = {11, 12, 20, 29}
Node 17: Neighbors = {5, 12, 13, 18}
Node 18: Neighbors = {6, 17, 22}
Node 19: Neighbors = {10, 24, 26}
Node 20: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 16}
Node 21: Neighbors = {7, 10}
Node 22: Neighbors = {15, 18}
Node 23: Neighbors = {0, 13, 15, 25}
Node 24: Neighbors = {13, 19, 26}
Node 25: Neighbors = {2, 3, 23}
Node 26: Neighbors = {19, 24}
Node 27: Neighbors = {11, 29}
Node 28: Neighbors = {2, 6}
Node 29: Neighbors = {7, 11, 16, 27}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, insufficient for a 3-star.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, which forms exactly 1 3-star.
Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 18 has 3 neighbors, which forms exactly 1 3-star.
Node 19 has 3 neighbors, which forms exactly 1 3-star.
Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 22 has 2 neighbors, insufficient for a 3-star.
Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 24 has 3 neighbors, which forms exactly 1 3-star.
Node 25 has 3 neighbors, which forms exactly 1 3-star.
Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get: 
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 62 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62].
