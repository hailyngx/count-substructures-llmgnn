Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (29, 26) (29, 13) (29, 23) (29, 21) (3, 21) (25, 19) (25, 14) (22, 23) (22, 10) (23, 29) (23, 22) (23, 4) (12, 2) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 11) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 20) (27, 13) (27, 16) (4, 23) (4, 26) (8, 10) (8, 21) (6, 12) (6, 28) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 26) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 7) (28, 24) (5, 16) (13, 29) (13, 27) (13, 18) (26, 29) (26, 4) (26, 6) (26, 28) (26, 14) (21, 29) (21, 3) (21, 8) (14, 2) (14, 25) (14, 26) (14, 10) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 19) (10, 22) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 0) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 24) (11, 18) (24, 27) (24, 28) (24, 11) (24, 1) (7, 6) (7, 28) (15, 0) (15, 17) (19, 25) (19, 0) (19, 1) (17, 6) (17, 15) (1, 24) (1, 19) (1, 20) (1, 16) (20, 27) (20, 1) (9, 16) (16, 27) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 9) (18, 13) (18, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: {10, 15, 19}
- Node 1: {16, 19, 20, 24}
- Node 2: {11, 12, 14}
- Node 3: {21}
- Node 4: {23, 26}
- Node 5: {16}
- Node 6: {7, 12, 17, 26, 28}
- Node 7: {6, 28}
- Node 8: {10, 21}
- Node 9: {16}
- Node 10: {0, 14, 22, 8}
- Node 11: {2, 12, 18, 24}
- Node 12: {2, 6, 11, 27}
- Node 13: {18, 27, 29}
- Node 14: {2, 10, 25, 26}
- Node 15: {0, 17}
- Node 16: {1, 5, 9, 27}
- Node 17: {6, 15}
- Node 18: {11, 13}
- Node 19: {0, 1, 25}
- Node 20: {1, 27}
- Node 21: {3, 8, 29}
- Node 22: {10, 23}
- Node 23: {4, 22, 29}
- Node 24: {1, 11, 27, 28}
- Node 25: {14, 19}
- Node 26: {4, 6, 14, 28, 29}
- Node 27: {12, 13, 16, 20, 24}
- Node 28: {6, 7, 24, 26}
- Node 29: {13, 21, 23, 26}

The nodes with exactly 3 or more neighbors are: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{0}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{11}{3} + \binom{12}{3} + \binom{13}{3} + \binom{14}{3} + \binom{16}{3} + \binom{19}{3} + \binom{21}{3} + \binom{24}{3} + \binom{26}{3} + \binom{27}{3} + \binom{28}{3} + \binom{29}{3} = 249$

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [249].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (10, 15, 19)>, 
<1, (16, 20, 24)>, 
<2, (11, 12, 14)>, 
<4, (23, 26, 29)>, 
<6, (12, 26, 28)>, 
<11, (18, 24, 27)>, 
<14, (10, 25, 26)>, 
<29, (13, 23, 26)>, 
<27, (16, 20, 24)>, 
<24, (11, 27, 28)>
