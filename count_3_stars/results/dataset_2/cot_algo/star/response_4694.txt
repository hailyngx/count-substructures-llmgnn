Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 22) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 18) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 24) (7, 26) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 26) (8, 25) (8, 0) (8, 26) (23, 6) (23, 20) (23, 27) (12, 25) (12, 15) (12, 9) (28, 11) (28, 19) (5, 21) (5, 27) (13, 21) (20, 23) (20, 22) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 19) (1, 17) (1, 19) (25, 8) (25, 12) (25, 27) (25, 29) (27, 23) (27, 5) (27, 25) (15, 12) (15, 2) (15, 24) (19, 14) (19, 28) (19, 0) (19, 1) (21, 5) (21, 13) (21, 9) (21, 18) (21, 2) (6, 23) (6, 29) (3, 4) (3, 24) (3, 22) (24, 7) (24, 15) (24, 3) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 21) (29, 14) (29, 25) (29, 6) (29, 26) (26, 7) (26, 17) (26, 8) (26, 29) (22, 11) (22, 20) (22, 3) (10, 18) (18, 16) (18, 21) (18, 10) (2, 15) (2, 21) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {16, 7, 8, 9, 19}
- Node 1: {17, 19}
- Node 2: {15, 21}
- Node 3: {4, 24, 22}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 3}
- Node 5: {21, 27}
- Node 6: {23, 29}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 24, 26}
- Node 8: {25, 0, 26}
- Node 9: {4, 12, 0, 21}
- Node 10: {18}
- Node 11: {16, 28, 22}
- Node 12: {25, 15, 9}
- Node 13: {21}
- Node 14: {17, 19, 29}
- Node 15: {2, 12, 24}
- Node 16: {11, 0, 18}
- Node 17: {14, 1, 26}
- Node 18: {10, 21, 16}
- Node 19: {14, 1, 28, 0}
- Node 20: {23, 22}
- Node 21: {5, 13, 18, 2, 9}
- Node 22: {20, 11, 3}
- Node 23: {6, 20, 27}
- Node 24: {7, 3, 15}
- Node 25: {8, 12, 27, 29}
- Node 26: {7, 17, 8, 29}
- Node 27: {5, 23, 25}
- Node 28: {11, 19}
- Node 29: {14, 25, 6, 26}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, forming [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars. 
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <4, 7, 9>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <14, 17, 19>
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <16, 0, 18>
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors, forming [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars. 
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. 

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43]. The unique 3-stars are:
<4, 7, 9>, <14, 17, 19>, <16, 0, 18>, <21, 2, 9>, <25, 8, 27>, <26, 17, 8>, <29, 25, 26>.
