Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 8) (15, 12) (15, 2) (15, 11) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (12, 15) (12, 7) (12, 14) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 10) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 16) (0, 4) (0, 17) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 8) (2, 15) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 11) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 13) (13, 16) (13, 11) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 13) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars and list them, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {4, 17}
Node 1: {5, 7, 9}
Node 2: {5, 11, 15, 19}
Node 3: {7, 8, 16}
Node 4: {0, 7, 10, 14}
Node 5: {1, 2}
Node 6: {7, 9, 11}
Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 6, 12}
Node 8: {3, 10, 16, 19}
Node 9: {1, 6, 17}
Node 10: {4, 8, 19}
Node 11: {2, 6, 13, 15}
Node 12: {7, 14, 15}
Node 13: {11, 16}
Node 14: {4, 12}
Node 15: {2, 11, 12}
Node 16: {3, 8, 13, 17}
Node 17: {0, 9, 16}
Node 19: {2, 8, 10}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {5, 2, 9}. It forms one 3-star: <1, (5, 2, 9)>
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {5, 11, 15, 19}. It forms four 3-stars: <2, (5, 11, 15)>, <2, (5, 11, 19)>, <2, (5, 15, 19)>, <2, (11, 15, 19)>
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {7, 8, 16}. It forms one 3-star: <3, (7, 8, 16)>
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {0, 7, 10, 14}. It forms four 3-stars: <4, (0, 7, 10)>, <4, (0, 7, 14)>, <4, (0, 10, 14)>, <4, (7, 10, 14)>
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {7, 9, 11}. It forms one 3-star: <6, (7, 9, 11)>
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {1, 3, 4, 6, 12}. It forms ten 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 12)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 12)>, <7, (1, 6, 12)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 12)>, <7, (3, 6, 12)>, <7, (4, 6, 12)>
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {3, 10, 16, 19}. It forms four 3-stars: <8, (3, 10, 16)>, <8, (3, 10, 19)>, <8, (3, 16, 19)>, <8, (10, 16, 19)>
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {1, 6, 17}. It forms one 3-star: <9, (1, 6, 17)>
Node 10 has 3 neighbors: {4, 8, 19}. It forms one 3-star: <10, (4, 8, 19)>
Node 11 has 4 neighbors: {2, 6, 13, 15}. It forms four 3-stars: <11, (2, 6, 13)>, <11, (2, 6, 15)>, <11, (2, 13, 15)>, <11, (6, 13, 15)>
Node 12 has 3 neighbors: {7, 14, 15}. It forms one 3-star: <12, (7, 14, 15)>
Node 16 has 4 neighbors: {3, 8, 13, 17}. It forms four 3-stars: <16, (3, 8, 13)>, <16, (3, 8, 17)>, <16, (3, 13, 17)>, <16, (8, 13, 17)>

Adding up all the 3-stars found, the total number is [31].
