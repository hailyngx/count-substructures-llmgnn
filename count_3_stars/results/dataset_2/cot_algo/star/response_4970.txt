Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 17) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 17) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 8) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 17) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 16) (19, 4) (19, 14) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 16) (14, 19) (14, 12) (18, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 17) (17, 15) (17, 7) (17, 11) (17, 12) (16, 4) (16, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {7, 12}
- Node 1: {6, 8, 13}
- Node 2: {3, 9, 10, 16}
- Node 3: {2, 10, 15}
- Node 4: {6, 16, 19}
- Node 5: {7, 13, 18}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 8, 10}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 11, 13, 17}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 10}
- Node 9: {2, 11}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 11: {7, 9, 13, 17}
- Node 12: {0, 14, 17}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 14: {12, 19}
- Node 15: {3, 17}
- Node 16: {2, 4}
- Node 17: {7, 11, 12, 15}
- Node 18: {5}
- Node 19: {4, 14}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, Node 7, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 4, Node 5, Node 17, Node 16

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <2, (3, 9, 10)>
    - <2, (3, 9, 16)>
    - <2, (3, 10, 16)>
    - <2, (9, 10, 16)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <3, (2, 10, 15)>
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <6, (1, 8, 10)>
    - <6, (1, 8, 10)>
    - <6, (4, 8, 10)>
    - <6, (1, 4, 10)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <7, (11, 13, 17)>
    - <7, (5, 13, 11)>
    - <7, (5, 11, 17)>
    - <7, (5, 13, 17)>
    - <7, (5, 11, 13)>
    - <7, (5, 13, 17)>
    - <7, (13, 11, 17)>
    - <7, (5, 11, 13)>
    - <7, (11, 13, 17)>
    - <7, (7, 11, 17)>
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <10, (1, 2, 3)>
    - <10, (1, 2, 6)>
    - <10, (1, 2, 8)>
    - <10, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <10, (1, 3, 8)>
    - <10, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <10, (2, 3, 6)>
    - <10, (2, 3, 8)>
    - <10, (2, 6, 8)>
    - <10, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <11, (7, 13, 17)>
    - <11, (7, 13, 11)>
    - <11, (13, 17, 12)>
    - <11, (7, 13, 17)>
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <12, (0, 14, 17)>
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <13, (7, 11, 17)>
    - <13, (5, 11, 7)>
    - <13, (5, 11, 17)>
    - <13, (5, 7, 11)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <4, (6, 16, 19)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <5, (7, 13, 11)>
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <17, (12, 15, 7)>
    - <17, (12, 15, 11)>
    - <17, (15, 7, 12)>
    - <17, (15, 7, 11)>
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Not enough neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 34
Therefore, the final answer is [34].
