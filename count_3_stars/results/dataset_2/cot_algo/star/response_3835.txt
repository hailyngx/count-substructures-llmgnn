Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. We will now find the 3-stars in this graph.

1. For node 4: Neighbors = {7, 12, 10}. Since it has 3 neighbors, there is one 3-star: <4, (7, 12, 10)>.
2. For node 7: Neighbors = {4, 15, 2, 13}. Since it has 4 neighbors, there are 4 3-stars: <7, (4, 15, 2)>, <7, (4, 15, 13)>, <7, (4, 2, 13)>, <7, (15, 2, 13)>.
3. For node 8: Neighbors = {16, 15, 18}. Since it has 3 neighbors, there is one 3-star: <8, (16, 15, 18)>.
4. For node 12: Neighbors = {4, 6}. Since it has 2 neighbors, it does not form any 3-star.
5. For node 1: Neighbors = {17, 15, 16, 5}. Since it has 4 neighbors, there are 4 3-stars: <1, (17, 15, 16)>, <1, (17, 15, 5)>, <1, (17, 16, 5)>, <1, (15, 16, 5)>.
6. For node 17: Neighbors = {1, 0}. Since it has 2 neighbors, it does not form any 3-star.
7. For node 5: Neighbors = {1, 19, 2, 3}. Since it has 4 neighbors, there are 4 3-stars: <5, (1, 19, 2)>, <5, (1, 19, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (19, 2, 3)>.
8. For node 19: Neighbors = {5, 11, 2, 14}. Since it has 4 neighbors, there are 4 3-stars: <19, (5, 11, 2)>, <19, (5, 11, 14)>, <19, (5, 2, 14)>, <19, (11, 2, 14)>.
9. For node 15: Neighbors = {7, 8, 1, 11}. Since it has 4 neighbors, there are 4 3-stars: <15, (7, 8, 1)>, <15, (7, 8, 11)>, <15, (7, 1, 11)>, <15, (8, 1, 11)>.
10. For node 13: Neighbors = {7}. Since it has only 1 neighbor, it does not form any 3-star.
11. For node 9: Neighbors = {2, 11, 10}. Since it has 3 neighbors, there is one 3-star: <9, (2, 11, 10)>.
12. For node 18: Neighbors = {8, 10, 6}. Since it has 3 neighbors, there is one 3-star: <18, (8, 10, 6)>.
13. For node 0: Neighbors = {17, 3, 11}. Since it has 3 neighbors, there is one 3-star: <0, (17, 3, 11)>.
14. For node 10: Neighbors = {4, 9, 18, 3}. Since it has 4 neighbors, there are 4 3-stars: <10, (4, 9, 18)>, <10, (4, 9, 3)>, <10, (4, 18, 3)>, <10, (9, 18, 3)>.
15. For node 3: Neighbors = {5, 0, 10}. Since it has 3 neighbors, there is one 3-star: <3, (5, 0, 10)>.
16. For node 2: Neighbors = {7, 5, 19, 9}. Since it has 4 neighbors, there are 4 3-stars: <2, (7, 5, 19)>, <2, (7, 5, 9)>, <2, (7, 19, 9)>, <2, (5, 19, 9)>.
17. For node 11: Neighbors = {19, 15, 9, 0}. Since it has 4 neighbors, there are 4 3-stars: <11, (19, 15, 9)>, <11, (19, 15, 0)>, <11, (19, 9, 0)>, <11, (15, 9, 0)>.
18. For node 16: Neighbors = {8, 1}. Since it has only 2 neighbors, it does not form any 3-star.
19. For node 6: Neighbors = {12, 18}. Since it has 2 neighbors, it does not form any 3-star.
20. For node 14: Neighbors = {19}. Since it has only 1 neighbor, it does not form any 3-star.

Counting up the total number of 3-stars, we have 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 20. Therefore, the final answer is [20].
