Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 6, 1, 4, 7
Node 1: 3, 2, 5, 0, 8
Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 8
Node 3: 9, 1, 4, 2, 5
Node 4: 9, 3, 0, 5
Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 7, 2
Node 6: 9, 8, 0
Node 7: 0, 5, 8
Node 8: 6, 1, 7, 2
Node 9: 6, 4, 3

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4C3 = 4
Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 5C3 = 10
Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 5C3 = 10
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4C3 = 4
Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 5C3 = 10
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4C3 = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the final calculation is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>
