Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 4) (15, 11) (8, 2) (8, 17) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 18) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 15) (11, 7) (0, 10) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 16) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (5, 13) (5, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 17) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 16) (19, 13) (19, 1) (19, 12) (16, 14) (16, 6) (16, 18) (17, 8) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 4) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 17) (9, 10) (9, 17) (18, 13) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 12) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 18) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 10
- Node 1: 6, 19
- Node 2: 3, 8, 10, 14
- Node 3: 2, 7, 12, 15
- Node 4: 5, 14, 15, 17
- Node 5: 4, 13
- Node 6: 1, 16, 18
- Node 7: 3, 11, 15, 17
- Node 8: 2, 17
- Node 9: 10, 17
- Node 10: 0, 2, 9, 14
- Node 11: 7, 15
- Node 12: 3, 18, 19
- Node 13: 5, 18, 19
- Node 14: 2, 4, 10, 16
- Node 15: 3, 4, 7, 11
- Node 16: 6, 14, 18
- Node 17: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 18: 6, 12, 13, 16
- Node 19: 1, 12, 13

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 4 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: No 3-star is formed

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24

Therefore, the final answer is [24].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <2, (3, 8, 14)>
- <3, (2, 7, 15)>
- <4, (5, 14, 17)>
- <7, (4, 15, 17)>
- <10, (0, 14, 17)>
- <14, (2, 4, 16)>
- <15, (3, 4, 11)>
- <16, (6, 14, 18)>
- <17, (4, 7, 9)>
- <18, (6, 12, 13)>
