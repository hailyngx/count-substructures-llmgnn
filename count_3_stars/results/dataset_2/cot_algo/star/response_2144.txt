Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 7) (6, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 2) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, the neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 7, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 12, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {1}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {11, 12}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 7, 13}
- Node 10: {5, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {8, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 13: {5, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 10}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms a total of C(5, 3) = 10 possible 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms a total of C(5, 3) = 10 possible 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms a total of C(5, 3) = 10 possible 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms a total of C(4, 3) = 4 possible 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it forms a total of C(6, 3) = 20 possible 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms a total of C(4, 3) = 4 possible 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms a total of C(5, 3) = 10 possible 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms a total of C(4, 3) = 4 possible 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms a total of C(5, 3) = 10 possible 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms a total of C(4, 3) = 4 possible 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 72

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [72].
