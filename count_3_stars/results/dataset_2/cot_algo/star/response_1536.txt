Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 12) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 12) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (13, 7) (13, 9) (10, 2) (10, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 7, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6, 8, 10}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 8, 11}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 5, 11}
- Node 9: {0, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {2, 7}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 13: {7, 9}
- Node 14: {1, 5, 11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars based on the number of neighbors each node has:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: 1 3-star (4, 8, 11)
- Node 5: 1 3-star (5, 1, 14)
- Node 6: 0 3-stars
- Node 7: 0 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 3-star (8, 2, 5)
- Node 9: 0 3-stars
- Node 10: 0 3-stars
- Node 11: 1 3-star (11, 1, 14)
- Node 12: 0 3-stars
- Node 13: 0 3-stars
- Node 14: 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 33

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [33]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, 8, 11>, <5, 1, 14>, <8, 2, 5>, <11, 1, 14>.
