Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 8) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 6) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {12, 14, 10, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 13, 6, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 3, 1, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {13, 11, 10, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 1, 11, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {12, 14, 11, 1, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {11, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 12, 0, 10}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 4, 14, 10}
- Node 10: Neighbors {9, 0, 3, 8}
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 7, 13, 3, 6}
- Node 12: Neighbors {13, 0, 6, 8}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 12, 11, 3, 1}
- Node 14: Neighbors {9, 7, 0, 6}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars based on the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 11: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 13: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 66

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [66].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (4, 6, 13)>
- <2, (4, 6, 13)>
- <3, (11, 13, 5)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <8, (9, 10, 12)>
- <9, (5, 10, 14)>
- <10, (3, 8, 9)>
- <11, (3, 6, 13)>
- <12, (0, 8, 14)>
- <13, (1, 3, 6)>
- <14, (0, 6, 8)>
