Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 7, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6
Node 2: 1, 4, 6
Node 3: 5, 7, 8
Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 5: 1, 3, 4
Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8
Node 8: 3, 7, 9
Node 9: 0, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: No 3-star can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 3: No 3-star can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 5: No 3-star can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: No 3-star can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 9: No 3-star can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 51

Therefore, the final result is [51].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
