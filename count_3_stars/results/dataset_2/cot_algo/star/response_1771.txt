Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (16, 9) (16, 5) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 29) (27, 0) (27, 6) (27, 13) (27, 8) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 26) (2, 10) (2, 25) (29, 0) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 15) (12, 17) (12, 3) (12, 26) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 17) (5, 16) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 11) (6, 27) (6, 5) (8, 27) (8, 23) (8, 4) (23, 8) (23, 3) (21, 28) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 4) (28, 21) (28, 22) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 21) (26, 2) (26, 12) (26, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 19) (20, 21) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 25) (25, 2) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 22) (1, 25) (1, 14) (1, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 9) (15, 29) (15, 19) (19, 29) (19, 17) (19, 15) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 23) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 3) (22, 21) (22, 28) (22, 25) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 10) (13, 27) (13, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by first determining the neighbor nodes for each node and then counting the 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors.

Here are the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {27, 7, 10, 4, 29}
- Node 1: Neighbors {25, 14, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {29, 18, 26, 10, 25}
- Node 3: Neighbors {12, 5, 23, 14, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 8, 21}
- Node 5: Neighbors {16, 6, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {11, 27, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 18, 25}
- Node 8: Neighbors {27, 23, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {16, 1, 10}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 2, 26, 9}
- Node 12: Neighbors {17, 3, 26}
- Node 13: Neighbors {27, 3}
- Node 14: Neighbors {18, 1, 3}
- Node 15: Neighbors {29, 19}
- Node 16: Neighbors {9, 5}
- Node 17: Neighbors {12, 18, 19}
- Node 18: Neighbors {2, 14, 17, 7}
- Node 19: Neighbors {29, 17, 15}
- Node 20: Neighbors {21}
- Node 21: Neighbors {28, 20, 22, 4}
- Node 22: Neighbors {21, 28, 25}
- Node 23: Neighbors {8, 3}
- Node 25: Neighbors {2, 7, 1, 22}
- Node 26: Neighbors {2, 12, 10}
- Node 27: Neighbors {0, 6, 13, 8}
- Node 28: Neighbors {21, 22}
- Node 29: Neighbors {0, 2, 19, 15}

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 41. Hence, the final number to be placed inside brackets is [41].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
