Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 11) (3, 10) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 0) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 17) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 11) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 14) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 4) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 16) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 17) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 15) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 12) (9, 1) (9, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 12) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 10) (17, 2) (17, 15) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {13, 7, 15}
- Node 1: {5, 9}
- Node 2: {18, 6, 17}
- Node 3: {11, 10}
- Node 4: {5, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 19, 12, 4}
- Node 6: {2, 7}
- Node 7: {8, 0, 6, 19, 14}
- Node 8: {13, 18, 7, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 4}
- Node 10: {3, 19, 12}
- Node 11: {3, 18, 14}
- Node 12: {5, 14, 10}
- Node 13: {8, 16, 0}
- Node 14: {8, 11, 7, 12}
- Node 15: {0, 16, 17}
- Node 16: {13, 19, 15}
- Node 17: {2, 15}
- Node 18: {2, 8, 11}
- Node 19: {7, 5, 10, 16}

Identifying nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0:  inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5:  inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7:  inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8:  inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14:  inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 19:  inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 27

Therefore, the final answer is [27], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 15, 7>
<5, 1, 12>
<7, 8, 14>
<16, 13, 0>
<19, 5, 10>
<2, 17, 15>
<7, 19, 16>
<8, 18, 2>
<0, 7, 13>
<8, 14, 11>
<8, 14, 12>
<2, 18, 11>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 19, 16>
<10, 12, 14>
<4, 9, 1>
<11, 14, 7>
<15, 16, 13>
<7, 19, 5>
<7, 19, 10>
<0, 13, 8>
<2, 18, 8>
<19, 16, 15>
<7, 19, 5>
<9, 4, 1>
