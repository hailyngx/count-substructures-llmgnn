Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of its adjacency list:

Node 0: 4, 7, 9
Node 1: 4, 6, 7
Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 8
Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7
Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 8
Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 5
Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
Node 8: 2, 3, 5, 9
Node 9: 0, 7, 8

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (4, 7, 9), so it forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (4, 6, 7), so it forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (6, 3, 8)>.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>,<7, (1, 4, 9)>,<7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 3)>, <8, (2, 6, 3)>, <8, (5, 6, 3)>.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (0, 7, 8), so it forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 49 3-stars. 
Therefore, the final answer is [49].
