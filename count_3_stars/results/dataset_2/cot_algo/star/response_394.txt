Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with its adjacency list:

1: {3, 5, 9, 8}
2: {9, 7, 0}
3: {1, 7, 6, 5, 4}
4: {3, 8, 0, 5, 6}
5: {1, 3, 4, 7}
6: {3, 4, 7}
7: {3, 2, 9, 6, 5}
8: {1, 4, 9}
9: {1, 8, 2, 7, 0}
0: {4, 2, 9}

Next, we'll identify the unique 3-stars using the method described in the initial statement:

Nodes with 3 neighbors or more are: 1, 3, 4, 9, 7
For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

Node 1:
- Neighbors: 3, 5, 9
- 3-star count: 1

Node 3:
- Neighbors: 1, 7, 6, 5, 4
- 3-star count: 1

Node 4:
- Neighbors: 3, 8, 0, 5, 6
- 3-star count: 1

Node 9:
- Neighbors: 1, 8, 2, 7, 0
- 3-star count: 6

Node 7:
- Neighbors: 3, 2, 9, 6, 5
- 3-star count: 1

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 6)>
<4, (3, 8, 0)>
<9, (1, 8, 2)>
<7, (3, 2, 9)>
