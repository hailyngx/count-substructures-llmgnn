Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 19) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 15) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 11) (8, 15) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 18) (2, 5) (2, 6) (18, 13) (18, 14) (18, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 0) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 12) (3, 7) (3, 18) (3, 9) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 14) (0, 16) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 12) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 0) (14, 18) (14, 5) (14, 15) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 10) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 19) (9, 13) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 12, 15, 16}
- Node 1: {0, 10, 15}
- Node 2: {5, 6}
- Node 3: {7, 9, 18}
- Node 4: {5, 15, 19}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 14, 17}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 11}
- Node 7: {3, 6}
- Node 8: {11, 15}
- Node 9: {3, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 13, 19}
- Node 11: {6, 8, 17}
- Node 12: {0, 16, 17}
- Node 13: {9, 10, 18}
- Node 14: {5, 15, 18}
- Node 15: {0, 1, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 16: {0, 12, 19}
- Node 17: {5, 11, 12}
- Node 18: {3, 13, 14}
- Node 19: {4, 10, 16}

Now, we can identify which nodes can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 4, Node 15, and Node 16 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 12, 16)>, <0, (1, 15, 14)>, <0, (4, 15, 16)>, <0, (12, 15, 16)>, <4, (5, 14, 17)>, <15, (1, 14, 18)>.
