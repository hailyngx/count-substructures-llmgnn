Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 1) (2, 27) (2, 21) (29, 2) (29, 25) (29, 14) (3, 27) (3, 5) (25, 29) (25, 5) (25, 8) (8, 25) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 8) (15, 10) (15, 26) (15, 22) (15, 24) (20, 26) (20, 1) (20, 5) (0, 8) (0, 28) (14, 29) (14, 18) (14, 21) (21, 2) (21, 14) (21, 11) (28, 0) (28, 12) (9, 22) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 1) (22, 15) (22, 9) (22, 5) (24, 15) (24, 26) (24, 17) (26, 15) (26, 20) (26, 24) (26, 7) (7, 8) (7, 26) (7, 11) (7, 19) (10, 15) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 23) (27, 2) (27, 3) (27, 23) (18, 14) (18, 5) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 12) (4, 23) (4, 6) (11, 21) (11, 7) (6, 4) (6, 17) (6, 16) (17, 9) (17, 24) (17, 6) (1, 2) (1, 20) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 19) (5, 3) (5, 25) (5, 20) (5, 22) (5, 18) (23, 10) (23, 27) (23, 4) (12, 28) (12, 19) (16, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 28}
- Node 1: {2, 20, 9, 10, 19}
- Node 2: {29, 1, 27}
- Node 3: {27, 5}
- Node 4: {23, 6}
- Node 5: {25, 3, 8, 22, 18}
- Node 6: {4, 17, 16}
- Node 7: {8, 26, 11, 19}
- Node 8: {25, 13, 0, 7}
- Node 9: {22, 10, 1, 17}
- Node 10: {15, 9, 1, 23}
- Node 11: {21, 7}
- Node 12: {28, 19}
- Node 13: {8}
- Node 14: {29, 18, 21}
- Node 15: {10, 26, 22, 24}
- Node 16: {6}
- Node 17: {9, 24, 6}
- Node 18: {5, 14}
- Node 19: {1, 7, 12}
- Node 20: {26, 1, 5}
- Node 21: {2, 14, 11}
- Node 22: {15, 5, 9}
- Node 23: {4, 10, 27}
- Node 24: {15, 26, 17}
- Node 25: {29, 5, 8}
- Node 26: {20, 15, 24, 7}
- Node 27: {2, 3, 23}
- Node 28: {0, 12}
- Node 29: {2, 25, 14}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <2, (1, 27, 29)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <5, (3, 18, 25)>, <5, (20, 22, 25)>, <5, (3, 18, 22)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <8, (0, 7, 25)>, <8, (0, 13, 7)>, <8, (7, 13, 25)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <14, (18, 21, 29)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <15, (10, 22, 26)>, <15, (22, 24, 26)>, <15, (10, 24, 22)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <17, (6, 9, 24)>, <17, (6, 17, 24)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <19, (1, 7, 12)>
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <21, (11, 14, 29)>
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <24, (15, 17, 26)>
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <25, (5, 8, 29)>
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <26, (7, 15, 24)>, <26, (7, 20, 15)>, <26, (15, 17, 24)>

Counting all the 3-stars identified, we find a total of 13 unique 3-stars, so the answer is [13].
