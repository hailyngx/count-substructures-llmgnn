Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 16) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 11) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 16) (4, 9) (18, 13) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (5, 13) (5, 19) (13, 18) (13, 5) (13, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 8) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 6) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 8) (12, 15) (12, 2) (1, 2) (1, 8) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 6) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 13) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 14, 2, 7, 16  
Node 1: 2, 8  
Node 2: 0, 1, 12  
Node 3: 15, 6, 9  
Node 4: 9  
Node 5: 13, 19  
Node 6: 3, 15, 19, 11  
Node 7: 10, 0, 8  
Node 8: 14, 7, 16, 1  
Node 9: 3, 14, 4, 13  
Node 10: 15, 17, 7  
Node 11: 17, 19, 6  
Node 12: 15, 2  
Node 13: 18, 5, 9  
Node 14: 17, 0, 8, 9  
Node 15: 3, 6, 12, 10, 16  
Node 16: 15, 0, 8  
Node 17: 14, 10, 11  
Node 18: 13  
Node 19: 5, 11, 6  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 3 has 3 neighbors: <15, 6, 9>  
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: <3, 15, 19>, <15, 12, 16>  
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: <3, 14, 4>, <3, 13, 5>  
Node 14 has 4 neighbors: <17, 0, 8>, <17, 10, 11>  
Node 15 has 5 neighbors: <3, 6, 12>, <3, 10, 16>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [13].
