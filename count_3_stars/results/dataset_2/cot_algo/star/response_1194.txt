Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 3) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 14) 

Response:
Given the described graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 14}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {7, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 3: {9, 10, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 7, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 13}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 5, 11, 13}
- Node 11: {3, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {8, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 6, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 5, 12, 13}

Now, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {10, 13, 14} <3, (10, 13, 14)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 5, 6} <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 7, 14} <5, (0, 7, 14)>
  
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
