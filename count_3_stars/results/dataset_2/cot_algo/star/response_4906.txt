Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 3) (15, 11) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 3) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 12) (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 29) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (7, 5) (7, 16) (7, 1) (21, 25) (21, 17) (21, 4) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 12) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 19) (6, 9) (4, 21) (8, 2) (8, 12) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 20) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 13) (19, 23) (19, 26) (19, 24) (26, 22) (26, 19) (11, 15) (11, 28) (11, 18) (28, 15) (28, 11) (28, 0) (28, 25) (17, 21) (17, 20) (17, 16) (20, 2) (20, 17) (20, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 24) (18, 11) (18, 10) (0, 28) (0, 24) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 29) (12, 3) (12, 22) (12, 8) (12, 20) (12, 29) (24, 19) (24, 1) (24, 0) (24, 10) (29, 5) (29, 16) (29, 12) (10, 18) (10, 24) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 10) (25, 21) (25, 22) (25, 28) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {24, 28}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 9, 24}
- Node 2: {8, 14, 20}
- Node 3: {12, 15, 27}
- Node 4: {21}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 9, 29}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 16}
- Node 8: {2, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {13, 18, 24}
- Node 11: {15, 18, 28}
- Node 12: {3, 8, 20, 22, 29}
- Node 13: {9, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 9, 13}
- Node 15: {3, 11, 27}
- Node 16: {7, 17, 29}
- Node 17: {16, 20, 21}
- Node 18: {10, 11}
- Node 19: {23, 24, 26}
- Node 20: {2, 12, 17}
- Node 21: {4, 17, 25}
- Node 22: {12, 19, 23, 25, 26}
- Node 23: {19, 22}
- Node 24: {0, 1, 10, 19}
- Node 25: {21, 22, 28}
- Node 26: {19, 22}
- Node 27: {3, 15}
- Node 28: {11, 25}
- Node 29: {5, 12, 16}

Based on the neighbor sets, the nodes that can form 3-stars are: {1, 9, 12, 24, 28}

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [5]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 5, 7>
<9, 5, 29>
<12, 3, 15>
<24, 0, 1>
<28, 11, 25>
