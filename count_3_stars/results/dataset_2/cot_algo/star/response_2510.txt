Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 12) (16, 13) (5, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 19) (6, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 16) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 17) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 8) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 15) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 1) (15, 14) (15, 4) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 13) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 4) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 18) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 13) (4, 15) (4, 19) (13, 16) (13, 6) (13, 18) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: 9, 7, 14, 17
2: 7, 12, 8, 19
3: 9, 0, 13
4: 15, 19
5: 10
6: 13
7: 2, 12, 1
8: 11, 0, 2
9: 1, 3, 19
10: 5, 0, 18
11: 8, 18, 17
12: 16, 7, 2, 17
13: 16, 6, 18, 3
14: 18, 1, 15
15: 14, 4
16: 12, 13
17: 12, 11, 1
18: 11, 14, 19, 10, 13
19: 9, 2, 18, 4

Now, let's identify nodes with at least 3 neighbors and count the 3-stars:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 9, 7, 14>
<2, 7, 12, 17>
<7, 12, 2, 17>
<8, 11, 18, 14>
<12, 16, 13, 3>
<12, 17, 1, 14>
<13, 16, 6, 18>
<18, 11, 14, 19>
<18, 14, 15, 4>
<19, 2, 18, 4>
