Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6
- Node 5: 1, 6, 7
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7

Next, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: has 3 neighbors
- Node 1: has 4 neighbors
- Node 3: has 5 neighbors
- Node 6: has 5 neighbors
- Node 7: has 5 neighbors
- Node 9: has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
From the nodes above with 3 or more neighbors, we can form 3-stars with each of them. For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star formed.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is:
1 + 4C3 + 5C3 + 5C3 + 5C3 = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 35

Therefore, the final answer is [35], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <7,(2, 5, 8)>, <9,(0, 1, 2)>.
