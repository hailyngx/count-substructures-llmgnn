Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 19) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 9) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 13) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 17) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 6) (4, 12) (1, 16) (1, 2) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 2) (17, 9) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 2) (3, 19) (3, 18) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 17) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 17) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 19) (18, 15) (18, 3) (19, 16) (19, 17) (19, 3) (19, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 14, 8}
- Node 1: {16, 2}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 17}
- Node 3: {19, 18}
- Node 4: {12}
- Node 5: {11, 8, 17}
- Node 6: {15, 17, 2}
- Node 7: {11, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 9, 5}
- Node 9: {12, 8, 15, 17}
- Node 10: {15}
- Node 11: {16, 7, 0, 13, 5}
- Node 12: {7, 4, 9}
- Node 13: {11, 7, 14, 19}
- Node 14: {0, 13}
- Node 15: {9, 10, 18, 6}
- Node 16: {11, 1, 19}
- Node 17: {6, 9, 19, 5, 2}
- Node 18: {15, 3}
- Node 19: {16, 17, 3, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 17, and 19 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 36 unique 3-stars, so the final answer is [36]. The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 17>
<6, 15, 17>
<7, 11, 13>
<9, 17, 19>
<11, 16, 19>
<8, 9, 5>
<11, 13, 7>
<19, 17, 3>
<11, 7, 0>
