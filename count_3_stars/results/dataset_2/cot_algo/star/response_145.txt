Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star formations:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 68, which we write as [68].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, 
<5, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<6, (0, 5, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, 
<8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>
