Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 19) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 15) (1, 4) (1, 18) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 18) (18, 1) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 18) (15, 17) (15, 0) (8, 14) (8, 17) (19, 14) (19, 3) (19, 18) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (7, 5) (7, 16) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 10) (2, 9) (2, 11) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 12) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node: 

Node 0: {9, 12, 15}
Node 1: {4, 18}
Node 2: {9, 11}
Node 3: {4, 16, 19}
Node 4: {1, 3, 9, 18}
Node 5: {7, 13, 17}
Node 6: {10, 11, 12}
Node 7: {5, 16}
Node 8: {14, 17}
Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 13}
Node 10: {6, 12, 16}
Node 11: {2, 6}
Node 12: {0, 6, 10}
Node 13: {5, 9, 18}
Node 14: {8, 17, 19}
Node 15: {0, 17}
Node 16: {3, 7, 10, 18}
Node 17: {5, 8, 14, 15}
Node 18: {1, 4, 13, 16, 19}
Node 19: {3, 14, 18}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes forming a 3-star: 4, 9, 13, 18

Calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

\( \text{Number of 3-stars} = \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 19 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (1, 3, 18)>, 
<9, (0, 2, 13)>, 
<13, (5, 9, 18)>, 
<18, (1, 4, 13, 16)>.
