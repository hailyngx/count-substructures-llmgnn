Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 2) (9, 28) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 11) (26, 4) (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 25) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 5) (27, 8) (22, 7) (22, 12) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 7) (20, 0) (20, 6) (25, 15) (25, 29) (25, 2) (8, 27) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 29) (8, 12) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 18) (1, 26) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 13) (17, 10) (17, 21) (17, 7) (21, 17) (21, 19) (28, 9) (4, 26) (4, 27) (4, 18) (4, 29) (18, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 16) (5, 27) (5, 13) (13, 10) (13, 5) (3, 10) (11, 26) (11, 2) (11, 29) (16, 18) (6, 20) (6, 14) (24, 0) (24, 7) (24, 12) (19, 21) (19, 18) (2, 9) (2, 25) (2, 11) (2, 12) (12, 22) (12, 8) (12, 24) (12, 2) (14, 23) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 6) (29, 25) (29, 8) (29, 4) (29, 11) (7, 22) (7, 23) (7, 17) (7, 24) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {15, 20, 24, 18}
- Node 1: {26, 14, 10}
- Node 2: {9, 25, 11, 12}
- Node 3: {10}
- Node 4: {26, 27, 18, 29}
- Node 5: {27, 13}
- Node 6: {20, 14}
- Node 7: {22, 23, 17, 24}
- Node 8: {27, 23, 14, 29, 12}
- Node 9: {26, 2, 28}
- Node 10: {1, 17, 3, 13}
- Node 11: {26, 2, 29}
- Node 12: {22, 8, 24, 2}
- Node 13: {10, 5}
- Node 14: {23, 8, 1, 6}
- Node 15: {27, 0, 25}
- Node 16: {18}
- Node 17: {10, 21, 7}
- Node 18: {0, 4, 19, 16}
- Node 19: {21, 18}
- Node 20: {0, 6}
- Node 21: {17, 19}
- Node 22: {7, 12}
- Node 23: {8, 14, 7}
- Node 24: {0, 7, 12}
- Node 25: {15, 29, 2}
- Node 26: {9, 1, 11, 4}
- Node 27: {15, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 28: {9}
- Node 29: {25, 8, 4, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <8, (27, 5, 29)>
- <27, (15, 4, 8)>
- <4, (26, 18, 29)>
- <12, (22, 8, 24)>
- <10, (1, 17, 13)>
- <25, (15, 2, 29)>
