Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 13) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 1) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 7) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 3: {4, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 6, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {12}
- Node 10: {1, 5, 7, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 11: {2, 10, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 10, 12, 3, 7}
- Node 14: {3, 5, 6, 11}

Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 12 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 12, 8)>
<4, (2, 12, 13)>
<4, (2, 12, 1)>
<4, (3, 4, 12)>
<5, (0, 6, 10)>
<5, (1, 6, 10)>
<5, (6, 10, 14)>
<5, (5, 6, 10)>
<6, (0, 5, 14)>
<6, (1, 5, 14)>
<6, (5, 10, 14)>
<6, (5, 6, 14)>
<1, (0, 1, 8)>
<1, (0, 1, 7)>
<1, (1, 7, 13)>
<1, (1, 10, 13)>
