Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 3) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 12) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1) 

Response:
The nodes and edges in the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 13), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 14), 
(9, 10), (6, 9), (6, 2), (6, 12), (6, 4), 
(4, 6), (4, 7), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 11), 
(7, 2), (7, 13), (10, 9), (10, 11), (10, 8), 
(11, 7), (11, 10), (11, 3), (11, 8), (11, 12), 
(0, 14), (0, 12), (0, 1), (0, 13), (14, 9), 
(14, 0), (14, 2), (14, 13), (2, 6), (2, 7), 
(2, 14), (2, 8), (2, 1), (2, 13), (8, 10), 
(8, 11), (8, 2), (8, 3), (3, 7), (3, 11), 
(3, 8), (3, 13), (13, 5), (13, 7), (13, 0), 
(13, 14), (13, 2), (13, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), 
(1, 12), (12, 6), (12, 11), (12, 0), (12, 1)

Let's now find the 3-stars in this graph. 

The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
Node 0: {14, 1, 13, 12}
Node 1: {0, 2, 12}
Node 2: {6, 7, 14, 8, 1, 13}
Node 3: {7, 11, 8, 13}
Node 4: {6, 7}
Node 5: {9, 13}
Node 6: {9, 2, 12, 4}
Node 7: {4, 3, 11, 2, 13}
Node 8: {10, 11, 2, 3}
Node 9: {5, 13, 6, 10, 14}
Node 10: {9, 11, 8}
Node 11: {7, 3, 8, 10, 12}
Node 12: {6, 11, 0, 1}
Node 13: {5, 7, 0, 14, 2, 3}
Node 14: {9, 0, 2, 13}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 does not form any 3-stars.
Node 1 does not form any 3-stars.
Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 does not form any 3-stars.
Node 5 does not form any 3-stars.
Node 6 does not form any 3-stars.
Node 7 forms 2 3-stars.
Node 8 does not form any 3-stars.
Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
Node 10 does not form any 3-stars.
Node 11 does not form any 3-stars.
Node 12 does not form any 3-stars.
Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
Node 14 forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<2, 6, 14>, <3, 7, 13>, <7, 11, 13>, <7, 13, 2>, <9, 13, 14>
