Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 20) (26, 6) (1, 14) (21, 4) (21, 2) (21, 29) (6, 9) (6, 26) (6, 24) (6, 3) (6, 4) (0, 27) (0, 18) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 18) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 5) (2, 21) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 17) (18, 0) (18, 27) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 8) (17, 2) (17, 23) (4, 21) (4, 6) (4, 16) (7, 3) (7, 28) (7, 23) (7, 14) (15, 13) (13, 15) (13, 12) (13, 29) (23, 26) (23, 11) (23, 17) (23, 7) (5, 26) (5, 11) (5, 20) (12, 2) (12, 13) (8, 18) (8, 20) (28, 7) (28, 14) (28, 24) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 22) (22, 19) (22, 24) (3, 6) (3, 7) (24, 9) (24, 6) (24, 28) (24, 22) (16, 18) (16, 4) (25, 9) (25, 10) (29, 21) (29, 27) (29, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 28) (20, 26) (20, 5) (20, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 27, 18, 19
Node 1: 14
Node 2: 21, 18, 12, 17
Node 3: 6, 7
Node 4: 21, 6, 16
Node 5: 26, 11, 20
Node 6: 9, 26, 24, 3, 4
Node 7: 3, 28, 23, 14
Node 8: 18, 20
Node 9: 26, 6, 25, 24
Node 10: 11, 19, 25
Node 11: 10, 23, 5
Node 12: 2, 13
Node 13: 15, 12, 29
Node 14: 1, 7, 28
Node 15: 13
Node 16: 18, 4
Node 17: 2, 23
Node 18: 0, 27, 2, 16, 8
Node 19: 0, 10, 22
Node 20: 26, 5, 8
Node 21: 4, 2, 29
Node 22: 19, 24
Node 23: 26, 11, 17, 7
Node 24: 9, 6, 28, 22
Node 25: 9, 10
Node 26: 9, 5, 20
Node 27: 0, 29, 18
Node 28: 7, 14, 24
Node 29: 21, 27, 13

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 18, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

Node 18 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 = 20

Therefore, the final answer is [20]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<18, (0, 27, 2)>
<18, (0, 27, 16)>
<18, (0, 2, 16)>
<18, (0, 2, 8)>
<18, (27, 2, 16)>
<18, (27, 2, 8)>
<18, (2, 16, 8)>
<18, (27, 16, 8)>
<18, (2, 16, 8)>
<6, (9, 26, 24)>
