Next, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors, as these are potential centers of 3-stars:

- Node 3: Neighbors 10, 17, 25, 29 (needs further evaluation)
- Node 8: Neighbors 1, 11, 21, 23 (potential 3-star center)
- Node 10: Neighbors 1, 3, 9, 15, 26 (potential 3-star center)
- Node 11: Neighbors 1, 2, 8, 14 (potential 3-star center)
- Node 12: Neighbors 4, 5, 25 (potential 3-star center)
- Node 13: Neighbors 16, 19, 22 (potential 3-star center)
- Node 15: Neighbors 2, 10, 19 (potential 3-star center)
- Node 18: Neighbors 25, 27, 28 (potential 3-star center)
- Node 19: Neighbors 13, 15, 22, 27 (potential 3-star center)
- Node 22: Neighbors 13, 19, 21, 27 (potential 3-star center)
- Node 25: Neighbors 3, 9, 12, 18, 29 (needs further evaluation)
- Node 27: Neighbors 18, 19, 22, 27 (potential 3-star center)
- Node 28: Neighbors 5, 18, 29 (needs further evaluation)

Now, we calculate the total number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 3: 0
- Node 8: 1 (with neighbors 1, 11, 23)
- Node 10: 1 (with neighbors 1, 15, 26)
- Node 11: 1 (with neighbors 1, 14, 8)
- Node 12: 1 (with neighbors 4, 5, 25)
- Node 13: 1 (with neighbors 16, 19, 22)
- Node 15: 1 (with neighbors 2, 10, 19)
- Node 18: 1 (with neighbors 25, 27, 28)
- Node 19: 1 (with neighbors 13, 15, 22)
- Node 22: 1 (with neighbors 13, 19, 27)
- Node 25: 0
- Node 27: 1 (with neighbors 18, 19, 22)
- Node 28: 0

Adding these up gives a total of [8] 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 8, 11, 23>
- <1, 10, 15, 26>
- <4, 5, 12>
- <13, 16, 19, 22>
- <2, 10, 15, 19>
- <25, 18, 27>
- <18, 19, 22, 27>
- <13, 19, 22, 27>
