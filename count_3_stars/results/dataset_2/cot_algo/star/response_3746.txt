Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 6) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 2) (8, 19) (3, 11) (3, 0) (15, 10) (15, 14) (13, 17) (13, 14) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 19) (17, 5) (19, 18) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 14) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (12, 10) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 1) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 9) (4, 1) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 18) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 13) (14, 19) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (5, 16) (5, 17) (5, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 10}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 9}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {6, 8}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {0, 11}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {1, 9, 10, 19}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {1, 16, 17}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {2, 18}
8. Node 8: Neighbors {2, 11, 16, 19}
9. Node 9: Neighbors {1, 4}
10. Node 10: Neighbors {0, 4, 12, 15}
11. Node 11: Neighbors {3, 8, 16, 17, 18}
12. Node 12: Neighbors {10}
13. Node 13: Neighbors {14, 17}
14. Node 14: Neighbors {13, 15, 18, 19}
15. Node 15: Neighbors {10, 14}
16. Node 16: Neighbors {5, 8, 11}
17. Node 17: Neighbors {5, 13, 19}
18. Node 18: Neighbors {6, 14, 19}
19. Node 19: Neighbors {4, 8, 14, 17, 18}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with more than 3 neighbors:

- Node 1: 1 3-star (1 combination)
- Node 4: 1 3-star (1 combination)
- Node 8: 1 3-star (1 combination)
- Node 10: 1 3-star (1 combination)
- Node 14: 3 3-stars (3 combinations)
- Node 19: 5 3-stars (5 combinations)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, 0, 4>
<4, 1, 9>
<8, 2, 6>
<10, 0, 12>
<14, 13, 17>
<19, 14, 18>
<19, 14, 8>
<19, 14, 18>
<19, 14, 13>
<19, 8, 2>
<19, 8, 16>
<19, 8, 11>
