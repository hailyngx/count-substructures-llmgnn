Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 24) (15, 16) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 21) (9, 7) (9, 23) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 29) (14, 25) (21, 9) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 11) (28, 4) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 13) (11, 20) (26, 18) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 17) (1, 15) (1, 25) (18, 26) (18, 12) (18, 8) (2, 14) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 10) (22, 2) (24, 15) (23, 9) (23, 26) (23, 20) (10, 2) (10, 27) (10, 29) (17, 26) (17, 25) (17, 12) (25, 14) (25, 1) (25, 17) (25, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (13, 11) (13, 20) (13, 19) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (8, 5) (27, 10) (27, 19) (29, 14) (29, 26) (29, 10) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 27) (20, 11) (20, 23) (20, 13) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 17) (12, 5) (4, 0) (4, 28) (4, 25) (4, 5) (16, 15) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1. Node 0: {14, 11, 4, 12}
2. Node 1: {15, 25}
3. Node 2: {14, 22, 19, 10}
4. Node 3: {15, 7}
5. Node 4: {0, 28, 25, 5}
6. Node 5: {8, 12, 4}
7. Node 6: {9, 11, 8}
8. Node 7: {3, 9}
9. Node 8: {6, 18, 5}
10. Node 9: {6, 21, 7, 23}
11. Node 10: {2, 27, 29}
12. Node 11: {6, 0, 28, 13, 20}
13. Node 12: {0, 18, 17, 5}
14. Node 13: {11, 20, 19}
15. Node 14: {0, 2, 29, 25}
16. Node 15: {3, 1, 24, 16}
17. Node 16: {15}
18. Node 17: {26, 25, 12}
19. Node 18: {26, 12, 8}
20. Node 19: {2, 13, 27}
21. Node 20: {11, 23, 13}
22. Node 21: {9, 28}
23. Node 22: {2}
24. Node 23: {9, 26, 20}
25. Node 25: {1, 14, 17, 4}
26. Node 26: {18, 23, 29, 17}
27. Node 27: {10, 19}
28. Node 28: {21, 11, 4}
29. Node 29: {14, 26, 10}

Now, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

2. Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
9. Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with leaves (6, 18, 5)
10. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with leaves (6, 21, 7), (6, 21, 23), (6, 9, 7), (7, 9, 23)
13. Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with leaves (0, 18, 17), (0, 18, 5), (0, 12, 17), (18, 12, 5)
14. Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with leaves (11, 20, 13)
16. Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with leaves (3, 1, 24), (3, 1, 16), (1, 24, 16), (15, 24, 16)
17. Node 16: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
19. Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with leaves (26, 23, 17)
20. Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with leaves (26, 25, 12)
21. Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with leaves (2, 13, 27)
22. Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with leaves (11, 23, 20)
23. Node 21: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
24. Node 22: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
25. Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with leaves (9, 26, 20)
26. Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with leaves (15, 1, 16)
27. Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with leaves (14, 2, 29), (14, 25, 4), (2, 29, 10), (29, 26, 10)
28. Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with leaves (18, 23, 17), (1, 25, 17), (17, 12, 5), (25, 4, 5)
29. Node 27: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
30. Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with leaves (4, 11, 28)
31. Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with leaves (14, 26, 29)

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 23 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (9, 18, 5)>, <9, (6, 21, 7)>, <9, (6, 21, 23)>, <9, (6, 9, 7)>, <9, (7, 9, 23)>, <12, (0, 18, 17)>, <12, (0, 18, 5)>, <12, (0, 12, 17)>, <12, (18, 12, 5)>, <13, (11, 20, 13)>, <15, (3, 1, 24)>, <15, (3, 1, 16)>, <15, (1, 24, 16)>, <15, (15, 24, 16)>, <18, (26, 23, 17)>, <17, (26, 25, 12)>, <19, (2, 13, 27)>, <20, (11, 23, 20)>, <23, (9, 26, 20)>, <24, (15, 1, 16)>, <25, (14, 2, 29)>, <25, (14, 25, 4)>, <25, (2, 29, 10)>, <25, (29, 26, 10)>, <26, (18, 23, 17)>, <26, (1, 25, 17)>, <26, (17, 12, 5)>, <26, (25, 4, 5)>, <28, (4, 11, 28)>, <29, (14, 26, 29)>.
