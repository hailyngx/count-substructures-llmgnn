Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 3) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 0) (8, 7) (8, 2) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 1) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 12) 

Response:
For this graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 13}
Node 1: {0, 5, 13, 14}
Node 2: {0, 5, 8, 12}
Node 3: {0, 5, 10}
Node 4: {0, 6, 7, 11}
Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 9, 10}
Node 6: {4, 9, 13, 14}
Node 7: {4, 8, 10, 11}
Node 8: {2, 7}
Node 9: {5, 6, 10, 14}
Node 10: {3, 5, 7, 9, 11}
Node 11: {4, 7, 10, 12}
Node 12: {0, 2, 11, 13}
Node 13: {0, 1, 6, 12}
Node 14: {1, 6, 9}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 13, 14)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 5, 10)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (9, 10, 14)>
- Node 6: <6, (4, 9, 13)>, <6, (9, 13, 14)>
- Node 7: <7, (4, 8, 10)>, <7, (10, 11, 12)>
- Node 9: <9, (5, 6, 10)>, <9, (6, 14, 1)>
- Node 10: <10, (3, 5, 7)>, <10, (4, 7, 11)>
- Node 12: <12, (0, 2, 11)>, <12, (11, 13, 2)>
- Node 13: <13, (0, 1, 6)>, <13, (6, 12, 14)>
- Node 14: <14, (1, 6, 9)>, <14, (6, 9, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [14].
