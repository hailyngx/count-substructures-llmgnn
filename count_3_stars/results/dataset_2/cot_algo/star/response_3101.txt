Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 15) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 13) (17, 3) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 4) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 10) (18, 5) (18, 15) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 19) (19, 14) (19, 8) (19, 3) (19, 10) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 0) (5, 18) (5, 2) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 18) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 2) (0, 4) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: 8
2: 6, 9, 5, 10
3: 9, 17, 7, 19
4: 16, 13, 0
5: 18, 2
6: 2, 13
7: 3, 15, 10
8: 11, 13, 19, 15, 1
9: 2, 3, 12
10: 7, 19, 2
11: 16, 8
12: 9, 14, 0, 2
13: 6, 17, 8, 4
14: 12, 19
15: 16, 8, 7, 18
16: 4, 11, 15
17: 3, 13
18: 5, 15
19: 14, 8, 3, 10

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:

1: 
2: 
3: [<3, 17, 7>, <3, 9, 19>]
4: [<4, 16, 13>]
8: [<8, 19, 15>, <8, 13, 1>]
9: [<9, 3, 12>, <9, 2, 10>]
10: 
12: [<12, 9, 0>, <12, 2, 14>]
13: [<13, 8, 4>]
15: [<15, 16, 8>]
16: 
17: 
18: 
19: [<19, 14, 3>]

Counting the total number of 3-stars:
6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
