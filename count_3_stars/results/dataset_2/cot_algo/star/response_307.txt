Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 14) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 2) (9, 2) (9, 14) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 11, 13
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 2
Node 2 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 10
Node 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 11, 12
Node 4 neighbors: 2, 10
Node 5 neighbors: 3, 7, 10, 13
Node 6 neighbors: 0, 12, 13, 14
Node 7 neighbors: 3, 5, 7, 12, 14
Node 8 neighbors: 10, 11, 14
Node 9 neighbors: 2, 14
Node 10 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 8, 11
Node 11 neighbors: 0, 3, 8, 10, 12
Node 12 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 11, 13
Node 13 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 12
Node 14 neighbors: 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 2 forms a 3-star with (0, 3, 10) <2, (0, 3, 10)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with (5, 12, 14) <7, (5, 12, 14)>

The total number of 3-stars is [2].
