Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 3) (16, 9) (10, 18) (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 7) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (19, 5) (19, 7) (15, 8) (15, 0) (15, 4) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (18, 10) (18, 1) (3, 16) (3, 6) (7, 13) (7, 19) (7, 17) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 9) (2, 7) (14, 5) (14, 9) (4, 6) (4, 15) (4, 9) (4, 1) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 12) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) (1, 18) (1, 4) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, we can create the following 3-star graphs:

- Node 16 has neighbors {11, 13, 3, 9}. Since it has 4 neighbors, it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars:
    - <16, (11, 13, 3)>
    - <16, (11, 13, 9)>
    - <16, (11, 3, 9)>
    - <16, (13, 3, 9)>

- Node 13 has neighbors {16, 8, 17, 7}. Since it has 4 neighbors, it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars:
    - <13, (16, 8, 17)>
    - <13, (16, 8, 7)>
    - <13, (16, 17, 7)>
    - <13, (8, 17, 7)>

- Node 5 has neighbors {6, 19, 2, 12, 14}. Since it has 5 neighbors, it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars:
    - <5, (6, 19, 2)>
    - <5, (6, 19, 12)>
    - <5, (6, 19, 14)>
    - <5, (6, 2, 12)>
    - <5, (6, 2, 14)>
    - <5, (6, 12, 14)>
    - <5, (19, 2, 12)>
    - <5, (19, 2, 14)>
    - <5, (19, 12, 14)>
    - <5, (2, 12, 14)>

- Node 6 has neighbors {5, 3, 4}. Since it has 3 neighbors, it can form 1 3-star:
    - <6, (5, 3, 4)>

We found a total of 15 unique 3-stars, so the final count is [15].
