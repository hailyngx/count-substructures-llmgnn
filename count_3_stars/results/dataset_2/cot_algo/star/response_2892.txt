Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {5, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 6}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 1, 6, 4, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 1, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 1, 4, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 3, 7, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {8, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 3, 0}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 does not have 3 or more neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 2 does not have 3 or more neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 6 does not have 3 or more neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 does not have 3 or more neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8 does not have 3 or more neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 unique 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us a final count of [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (5, 3, 4)>
- <3, (5, 9, 1)>
- <4, (5, 9, 1)>
- <5, (9, 6, 1)>
- <9, (5, 4, 3)>
