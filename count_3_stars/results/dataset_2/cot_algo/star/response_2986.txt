Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's denote the nodes as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 4, 6, 3}
- Node 2: {7, 8, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 4, 6, 1, 0}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 1, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {9, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {6, 2}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 7, 0}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 39, so the final answer is [39].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>,
<1, (5, 4, 6)>,
<3, (5, 4, 6)>,
<3, (5, 1, 0)>,

<3, (5, 0, 7)>,

<3, (4, 6, 8)>,
<5, (9, 6, 1)>,

<9, (5, 3, 0)>,
<9, (6, 1, 3)>
