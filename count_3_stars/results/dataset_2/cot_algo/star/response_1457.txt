Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 1) (9, 0) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 22) (15, 4) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 22) (22, 15) (22, 18) (22, 17) (22, 7) (22, 25) (8, 13) (8, 1) (8, 27) (13, 3) (13, 8) (20, 25) (20, 23) (20, 10) (25, 22) (25, 20) (25, 21) (2, 5) (2, 23) (2, 28) (2, 11) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 8) (1, 26) (1, 7) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 14) (26, 4) (19, 26) (19, 21) (19, 28) (19, 12) (11, 2) (28, 2) (28, 19) (28, 10) (24, 6) (24, 14) (4, 15) (4, 26) (27, 8) (27, 14) (27, 16) (7, 22) (7, 1) (7, 16) (14, 26) (14, 24) (14, 27) (16, 27) (16, 7) (16, 17) (6, 24) (17, 22) (17, 16) (17, 0) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 21) (21, 25) (21, 19) (21, 0) (21, 12) (10, 3) (10, 20) (10, 28) (10, 29) (12, 19) (12, 21) (12, 29) (23, 20) (23, 2) (29, 10) (29, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 17, 21}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 8, 15, 26, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 23, 28, 11}
- Node 3: Neighbors {15, 10, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {15, 26}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 18, 1}
- Node 6: Neighbors {24}
- Node 7: Neighbors {22, 1, 16}
- Node 8: Neighbors {13, 1, 27}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0}
- Node 10: Neighbors {3, 20, 28, 29}
- Node 11: Neighbors {2}
- Node 12: Neighbors {19, 21, 29}
- Node 13: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 14: Neighbors {26, 24, 27}
- Node 15: Neighbors {3, 1, 18, 22, 4}
- Node 16: Neighbors {27, 7, 17}
- Node 17: Neighbors {22, 16, 0}
- Node 18: Neighbors {5, 15, 22}
- Node 19: Neighbors {26, 21, 28, 12}
- Node 20: Neighbors {25, 23, 10}
- Node 21: Neighbors {25, 19, 0, 12}
- Node 22: Neighbors {15, 18, 17, 7, 25}
- Node 23: Neighbors {5, 2, 20}
- Node 24: Neighbors {6, 14}
- Node 25: Neighbors {22, 20, 21}
- Node 26: Neighbors {1, 19, 14, 4}
- Node 27: Neighbors {8, 14, 16}
- Node 28: Neighbors {2, 19, 10}
- Node 29: Neighbors {10, 12}

Next, we will find the number of 3-stars formed by each node and calculate the total:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 67\)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [67].
