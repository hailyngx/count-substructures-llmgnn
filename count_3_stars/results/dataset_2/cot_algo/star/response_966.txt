Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: neighbors {3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 3, 5}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 5, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 6, 7, 8}

Now, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 2: 4 neighbors (1, 6, 8, 9) => 1 unique 3-star
- Node 3: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 6, 7, 8) => 1 unique 3-star
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 7, 8) => 1 unique 3-star
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 6, 9) => 1 unique 3-star
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (2, 3, 5, 9) => 1 unique 3-star
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (2, 6, 7, 8) => 1 unique 3-star

Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars:
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
