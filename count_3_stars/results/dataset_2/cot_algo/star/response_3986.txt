Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 17) (5, 15) (6, 2) (6, 19) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 8) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 3) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 18) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 11) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 17) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 15) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 12) (14, 18) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (2, 6) (15, 7) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 9) (9, 15) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 14) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, we can deduce the neighbor set for each node:

1. Node 1: {8, 10, 13, 17}
2. Node 2: {6}
3. Node 3: {12, 13, 14}
4. Node 4: {10, 11, 16}
5. Node 5: {7, 15, 17}
6. Node 6: {2, 19}
7. Node 7: {5, 15, 16}
8. Node 8: {1, 15, 18, 19}
9. Node 9: {15}
10. Node 10: {1, 4, 14}
11. Node 11: {4, 12, 19}
12. Node 12: {3, 11, 14}
13. Node 13: {1, 3, 17}
14. Node 14: {10, 12, 18, 3}
15. Node 15: {5, 7, 8, 9, 18}
16. Node 16: {4, 7, 17}
17. Node 17: {5, 13, 16, 1}
18. Node 18: {8, 14, 15, 19}
19. Node 19: {6, 8, 11, 18}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, forming [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 4] = [14].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<15, (5, 8, 18)>
<18, (8, 14, 15)>
