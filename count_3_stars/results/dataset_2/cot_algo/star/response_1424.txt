Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (12, 5) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {5, 3, 8, 6, 9}
Node 1: Neighbors {9, 3, 10, 14, 8}
Node 2: Neighbors {4, 7, 10, 8}
Node 3: Neighbors {1, 0, 11, 13}
Node 4: Neighbors {7, 14, 6, 2}
Node 5: Neighbors {9, 12, 0, 10, 14}
Node 6: Neighbors {4, 0, 13}
Node 7: Neighbors {4, 14, 2, 8}
Node 8: Neighbors {7, 1, 2, 0}
Node 9: Neighbors {5, 1, 13, 0}
Node 10: Neighbors {5, 1, 2}
Node 11: Neighbors {3, 14, 13}
Node 12: Neighbors {5}
Node 13: Neighbors {9, 3, 11, 6, 14}
Node 14: Neighbors {5, 4, 7, 1, 11, 13}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star
Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star
Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star
Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 14 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 12>
<0, 5, 14>
<0, 9, 13>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 10>
<1, 5, 14>
<1, 9, 13>
<5, 9, 12>
<5, 9, 14>
<5, 10, 14>
<9, 13, 14>
