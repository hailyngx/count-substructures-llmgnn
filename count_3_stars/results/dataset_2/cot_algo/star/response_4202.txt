Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 4) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 5) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 7) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 10) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's analyze the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 8, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {2, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 7: {9, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 9: {2, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 11: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 12: {4, 9}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0, Node 8, and Node 13 each have 4 neighbors, so they can each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) different 3-stars.
- Node 1, Node 3, and Node 14 each have 4 neighbors, so they can each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) different 3-stars.
- Node 2, Node 5, and Node 6 each have 5 neighbors, so they can each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) different 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 3 \times 4 + 3 \times 4 + 3 \times 10 = 72 \). 

Thus, the final answer to the problem is [72], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, 2, 8, 10>
- <0, 2, 8, 13>
- <0, 2, 10, 13>
- <1, 3, 5, 14>
- <1, 3, 8, 14>
- <1, 5, 6, 14>
- <2, 4, 6, 9>
- <2, 4, 8, 9>
- <2, 4, 9, 12>
- <2, 6, 8, 13>
- <3, 7, 11, 14>
- <4, 12, 13, 14>
