Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {9, 10, 14, 3, 13}
Node 1: {5, 9, 12}
Node 2: {5, 6, 8}
Node 3: {5, 6, 0, 8}
Node 4: {10, 6}
Node 5: {9, 2, 1, 3}
Node 6: {9, 4, 10, 3, 2, 8}
Node 7: {12, 13}
Node 8: {6, 11, 2, 3}
Node 9: {5, 6, 14, 1, 0}
Node 10: {4, 6, 11, 0, 12, 13}
Node 11: {10, 14, 8, 12}
Node 12: {7, 10, 11, 13, 1}
Node 13: {7, 10, 12, 0}
Node 14: {9, 11, 0}

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 13 (each contributing 1 3-star)
Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 14

For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
\[ \binom{5}{3} \] for Node 0 = 10 3-stars
\[ \binom{5}{3} \] for Node 5 = 10 3-stars
\[ \binom{6}{3} \] for Node 6 = 20 3-stars
\[ \binom{5}{3} \] for Node 9 = 10 3-stars
\[ \binom{6}{3} \] for Node 10 = 20 3-stars
\[ \binom{5}{3} \] for Node 11 = 10 3-stars
\[ \binom{3}{3} \] for Node 14 = 1 3-star

Total 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 76

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [76].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 1, 3)>, <6, (9, 4, 10)>, <6, (9, 10, 0)>, <6, (4, 10, 0)>, <6, (4, 10, 13)>, <6, (10, 0, 13)>, <9, (5, 1, 0)>, <10, (6, 4, 13)>
