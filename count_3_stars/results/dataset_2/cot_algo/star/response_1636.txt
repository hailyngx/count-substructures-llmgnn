Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars from nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
- Node 1: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star
- Node 2: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star
- Node 4: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the final answer is [54], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
