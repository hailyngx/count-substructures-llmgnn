Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 12) (21, 18) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 7) (22, 16) (22, 15) (22, 7) (23, 11) (23, 20) (23, 27) (5, 6) (5, 28) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 20) (26, 7) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 12) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 25) (4, 2) (18, 21) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 11) (13, 19) (13, 2) (13, 11) (27, 23) (7, 9) (7, 22) (7, 26) (7, 25) (7, 16) (25, 4) (25, 7) (25, 17) (25, 28) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 13) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 8) (16, 22) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 17) (17, 25) (17, 16) (17, 24) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (28, 5) (28, 25) (28, 15) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 24) (10, 29) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 10) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 20) (20, 23) (20, 26) (20, 2) (15, 22) (15, 28) (24, 17) (24, 10) (24, 29) (14, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (29, 10) (29, 24) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: neighbors {16, 3, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {26, 12}
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 13, 20}
- Node 3: neighbors {6, 0, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {18, 14, 25, 2}
- Node 5: neighbors {6, 28}
- Node 6: neighbors {9, 5, 10, 3}
- Node 7: neighbors {9, 22, 26, 25, 16}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 9: neighbors {6, 18, 7}
- Node 10: neighbors {6, 12, 24, 29}
- Node 11: neighbors {23, 19, 18, 13}
- Node 12: neighbors {1, 19, 10}
- Node 13: neighbors {19, 2, 11}
- Node 14: neighbors {4}
- Node 15: neighbors {22, 28}
- Node 16: neighbors {22, 7, 0, 17}
- Node 17: neighbors {25, 16, 24}
- Node 18: neighbors {21, 9, 4, 11}
- Node 19: neighbors {26, 11, 13, 12}
- Node 20: neighbors {23, 26, 2}
- Node 21: neighbors {18}
- Node 22: neighbors {16, 15, 7}
- Node 23: neighbors {11, 20, 27}
- Node 24: neighbors {17, 10, 29}
- Node 25: neighbors {4, 7, 17, 28}
- Node 26: neighbors {1, 19, 20, 7}
- Node 27: neighbors {23}
- Node 28: neighbors {5, 25, 15}
- Node 29: neighbors {10, 24}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 5, 3} (1 3-star)
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 22, 26} (1 3-star)
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors {12, 24, 29} (1 3-star)
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors {22, 17, 0} (1 3-star)
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 17, 28} (1 3-star)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, so the final answer is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
- <6, (9, 5, 3)>
- <7, (9, 22, 26)>
- <10, (12, 24, 29)>
- <16, (22, 17, 0)>
- <25, (7, 17, 28)>
