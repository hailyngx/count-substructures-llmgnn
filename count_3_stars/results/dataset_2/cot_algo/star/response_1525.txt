Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (12, 7) (12, 8) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {4, 5}
- Node 3: {6, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 7, 10}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 5, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 12}
- Node 9: {0, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {4, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 3, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {7, 8}
- Node 13: {3, 6, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 1: Only 4 neighbors, no 3-star formed
- Node 2: Only 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed
- Node 3: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 8: Only 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed
- Node 9: Only 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed
- Node 10: Only 3 neighbors, no 3-star formed
- Node 11: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 12: Only 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed
- Node 13: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 14: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 108

Therefore, the final answer is [108], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 11)>, <0, (1, 9, 11)>, <0, (6, 9, 11)>, <3, (6, 13, 14)>, <3, (6, 11, 13)>, <3, (6, 11, 14)>, <3, (13, 11, 14)>, <4, (0, 7, 10)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 13)>, <6, (0, 3, 13)>, <6, (1, 5, 13)>, <6, (1, 13, 14)>, <6, (3, 11, 13)>, <6, (11, 14, 13)>, <13, (3, 11, 14)>
