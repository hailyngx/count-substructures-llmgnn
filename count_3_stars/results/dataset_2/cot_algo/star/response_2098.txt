Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 3, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: inom(4, 3) = 4 (as it has 4 neighbors)
- Node 1: inom(6, 3) = 20 (as it has 6 neighbors)
- Node 2: inom(4, 3) = 4 (as it has 4 neighbors)
- Node 3: inom(4, 3) = 4 (as it has 4 neighbors)
- Node 4: inom(5, 3) = 10 (as it has 5 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-star can be formed as it has exactly 4 neighbors.
- Node 6: No 3-star can be formed as it has exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: No 3-star can be formed as it has exactly 2 neighbors.
- Node 8: inom(4, 3) = 4 (as it has 4 neighbors)
- Node 9: No 3-star can be formed as it has exactly 4 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 8, 9>
