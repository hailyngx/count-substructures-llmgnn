Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 2) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 19) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 12) (12, 3) (12, 13) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 18) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 18) (17, 11) (17, 2) (19, 15) (19, 9) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 17) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 19) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {14, 18, 1}
Node 1: {0, 14, 2, 18}
Node 2: {16, 7, 14, 1, 17}
Node 3: {9, 5, 12}
Node 4: {7, 9}
Node 5: {3, 7, 8, 6}
Node 6: {10, 14, 5, 18}
Node 7: {4, 2, 5}
Node 8: {13, 5, 18}
Node 9: {3, 4, 19}
Node 10: {11, 6}
Node 11: {16, 10, 18, 17}
Node 12: {3, 13}
Node 13: {8, 12}
Node 14: {0, 1, 6, 2}
Node 15: {19}
Node 16: {11, 2}
Node 17: {11, 2}
Node 18: {11, 8, 0, 6, 1}
Node 19: {15, 9}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 11, and 18 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 38 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (1, 14, 18)>
<1, (0, 14, 2)>
<2, (16, 7, 14)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (10, 14, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 19)>
<11, (16, 10, 18)>
<18, (11, 8, 0)>
