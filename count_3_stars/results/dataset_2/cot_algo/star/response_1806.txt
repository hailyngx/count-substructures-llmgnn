Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (15, 4) (15, 11) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 18) (1, 19) (1, 8) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 7) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 6) (7, 2) (7, 12) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 8) (16, 12) (16, 9) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 19) (19, 1) (19, 8) (0, 11) (0, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 10) (11, 15) (11, 0) (9, 14) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 10) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 4) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 2) (13, 10) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:

First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 11}
- Node 1: {8, 19}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7, 13, 18}
- Node 3: {4, 10}
- Node 4: {5, 10, 14, 15}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 6: {2, 10, 18}
- Node 7: {2, 12}
- Node 8: {1, 12, 17, 19}
- Node 9: {10, 14, 16, 18}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 15}
- Node 12: {7, 8, 14, 16}
- Node 13: {2, 10}
- Node 14: {4, 9, 12, 15, 17}
- Node 15: {4, 11, 14}
- Node 16: {9, 12}
- Node 17: {8, 14, 18}
- Node 18: {2, 6, 9, 17}
- Node 19: {1, 8}

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 4, 10, and 14 have 3 or more neighbors, so we have:
    - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
    - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 10 as the center.
    - \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 14 as the center.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us 4 + 4 + 10 = 18.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, 5, 10>
- <10, 3, 6>
- <10, 4, 13>
- <10, 9, 13>
- <14, 4, 15>
- <14, 9, 17>
- <14, 12, 17>
- <14, 15, 17>
- <7, 2, 12>
- <12, 8, 17>
- <12, 14, 16>
- <12, 16, 9>
- <18, 2, 6>
- <18, 6, 9>
- <18, 9, 17>
- <4, 15, 11>
- <5, 4, 10>
- <10, 6, 2>
- <10, 9, 14>
- <10, 13, 2>
