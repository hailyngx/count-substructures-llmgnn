Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 7) (2, 18) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 1) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 8) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 9) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 4) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 1) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 16) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 16) (17, 13) (17, 16) (4, 1) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 19) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 13) (16, 17) (19, 11) (19, 10) (19, 12) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 7) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 12) (6, 3) 

Response:
The graph has 10 nodes with 3 neighbors, which potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

1. Node 1: Neighbors {5, 18, 14}, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
2. Node 3: Neighbors {5, 11, 6}, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
3. Node 7: Neighbors {9, 18, 0}, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
4. Node 9: Neighbors {5, 16, 7}, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
5. Node 11: Neighbors {3, 19, 8}, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
6. Node 12: Neighbors {4, 14, 19}, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
7. Node 13: Neighbors {10, 17, 16}, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
8. Node 14: Neighbors {18, 1, 12}, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
9. Node 15: Neighbors {2, 0, 1}, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
10. Node 16: Neighbors {9, 10, 17}, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 5, 18, 14>, <3, 5, 11, 6>, <7, 9, 18, 0>, <9, 5, 16, 7>, <11, 3, 19, 8>, <12, 4, 14, 19>, <13, 10, 17, 16>, <14, 18, 1, 12>, <15, 2, 0, 1>, <16, 9, 10, 17>
