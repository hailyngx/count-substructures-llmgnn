Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 48 \). Therefore, the final answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <3, (0, 4, 8)>
- <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (0, 3, 4)>
