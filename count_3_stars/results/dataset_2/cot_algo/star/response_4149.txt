This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 20) (1, 2) (1, 7) (21, 10) (21, 17) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 3) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 28) (27, 20) (4, 27) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 16) (2, 1) (2, 12) (6, 28) (28, 27) (28, 6) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 20) (14, 0) (14, 15) (17, 21) (17, 29) (17, 23) (17, 11) (29, 17) (29, 7) (29, 5) (11, 28) (11, 17) (11, 24) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 26) (16, 8) (16, 28) (16, 13) (16, 26) (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 20) (22, 4) (22, 9) (22, 10) (13, 16) (13, 25) (13, 24) (26, 3) (26, 16) (10, 21) (10, 22) (10, 19) (10, 23) (12, 2) (24, 11) (24, 13) (24, 7) (24, 5) (7, 1) (7, 29) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 5) (15, 4) (15, 14) (15, 9) (15, 19) (19, 10) (19, 15) (25, 13) (20, 1) (20, 27) (20, 28) (20, 9) (20, 23) (5, 8) (5, 29) (5, 24) (5, 7) (23, 17) (23, 10) (23, 20) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {27, 14, 3}
- Node 1: {20, 2, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 12}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 26}
- Node 4: {27, 8, 22, 15}
- Node 5: {8, 29, 24, 7}
- Node 6: {28}
- Node 7: {1, 29, 3, 24, 5}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 16}
- Node 9: {22, 15, 20}
- Node 10: {21, 22, 19, 23}
- Node 11: {28, 17, 24}
- Node 12: {2}
- Node 13: {16, 25, 24}
- Node 14: {0, 15}
- Node 15: {4, 14, 9, 19}
- Node 16: {8, 28, 13, 26}
- Node 17: {21, 29, 23, 11}
- Node 19: {10, 15}
- Node 20: {1, 27, 28, 9, 23}
- Node 21: {10, 17}
- Node 22: {4, 9, 10}
- Node 23: {17, 10, 20}
- Node 24: {11, 13, 7, 5}
- Node 25: {13}
- Node 26: {3, 16}
- Node 27: {0, 4, 28, 20}
- Node 28: {27, 6, 16, 20, 11}
- Node 29: {17, 7, 5}

After calculating, we find that there are 13 unique 3-stars formed in this graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [13]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 3, 27>
- <0, 14, 15>
- <4, 8, 16>
- <4, 15, 9>
- <8, 5, 29>
- <9, 15, 19>
- <10, 19, 15>
- <10, 21, 17>
- <11, 17, 24>
- <16, 26, 3>
- <20, 9, 22>
- <20, 28, 27>
