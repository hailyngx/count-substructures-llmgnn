Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 6, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 3 + 35 + 20 + 1 = 83

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us [83].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<3, (4, 6, 7)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 7)>, 
<6, (3, 4, 9)>, 
<6, (4, 7, 8)>, 
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
