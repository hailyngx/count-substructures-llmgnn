Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has only 1 neighbor.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 58\).

Therefore, the final answer inside brackets is [58].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 6, 1>
- <0, 6, 5>
- <0, 8, 3>
- <0, 8, 5>
- <1, 2, 3>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <7, 5, 8>
