Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 5, 3, 8, 4, 6
Node 1: 9, 7
Node 2: 9, 8, 6, 4
Node 3: 5, 9, 7, 0, 4
Node 4: 9, 3, 2, 0
Node 5: 9, 8, 0, 3
Node 6: 2, 8, 0
Node 7: 1, 3, 8
Node 8: 5, 2, 0, 7, 6
Node 9: 5, 4, 2, 3, 1

Now, we will identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 8, Node 9

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 52 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [52], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 0)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>
