Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 7) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 11) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 7) (2, 6) (2, 10) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
Given the 60 edges provided, we can construct the adjacency list representation of the graph to analyze its structure:

- Node 0: {1, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {6, 10}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 13}
- Node 4: {3, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {1, 9, 13}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 12}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 8: {4, 9, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 8, 11}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 4, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 6, 8, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 8, 10, 12}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph by examining each node and its neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars formed.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors {5, 11, 14}: <1, (5, 11, 14)>
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors {8, 10, 11}: <4, (8, 10, 11)>
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors {10, 12, 14}: <8, (10, 12, 14)>
- Node 11: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors {7, 9, 13}: <11, (7, 9, 13)>
- Node 12: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors {1, 6, 14}: <12, (1, 6, 14)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of [5].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 11, 14)>
<4, (8, 10, 11)>
<8, (10, 12, 14)>
<11, (7, 9, 13)>
<12, (1, 6, 14)>
