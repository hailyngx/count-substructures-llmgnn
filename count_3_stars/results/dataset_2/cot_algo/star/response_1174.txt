Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph as an adjacency list for easier visualization:

1: {5, 6, 0}
2: {9, 3, 8, 7, 4}
3: {0, 2, 8}
4: {5, 9, 6, 2}
5: {9, 6, 1, 4}
6: {5, 1, 7, 4, 8}
7: {6, 1, 2}
8: {6, 3, 2, 0}
9: {5, 4, 2, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1: no 3-stars
- Node 2: no 3-stars
- Node 3: no 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 3 3-stars
- Node 7: no 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 2 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<6, (5, 1, 4)>
<6, (5, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (6, 3, 2)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<9, (4, 2, 0)>
