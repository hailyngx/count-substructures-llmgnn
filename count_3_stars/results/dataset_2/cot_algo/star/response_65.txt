Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 13) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 15) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 8) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 19) (5, 3) (19, 11) (19, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 16) (4, 0) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 16) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 16) (9, 10) (9, 16) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 16) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 15) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can start by listing the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {17, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 13}
- Node 2: {3, 15}
- Node 3: {17, 2, 13, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 19, 16}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {10, 1, 13, 16}
- Node 7: {12, 11}
- Node 8: {14, 0, 16}
- Node 9: {10, 16}
- Node 10: {17, 6, 9}
- Node 11: {7, 12, 19}
- Node 12: {7, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {14, 3, 1, 6, 12}
- Node 14: {8, 18, 13}
- Node 15: {17, 2, 16}
- Node 16: {8, 4, 6, 9, 15}
- Node 17: {10, 3, 0, 15}
- Node 18: {14}
- Node 19: {4, 11}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17.

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars formed: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 6>
<3, 13, 6>
<3, 13, 12>
<3, 13, 1>
<3, 13, 6>
<4, 8, 16>
<4, 16, 6>
<4, 16, 9>
<4, 16, 15>
<6, 10, 16>
<13, 6, 16>
<13, 6, 1>
<13, 6, 16>
<13, 16, 9>
<13, 16, 15>
<16, 6, 9>
<16, 6, 15>
<16, 9, 15>
<16, 15, 9>
