Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 20) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 0) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 29) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 22) (20, 1) (20, 27) (20, 28) (7, 1) (7, 19) (12, 25) (6, 17) (28, 20) (28, 10) (14, 0) (14, 27) (14, 4) (14, 21) (5, 13) (5, 25) (5, 15) (24, 26) (24, 9) (26, 24) (26, 15) (26, 29) (26, 21) (26, 11) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 15) (9, 8) (9, 24) (9, 18) (9, 19) (19, 7) (19, 9) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 16) (15, 5) (15, 26) (15, 17) (15, 29) (15, 2) (4, 14) (29, 13) (29, 26) (29, 15) (29, 16) (16, 18) (16, 29) (16, 22) (16, 10) (10, 28) (10, 18) (10, 16) (11, 26) (11, 18) (11, 22) (11, 27) (11, 2) (22, 0) (22, 16) (22, 11) (27, 20) (27, 14) (27, 11) (25, 12) (25, 5) (25, 23) (25, 21) (2, 15) (2, 11) (2, 21) (23, 25) (21, 14) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 14, 22}
- Node 1: {7, 18, 20}
- Node 2: {11, 15, 21}
- Node 3: {0, 17}
- Node 4: {14}
- Node 5: {13, 15, 25}
- Node 6: {17}
- Node 7: {1, 19}
- Node 8: {9, 13}
- Node 9: {8, 18, 19, 24}
- Node 10: {16, 18, 28}
- Node 11: {2, 16, 22, 26, 27}
- Node 12: {25}
- Node 13: {5, 8, 29}
- Node 14: {0, 4, 21, 27}
- Node 15: {2, 5, 17, 26, 29}
- Node 16: {10, 11, 18, 22, 29}
- Node 17: {3, 6, 15}
- Node 18: {1, 9, 10, 16}
- Node 19: {7, 9}
- Node 20: {1, 27, 28}
- Node 21: {2, 14, 25, 26}
- Node 22: {0, 11, 16}
- Node 23: {25}
- Node 24: {9, 26}
- Node 25: {5, 12, 21, 23}
- Node 26: {11, 15, 21, 24, 29}
- Node 27: {11, 14, 20}
- Node 28: {10, 20}
- Node 29: {13, 15, 16, 26}

Nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, 26, 29.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 1
- Node 2: 1
- Node 5: 1
- Node 9: 4
- Node 10: 1
- Node 11: 5
- Node 13: 1
- Node 14: 2
- Node 15: 1
- Node 16: 5
- Node 18: 3
- Node 21: 2
- Node 26: 5
- Node 29: 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 32. 

Therefore, the final answer is [32] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 

<0, (3, 14, 22)>, <1, (7, 18, 20)>, <2, (11, 15, 21)>, <5, (13, 15, 25)>, <9, (8, 18, 19, 24)>, <10, (16, 18, 28)>, <11, (2, 16, 22, 26, 27)>, <14, (0, 4, 21, 27)>, <15, (2, 5, 17, 26, 29)>, <16, (10, 11, 18, 22, 29)>, <18, (1, 9, 10, 16)>, <21, (2, 14, 25, 26)>, <26, (11, 15, 21, 24, 29)> and <29, (13, 15, 16, 26)>.
