Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 10) (7, 18) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 14) (6, 16) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 18) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 10) (19, 0) (19, 1) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 1) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 13) (1, 18) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 4, 10, 19}
- Node 1: {16, 4, 19, 13, 18}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 10}
- Node 3: {15, 2, 5, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 1}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 2}
- Node 6: {16, 5, 10}
- Node 7: {10, 18}
- Node 8: {11, 9, 18}
- Node 9: {15, 14, 8}
- Node 10: {7, 6, 0, 12, 2}
- Node 11: {16, 0, 8}
- Node 12: {3, 10}
- Node 13: {15, 14, 1}
- Node 14: {17, 15, 9, 13}
- Node 15: {3, 9, 13}
- Node 16: {11, 1, 6}
- Node 17: {14}
- Node 18: {7, 8, 1}
- Node 19: {0, 1}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 36 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are as follows:
<0, (4, 10, 19)>, <1, (4, 19, 13)>, <1, (4, 19, 18)>, <1, (13, 14, 15)>, <1, (13, 14, 9)>, <1, (13, 15, 9)>, <1, (14, 15, 9)>, 
<3, (2, 5, 12)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (5, 10, 16)>, <8, (9, 11, 18)>, <10, (0, 2, 12)>, <10, (0, 6, 7)>, <10, (2, 3, 12)>, <10, (2, 5, 6)>, <15, (9, 13, 14)>
