Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 3) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 18) (4, 0) (4, 16) (8, 15) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 7) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 3) (19, 13) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 0) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 1) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 11) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 0) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 7) (11, 18) (11, 15) (11, 0) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 6) (6, 2) (6, 16) (6, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 1) (12, 15) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 11, 13, 3, 12}
- Node 1: {18, 12, 7}
- Node 2: {14, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {9, 19, 0}
- Node 4: {0, 16}
- Node 5: {9, 19, 16}
- Node 6: {2, 16, 12}
- Node 7: {14, 2, 18, 1}
- Node 8: {15}
- Node 9: {5, 18, 3}
- Node 11: {18, 15, 0}
- Node 12: {15, 0, 1, 6}
- Node 13: {14, 19, 0}
- Node 14: {7, 2, 13}
- Node 15: {8, 19, 11, 12}
- Node 16: {5, 4, 6}
- Node 17: {18}
- Node 18: {9, 17, 11, 7, 1}
- Node 19: {5, 9, 15, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, which forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 2, 7, 12, 13, 15, and 18 each have 4 neighbors, which forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars for each node.

In total, there are 10 + 6(4) = 34 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 3, 13)>
- <2, (14, 7, 6)>
- <7, (14, 2, 18)>
- <12, (15, 0, 1)>
- <13, (14, 19, 0)>
- <15, (8, 19, 11)>
- <18, (9, 17, 7)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].
