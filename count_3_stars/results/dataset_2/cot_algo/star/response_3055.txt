Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 17) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 9) (10, 8) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 18) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 12) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (8, 10) (8, 17) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 19) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 18) (0, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (12, 2) (12, 18) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 19) (15, 19) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 15) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {11, 16, 18, 9}
- Node 1: {11, 3, 5, 7, 13}
- Node 2: {11, 18, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 14, 9}
- Node 4: {13, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 13, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 19}
- Node 8: {10, 17}
- Node 9: {11, 3, 0}
- Node 10: {8}
- Node 11: {16, 1, 0, 9, 2}
- Node 12: {2, 18}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 4, 19}
- Node 14: {3, 6, 4}
- Node 15: {19}
- Node 16: {11, 0, 17}
- Node 17: {16, 8, 18}
- Node 18: {17, 2, 12, 0}
- Node 19: {13, 7, 15}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 1: 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 11: 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 13: 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 18: 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 19: 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 37

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [37], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, 16, 18, 9>, <1, 3, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 13, 5>, <1, 5, 7, 13>, <1, 5, 13, 19>, <11, 16, 0, 17>, <11, 16, 1, 2>, <11, 16, 0, 18>, <11, 16, 17, 8>, <11, 1, 7, 13>, <13, 19, 7, 15>
