Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 1) (14, 4) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 3) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 19) (10, 8) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 15) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 17) (3, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 18) (9, 4) (9, 12) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 12) (16, 7) (16, 8) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 12) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 11) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 18) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 18) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 6 -- 3 -- 17  
:    |    |    |
7 -- 16 -- 8 -- 13 -- 1 -- 4 -- 9   
:          |          |          |    
18 -- 15   12 -- 19   11 -- 5
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

For node 0: Neighbors = {6, 7, 15, 18}
For node 1: Neighbors = {4, 7, 11, 13}
For node 3: Neighbors = {6, 17}
For node 4: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9, 14}
For node 5: Neighbors = {4, 11, 15}
For node 8: Neighbors = {13, 16, 10, 19}
For node 12: Neighbors = {9, 13, 18, 19}
For node 13: Neighbors = {1, 8, 12, 15, 19}
For node 16: Neighbors = {7, 8}
For node 18: Neighbors = {0, 12, 15, 19}
For node 19: Neighbors = {8, 12, 13, 18}

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 6, 15>, <0, 6, 18>, <0, 7, 15>, <0, 7, 16>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 4, 7>, <5, 4, 11>, <5, 4, 15>, <8, 13, 19>, <8, 13, 12>
