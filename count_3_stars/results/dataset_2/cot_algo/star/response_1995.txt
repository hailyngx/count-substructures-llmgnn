Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 5) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 2) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 14) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: {10, 12, 6, 5}
- Node 1: {3, 9, 8}
- Node 2: {13, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 13, 8, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 8, 12, 5}
- Node 5: {10, 4, 8, 7, 0}
- Node 6: {3, 11, 0, 13}
- Node 7: {11, 12, 14, 9, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 11, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 7, 14}
- Node 10: {11, 0, 5, 14}
- Node 11: {10, 7, 6, 8}
- Node 12: {4, 7, 13, 0}
- Node 13: {3, 12, 6, 2}
- Node 14: {10, 7, 2, 9}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 3: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 4: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 5: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 7: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 8: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 10: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 11: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 12: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 13: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 14: 4 choose 3 = 4

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 
4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 61

Therefore, there are 61 3-stars in this graph. 
Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, 10, 5>, <0, 10, 6>, <0, 10, 12>, <0, 12, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 8, 4>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 12>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 11>, <3, 6, 13>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 12>, <4, 8, 5>, <5, 7, 10>, <5, 7, 8>, <7, 9, 14>, <8, 11, 4>, <8, 11, 5>, <9, 7, 14>, <10, 11, 7>, <10, 11, 8>, <10, 14, 7>, <11, 6, 3>, <12, 0, 6>, <12, 4, 7>, <12, 7, 13>, <13, 2, 14> 

Therefore, the final answer is [61].
