Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 19) (6, 9) (6, 29) (6, 23) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 19) (2, 8) (2, 0) (29, 6) (29, 5) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 21) (23, 6) (23, 22) (23, 5) (0, 2) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 21) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 15) (3, 20) (3, 28) (3, 17) (4, 20) (4, 27) (4, 12) (4, 26) (27, 4) (27, 25) (27, 28) (27, 7) (12, 4) (12, 28) (12, 18) (12, 15) (7, 27) (7, 13) (26, 4) (26, 10) (26, 25) (28, 0) (28, 3) (28, 27) (28, 12) (28, 24) (10, 26) (10, 25) (25, 27) (25, 26) (25, 10) (25, 13) (25, 24) (5, 29) (5, 23) (5, 1) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 15) (1, 9) (1, 5) (21, 22) (21, 0) (21, 18) (13, 7) (13, 25) (13, 19) (18, 12) (18, 21) (18, 15) (24, 28) (24, 25) (15, 22) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 17) (15, 18) (19, 16) (19, 9) (19, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 20, 28, 21}
- Node 1: {5, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 8}
- Node 3: {17, 20, 28}
- Node 4: {12, 20, 26, 27}
- Node 5: {1, 29, 23}
- Node 6: {8, 9, 23, 29}
- Node 7: {13, 27}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 15}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 17, 19}
- Node 10: {25, 26}
- Node 11: {16}
- Node 12: {4, 15, 18, 28}
- Node 13: {7, 19, 25}
- Node 15: {8, 12, 17, 18, 22}
- Node 16: {11, 19}
- Node 17: {3, 9, 15}
- Node 18: {12, 15, 21}
- Node 19: {9, 13, 16}
- Node 20: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 21: {0, 18, 22}
- Node 22: {15, 21, 23}
- Node 23: {5, 6, 22}
- Node 24: {25, 28}
- Node 25: {7, 10, 13, 24, 26}
- Node 26: {4, 10, 25}
- Node 27: {4, 7, 24, 25, 28}
- Node 28: {0, 3, 12, 24, 27}
- Node 29: {5, 6}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 4: 1
- Node 6: 1
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 1
- Node 12: 1
- Node 15: 1
- Node 25: 1
- Node 27: 1
- Node 28: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10, so the final answer is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 20, 28)>
<4, (12, 26, 27)>
<6, (8, 9, 23)>
<8, (2, 6, 15)>
<9, (1, 6, 17)>
<12, (4, 15, 18)>
<15, (8, 12, 17)>
<25, (7, 13, 27)>
<27, (4, 24, 28)>
<28, (3, 12, 27)>
