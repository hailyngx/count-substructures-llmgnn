Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 11) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 2) (1, 10) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 11) (13, 3) (13, 9) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 4) (15, 10) (15, 16) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 14) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 12) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 3) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 12) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 4) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 8) (11, 19) (14, 9) (14, 16) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {5, 8, 12}
Node 1: Neighbors {2, 10}
Node 2: Neighbors {1, 7, 4, 18}
Node 3: Neighbors {13, 12, 4}
Node 4: Neighbors {2, 6, 10, 3}
Node 5: Neighbors {0}
Node 6: Neighbors {7, 4}
Node 7: Neighbors {2, 6, 10, 8}
Node 8: Neighbors {9, 11, 0, 7}
Node 9: Neighbors {13, 8, 14}
Node 10: Neighbors {1, 15, 7, 4}
Node 11: Neighbors {18, 17, 8, 19}
Node 12: Neighbors {17, 19, 16, 0, 3}
Node 13: Neighbors {3, 9}
Node 14: Neighbors {9, 16}
Node 15: Neighbors {10, 16}
Node 16: Neighbors {15, 12, 14}
Node 17: Neighbors {12, 19, 11}
Node 18: Neighbors {2, 11}
Node 19: Neighbors {17, 11, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is: [30]

Unique 3-stars found: <2, (1, 7, 4)>, <4, (2, 6, 10)>, <7, (2, 10, 8)>, <8, (9, 11, 0)>, <10, (1, 15, 7)>, <11, (18, 17, 8)>, <12, (17, 19, 16)>, <16, (15, 12, 14)>, <17, (12, 19, 11)>, <19, (17, 11, 12)>
