Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 7) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 6) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 9) (5, 15) (5, 19) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 6) (2, 17) (2, 12) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 18) (0, 15) (0, 13) (0, 10) (6, 8) (6, 19) (18, 11) (18, 12) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {3, 10, 13, 15}
- Node 2: {12, 17}
- Node 3: {4, 15}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 11}
- Node 5: {15, 19}
- Node 6: {8, 19}
- Node 7: {4, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 8: {6, 7, 13, 17, 19}
- Node 9: {7, 10, 14, 16}
- Node 10: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 11: {4, 16, 18}
- Node 12: {2, 13, 18}
- Node 13: {0, 8, 12, 16}
- Node 14: {9, 15, 17}
- Node 15: {0, 3, 5, 14}
- Node 16: {9, 11, 13}
- Node 17: {2, 8, 14, 19}
- Node 18: {11, 12}
- Node 19: {5, 6, 8, 17}

Next, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 8, 15
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19

For nodes with 4 neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For nodes with 3 neighbors, since each generates only 1 unique 3-star:
- Node 3: 1 3-star <3, (4, 15)>
- Node 4: 1 3-star <4, (3, 7)>
- Node 7: 1 3-star <7, (4, 8)>
- Node 9: 1 3-star <9, (7, 10)>
- Node 10: 1 3-star <10, (0, 7)>
- Node 11: 1 3-star <11, (16, 18)>
- Node 12: 1 3-star <12, (13, 18)>
- Node 13: 1 3-star <13, (8, 16)>
- Node 14: 1 3-star <14, (9, 17)>
- Node 17: 1 3-star <17, (14, 19)>
- Node 19: 1 3-star <19, (5, 8)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 22, so the final answer is [22].
