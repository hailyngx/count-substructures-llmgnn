Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 4) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 14) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 18) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 1) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 12) (2, 12) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 7) (19, 5) (19, 0) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 7) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 1) (15, 12) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 14) (12, 18) (12, 2) (12, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 14) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 19, 6, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 15, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbor {12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 7, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {11, 18, 1}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 19, 15}
- Node 6: Neighbors {11, 17, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {10, 8, 1, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {17, 0, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 15, 14, 3}
- Node 10: Neighbors {7, 13, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {18, 6, 4}
- Node 12: Neighbors {18, 2, 15}
- Node 13: Neighbors {10, 17, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {9, 10, 13, 3}
- Node 15: Neighbors {5, 9, 1, 12}
- Node 17: Neighbors {13, 6, 8, 18}
- Node 18: Neighbors {11, 17, 4, 12}
- Node 19: Neighbors {5, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 3, 9, 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- Node 1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15, 17: No 3-star can be formed as they have less than 3 neighbors
- Node 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 12, 18, 19: No 3-star can be formed as they have exactly 3 neighbors

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12], and the unique 3-stars are:

<3, (9, 7, 14)>, <9, (5, 15, 14)>, <14, (9, 10, 13)>, <14, (9, 10, 3)>, <14, (9, 13, 3)>, <14, (10, 13, 3)>.
