Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {1, 5, 9}
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {3, 6, 8}
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {2, 5, 7}
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {1, 5, 7}

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4]. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 8)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
