Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 5
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 8

Now, we can see which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 6 neighbors
- Node 3: 6 neighbors
- Node 4: 6 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 74

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [74], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- <8, (1, 3, 5)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <8, (4, 5, 9)>
