Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 27) (16, 11) (16, 3) (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 26) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 15) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 24) (22, 18) (22, 29) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 15) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 29) (13, 6) (23, 26) (23, 9) (12, 7) (12, 24) (12, 25) (17, 19) (29, 22) (29, 13) (29, 5) (26, 4) (26, 23) (28, 8) (28, 2) (28, 15) (6, 13) (6, 21) (6, 10) (21, 6) (21, 25) (27, 11) (27, 4) (27, 10) (27, 3) (10, 6) (10, 27) (10, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 20) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 25) (0, 10) (0, 25) (0, 5) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 23) (5, 29) (5, 0) (3, 16) (3, 27) (3, 14) (24, 18) (24, 12) (24, 2) (24, 20) (1, 2) (2, 28) (2, 24) (2, 1) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 28) (25, 13) (25, 12) (25, 21) (25, 19) (25, 0) (20, 14) (20, 24) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

1. Node 0: 10, 25, 5
2. Node 1: 2
3. Node 2: 1, 28, 24
4. Node 3: 16, 27, 14
5. Node 4: 7, 27, 9, 13, 26
6. Node 5: 29, 0
7. Node 6: 13, 21, 10
8. Node 7: 4, 12, 15
9. Node 8: 13, 28, 15
10. Node 9: 4, 18, 23
11. Node 10: 6, 27, 0
12. Node 11: 16, 14, 27
13. Node 12: 7, 25, 21
14. Node 13: 4, 8, 25, 29, 6
15. Node 14: 11, 3, 20
16. Node 15: 7, 18, 8, 28
17. Node 17: 19
18. Node 18: 22, 19, 9, 15, 24
19. Node 19: 18, 17, 25
20. Node 20: 14, 24
21. Node 21: 6, 25, 12
22. Node 22: 18, 29
23. Node 23: 26, 9
24. Node 24: 18, 12, 2, 20
25. Node 25: 13, 12, 21, 19, 0
26. Node 26: 4, 23
27. Node 27: 11, 4, 10, 3
28. Node 28: 8, 2, 15
29. Node 29: 22, 13, 5

Next, we will find the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

1. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
2. Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
3. Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
4. Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
6. Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7. Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the final answer is [52], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, 7, 27>, <4, 27, 9>, <4, 27, 13>, <4, 27, 26>, <4, 9, 13>, <4, 9, 26>, <4, 13, 26>, <7, 12, 15>, <18, 22, 29>, <18, 22, 9>, <18, 22, 15>, <18, 19, 15>, <18, 19, 24>, <22, 29, 13>, <8, 13, 28>, <8, 13, 15>, <8, 13, 28>, <13, 29, 6>, <12, 25, 21>, <12,...
