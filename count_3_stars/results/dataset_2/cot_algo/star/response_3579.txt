Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 6 neighbors
- Node 2, 4 neighbors
- Node 3, 5 neighbors
- Node 4, 4 neighbors
- Node 7, 4 neighbors
- Node 8, 4 neighbors
- Node 9, 5 neighbors

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
