Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 4, 7, 3, 8
- Node 2: 5, 9, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 9, 7, 1, 6, 8
- Node 4: 7, 8, 2, 1, 6
- Node 5: 6, 2
- Node 6: 5, 9, 4, 3, 0
- Node 7: 4, 3, 1, 2
- Node 8: 9, 4, 1, 3, 2
- Node 9: 6, 8, 2, 3, 0

Next, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with itself as the center. These 3-stars are:
    <1, (4, 7, 3)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 3, 8)>, <1, (7, 3, 8)>
- Node 2: has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with itself as the center. However, one of the 3-stars <2, (2, 4, 8)> is a duplicate.
- Node 3: has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with itself as the center. These 3-stars are:
    <3, (9, 7, 1)>, <3, (9, 7, 8)>, <3, (9, 1, 8)>, <3, (7, 1, 8)>, 
    <3, (7, 1, 4)>, <3, (7, 2, 1)>, <3, (7, 2, 8)>, <3, (7, 4, 8)>, 
    <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 4: has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with itself as the center. However, <4, (4, 7, 8)> is a duplicate.
- Node 6: has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with itself as a center. However, <6, (6, 4, 9)> is a duplicate.
- Node 8: has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with itself as the center. However, <8, (8, 1, 4)> is a duplicate.
- Node 9: has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with itself as the center. These 3-stars are:
    <9, (3, 7, 1)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 1, 8)>, <9, (7, 1, 8)>,
    <9, (7, 1, 6)>, <9, (7, 2, 1)>, <9, (7, 2, 8)>, <9, (7, 4, 8)>,
    <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 (from node 1) + 9 (from nodes 3 and 9) = 13, so the final answer is [13].
