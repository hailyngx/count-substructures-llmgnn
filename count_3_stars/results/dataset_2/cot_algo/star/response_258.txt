Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 6, 8, 9
Node 1: 7
Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 4: 2, 5, 8
Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 8, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 8
Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 9: 0, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 7, 9
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 2, 4
Nodes with 6 neighbors: 3, 5, 8, 6

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
For nodes with 3 neighbors, the number of 3-stars formed is 1 each.
For nodes with 6 neighbors, the number of 3-stars formed is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) each.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
1 (node 0) + 1 (node 1) + 1 (node 7) + 1 (node 9) + 20*4 (for nodes with 6 neighbors) = 85

Therefore, the final answer, inside brackets [], is [85].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 6, 8, 9>, <1, 7, 2, 8>, <3, 5, 2, 6>, <4, 2, 5, 8>
