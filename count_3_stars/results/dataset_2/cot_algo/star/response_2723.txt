Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 8, and Node 9 have 4 or more neighbors.

For nodes with 4 neighbors (Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 8), they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

For nodes with 5 neighbors (Node 2, Node 9), they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 
\[ 6 \times 4 + 2 \times 10 = 24 + 20 = 44 \]

Therefore, the final answer is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>
