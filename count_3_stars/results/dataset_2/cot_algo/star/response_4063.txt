Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 16) (4, 15) (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 3) (15, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 2) (10, 5) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 8) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 11) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 18) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 6) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 12) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 6) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 12) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 16) (1, 14) (1, 19) (14, 1) (19, 10) (19, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 11) 

Response:
This graph has the following neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {16, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {14, 19}
- Node 2: {3, 13, 10, 18}
- Node 3: {15, 6, 2, 18}
- Node 4: {8, 16, 15}
- Node 5: {9, 15, 10}
- Node 6: {3, 17, 18, 16}
- Node 8: {4, 13, 17, 12}
- Node 9: {5, 13}
- Node 10: {5, 17, 19, 2}
- Node 11: {0, 17, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 8, 11}
- Node 13: {9, 15, 8, 2}
- Node 14: {1}
- Node 15: {5, 4, 3, 13}
- Node 16: {4, 0, 6}
- Node 17: {8, 10, 6, 11}
- Node 18: {3, 2, 6}
- Node 19: {10, 1}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 2, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4, 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5, 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17, 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18, 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 26, which can be represented as [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (3, 13, 18)>
- <3, (2, 13, 18)>
- <4, (8, 15, 16)>
- <5, (9, 10, 15)>
- <8, (4, 13, 17)>
- <10, (2, 17, 19)>
- <13, (2, 15, 3)>
- <15, (3, 13, 5)>
- <17, (6, 10, 11)>
- <18, (2, 3, 6)>
