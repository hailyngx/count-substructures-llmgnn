Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 24) (11, 19) (11, 20) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 29) (16, 10) (1, 16) (1, 21) (1, 24) (1, 13) (21, 1) (21, 15) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 23) (6, 0) (28, 29) (28, 26) (29, 16) (29, 28) (29, 17) (17, 29) (17, 23) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 0) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 4) (9, 22) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 22) (4, 26) (4, 27) (27, 4) (27, 10) (27, 7) (20, 11) (20, 3) (20, 18) (25, 12) (25, 24) (14, 26) (14, 24) (12, 16) (12, 25) (12, 3) (12, 8) (8, 12) (24, 11) (24, 1) (24, 25) (24, 14) (0, 6) (0, 22) (0, 3) (0, 18) (3, 20) (3, 12) (3, 0) (15, 21) (15, 19) (15, 18) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 23) (2, 6) (2, 10) (10, 16) (10, 5) (10, 27) (10, 2) (7, 9) (7, 27) (7, 13) (23, 6) (23, 17) (23, 19) (18, 20) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 13) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's find the set of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {6, 22, 3, 18}
- Node 1: {16, 21, 24, 13}
- Node 2: {6, 10}
- Node 3: {20, 12, 0}
- Node 4: {5, 22, 26, 27}
- Node 5: {6, 4, 10}
- Node 6: {5, 2, 23, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 27, 13}
- Node 8: {12}
- Node 9: {22, 7}
- Node 10: {16, 5, 27, 2}
- Node 11: {24, 19, 20}
- Node 12: {16, 25, 3, 8}
- Node 13: {1, 7, 18}
- Node 14: {26, 24}
- Node 15: {21, 19, 18}
- Node 16: {12, 1, 29, 10}
- Node 17: {29, 23}
- Node 18: {20, 0, 15, 13}
- Node 19: {11, 15, 23}
- Node 20: {11, 3, 18}
- Node 21: {1, 15}
- Node 22: {9, 4, 0}
- Node 23: {6, 17, 19}
- Node 24: {11, 1, 25, 14}
- Node 25: {12, 24}
- Node 26: {28, 14, 4}
- Node 27: {4, 10, 7}
- Node 28: {29, 26}
- Node 29: {16, 28, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star by having at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 4, Node 6, Node 10, Node 12, Node 18, Node 19, Node 22, Node 24, Node 27, Node 29

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0: [1]
    - <0, (6, 22, 3)>
- Node 4: [1]
    - <4, (5, 26, 27)>
- Node 6: [4]
    - <6, (5, 2, 0)>
    - <6, (5, 23, 0)>
    - <6, (2, 23, 0)>
    - <6, (23, 17, 19)>
- Node 10: [1]
    - <10, (16, 5, 27)>
- Node 12: [1]
    - <12, (16, 25, 3)>
- Node 18: [1]
    - <18, (20, 0, 15)>
- Node 19: [1]
    - <19, (11, 15, 23)>
- Node 22: [1]
    - <22, (9, 4, 0)>
- Node 24: [1]
    - <24, (11, 25, 14)>
- Node 27: [1]
    - <27, (4, 10, 7)>
- Node 29: [1]
    - <29, (16, 28, 17)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
