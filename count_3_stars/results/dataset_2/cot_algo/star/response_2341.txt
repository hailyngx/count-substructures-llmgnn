Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 23) (22, 11) (22, 10) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 10) (23, 3) (23, 6) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 15) (18, 29) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 13) (21, 12) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 14) (28, 19) (3, 23) (3, 21) (26, 18) (26, 14) (26, 15) (26, 8) (14, 28) (14, 26) (14, 20) (12, 21) (16, 27) (16, 15) (7, 28) (29, 18) (29, 13) (13, 21) (13, 29) (13, 20) (13, 1) (15, 18) (15, 26) (15, 16) (15, 17) (0, 2) (0, 24) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 19) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 24) (9, 4) (9, 11) (6, 23) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 27) (19, 28) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 20) (27, 16) (27, 6) (27, 17) (25, 22) (25, 8) (24, 0) (24, 4) (10, 22) (10, 23) (10, 8) (8, 26) (8, 25) (8, 10) (11, 22) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 20) (20, 14) (20, 13) (20, 19) (20, 11) (17, 15) (17, 27) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by identifying the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 6, 24}
- Node 1: {2, 13, 19}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 18}
- Node 3: {6, 21, 23}
- Node 4: {0, 9, 19, 24}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 11, 23, 27}
- Node 7: {14, 19, 21, 28}
- Node 8: {10, 25, 26}
- Node 9: {4, 11}
- Node 10: {8, 22, 23}
- Node 11: {9, 11, 20, 22}
- Node 12: {13, 21}
- Node 13: {1, 12, 19, 20, 29}
- Node 14: {7, 20, 26, 28}
- Node 15: {16, 17, 18, 26}
- Node 16: {15, 27}
- Node 17: {15, 27}
- Node 18: {2, 15, 26, 29}
- Node 19: {1, 4, 7, 13, 20, 28}
- Node 20: {11, 13, 14, 19}
- Node 21: {3, 7, 12, 13, 28}
- Node 22: {10, 11, 23, 25}
- Node 23: {3, 10, 22}
- Node 24: {0, 4}
- Node 25: {8, 22}
- Node 26: {8, 14, 15, 18}
- Node 27: {6, 16, 17}
- Node 28: {7, 14, 19, 21}
- Node 29: {13, 18}

Now we can find the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0, Node 4, Node 6, Node 19 each have 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 8, Node 10, Node 11, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15,  Node 18, Node 20, and Node 28 each have 3 neighbors => 1 3-star each

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4*4 + 11*1 = 27 \)

So, the final answer is [27], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, 2, 4, 24>, <4, 1, 13, 19>, <6, 0, 27, 4>, <19, 7, 13, 28>, <1, 2, 18>, <8, 10, 25>, <10, 11, 22>, <13, 12, 29>, <14, 7, 28>, <15, 16, 17>, <18, 26, 29>, <20, 11, 14>, <21, 3, 7>, <22, 23, 25>
