Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 7) (5, 22) (5, 21) (9, 24) (1, 25) (1, 24) (1, 4) (1, 22) (22, 3) (22, 5) (22, 1) (22, 23) (22, 20) (23, 22) (23, 7) (23, 6) (23, 13) (12, 10) (12, 21) (12, 0) (27, 25) (27, 6) (4, 1) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 16) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 29) (21, 5) (21, 12) (21, 16) (28, 11) (28, 8) (28, 25) (13, 23) (13, 24) (13, 19) (26, 10) (11, 28) (11, 20) (11, 25) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 26) (25, 1) (25, 27) (25, 28) (25, 11) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 0) (16, 4) (16, 21) (16, 20) (8, 28) (8, 7) (6, 23) (6, 27) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 6) (17, 2) (7, 15) (7, 23) (7, 8) (29, 18) (29, 0) (2, 17) (2, 0) (14, 4) (14, 18) (20, 22) (20, 11) (20, 16) (24, 9) (24, 1) (24, 13) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 6) (0, 29) (0, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 6, 12, 19, 29}
- Node 1: {4, 22, 24, 25}
- Node 2: {0, 17}
- Node 3: {10, 15, 22}
- Node 4: {1, 14, 16, 18}
- Node 5: {21, 22}
- Node 6: {0, 17, 23, 27}
- Node 7: {8, 15, 23}
- Node 8: {7, 28}
- Node 9: {24}
- Node 10: {3, 12, 15, 26}
- Node 11: {20, 25, 28}
- Node 12: {0, 10, 21}
- Node 13: {19, 23, 24}
- Node 14: {4, 18}
- Node 15: {3, 7, 10, 19}
- Node 16: {4, 20, 21}
- Node 17: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 18: {4, 14, 29}
- Node 19: {0, 13, 15}
- Node 20: {11, 16, 22}
- Node 21: {5, 12, 16}
- Node 22: {1, 3, 5, 20, 23}
- Node 23: {6, 7, 13, 22}
- Node 24: {1, 9, 13}
- Node 25: {1, 11, 27, 28}
- Node 26: {10}
- Node 27: {6, 25}
- Node 28: {8, 11, 25}
- Node 29: {0, 18}

Next, we identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0 can form a 3-star with 4 other nodes: <0, (2, 6, 12)>
- Node 1 can form a 3-star with 3 other nodes: <1, (4, 24, 25)>
- Node 3 can form a 3-star with 3 other nodes: <3, (10, 15, 22)>
- Node 4 can form a 3-star with 3 other nodes: <4, (14, 16, 18)>
- Node 6 can form a 3-star with 3 other nodes: <6, (17, 23, 27)>
- Node 10 can form a 3-star with 3 other nodes: <10, (12, 15, 26)>
- Node 15 can form a 3-star with 3 other nodes: <15, (7, 10, 19)>
- Node 16 can form a 3-star with 3 other nodes: <16, (4, 20, 21)>
- Node 18 can form a 3-star with 3 other nodes: <18, (14, 29, 4)>
- Node 22 can form a 3-star with 4 other nodes: <22, (5, 20, 23)>
- Node 23 can form a 3-star with 4 other nodes: <23, (6, 7, 13)>
- Node 25 can form a 3-star with 3 other nodes: <25, (11, 28, 27)>

The total number of 3-stars formed is 11, thus the final answer is [11].
