Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 7: {3, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, and Node 8 each have 4 neighbors, so they can each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \). 
Thus, the final number to put inside brackets is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 2, 8, 9>
- <2, 0, 1, 3>
- <4, 0, 2, 8>
- <8, 1, 2, 4>
