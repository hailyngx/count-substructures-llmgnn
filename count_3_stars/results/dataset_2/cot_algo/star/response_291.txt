Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 2) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 12) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 0) (15, 1) (8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 18) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 13) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 7) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 4) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 0) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 2) (3, 8) (3, 19) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 12) (19, 0) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 19) (4, 14) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 18, 2, 19
- Node 1: 6, 15, 0
- Node 2: 11, 0, 5
- Node 3: 8, 19
- Node 4: 14, 13
- Node 5: 10, 2, 12
- Node 6: 1, 7, 13
- Node 7: 6, 16, 14, 13
- Node 8: 16, 3, 18
- Node 9: 12
- Node 10: 11, 17, 5, 16
- Node 11: 10, 14, 17, 2
- Node 12: 9, 17, 5, 19
- Node 13: 6, 7, 4
- Node 14: 11, 7, 18, 4
- Node 15: 1
- Node 16: 10, 8, 7
- Node 17: 10, 11, 12
- Node 18: 8, 14, 0
- Node 19: 0, 3, 12

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 18, 2) and a 3-star with nodes (1, 19, 18).
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes (8, 19, 12).
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes (10, 2, 12).
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 7, 13).
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes (6, 16, 13).
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes (11, 17, 5).
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes (9, 17, 19) and a 3-star with nodes (5, 17, 12).
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes (11, 18, 14).
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes (8, 7, 16).

Thus, there are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in this graph. So, the final number inside brackets is [10].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 18, 2)>, <0, (1, 19, 18)>, <3, (8, 19, 12)>, <5, (10, 2, 12)>, <6, (1, 7, 13)>, <7, (6, 16, 13)>, <10, (11, 17, 5)>, <12, (9, 17, 19)>, <12, (5, 17, 12)>, <14, (11, 18, 14)>, <16, (8, 7, 16)>.
