Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 2) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 12) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 12) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 13, 6, 14, 2
- Node 1: 6, 14, 5, 9
- Node 2: 7, 5, 6, 0, 11, 12
- Node 3: 7, 14, 12
- Node 4: 7, 0, 5
- Node 5: 4, 7, 1, 6, 2, 10
- Node 6: 1, 5, 2, 0
- Node 7: 4, 0, 3, 2, 5
- Node 8: 13, 14, 11
- Node 9: 1, 11, 12
- Node 10: 5, 12
- Node 11: 8, 13, 9, 2
- Node 12: 3, 9, 2, 10
- Node 13: 8, 11, 0
- Node 14: 1, 3, 8, 0

Now, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, giving us \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, giving us \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, giving us \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, giving us \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 70

Therefore, the final answer is: [70]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, 4, 5, 7>, <0, 4, 6, 7>, <0, 5, 6, 7>, <2, 5, 6, 7>, <0, 2, 5, 7>
