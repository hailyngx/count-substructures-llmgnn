Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 2) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 8, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 12}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 11, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 5, 9, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 8, 10}
- Node 10: Neighbors {4, 5, 9}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {4, 5, 7, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: <1, (0, 8, 14)>
- Node 2: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: <4, (5, 10, 13)>
- Node 5: No 3-star can be formed as it has exactly 2 neighbors.
- Node 6: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it has exactly 2 neighbors.
- Node 9: No 3-star can be formed as it has exactly 2 neighbors.
- Node 10: No 3-star can be formed as it has exactly 2 neighbors.
- Node 11: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 12: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 13: No 3-star can be formed as it has exactly 2 neighbors.
- Node 14: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 8, 14)> and <4, (5, 10, 13)>.
