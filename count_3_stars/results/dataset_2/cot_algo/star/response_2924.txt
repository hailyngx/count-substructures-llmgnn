Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 0) (5, 12) (5, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 0) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually with its nodes and edges:

```plaintext
    5 -- 12 -- 6 -- 1
    |           |   |
    13 -- 3 -- 4 -- 7 -- 0
            |   |   |
            10 -- 2 -- 9 -- 8
                |
                11
```

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each = 20 total.
  - No 3-stars for Node 13 (4, 0, 3) as it does not form a triangle.

- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each = 20 total.
  - No 3-stars for Node 12 (5, 10, 0) as it does not form a triangle.

- For nodes with 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each = 20 total.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 20 + 20 + 20 = 60 \), which can be represented as [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 7, 10)>, 
<1, (2, 4, 6)>, 
<2, (0, 7, 10)>, 
<3, (4, 6, 13)>, 
<4, (1, 6, 7)>, 
<6, (1, 4, 7)>, 
<7, (0, 2, 10)>, 
<10, (0, 2, 7)>, 
<12, (0, 3, 6)>, 
<13, (3, 4, 0)>.
