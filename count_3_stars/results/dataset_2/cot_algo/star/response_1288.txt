Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 20) (26, 10) (26, 27) (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 29) (6, 9) (6, 25) (2, 17) (29, 15) (29, 14) (29, 10) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 27) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 8) (21, 14) (21, 4) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 21) (8, 24) (23, 12) (23, 13) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (17, 2) (17, 20) (17, 1) (17, 16) (19, 28) (19, 27) (13, 23) (13, 16) (13, 20) (22, 9) (22, 14) (22, 0) (20, 9) (20, 17) (20, 13) (20, 12) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 22) (4, 21) (4, 12) (4, 24) (4, 1) (27, 26) (27, 7) (27, 19) (27, 10) (11, 12) (5, 3) (12, 23) (12, 20) (12, 4) (12, 11) (28, 19) (1, 7) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 10) (16, 18) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 10) (10, 26) (10, 29) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 16) (14, 29) (14, 21) (14, 22) (14, 25) (24, 8) (24, 4) (25, 6) (25, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: {7, 17, 4, 10}
2: {17}
3: {15, 5, 8}
4: {21, 12, 1, 24}
5: {3}
6: {9, 25}
7: {21, 0, 27, 1}
8: {3, 15, 21, 24}
9: {6, 22, 20}
10: {26, 29, 27, 1, 16}
11: {12}
12: {23, 20, 4, 11}
13: {23, 16, 20}
14: {29, 21, 22, 25}
15: {3, 18, 8, 29}
16: {18, 17, 13, 10}
17: {2, 20, 1, 16}
18: {15, 16, 0}
19: {28, 27}
20: {9, 17, 13, 12}
21: {7, 8, 14, 4}
22: {9, 14, 0}
23: {12, 13}
24: {8, 4}
25: {6, 14}
26: {10, 27}
27: {26, 7, 19, 10}
28: {19}
29: {15, 14, 10}

Now we can identify the number of 3-stars.
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Total 3-stars = \( \sum_{{v \in V \\ deg(v) \geq 3}} \binom{{deg(v)}}{3} \)
- Total 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} \)
- Total 3-stars = 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1
- Total 3-stars = 119

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [119].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (7, 17, 4)>
<3, (15, 5, 8)>
<4, (21, 12, 1)>
<7, (21, 0, 27)>
<8, (15, 18, 29)>
<9, (6, 22, 20)>
<10, (26, 29, 27)>
<12, (23, 20, 4)>
<14, (29, 21, 22)>
<15, (3, 18, 8)>
<16, (18, 17, 13)>
<17, (2, 20, 1)>
<20, (9, 17, 13)>
<21, (8, 24, 4)>
<22, (14, 29, 25)>
<24, (8, 4, 24)>
<25, (6, 25, 14)>
<26, (10, 29, 27)>
<27, (7, 19, 10)>
