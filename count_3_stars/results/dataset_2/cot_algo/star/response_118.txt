Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 0) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 10) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 0) (19, 12) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 4) (18, 19) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (15, 16) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 7) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 16) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 13) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will first list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {17, 5, 19, 13}
Node 1: {16, 4, 12}
Node 2: {14, 11, 9, 7}
Node 3: {12}
Node 4: {1, 9, 13, 12, 10}
Node 5: {19, 0, 10}
Node 6: {8, 13, 7}
Node 7: {6, 2}
Node 8: {14, 16, 6}
Node 9: {4, 2}
Node 10: {5, 4, 16}
Node 11: {14, 2}
Node 12: {1, 3, 19, 4}
Node 13: {4, 0, 6}
Node 14: {17, 11, 8, 2}
Node 15: {16}
Node 16: {1, 19, 8, 15, 10}
Node 17: {14, 0}
Node 18: {19}
Node 19: {5, 18, 16, 0, 12}

Now, we will check for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to find 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 7, which we will represent as [7]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 5, 19>, <4, 12, 10>, <6, 13, 7>, <8, 14, 16>, <12, 1, 19>, <14, 8, 16>, <16, 10, 19>.
