Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>
