Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 5, 9, 4, 3, 2
- Node 1: 5, 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 9, 7, 3, 6, 0
- Node 3: 9, 7, 1, 0, 2
- Node 4: 9, 8, 0
- Node 5: 9, 6, 1, 0
- Node 6: 5, 1, 2
- Node 7: 3, 2, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7, 1
- Node 9: 5, 4, 2, 3, 0

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least three neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (5, 9, 4)>
- <0, (5, 9, 3)>
- <0, (5, 9, 2)>
- <0, (5, 4, 3)>
- <0, (5, 4, 2)>
- <0, (5, 3, 2)>
- <1, (5, 3, 6)>
- <1, (5, 1, 8)>
- <2, (9, 7, 3)>
- <3, (9, 7, 1)>
- <4, (9, 8, 7)>
- <5, (9, 6, 1)>
