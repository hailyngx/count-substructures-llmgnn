Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 13) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 13) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and the specified edges, let's first calculate the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 11, 13}
Node 1 neighbors: {0, 7, 13, 14}
Node 2 neighbors: {0, 7, 11}
Node 3 neighbors: {0, 7, 10}
Node 4 neighbors: {5, 6, 9, 12}
Node 5 neighbors: {4, 7, 10, 13}
Node 6 neighbors: {4, 8, 10, 13}
Node 7 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 5}
Node 8 neighbors: {6, 10, 12}
Node 9 neighbors: {4, 11, 14}
Node 10 neighbors: {3, 5, 6, 8, 11}
Node 11 neighbors: {0, 2, 9, 10, 14}
Node 12 neighbors: {4, 8, 13}
Node 13 neighbors: {0, 1, 5, 6, 12, 14}
Node 14 neighbors: {1, 9, 11, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars using the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) and count the total number of 3-stars:

Node 4: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars (with 5, 6, 9) 
Node 5: 3 3-stars (with 4, 7, 10)  
Node 6: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars (with 4, 8, 13) 
Node 10: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars (with 3, 5, 6), (3, 5, 8), (3, 5, 10), (3, 6, 8), (3, 6, 10), (3, 8, 10), (5, 6, 8), (5, 6, 10), (5, 8, 10), (6, 8, 10) 
Node 11: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars (with 0, 9, 14), (2, 9, 14), (2, 11, 14), (6, 9, 14), (6, 11, 14), (8, 9, 14), (8, 11, 14), (10, 9, 14), (10, 11, 14), (6, 8, 14) 
Node 13: 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars (with 0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 6), (0, 1, 12), (0, 1, 14), (0, 5, 6), (0, 5, 12), (0, 5, 14), (0, 6, 12), (0, 6, 14), (0, 12, 14), (1, 5, 6), (1, 5, 12), (1, 5, 14), (1, 6, 12), (1, 6, 14), (1, 12, 14), (5, 6, 12), (5, 6, 14), (5, 12, 14), (6, 12, 14)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 3 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 51

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [51]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 10)>, <6, (4, 8, 13)>, <10, (3, 5, 6)>, <10, (3, 5, 8)>, <10, (3, 5, 10)>, <10, (3, 6, 8)>, <10, (3, 6, 10)>, <10, (3, 8, 10)>, <10, (5, 6, 8)>, <10, (5, 6, 10)>, <10, (5, 8, 10)>, <10, (6, 8, 10)>, <11, (0, 9, 14)>, <11, (2, 9, 14)>, <11, (2, 11, 14)>, <11, (6, 9, 14)>, <11, (6, 11, 14)>, <11, (8, 9, 14)>, <11, (8, 11, 14)>, <11, (10, 9, 14)>, <11, (10, 11, 14)>, <11, (6, 8, 14)>, <13, (0, 1, 5)>, <13, (0, 1, 6)>, <13, (0, 1, 12)>, <13, (0, 1, 14)>, <13, (0, 5, 6)>, <13, (0, 5, 12)>, <13, (0, 5, 14)>, <13, (0, 6, 12)>, <13, (0, 6, 14)>, <13, (0, 12, 14)>, <13, (1, 5, 6)>, <13, (1, 5, 12)>, <13, (1, 5, 14)>, <13, (1, 6, 12)>, <13, (1, 6, 14)>, <13, (1, 12, 14)>, <13, (5, 6, 12)>, <13, (5, 6, 14)>, <13, (5, 12, 14)>, <13, (6, 12, 14)>
