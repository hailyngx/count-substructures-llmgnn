Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: Neighbors are 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 3, 5
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 2, 5, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars we found, we get a total of 46.
Therefore, the final answer is [46].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>.
