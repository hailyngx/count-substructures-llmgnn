Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 19) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 3) (26, 17) (15, 23) (15, 2) (15, 25) (27, 29) (27, 21) (27, 5) (2, 15) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 7) (29, 27) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 24) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (23, 15) (23, 2) (23, 1) (0, 22) (0, 18) (20, 19) (20, 28) (28, 29) (28, 20) (4, 18) (4, 13) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 4) (18, 1) (3, 26) (11, 26) (11, 13) (11, 12) (17, 26) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 5) (1, 23) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 6) (10, 26) (10, 12) (10, 14) (21, 27) (21, 25) (21, 24) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 22) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 24) (16, 13) (16, 22) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 19) (22, 0) (22, 6) (22, 16) (14, 10) (14, 24) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 16) (24, 29) (24, 21) (24, 12) (24, 14) (19, 9) (19, 20) (19, 7) (19, 25) (25, 15) (25, 21) (25, 19) (5, 27) (5, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {18, 22}
- Node 1: {6, 17, 18, 23}
- Node 2: {7, 15, 23, 29}
- Node 3: {26}
- Node 4: {13, 18}
- Node 5: {17, 27}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 22}
- Node 7: {2, 8, 19}
- Node 8: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {8, 18, 19}
- Node 10: {12, 14, 26}
- Node 11: {12, 13, 26}
- Node 12: {10, 11, 17, 24}
- Node 13: {4, 11, 16}
- Node 14: {10, 24}
- Node 15: {2, 23, 25}
- Node 16: {13, 22}
- Node 17: {1, 5, 12, 26}
- Node 18: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 19: {7, 9, 20, 25}
- Node 20: {19, 28}
- Node 21: {24, 25, 27}
- Node 22: {0, 6, 16}
- Node 23: {1, 2, 15}
- Node 24: {12, 14, 21, 29}
- Node 25: {15, 19, 21}
- Node 26: {3, 10, 11, 17}
- Node 27: {5, 21, 29}
- Node 28: {20, 29}
- Node 29: {2, 24, 27, 28}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 1, 3-stars: [<1, (6, 18, 23)>, <1, (17, 18, 6)>, <1, (17, 18, 23)>]
- Node 2, 3-stars: [<2, (7, 15, 29)>]
- Node 6, 3-stars: [<6, (1, 8, 22)>]
- Node 8, 3-stars: [<8, (6, 7, 9)>]
- Node 9, 3-stars: [<9, (8, 19, 18)>]
- Node 12, 3-stars: [<12, (10, 17, 24)>, <12, (11, 17, 24)>]
- Node 13, 3-stars: [<13, (11, 16, 4)>]
- Node 17, 3-stars: [<17, (1, 5, 26)>]
- Node 18, 3-stars: [<18, (1, 4, 9)>, <18, (1, 9, 6)>, <18, (4, 9, 1)>, <18, (6, 9, 1)>]
- Node 19, 3-stars: [<19, (7, 20, 25)>]
- Node 21, 3-stars: [<21, (24, 25, 29)>]
- Node 24, 3-stars: [<24, (14, 21, 29)>]

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we have 13. Therefore, the answer is [13].
