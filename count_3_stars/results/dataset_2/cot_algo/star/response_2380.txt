Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Adding these up, we get a total of 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (0, 1, 9)>
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- (0, 1, 3, 5)
- (0, 1, 5, 6)
