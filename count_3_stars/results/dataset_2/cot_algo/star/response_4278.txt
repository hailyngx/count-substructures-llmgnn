Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {6, 5, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {6, 4, 8, 5, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {4, 8, 5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {8, 5, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {6, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {5, 1, 8, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {9, 5, 2, 3, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {6, 9, 4, 2, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {8, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1 and Node 5 have 5 neighbors each, so they can each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \), so the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
