This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 25) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 15) (22, 23) (22, 10) (22, 7) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 19) (10, 17) (10, 22) (10, 21) (10, 12) (10, 2) (4, 14) (4, 8) (4, 25) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 18) (21, 10) (21, 19) (28, 26) (28, 27) (19, 23) (19, 21) (19, 26) (19, 7) (19, 1) (26, 28) (26, 19) (26, 20) (13, 5) (13, 29) (13, 15) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 25) (1, 19) (1, 11) (15, 17) (15, 13) (6, 29) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 20) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 12) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 5) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 29) (16, 0) (16, 24) (16, 20) (25, 14) (25, 4) (25, 5) (25, 27) (25, 29) (27, 28) (27, 25) (24, 16) (24, 18) (18, 23) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 24) (20, 26) (20, 11) (20, 16) (29, 13) (29, 6) (29, 0) (29, 25) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 9) (7, 22) (7, 19) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are as follows: 

{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Now let's find the 3-star configurations in this graph. 

For each node, we will identify its neighbors:

Node 0 neighbors: {3, 16, 29}
Node 1 neighbors: {11, 19}
Node 2 neighbors: {5, 10, 17}
Node 3 neighbors: {0, 11}
Node 4 neighbors: {8, 14, 25}
Node 5 neighbors: {2, 18, 25}
Node 6 neighbors: {29}
Node 7 neighbors: {19, 22}
Node 8 neighbors: {4, 9, 18}
Node 9 neighbors: {8, 12, 14}
Node 10 neighbors: {2, 12, 17, 21, 22}
Node 11 neighbors: {1, 3, 20}
Node 12 neighbors: {9, 10, 14}
Node 13 neighbors: {5, 15, 29}
Node 14 neighbors: {4, 9, 12, 25}
Node 15 neighbors: {13, 17}
Node 16 neighbors: {0, 20, 24}
Node 17 neighbors: {2, 10, 15}
Node 18 neighbors: {5, 8, 23, 24}
Node 19 neighbors: {1, 7, 21, 23, 26}
Node 20 neighbors: {11, 16, 26}
Node 21 neighbors: {10, 19}
Node 22 neighbors: {7, 10, 23}
Node 23 neighbors: {18, 19, 22}
Node 24 neighbors: {16, 18}
Node 25 neighbors: {4, 5, 14, 27, 29}
Node 26 neighbors: {19, 20, 28}
Node 27 neighbors: {25, 28}
Node 28 neighbors: {26, 27}
Node 29 neighbors: {0, 5, 13, 25, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 can form 1 3-star.
Node 10 can form 1 3-star.
Node 12 can form 1 3-star.
Node 14 can form 1 3-star.
Node 18 can form 1 3-star.
Node 19 can form 1 3-star.
Node 20 can form 1 3-star.
Node 25 can form 1 3-star.
Node 26 can form 1 3-star.
Node 29 can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 13

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (8, 14, 25)>
<5, (2, 14, 25)>
<8, (4, 9, 18)>
<9, (4, 12, 14)>
<10, (2, 12, 17)>
<12, (4, 9, 14)>
<14, (4, 9, 25)>
<18, (5, 8, 23)>
<19, (1, 7, 21)>
<20, (11, 16, 26)>
<25, (4, 5, 27)>
<26, (19, 20, 28)>
<29, (5, 13, 25)>
