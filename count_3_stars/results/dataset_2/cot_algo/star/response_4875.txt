Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (2, 16) (2, 17) (18, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 13) (14, 18) (14, 16) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 11) (15, 0) (15, 1) (8, 10) (8, 6) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 3) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (5, 12) (5, 17) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 9) (17, 4) (17, 2) (17, 9) (17, 5) (19, 4) (19, 13) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 19) 

Response:
First, let's organize the given edges with their corresponding nodes:

Node 0:  (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 13)
Node 1:  (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 11)
Node 2:  (2, 16) (2, 17)
Node 3:  (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6)
Node 4:  (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 17)
Node 5:  (5, 12) (5, 17)
Node 6:  (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 3)
Node 7:  (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10)
Node 8:  (8, 10) (8, 6)
Node 9:  (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 3)
Node 10: (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 13)
Node 11: (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13)
Node 12: (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3)
Node 13: (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 19)
Node 14: (14, 18) (14, 16)
Node 15: (15, 0) (15, 1)
Node 16: (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 9)
Node 17: (17, 4) (17, 2) (17, 9) (17, 5)
Node 18: (18, 14)
Node 19: (19, 4) (19, 13)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 10 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 13 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 16 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star
Node 17 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 31

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 10, 15)>
<3, (0, 6, 12)>
<4, (7, 10, 17)>
<6, (1, 3, 12)>
<10, (0, 13, 4)>
<17, (2, 5, 9)>
