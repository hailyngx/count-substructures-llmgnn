Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 4) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 7, 11, 4}
- Node 2: {10, 11, 14, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 12, 4}
- Node 4: {6, 1, 3, 13}
- Node 5: {12, 1, 0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 0, 2, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {11, 13, 7}
- Node 9: {6, 13}
- Node 10: {11, 0, 14, 2}
- Node 11: {10, 1, 8, 14, 2}
- Node 12: {13, 5, 0, 3}
- Node 13: {9, 8, 4, 12}
- Node 14: {10, 11, 2}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
Node 0, Node 1, Node 5, Node 7, Node 11, and Node 12 have 5 or more neighbors, thus they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].
