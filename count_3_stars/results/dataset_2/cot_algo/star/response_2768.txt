Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 10) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 19) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (5, 3) (5, 18) (6, 17) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 9) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 18) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 4) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 9) (12, 8) (12, 0) (18, 5) (18, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 16) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 19) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {7, 12, 16, 19}
- Node 1: {4, 13, 15}
- Node 2: {3, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 10}
- Node 4: {1, 14, 16}
- Node 5: {3, 18}
- Node 6: {17}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 8, 14, 18}
- Node 8: {7, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {11, 13, 16, 19}
- Node 10: {3, 11, 13, 15}
- Node 11: {9, 10, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 8}
- Node 13: {1, 9, 10}
- Node 14: {4, 7, 8, 11, 17}
- Node 15: {1, 10}
- Node 16: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 17: {6, 14, 19}
- Node 18: {5, 7}
- Node 19: {0, 9, 17}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 15, 18
    - Total 3-stars: 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (2, 5, 10)>
<5, (3, 18, 7)>
<6, (17, 14, 19)>
<15, (1, 10, 13)>
<18, (5, 7, 18)>
