Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: 6, 3, 5, 4, 8
- Node 2: 9, 3, 5, 7, 4
- Node 3: 1, 7, 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 2
- Node 5: 1, 3, 2, 4
- Node 6: 9, 1, 0
- Node 7: 3, 0, 8, 2
- Node 8: 1, 3, 0, 7
- Node 9: 6, 2

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

There are no other nodes with three or more neighbors, so the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 44 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [44] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 4)>, and <3, (0, 8, 7)>.
