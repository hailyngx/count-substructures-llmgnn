Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 0) (16, 14) (16, 10) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 3) (1, 6) (1, 18) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 12) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 17) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 9) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 16) (14, 8) (14, 19) (2, 3) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 18) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 10) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 18) (18, 1) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 10) 

Response:
With the given graph information:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 11, 12, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 18.
- Node 2 is connected to node 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 15, 9, and 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 10.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 17, 10, 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 9, 17, 19.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 5, 14.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 16, 6, 4, 19, 18.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 0.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 13, 7, 0, 18, 9.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 12.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 16, 8, 19.
- Node 15 is connected to node 3.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 14, 10.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 7, 6, 19, 18.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 1, 12, 17, 10.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 7, 14, 17, 10.

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, 17, 18, and 19.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 12: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 18: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 19: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 38.

Therefore, the final answer is [38].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 12, 18>, <10, 16, 14>, <3, 15, 9>, <6, 17, 10>, <7, 12, 9>, <1, 6, 18>, <7, 17, 19>, <6, 4, 10>, <17, 6, 1>, <18, 17, 10>.
