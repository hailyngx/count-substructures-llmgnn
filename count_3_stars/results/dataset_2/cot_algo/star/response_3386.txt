Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 23) (1, 27) (21, 13) (21, 27) (21, 11) (4, 28) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 20) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 8) (2, 22) (2, 16) (29, 28) (8, 7) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 12) (8, 22) (23, 1) (23, 8) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 12) (20, 7) (20, 0) (20, 24) (20, 10) (26, 1) (26, 27) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 25) (6, 22) (6, 12) (28, 4) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 19) (18, 7) (18, 13) (22, 2) (22, 8) (22, 0) (22, 6) (22, 3) (3, 22) (17, 12) (17, 27) (9, 25) (9, 15) (25, 6) (25, 9) (25, 15) (13, 21) (13, 18) (13, 12) (13, 14) (24, 8) (24, 20) (19, 7) (19, 28) (19, 14) (19, 16) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 25) (15, 5) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 13) (27, 1) (27, 21) (27, 26) (27, 17) (10, 20) (10, 6) (10, 5) (16, 2) (16, 19) (14, 13) (14, 19) (5, 15) (5, 10) (11, 21) (11, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {20, 22, 12}
- Node 1: {26, 23, 27}
- Node 2: {22, 16}
- Node 3: {22}
- Node 4: {28, 11, 15}
- Node 5: {15, 10}
- Node 6: {28, 10, 25, 22, 12}
- Node 7: {20, 19, 18, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 23, 24, 12, 22}
- Node 9: {25, 15}
- Node 10: {20, 6, 5}
- Node 11: {21, 4}
- Node 12: {8, 0, 6, 17, 13}
- Node 13: {21, 18, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {13, 19}
- Node 15: {4, 9, 25, 5}
- Node 16: {2, 19}
- Node 17: {12, 27}
- Node 18: {7, 13}
- Node 19: {7, 28, 14, 16}
- Node 20: {7, 0, 24, 10}
- Node 21: {13, 27, 11}
- Node 22: {2, 8, 0, 6, 3}
- Node 23: {1, 8}
- Node 24: {20, 8}
- Node 25: {6, 9, 15}
- Node 26: {1, 27}
- Node 27: {21, 26, 17}
- Node 28: {4, 29, 6, 19}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. 
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.  
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. 
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 0 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 0 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].
