Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be found as follows:

1. For node 1, neighbors: {9, 10}, no 3-star.
2. For node 2, neighbors: {6, 7}, no 3-star.
3. For node 3, neighbors: {4, 7, 9, 18}, 1 combination possible, so 1 3-star.
4. For node 4, neighbors: {3, 8, 21, 22, 23}, 1 combination possible, so 1 3-star.
5. For node 5, neighbors: {18}, no 3-star.
6. For node 6, neighbors: {2}, no 3-star.
7. For node 7, neighbors: {2, 3, 8}, no 3-star.
8. For node 8, neighbors: {3, 4, 7, 15, 19, 20}, 1 combination possible, so 1 3-star.
9. For node 9, neighbors: {1, 3, 29}, no 3-star.
10. For node 10, neighbors: {1}, no 3-star.
11. For node 11, neighbors: {13, 17, 25, 26, 27}, 1 combination possible, so 1 3-star.
12. For node 12, neighbors: {13, 16}, no 3-star.
13. For node 13, neighbors: {11, 12, 19, 21}, 1 combination possible, so 1 3-star.
14. For node 14, neighbors: {17, 18, 23}, 1 combination possible, so 1 3-star.
15. For node 15, neighbors: {8, 17, 23}, no 3-star.
16. For node 16, neighbors: {12}, no 3-star.
17. For node 17, neighbors: {11, 14, 15}, no 3-star.
18. For node 18, neighbors: {5, 13, 14, 19, 26}, 1 combination possible, so 1 3-star.
19. For node 19, neighbors: {8, 13, 18, 21}, 1 combination possible, so 1 3-star.
20. For node 20, neighbors: {8, 23, 26}, no 3-star.
21. For node 21, neighbors: {0, 4, 13, 19}, 1 combination possible, so 1 3-star.
22. For node 22, neighbors: {4, 26, 28}, no 3-star.
23. For node 23, neighbors: {4, 14, 15, 18, 20}, 1 combination possible, so 1 3-star.
24. For node 24, neighbors: {29}, no 3-star.
25. For node 25, neighbors: {11, 27, 29}, no 3-star.
26. For node 26, neighbors: {11, 18, 20, 22, 28}, 1 combination possible, so 1 3-star.
27. For node 27, neighbors: {25, 29, 11}, no 3-star.
28. For node 28, neighbors: {22, 26}, no 3-star.
29. For node 29, neighbors: {9, 24, 25, 27}, no 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
