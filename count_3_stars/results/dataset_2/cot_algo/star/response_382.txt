Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 7) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 5) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 16) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (19, 11) (19, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 9) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 16) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 18) (7, 13) (7, 10) (7, 5) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 18) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 11) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 18) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 0) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 9, 15}
- Node 2: {5, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {0, 14, 18, 19}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 16}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7, 17}
- Node 6: {0, 1}
- Node 7: {5, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {4, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 11}
- Node 10: {2, 7, 17}
- Node 11: {2, 9, 19}
- Node 12: {8, 17, 18}
- Node 13: {7, 8, 15}
- Node 14: {3, 8}
- Node 15: {1, 13, 16}
- Node 16: {4, 15, 18}
- Node 17: {5, 10, 12}
- Node 18: {3, 12, 16}
- Node 19: {3, 11}

Now, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: Node 3, Node 5, and Node 8.

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed.
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed.
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12. 

Therefore, the final answer is [12], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (0, 14, 18)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <8, (4, 12, 13)>
