Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 4, 7
Node 1: 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 2: 3, 6, 7
Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 7
Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
Node 5: 1, 4, 7, 9
Node 6: 1, 2, 8
Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9
Node 8: 4, 6, 9
Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8

Now, for each node that has three or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 48.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
