Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 3) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 8) (17, 9) (17, 18) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 18) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 16) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 1) (16, 14) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (1, 19) (1, 2) (1, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 4) (15, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 18) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 4) (9, 10) (9, 17) (9, 16) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 6) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {14, 19}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 19}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 11}
- Node 3: {4, 10, 13, 16}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 11}
- Node 5: {2, 19}
- Node 6: {2, 10, 18}
- Node 7: {12, 14, 15}
- Node 8: {11, 13, 17}
- Node 9: {10, 16, 17}
- Node 10: {3, 6, 9, 19}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 12: {7, 18}
- Node 13: {3, 8}
- Node 14: {0, 7, 16}
- Node 15: {7}
- Node 16: {3, 9, 14, 18}
- Node 17: {8, 9, 18}
- Node 18: {6, 12, 16, 17}
- Node 19: {0, 1, 5, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars associated with them:

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 19)>, <2, (1, 6, 10)>, <3, (4, 10, 16)>, <4, (1, 3, 11)>, <10, (3, 6, 19)>,  
<11, (2, 8, 4)>, <14, (0, 7, 16)>, <16, (3, 9, 14)>, <17, (8, 9, 18)>, <18, (6, 12, 16)>, <19, (1, 5, 10)>.
