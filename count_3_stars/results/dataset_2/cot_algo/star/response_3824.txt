Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 2) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 19) (19, 5) (19, 11) (8, 9) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 18) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 16) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 7) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 0) (6, 15) (6, 14) (4, 15) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 1) (18, 10) (18, 13) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges provided, let's first identify all the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 10}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 15}
- Node 3: {15}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 15}
- Node 5: {4, 9, 16, 19}
- Node 6: {5, 14, 15}
- Node 7: {11, 16, 17}
- Node 8: {9}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 11, 18}
- Node 11: {7, 10, 19}
- Node 12: {0, 9}
- Node 13: {9, 14, 16, 17, 18}
- Node 14: {6, 13, 15, 17}
- Node 15: {2, 3, 4, 6, 14}
- Node 16: {5, 7, 13, 17}
- Node 17: {7, 13, 14, 16}
- Node 18: {10, 13}
- Node 19: {5, 11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 14, which is represented as [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <13, (9, 14, 16)>
- <16, (5, 7, 13)>
