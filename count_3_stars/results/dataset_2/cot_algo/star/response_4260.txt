Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [49].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
