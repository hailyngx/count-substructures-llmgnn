Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors, forming 10 unique 3-stars
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, forming 4 unique 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 neighbors, forming 4 unique 3-stars
- Node 4: 3 neighbors, forming 1 unique 3-star
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, forming 4 unique 3-stars
- Node 6: 5 neighbors, forming 10 unique 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 neighbors, forming 4 unique 3-stars
- Node 8: 5 neighbors, forming 10 unique 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, forming 4 unique 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 51

Therefore, the final answer is [51], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
