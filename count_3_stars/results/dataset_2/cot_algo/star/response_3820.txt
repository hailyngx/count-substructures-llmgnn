Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 1) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 14) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 9, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 13, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 10: {3, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {6, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 14: {0, 4, 5, 10, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 7, and 12 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 2, 4, and 14 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form 10 3-stars each.
- Node 1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 13 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \), so the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 2, 12>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <7, 9, 12>
- <7, 9, 13>
- <7, 12, 13>
- <2, 9, 12>
- <2, 9, 14>
- <2, 12, 14>
- <4, 9, 14>
- <4, 14, 10>
- <9, 10, 14>
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 7>
-<12, 14, 2>
-<12, 14, 4>
-<12, 14, 10>
-<12, 14, 0>
-<12, 14, 5>
