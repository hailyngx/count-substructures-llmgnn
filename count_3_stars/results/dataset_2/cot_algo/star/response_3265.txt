This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 4) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 10) (27, 28) (18, 22) (18, 21) (18, 1) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 20) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 2) (17, 11) (29, 27) (29, 17) (29, 23) (29, 14) (9, 16) (9, 23) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 22) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 15) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 24) (13, 5) (13, 25) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 20) (20, 22) (20, 1) (20, 6) (23, 29) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 28) (8, 14) (8, 26) (19, 21) (25, 13) (25, 12) (25, 28) (28, 27) (28, 23) (28, 25) (28, 15) (6, 20) (6, 15) (24, 5) (26, 5) (26, 8) (26, 14) (7, 16) (7, 14) (16, 9) (16, 7) (16, 12) (12, 25) (12, 16) (14, 29) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 7) (14, 2) (2, 0) (2, 17) (2, 14) (4, 0) (4, 21) (21, 0) (21, 18) (21, 19) (21, 4) (10, 27) (10, 3) (10, 15) (15, 11) (15, 28) (15, 6) (15, 10) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Based on the provided edge list, the graph can be represented as follows:

```
Graph G {
    0 -- 27 -- 29 -- 17 -- 1 -- 18 -- 22 -- 20 -- 6 -- 15 -- 10 -- 3 -- 11
    2 -- 4 -- 21
    5 -- 13 -- 25 -- 12 -- 16 -- 9
                |         |         |
                26 -- 8         23 -- 28 -- 19
                |
                24
    7 -- 16 -- 14
}
```

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 17, 14): 
    - Number of 3-stars formed at node 2 = 1 (3 neighbors choose 3)
    - Unique 3-star at node 2: <2, (0, 17, 14)>

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (10, 11, 15): 
    - Number of 3-stars formed at node 3 = 1 (3 neighbors choose 3)
    - Unique 3-star at node 3: <3, (10, 11, 15)>

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (13, 24, 26): 
    - Number of 3-stars formed at node 5 = 1 (3 neighbors choose 3)
    - Unique 3-star at node 5: <5, (13, 24, 26)>

- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (14, 26, 28): 
    - Number of 3-stars formed at node 8 = 1 (3 neighbors choose 3)
    - Unique 3-star at node 8: <8, (14, 26, 28)>

- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (12, 16, 23): 
    - Number of 3-stars formed at node 9 = 1 (3 neighbors choose 3)
    - Unique 3-star at node 9: <9, (12, 16, 23)>

- Node 14 has 5 neighbors (2, 7, 8, 26, 29): 
    - Number of 3-stars formed at node 14 = 10 (5 neighbors choose 3)
    - Unique 3-stars at node 14: <14, (2, 7, 26)>, <14, (2, 7, 29)>, <14, (2, 8, 26)>, <14, (2, 8, 29)>, <14, (2, 26, 29)>, <14, (7, 8, 26)>, <14, (7, 8, 29)>, <14, (7, 26, 29)>, <14, (8, 26, 29)>, <14, (2, 26, 29)>

- Node 15 has 4 neighbors (6, 10, 11, 28): 
    - Number of 3-stars formed at node 15 = 4 (4 neighbors choose 3)
    - Unique 3-stars at node 15: <15, (6, 10, 11)>, <15, (6, 10, 28)>, <15, (6, 11, 28)>, <15, (10, 11, 28)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
