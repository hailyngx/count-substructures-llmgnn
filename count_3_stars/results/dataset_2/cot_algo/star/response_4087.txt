Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 28) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (21, 0) (21, 27) (21, 4) (21, 11) (6, 14) (6, 18) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 21) (4, 20) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 25) (7, 24) (18, 6) (18, 22) (18, 29) (22, 18) (22, 5) (14, 6) (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 26) (5, 22) (5, 13) (2, 8) (2, 27) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (29, 18) (26, 17) (26, 3) (26, 27) (28, 1) (28, 19) (28, 20) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 10) (25, 7) (25, 12) (12, 25) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 23) (15, 4) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 17) (0, 8) (23, 16) (23, 10) (23, 20) (27, 21) (27, 14) (27, 2) (27, 26) (27, 24) (19, 14) (19, 28) (24, 7) (24, 27) (24, 20) (3, 9) (3, 26) (20, 4) (20, 28) (20, 23) (20, 24) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 23) (11, 21) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) 

Response:
Based on the provided graph, the neighbors for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: {1, 8, 17, 21}
- Node 1: {0, 8, 13, 28}
- Node 2: {8, 10, 11, 27}
- Node 3: {9, 13, 26}
- Node 4: {11, 15, 20, 21}
- Node 5: {13, 22}
- Node 6: {14, 18}
- Node 7: {24, 25}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 10}
- Node 9: {3, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {2, 8, 13, 23}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 9, 21}
- Node 12: {16, 25}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 9, 10}
- Node 14: {6, 17, 19, 27}
- Node 15: {4}
- Node 16: {12, 23}
- Node 17: {0, 14, 26}
- Node 18: {6, 22, 29}
- Node 19: {14, 28}
- Node 20: {4, 23, 24, 28}
- Node 21: {0, 4, 11, 27}
- Node 22: {5, 18}
- Node 23: {10, 16, 20}
- Node 24: {7, 20, 27}
- Node 25: {7, 12}
- Node 26: {3, 17, 27}
- Node 27: {2, 14, 21, 24, 26}
- Node 28: {1, 19, 20}
- Node 29: {18}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {8, 13, 28} <1, (8, 13, 28)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {11, 21, 27} <4, (11, 21, 27)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 1, 10} <8, (0, 1, 10)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 13, 23} <10, (2, 13, 23)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 9, 21} <11, (4, 9, 21)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors {17, 19, 27} <14, (17, 19, 27)>
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with neighbors {23, 24, 28} <20, (23, 24, 28)>
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with neighbors {21, 24, 26} <27, (21, 24, 26)>

Counting up the total number of 3-stars gives us [8].
