Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 7) (16, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 16) (7, 2) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 13) (15, 4) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 13) (10, 14) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 14) (19, 13) (19, 12) (18, 10) (18, 17) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 8) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 15) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 17) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 10) (13, 19) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0:  Neighbors = {5, 2}
Node 1:  Neighbors = {6, 3, 15, 14, 4}
Node 2:  Neighbors = {0, 7, 17, 11}
Node 3:  Neighbors = {1, 14}
Node 4:  Neighbors = {9, 1, 15, 5}
Node 5:  Neighbors = {0, 4}
Node 6:  Neighbors = {1, 8}
Node 7:  Neighbors = {16, 2}
Node 8:  Neighbors = {6, 16, 14}
Node 9:  Neighbors = {4, 13}
Node 10:  Neighbors = {15, 18, 13, 14}
Node 11:  Neighbors = {13, 12, 2}
Node 12:  Neighbors = {11, 19, 17}
Node 13:  Neighbors = {11, 9, 15, 10, 19}
Node 14:  Neighbors = {1, 3, 10, 8}
Node 15:  Neighbors = {1, 13, 10, 4}
Node 16:  Neighbors = {7, 8}
Node 17:  Neighbors = {2, 12, 18}
Node 18:  Neighbors = {10, 17}
Node 19:  Neighbors = {13, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

Now, we calculate the 3-stars for these nodes:

- For node 1, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 4, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 8, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 10, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 11, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 12, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 13, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 14, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 15, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 39

Therefore, the final answer is [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 3, 14>, <1, 4, 15>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 10, 13>, <1, 10, 14>, <1, 13, 15>, <1, 13, 19>, <1, 14, 8>, <1, 15, 4>, <1, 15, 10>, <4, 5, 0>, <4, 9, 13>, <4, 13, 15>, <4, 15, 10>, <8, 14, 1>, <8, 14, 10>, <10, 13, 15>, <11, 12, 17>, <12, 17, 2>, <13, 15, 10>.
