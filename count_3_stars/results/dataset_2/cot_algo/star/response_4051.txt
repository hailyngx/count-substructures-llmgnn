Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 9) (1, 15) (1, 11) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 17) (18, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 8) (14, 7) (17, 18) (17, 16) (17, 11) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 13) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 16) (12, 4) (12, 5) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 5) (19, 11) (5, 18) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (16, 2) (16, 17) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 6) (10, 4) (10, 16) (13, 18) (13, 15) (6, 16) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {8}
- Node 1: {11, 15}
- Node 2: {3, 8, 16, 18}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 10, 12, 15}
- Node 5: {8, 11, 12, 18}
- Node 6: {16}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 9, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 8, 16}
- Node 10: {4, 16}
- Node 11: {1, 5, 17, 19}
- Node 12: {4, 5}
- Node 13: {15, 18}
- Node 14: {7}
- Node 15: {1, 4, 13}
- Node 16: {2, 9, 10, 17, 6}
- Node 17: {11, 16, 18}
- Node 18: {2, 5, 13, 17}
- Node 19: {11}

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18.

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{9}{3} + \binom{11}{3} + \binom{15}{3} + \binom{16}{3} + \binom{17}{3} + \binom{18}{3} = 0 + 1 + 35 + 84 + 165 + 455 + 560 + 680 + 816 = 2796 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2796].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <4, (7, 8, 10)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (3, 7, 16)>
- <16, (2, 9, 17)>
- <17, (11, 16, 18)>
