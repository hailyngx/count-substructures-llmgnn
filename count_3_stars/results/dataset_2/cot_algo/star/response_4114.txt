Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 12) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 0) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 0) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {9, 2, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 5, 13}
- Node 2: {6, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 3: {7, 2, 8}
- Node 4: {10, 1, 11}
- Node 5: {6, 1, 13, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 1, 2, 11, 12}
- Node 7: {3, 14, 13}
- Node 8: {9, 3, 2, 12}
- Node 9: {0, 13, 6, 8}
- Node 10: {4, 5, 0}
- Node 11: {4, 6, 12}
- Node 12: {6, 8, 14, 11}
- Node 13: {7, 9, 1, 5, 0}
- Node 14: {7, 5, 12, 0}

Nodes 0, 6, 13, and 14 have 5 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives: 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (9, 14, 2)>
- <0, (9, 13, 5)>
- <0, (9, 13, 14)>
- <0, (9, 6, 2)>
- <0, (9, 6, 13)>
- <0, (2, 10, 14)>
- <0, (13, 5, 10)>
- <6, (9, 1, 5)>
- <6, (9, 1, 13)>
- <6, (5, 1, 13)>
- <6, (2, 8, 3)>
- <6, (2, 12, 8)>
- <6, (11, 4, 12)>
- <6, (11, 12, 4)>
- <13, (7, 9, 1)>
- <13, (7, 9, 5)>
- <13, (7, 1, 5)>
- <14, (7, 12, 5)>
