Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 4) (8, 16) (8, 9) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 3) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 1) (14, 15) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 13) (17, 1) (17, 18) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 16) (2, 7) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 3) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 3) (5, 0) (5, 4) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 19) (15, 18) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 5) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are given below:

1: 14
2: 16, 7
3: 13, 0, 12, 7
4: 6, 9, 10, 0, 5
5: 0, 4
6: 16, 9, 4
7: 19, 2, 3
8: 16, 9
9: 6, 8, 13, 4, 15
10: 11, 18, 4
11: 10
12: 0, 19, 3
13: 9, 17, 3
14: 1, 15
15: 9, 14, 19, 18
16: 8, 2, 6
17: 13, 1, 18
18: 10, 17, 15
19: 15, 7, 12

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (6, 9, 10)>
<9, (6, 8, 13)>
<15, (9, 14, 19)>
<3, (0, 13, 12)>
