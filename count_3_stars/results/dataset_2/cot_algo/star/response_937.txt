Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 6) (22, 3) (12, 27) (12, 18) (12, 17) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 5) (8, 17) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 25) (5, 28) (6, 22) (6, 5) (6, 11) (2, 18) (2, 26) (13, 18) (13, 26) (26, 2) (26, 13) (26, 20) (26, 0) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 7) (10, 3) (10, 29) (16, 28) (28, 8) (28, 5) (28, 16) (28, 9) (28, 14) (3, 22) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 24) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (21, 19) (21, 17) (24, 1) (24, 3) (24, 29) (11, 6) (11, 19) (11, 25) (19, 21) (19, 11) (19, 17) (20, 26) (20, 23) (0, 18) (0, 26) (0, 23) (9, 28) (9, 7) (9, 14) (14, 28) (14, 9) (25, 15) (25, 5) (25, 11) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 21) (17, 19) (29, 15) (29, 10) (29, 24) (23, 27) (23, 20) (23, 0) 

Response:
The first step is to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {18, 26, 23}
- Node 1: {15, 24, 7}
- Node 2: {18, 26}
- Node 3: {22, 10, 7, 24}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {8, 6, 25, 28}
- Node 6: {22, 5, 11}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 28, 17}
- Node 9: {7, 28, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 29}
- Node 11: {6, 19, 25}
- Node 12: {27, 18, 17}
- Node 13: {18, 26}
- Node 14: {28, 9}
- Node 15: {1, 27, 25, 29}
- Node 16: {28}
- Node 17: {8, 19, 12, 21}
- Node 18: {22, 2, 12, 13, 0}
- Node 19: {21, 11, 17}
- Node 20: {26, 23}
- Node 21: {19, 17}
- Node 22: {18, 6, 3}
- Node 23: {27, 20, 0}
- Node 24: {1, 3, 29}
- Node 25: {15, 5, 11}
- Node 26: {2, 13, 20, 0}
- Node 27: {15, 12, 23}
- Node 28: {8, 16, 5, 9, 14}
- Node 29: {15, 10, 24}

We can now calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.

Adding them up, we get a total of 49 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [49].
