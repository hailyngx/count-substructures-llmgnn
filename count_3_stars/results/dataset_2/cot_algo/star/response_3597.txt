Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 10, 13}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 11, 13, 6}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 10, 8, 3}
- Node 3: {9, 7, 13, 12, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 14, 11}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 12, 1, 4}
- Node 6: {7, 14, 1}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 6, 2}
- Node 8: {13, 2}
- Node 9: {5, 14, 3, 1, 0}
- Node 10: {11, 0, 12, 2}
- Node 11: {4, 10, 1, 13}
- Node 12: {5, 10, 3}
- Node 13: {8, 11, 3, 1, 0}
- Node 14: {9, 4, 6}

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 58

Therefore, the final answer is [58], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 9, 11)>
<3, (9, 7, 13)>
<4, (5, 7, 4)>
<5, (9, 2, 3)>
<9, (5, 14, 9)>
<10, (11, 0, 10)>
<13, (8, 11, 13)>
