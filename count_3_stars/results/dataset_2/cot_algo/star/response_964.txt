Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 22) (9, 2) (9, 20) (9, 23) (0, 28) (0, 21) (27, 14) (27, 11) (27, 20) (10, 17) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 21) (29, 17) (29, 20) (29, 6) (4, 1) (18, 24) (21, 0) (21, 17) (28, 0) (28, 2) (24, 18) (24, 26) (24, 3) (24, 8) (26, 24) (26, 16) (3, 17) (3, 24) (3, 16) (3, 13) (11, 27) (11, 22) (11, 25) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 23) (20, 9) (20, 27) (20, 29) (12, 16) (12, 25) (12, 22) (12, 15) (16, 17) (16, 26) (16, 3) (16, 12) (7, 10) (7, 19) (7, 15) (15, 12) (15, 7) (15, 2) (6, 29) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (14, 27) (14, 6) (14, 22) (22, 5) (22, 11) (22, 12) (22, 14) (2, 9) (2, 28) (2, 15) (2, 25) (8, 24) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 6) (23, 9) (23, 19) (23, 25) (23, 1) (25, 11) (25, 12) (25, 2) (25, 23) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 23) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, we will first list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {28, 21}
- Node 1: {4, 19, 23}
- Node 2: {9, 28, 15, 25}
- Node 3: {17, 24, 16, 13}
- Node 4: {1}
- Node 5: {19, 22}
- Node 6: {29, 14, 8, 13}
- Node 7: {10, 19, 15}
- Node 8: {24, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 20, 23}
- Node 10: {17, 7}
- Node 11: {27, 22, 25}
- Node 12: {16, 25, 22, 15}
- Node 13: {3, 6}
- Node 14: {27, 6, 22}
- Node 15: {12, 7, 2}
- Node 16: {17, 26, 3, 12}
- Node 17: {10, 29, 3, 16, 21}
- Node 18: {24}
- Node 19: {5, 7, 1, 23}
- Node 20: {9, 27, 29}
- Node 21: {0, 17}
- Node 22: {5, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 23: {9, 19, 25, 1}
- Node 24: {18, 26, 3, 8}
- Node 25: {2, 12, 23, 11}
- Node 26: {24, 16}
- Node 27: {14, 11, 20}
- Node 28: {0, 2}
- Node 29: {17, 20, 6}

Now we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, 17, 22, 23, and 25 have three or more neighbors.

For these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars for node 2
- \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars for node 3
- \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars for node 6
- \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star for node 9
- \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars for node 12
- \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars for node 16
- \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars for node 17
- \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars for node 22
- \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars for node 23
- \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars for node 25

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 39\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (9, 15, 25)>
- <3, (17, 16, 24)>
- <6, (29, 8, 13)>
- <9, (2, 20, 23)>
- <12, (16, 22, 25)>
- <16, (17, 3, 26)>
- <17, (10, 29, 21)>
- <22, (5, 11, 14)>
- <23, (19, 25, 1)>
- <25, (11, 12, 23)>
