Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 18) (6, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (3, 8) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 17) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 15) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 11) (17, 12) (10, 15) (10, 1) (15, 8) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 16) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 19) (7, 9) (7, 1) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 16) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 17) (18, 6) (18, 13) (18, 1) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 18) (2, 15) (2, 16) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 12, 14, 16}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 10, 14, 18}
- Node 2: {15, 16}
- Node 3: {8}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 9, 12}
- Node 6: {4, 18}
- Node 7: {1, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 9, 11, 15}
- Node 9: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 10: {1, 15}
- Node 11: {8, 13, 17, 19}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 17}
- Node 13: {11, 18, 19}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 15: {2, 8, 10, 16}
- Node 16: {0, 2, 15, 19}
- Node 17: {11, 12}
- Node 18: {6, 13, 1}
- Node 19: {11, 13, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars each node participates in:

- Node 0: Participates in 1 3-star
- Node 1: Participates in 1 3-star
- Node 2: Does not participate in any 3-star
- Node 3: Does not participate in any 3-star
- Node 4: Participates in 1 3-star
- Node 5: Does not participate in any 3-star
- Node 6: Does not participate in any 3-star
- Node 7: Does not participate in any 3-star
- Node 8: Participates in 1 3-star
- Node 9: Does not participate in any 3-star
- Node 10: Does not participate in any 3-star
- Node 11: Does not participate in any 3-star
- Node 12: Does not participate in any 3-star
- Node 13: Does not participate in any 3-star
- Node 14: Does not participate in any 3-star
- Node 15: Does not participate in any 3-star
- Node 16: Does not participate in any 3-star
- Node 17: Does not participate in any 3-star
- Node 18: Does not participate in any 3-star
- Node 19: Does not participate in any 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 12, 14)> <1, (5, 7, 14)> <4, (0, 6, 14)> <8, (9, 11, 15)>.
