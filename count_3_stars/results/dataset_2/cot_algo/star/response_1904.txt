Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 10) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 11) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 8, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 2: {3, 9, 11}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 6, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 12}
- Node 7: {5, 8, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 7, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 10}
- Node 12: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 13: {8, 9, 10}
- Node 14: {0, 4, 5, 7}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the final answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (3, 7, 14)>
<5, (6, 7, 14)>
<5, (9, 7, 14)>
<5, (9, 9, 13)>
<5, (9, 12, 13)>
<8, (1, 10, 13)>
<8, (3, 7, 14)>
<8, (3, 8, 10)>
<8, (3, 9, 10)>
<8, (7, 8, 14)>
<8, (9, 12, 13)>
<9, (8, 9, 13)>
<9, (8, 9, 13)>
<9, (9, 12, 13)>
