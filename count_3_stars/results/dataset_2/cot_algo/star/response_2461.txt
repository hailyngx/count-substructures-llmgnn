Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 23) (9, 6) (9, 21) (14, 28) (14, 29) (17, 11) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 26) (23, 6) (23, 8) (23, 18) (23, 7) (23, 28) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 27) (2, 4) (18, 23) (18, 2) (18, 28) (18, 25) (15, 20) (15, 16) (15, 12) (15, 4) (20, 8) (20, 15) (20, 22) (20, 16) (20, 19) (24, 26) (24, 11) (26, 8) (26, 24) (26, 25) (28, 14) (28, 23) (28, 18) (16, 15) (16, 20) (21, 9) (21, 0) (21, 27) (12, 2) (12, 15) (12, 29) (12, 3) (11, 17) (11, 24) (11, 1) (11, 7) (19, 20) (19, 22) (19, 4) (19, 13) (22, 20) (22, 19) (1, 11) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 10) (29, 14) (29, 12) (29, 1) (7, 6) (7, 23) (7, 11) (7, 5) (0, 21) (25, 18) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 10) (4, 2) (4, 15) (4, 19) (27, 2) (27, 21) (27, 13) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 25) (10, 13) (5, 7) (13, 19) (13, 27) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {21}
Node 1: {11, 25, 29}
Node 2: {4, 12, 18, 27}
Node 3: {12}
Node 4: {2, 15, 19}
Node 5: {7}
Node 6: {7, 9, 23}
Node 7: {5, 6, 11, 23}
Node 8: {20, 23, 26}
Node 9: {6, 21}
Node 10: {1, 13, 25}
Node 11: {1, 7, 17, 24}
Node 12: {2, 3, 15, 29}
Node 13: {10, 19, 27}
Node 14: {28, 29}
Node 15: {2, 4, 12, 16, 20}
Node 16: {15, 20}
Node 17: {11}
Node 18: {2, 23, 25, 28}
Node 19: {4, 13, 19, 20}
Node 20: {8, 15, 16, 19, 22}
Node 21: {0, 9, 27}
Node 22: {19, 20}
Node 23: {6, 7, 8, 18, 28}
Node 24: {11, 26}
Node 25: {1, 10, 18, 25}
Node 26: {8, 24, 25}
Node 27: {2, 13, 21}
Node 28: {14, 18, 23}
Node 29: {1, 12, 14}

Next, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 1: [1]
Node 2: [0]
Node 4: [0]
Node 7: [0]
Node 11: [0]
Node 12: [0]
Node 13: [0]
Node 15: [1]
Node 18: [1]
Node 19: [0]
Node 20: [1]
Node 23: [4]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 11, 7>
<2, 18, 23>
<4, 19, 20>
<7, 6, 23>
<11, 1, 7>
<12, 2, 15>
<15, 4, 20>
<18, 23, 28>
