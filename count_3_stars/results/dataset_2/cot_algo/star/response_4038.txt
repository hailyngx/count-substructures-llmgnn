Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 12) (16, 25) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 28) (7, 0) (7, 22) (6, 28) (6, 26) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 10) (1, 15) (1, 22) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 24) (3, 23) (3, 29) (12, 16) (12, 1) (12, 27) (12, 2) (27, 12) (27, 23) (28, 4) (28, 6) (28, 25) (17, 11) (17, 9) (17, 29) (17, 5) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 15) (29, 22) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (15, 1) (15, 29) (15, 10) (15, 23) (15, 14) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 21) (8, 18) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 24) (10, 23) (19, 8) (19, 2) (5, 17) (5, 2) (26, 6) (26, 2) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 5) (2, 26) (24, 3) (24, 10) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 20) (14, 13) (20, 14) (20, 21) (23, 3) (23, 27) (23, 15) (23, 10) (21, 8) (21, 20) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 25) (25, 16) (25, 28) (25, 13) (18, 8) (22, 7) (22, 1) (22, 29) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbor sets:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {12, 15, 22}
- Node 2: {5, 12, 19, 26}
- Node 3: {14, 23, 24, 29}
- Node 4: {0, 13, 28}
- Node 5: {2, 17}
- Node 6: {0, 26, 28}
- Node 7: {0, 22}
- Node 8: {9, 11, 18, 19, 21}
- Node 9: {8, 10, 17}
- Node 10: {9, 15, 23, 24}
- Node 11: {8, 17}
- Node 12: {1, 2, 16, 27}
- Node 13: {4, 14, 25}
- Node 14: {3, 13, 15, 20}
- Node 15: {1, 10, 14, 22, 23, 29}
- Node 16: {12, 25}
- Node 17: {5, 9, 11, 29}
- Node 18: {8}
- Node 19: {2, 8}
- Node 20: {14, 21}
- Node 21: {8, 20}
- Node 22: {1, 7, 29}
- Node 23: {3, 10, 15, 27}
- Node 24: {3, 10}
- Node 25: {13, 16, 28}
- Node 26: {2, 6}
- Node 27: {12, 23}
- Node 28: {4, 6, 25}
- Node 29: {3, 15, 17, 22}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 2, 4, 6, 7 have 3 or more neighbors, so we calculate \( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} = 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 6 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 4, 6, 7>
- <2, 12, 19, 26>
- <4, 0, 13, 28>
- <6, 0, 26, 28>
- <7, 0, 22>
- <7, 22, 29>
