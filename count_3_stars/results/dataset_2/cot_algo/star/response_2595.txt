Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 10) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 9, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {7, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {9, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {8, 10, 12}
- Node 6: {1, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {3, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {5, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 10: {5, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 4, 6, 10}
- Node 14: {4, 6, 8, 10}

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:

- In Node 1, we have 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations. The 3-star configurations are <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 12)>, <1, (0, 9, 12)>, and <1, (2, 9, 12)>.
- In Node 4, we have 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star configurations. The 3-star configurations are <4, (9, 12, 13)>, <4, (9, 12, 14)>, <4, (9, 13, 14)>, and <4, (12, 13, 14)>.
- In Node 6, we have 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star configuration can be formed: <6, (1, 13, 14)>.
- In Node 9, we have 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star configurations. The 3-star configurations are <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, and <9, (2, 4, 7)>.

The total number of 3-star configurations is 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 19. Therefore, the final number to put inside brackets is [19].
