Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 3) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 3) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 7) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 11) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 5) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 10) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 3) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 12
- Node 1: 0, 6, 10, 11, 12, 14
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 7, 12
- Node 4: 0, 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 7, 10
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5, 10, 11
- Node 8: 12, 13, 14
- Node 9: 4, 6, 10, 13
- Node 10: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 11: 1, 7, 13, 14
- Node 12: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 13: 8, 9, 11, 14
- Node 14: 1, 8, 11, 13

Let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors, so it forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: 6 neighbors, so it forms 6C3 = 20 3-stars
- Node 3: 5 neighbors, so it forms 5C3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star
- Node 5: 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, so it forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 neighbors, so it forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, so it forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 10: 4 neighbors, so it forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 11: 4 neighbors, so it forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 4 neighbors, so it forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: 4 neighbors, so it forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 14: 4 neighbors, so it forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 62

Therefore, the final answer is [62]. Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, 1, 12>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 14>, <3, 0, 12>, <3, 0, 4>, <3, 0, 1>, <3, 0, 12>, <3, 2, 5>, <4, 0, 1>, <4, 0, 12>, <4, 0, 3>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 2, 7>, <6, 1, 4>, <6, 1, 9>, <6, 1, 2>, <6, 2, 5>, <7, 3, 5>, <7, 3, 10>, <7, 3, 11>, <7, 10, 5>, <9, 4, 6>, <9, 4, 10>, <9, 4, 13>, <10, 1, 7>, <10, 1, 9>, <10, 1, 5>, <10, 5, 7>, <11, 1, 7>, <11, 1, 13>, <11, 1, 14>, <11, 7, 13>, <12, 0, 1>, <12, 0, 3>, <12, 0, 4>, <12, 3, 7>, <13, 8, 14>, <13, 9, 4>, <13, 9, 10>, <13, 14, 8>, <14, 1, 11>, <14, 1, 13>, <14, 1, 8>, <14, 11, 13>
