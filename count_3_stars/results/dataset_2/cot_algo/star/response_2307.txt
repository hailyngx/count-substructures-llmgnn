Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 16) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (21, 3) (21, 22) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 22) (6, 13) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 25) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 10) (17, 6) (17, 20) (17, 28) (17, 27) (17, 15) (20, 17) (20, 27) (20, 22) (20, 14) (20, 23) (7, 25) (7, 3) (25, 2) (25, 7) (25, 0) (25, 18) (4, 10) (4, 15) (4, 3) (27, 17) (27, 20) (27, 19) (3, 26) (3, 21) (3, 7) (3, 4) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 10) (19, 27) (19, 15) (0, 25) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 18) (11, 22) (11, 13) (14, 1) (14, 20) (14, 23) (14, 16) (28, 8) (28, 17) (15, 17) (15, 4) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 29) (22, 21) (22, 6) (22, 20) (22, 11) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 15) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 29) (18, 25) (18, 10) (18, 29) (29, 15) (29, 16) (29, 18) (23, 20) (23, 14) 

Response:
After exploring all the neighbor nodes for each node, we find that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 22, 25, 27, and 29. 

Now, we count the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

For node 3: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 6: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 8: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 10: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 12: There are 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is formed.

For node 14: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 15: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 16: There are 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is formed.

For node 17: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 20: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 22: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 25: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 27: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 29: There are 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is formed.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 60. Hence, the final answer is [60].
