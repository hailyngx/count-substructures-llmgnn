Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 19) (14, 4) (14, 5) (17, 12) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 19) (0, 16) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 9) (5, 14) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 6) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 16) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 4) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 3) (16, 2) (16, 9) (18, 7) (18, 15) (18, 3) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 9) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 19) (6, 8) (6, 15) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 16) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 16) (3, 18) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 16
- Node 1: 8, 15, 19
- Node 2: 7, 11, 13, 16
- Node 3: 5, 8, 16, 18
- Node 4: 12, 14, 16
- Node 5: 3, 11, 12, 13, 14
- Node 6: 8, 15
- Node 7: 2, 9, 15, 18
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6
- Node 9: 7, 9, 15, 16, 19
- Node 11: 2, 5, 19
- Node 12: 4, 5, 17
- Node 13: 2, 5
- Node 14: 4, 5, 19
- Node 15: 1, 6, 7, 9, 18
- Node 16: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 17: 12
- Node 18: 3, 7, 15
- Node 19: 1, 11, 14, 9

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors (eligible for forming 3-star clusters): 1, 5, 9, 15, 16, 19

Now, let's calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 8, 15, 19>, <5, 3, 11, 12>, <5, 11, 13, 14>, <5, 12, 14, 19>, <5, 3, 12, 16>, <5, 3, 11, 19>, <5, 3, 12, 16>, <5, 19, 9, 11>, <5, 19, 9, 14>, <5, 9, 11, 14>, <9, 7, 15, 18>, <9, 15, 18, 7>, <9, 7, 18, 15>, <9, 16, 15, 7>, <9, 15, 18, 16>, <15, 18, 7, 16>, <15, 7, 9, 18>, <15, 7, 16, 18>, <15, 9, 16, 18>, <16, 0, 2, 4>
