Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of the neighbors for each node:

Node 0:  Neighbor set: {5, 7}
Node 1:  Neighbor set: {3, 5, 8, 9}
Node 2:  Neighbor set: {3, 6, 7, 9}
Node 3:  Neighbor set: {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
Node 4:  Neighbor set: {3, 7, 8}
Node 5:  Neighbor set: {0, 1, 3, 6}
Node 6:  Neighbor set: {2, 5, 7, 9}
Node 7:  Neighbor set: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
Node 8:  Neighbor set: {1, 4, 9}
Node 9:  Neighbor set: {1, 2, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7:  \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 9:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives: 
\[ 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 44 \]

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
