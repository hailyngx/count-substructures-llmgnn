Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 0) (26, 13) (26, 10) (0, 9) (0, 27) (0, 15) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 11) (6, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 15) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 16) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 23) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 10) (14, 21) (17, 1) (17, 8) (21, 14) (21, 8) (22, 9) (22, 14) (22, 19) (22, 5) (13, 26) (13, 29) (13, 1) (13, 23) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 8) (18, 20) (18, 12) (18, 25) (20, 18) (20, 29) (20, 10) (29, 13) (29, 20) (29, 8) (11, 27) (11, 23) (11, 25) (23, 7) (23, 13) (23, 11) (23, 3) (23, 12) (5, 22) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 22) (19, 5) (25, 18) (25, 11) (25, 24) (10, 26) (10, 14) (10, 20) (10, 5) (10, 12) (16, 4) (24, 7) (24, 25) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 12) (28, 4) (28, 14) (12, 18) (12, 23) (12, 10) (12, 15) (3, 6) (3, 23) (8, 17) (8, 21) (8, 1) (8, 29) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 9, 27, 15, 6
- Node 1: 17, 13, 8
- Node 3: 6, 23
- Node 4: 7, 28, 16, 15
- Node 5: 22, 19, 10
- Node 6: 9, 0, 3, 15
- Node 7: 4, 24, 23
- Node 8: 17, 21, 1, 29
- Node 9: 6, 22, 0
- Node 10: 26, 14, 20, 5, 12
- Node 11: 27, 23, 25
- Node 12: 18, 23, 10, 15
- Node 13: 26, 29, 1, 23
- Node 14: 22, 28, 10, 21
- Node 15: 0, 6, 4, 12
- Node 16: 4
- Node 17: 1, 8
- Node 18: 20, 12, 25
- Node 19: 22, 5
- Node 20: 18, 29, 10
- Node 21: 14, 8
- Node 22: 9, 14, 19, 5
- Node 23: 7, 13, 11, 3, 12
- Node 24: 7, 25
- Node 25: 18, 11, 24
- Node 26: 13, 10
- Node 27: 0, 11
- Node 28: 4, 14
- Node 29: 13, 20, 8

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars based on the neighbors of each node:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors (exactly): 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 28, 29 (Total: 13)
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: None

Since we have 13 nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars can be calculated as \( \binom{13}{3} = 286 \). Therefore, the final answer is [286].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 9, 27>
- <0, 6, 15>
- <0, 6, 3>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <0, 15, 12>
- <1, 17, 8>
- <4, 7, 24>
- <4, 7, 28>
- <4, 15, 12>
- <5, 19, 22>
- <10, 14, 21>
- <10, 20, 29>
- <13, 23, 29>
