Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 2) (9, 14) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (12, 4) (12, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 2) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 9, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 5, 11}
- Node 11: {4, 5, 10}
- Node 12: {0, 4}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 8, 9}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 20 + 20 + 35 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 105.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [105].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 13>, <0, 2, 13>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 3, 6>, <3, 5, 10>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 11>, <8, 13, 14>.
