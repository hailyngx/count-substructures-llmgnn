Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Initially, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {3, 8}
Node 1: {2, 6, 7}
Node 2: {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
Node 3: {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
Node 4: {2, 7, 8, 9}
Node 5: {3, 7}
Node 6: {1, 2, 9}
Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}
Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they contribute:

Nodes contributing to 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 55

Therefore, the final answer is [55], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>
