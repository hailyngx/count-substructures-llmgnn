Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 11) (13, 11) (13, 14) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 10) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the number of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: neighbors {4, 7} (degree 2)
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 6, 7, 12} (degree 4)
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 3, 10, 11} (degree 4)
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 4, 7, 10, 11} (degree 5)
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 3, 5, 8, 9} (degree 5)
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 4, 8, 11, 12} (degree 5)
- Node 6: neighbor {1} (degree 1)
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 10, 14} (degree 5)
- Node 8: neighbors {4, 5, 10, 14} (degree 4)
- Node 9: neighbors {4, 10, 12, 14} (degree 4)
- Node 10: neighbors {2, 3, 7, 8, 9} (degree 5)
- Node 11: neighbors {2, 3, 5, 13} (degree 4)
- Node 12: neighbors {1, 5, 9, 11} (degree 4)
- Node 13: neighbors {11, 14} (degree 2)
- Node 14: neighbors {7, 8, 9, 13} (degree 4)

Next, we identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and enumerate the 3-stars:

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [52], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (2, 4, 11)>, <7, (0, 3, 10)>, <10, (2, 3, 7)>, <11, (2, 3, 5)>, <12, (1, 5, 9)>, <14, (7, 8, 9)>.
