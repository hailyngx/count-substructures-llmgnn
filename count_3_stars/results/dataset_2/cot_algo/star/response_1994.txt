Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 10) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 6) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 5
- Node 11: degree 6
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to check for potential 3-stars:
- Node 4: <(0, 1, 8), (5, 9, 13), (4, 8, 13), (1, 8, 4)>
- Node 5: <(11, 13, 12), (8, 9, 13), (4, 13, 5), (11, 13, 5)>
- Node 6: <(10, 14, 7), (6, 8, 10), (6, 7, 14), (6, 10, 14)>
- Node 8: <(4, 6, 7), (9, 10, 14), (1, 4, 8), (4, 8, 13), (5, 8, 13), (7, 8, 11)>
- Node 9: <(0, 10, 14), (9, 13, 4), (9, 10, 14), (9, 13, 8)>
- Node 10: <(1, 4, 10), (9, 14, 10), (6, 8, 10), (10, 14, 9)>
- Node 11: <(2, 12, 11), (5, 11, 13), (7, 11, 8), (11, 13, 5), (11, 13, 3), (11, 13, 7)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
- Node 4 contributes 4 3-stars
- Node 5 contributes 4 3-stars
- Node 6 contributes 4 3-stars
- Node 8 contributes 6 3-stars
- Node 9 contributes 4 3-stars
- Node 10 contributes 4 3-stars
- Node 11 contributes 6 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 6 = 32 3-stars in the graph.
Therefore, the answer to this task is [32].
