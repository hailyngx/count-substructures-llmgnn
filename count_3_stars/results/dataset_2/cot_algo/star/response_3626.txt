Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8, 9, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 8}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 30, which we represent as [30].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>
