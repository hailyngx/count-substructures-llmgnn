Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 3, and Node 7 have 6 neighbors.
- Node 1 and Node 6 have 5 neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 80

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [80].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
