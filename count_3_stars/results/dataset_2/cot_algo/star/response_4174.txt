Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 14) (9, 25) (9, 10) (26, 18) (26, 29) (26, 6) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 0) (22, 12) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 15) (23, 16) (4, 1) (8, 24) (8, 20) (15, 23) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 21) (20, 8) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 19) (11, 28) (11, 0) (28, 11) (28, 14) (28, 10) (5, 13) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 19) (13, 27) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 29) (21, 15) (21, 13) (21, 16) (21, 14) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 15) (18, 29) (17, 16) (17, 2) (16, 23) (16, 21) (16, 17) (16, 24) (19, 22) (19, 20) (19, 13) (19, 24) (12, 22) (7, 3) (6, 26) (6, 10) (6, 27) (0, 22) (0, 11) (0, 3) (24, 8) (24, 16) (24, 19) (24, 2) (27, 13) (27, 6) (29, 26) (29, 3) (29, 18) (2, 17) (2, 24) (1, 22) (1, 4) (1, 20) (1, 25) (25, 9) (25, 1) (10, 9) (10, 28) (10, 6) (14, 9) (14, 28) (14, 21) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 11, 22}
- Node 1: {4, 20, 22, 25}
- Node 2: {17, 24}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 7, 29}
- Node 4: {1}
- Node 5: {3, 13}
- Node 6: {3, 10, 26, 27}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {20, 24}
- Node 9: {10, 14, 25}
- Node 10: {6, 9, 28}
- Node 11: {0, 28}
- Node 12: {22}
- Node 13: {5, 13, 19, 21, 27}
- Node 14: {9, 21, 28}
- Node 15: {18, 20, 21, 23}
- Node 16: {17, 21, 23, 24}
- Node 17: {2, 16}
- Node 18: {15, 23, 26, 29}
- Node 19: {13, 20, 22, 24}
- Node 20: {1, 8, 15, 19}
- Node 21: {13, 14, 15, 16}
- Node 22: {0, 1, 12, 19}
- Node 23: {15, 16, 18}
- Node 24: {2, 16, 19, 8}
- Node 25: {1, 9}
- Node 26: {6, 18, 29, 22}
- Node 27: {6, 13}
- Node 28: {10, 11, 14}
- Node 29: {3, 18, 26}

Now we can determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1, Node 13, and Node 21 have 5 neighbors each, so each can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 and Node 19 have 5 neighbors each, so each can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 0, Node 6, Node 15, and Node 16 have 4 neighbors each, so each can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 56 \).

Thus, the final answer is [56], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (13, 19, 21)>, <3, (0, 6, 29)>, <6, (3, 18, 26)>, <15, (16, 21, 23)>.
