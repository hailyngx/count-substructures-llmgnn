Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 28) (21, 3) (21, 2) (0, 15) (27, 16) (10, 17) (10, 22) (10, 4) (17, 10) (17, 24) (17, 5) (17, 7) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 14) (26, 15) (26, 8) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 20) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 26) (15, 18) (3, 21) (3, 13) (3, 22) (11, 23) (11, 14) (23, 11) (23, 29) (23, 16) (14, 19) (14, 6) (14, 11) (7, 17) (7, 13) (16, 27) (16, 23) (16, 4) (16, 9) (24, 17) (24, 6) (24, 8) (24, 5) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 28) (18, 13) (2, 21) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (5, 17) (5, 24) (5, 2) (5, 12) (29, 23) (8, 26) (8, 24) (8, 22) (12, 5) (12, 20) (12, 9) (20, 6) (20, 12) (20, 4) (20, 28) (25, 28) (9, 16) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 20) (22, 10) (22, 3) (22, 8) (22, 28) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 18) (28, 1) (28, 18) (28, 20) (28, 25) (28, 22) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {15}
- Node 1: {15, 28}
- Node 2: {21, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {21, 13, 22}
- Node 4: {10, 19, 16, 2, 20}
- Node 5: {17, 24, 2, 12}
- Node 6: {24, 14, 20}
- Node 7: {17, 13}
- Node 8: {26, 22, 24}
- Node 9: {16, 2, 12}
- Node 10: {4, 17, 22}
- Node 11: {23, 14}
- Node 12: {5, 9, 20}
- Node 13: {3, 7, 18}
- Node 14: {19, 6, 11}
- Node 15: {1, 0, 26, 18}
- Node 16: {27, 23, 4, 9}
- Node 17: {10, 24, 5, 7}
- Node 18: {19, 15, 28, 13}
- Node 19: {18, 4, 14}
- Node 20: {6, 12, 4, 28}
- Node 21: {3, 2}
- Node 22: {10, 8, 28}
- Node 23: {11, 29, 16}
- Node 24: {17, 6, 8, 5}
- Node 25: {28}
- Node 26: {15, 8}
- Node 27: {16}
- Node 28: {1, 18, 25, 22, 20}
- Node 29: {23}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves {4, 9, 5} 

Summing up all the 3-stars found, we have a total of 1 unique 3-star, which should be represented as [1].
