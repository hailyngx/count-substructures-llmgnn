Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 6) (16, 23) (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 10) (22, 13) (22, 14) (22, 10) (22, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 27) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 13) (8, 9) (18, 20) (18, 28) (18, 3) (26, 28) (26, 3) (28, 18) (28, 26) (28, 14) (28, 5) (3, 18) (3, 26) (3, 0) (5, 28) (5, 19) (5, 20) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 24) (25, 21) (25, 10) (25, 24) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 21) (9, 17) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 10) (1, 11) (6, 16) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 24) (27, 7) (27, 29) (27, 20) (29, 27) (29, 21) (24, 19) (24, 25) (24, 2) (24, 20) (15, 11) (15, 12) (23, 16) (23, 10) (21, 19) (21, 25) (21, 9) (21, 29) (21, 17) (20, 18) (20, 5) (20, 27) (20, 24) (12, 22) (12, 15) (12, 17) (17, 9) (17, 21) (17, 12) (10, 13) (10, 22) (10, 25) (10, 14) (10, 23) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (4, 3, 6)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (11, 2, 24)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (11, 4, 7, 24)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (18, 26, 0)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (0, 2, 7)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (28, 19, 20, 24)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (16, 0, 29)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (27, 2, 9)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (13, 9)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (7, 8, 21, 17, 27)
- Node 10: 5 neighbors (13, 22, 25, 14, 23)
- Node 11: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 15)
- Node 12: 3 neighbors (22, 15, 17)
- Node 13: 4 neighbors (8, 22, 10, 14)
- Node 14: 4 neighbors (22, 28, 10, 13)
- Node 15: 2 neighbors (11, 12)
- Node 16: 2 neighbors (6, 23)
- Node 17: 3 neighbors (9, 21, 12)
- Node 18: 3 neighbors (20, 28, 3)
- Node 19: 3 neighbors (5, 21, 24)
- Node 20: 4 neighbors (18, 28, 27, 24)
- Node 21: 5 neighbors (19, 25, 9, 17, 29)
- Node 22: 4 neighbors (13, 14, 10, 12)
- Node 23: 2 neighbors (16, 10)
- Node 24: 4 neighbors (19, 25, 2, 20)
- Node 25: 3 neighbors (21, 10, 24)
- Node 26: 3 neighbors (28, 3, 18)
- Node 27: 4 neighbors (7, 29, 20, 18)
- Node 28: 5 neighbors (18, 26, 14, 5, 20)
- Node 29: 3 neighbors (27, 21, 6)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (11, 4, 7)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (28, 19, 24)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (7, 8, 21)>
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star: <10, (25, 14, 23)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star: <14, (28, 10, 13)>
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star: <20, (27, 24, 18)>
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star: <21, (19, 25, 17)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
