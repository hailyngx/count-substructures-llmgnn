Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 8) (2, 29) (2, 19) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 20) (29, 14) (1, 3) (1, 25) (1, 12) (1, 18) (12, 1) (12, 27) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 20) (27, 7) (27, 8) (28, 29) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 13) (28, 10) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 21) (21, 28) (21, 17) (9, 22) (9, 10) (22, 3) (22, 9) (22, 25) (20, 29) (20, 27) (20, 24) (13, 28) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 14) (14, 29) (14, 13) (14, 26) (14, 6) (26, 14) (26, 23) (26, 0) (18, 1) (18, 10) (18, 25) (19, 2) (19, 23) (25, 1) (25, 17) (25, 22) (25, 18) (25, 11) (23, 26) (23, 19) (23, 4) (23, 16) (11, 25) (11, 24) (11, 4) (24, 20) (24, 11) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 26) (7, 27) (16, 13) (16, 23) (16, 10) (6, 14) (10, 28) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 16) (4, 23) (4, 11) (4, 5) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 27) (5, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {15, 28, 26}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 25, 12, 18}
- Node 2: Neighbors {29, 19}
- Node 3: Neighbors {15, 1, 22}
- Node 4: Neighbors {23, 11, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbor {4}
- Node 6: Neighbor {14}
- Node 7: Neighbor {27}
- Node 8: Neighbors {15, 12, 27}
- Node 9: Neighbors {22, 10}
- Node 10: Neighbors {28, 9, 18, 16}
- Node 11: Neighbors {25, 24, 4}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 27, 8}
- Node 13: Neighbors {28, 17, 16, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {29, 13, 26, 6}
- Node 15: Neighbors {3, 0, 8}
- Node 16: Neighbors {13, 23, 10}
- Node 17: Neighbors {13, 25, 21}
- Node 18: Neighbors {1, 10, 25}
- Node 19: Neighbors {2, 23}
- Node 20: Neighbors {29, 27, 24}
- Node 21: Neighbors {28, 17}
- Node 22: Neighbors {3, 9, 25}
- Node 23: Neighbors {26, 19, 4, 16}
- Node 24: Neighbors {20, 11}
- Node 25: Neighbors {1, 17, 22, 18, 11}
- Node 26: Neighbors {14, 23, 0}
- Node 27: Neighbors {12, 20, 8, 7}
- Node 28: Neighbors {29, 21, 0, 13, 10}
- Node 29: Neighbors {2, 28, 20, 14}

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: Nodes 3, 15, 29, 1, 12, 27, 28, 13, 14, 25, 23, 10, 4, 8

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 29: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 1 3-star
- Node 28: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 25: 1 3-star
- Node 23: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 0 3-stars
- Node 8: 0 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].

Unique 3-stars: 
<3, 1, 22>, <15, 0, 8>, <29, 2, 14>, <1, 3, 25>, <12, 1, 27>, <27, 8, 20>, <28, 10, 13>, <13, 14, 16>, <14, 6, 29>, <25, 11, 17>, <23, 4, 16>, <10, 16, 28>, <3, 22, 25>
