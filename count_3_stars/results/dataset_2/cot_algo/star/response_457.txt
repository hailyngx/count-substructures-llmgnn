Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 12) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 24) (15, 21) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 24) (18, 21) (22, 18) (22, 7) (22, 12) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 19) (6, 28) (6, 21) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 19) (21, 15) (21, 18) (21, 6) (21, 28) (19, 2) (19, 28) (26, 5) (17, 29) (17, 23) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 23) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 26) (5, 25) (5, 20) (20, 5) (20, 9) (4, 13) (4, 27) (4, 0) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 7) (11, 9) (12, 3) (12, 22) (12, 8) (12, 2) (7, 22) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 27) (7, 16) (16, 7) (16, 24) (16, 25) (16, 23) (16, 14) (0, 28) (0, 4) (24, 15) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 9) (25, 5) (25, 16) (1, 28) (14, 27) (14, 16) (9, 20) (9, 11) (9, 24) (9, 23) (23, 17) (23, 29) (23, 16) (23, 9) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: {28}
2: {18, 12, 19, 5}
3: {15, 12, 29}
4: {13, 27, 0}
5: {13, 2, 26, 25, 20}
6: {21, 28}
7: {22, 8, 13, 27, 16}
8: {13, 12, 7}
9: {20, 11, 24, 23}
11: {9}
12: {3, 22, 8, 2}
13: {4, 5, 7, 8}
14: {27, 16}
15: {3, 24, 21}
16: {7, 24, 25, 23, 14}
17: {29, 23}
18: {22, 2, 24, 21}
19: {2, 28}
20: {5, 9}
21: {18, 6, 28, 15}
22: {18, 7, 12}
23: {17, 29, 16, 9}
24: {15, 18, 16, 9}
25: {5, 16}
26: {5}
27: {4, 14, 7}
28: {6, 21, 19, 0, 1}
29: {3, 17, 23}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are involved in:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 42 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (18, 19, 5)>
<5, (13, 2, 25)>
<7, (22, 13, 16)>
<13, (4, 7, 8)>
<16, (7, 24, 25)>
<24, (15, 16, 9)>
<28, (19, 21, 1)>
