Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 8) (11, 13) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (0, 9) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 2) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {9, 13}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 8, 14, 2}
- Node 2: {4, 13, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {4, 14, 2}
- Node 4: {7, 3, 14, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 1, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 1, 10, 12}
- Node 7: {4, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {9, 13, 11, 12, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8, 0}
- Node 10: {5, 6, 13}
- Node 11: {8, 13}
- Node 12: {6, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {8, 13, 10, 0, 11, 2}
- Node 14: {5, 4, 7, 3, 1}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: No 3-star formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: No 3-star formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: No 3-star formed as it has less than 3 neighbors. 
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: No 3-star formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: No 3-star formed as it has less than 3 neighbors. 
- Node 10: No 3-star formed as it has less than 3 neighbors. 
- Node 11: No 3-star formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: No 3-star formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 64

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [64].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 14)>
- <1, (5, 8, 14)>
- <1, (6, 8, 14)>
- <5, (9, 6, 10)>
- <5, (9, 6, 14)>
- <6, (9, 5, 10)>
- <6, (9, 5, 14)>
- <8, (9, 13, 10)>
- <8, (9, 13, 12)>
- <13, (8, 12, 10)>
- <13, (8, 12, 2)>
