Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 24) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 20) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 16) (8, 4) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 11) (21, 14) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 19) (28, 13) (19, 15) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 1) (26, 19) (26, 17) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 20) (2, 22) (2, 14) (22, 2) (22, 0) (22, 29) (22, 7) (0, 28) (0, 22) (0, 29) (0, 23) (16, 4) (16, 14) (6, 18) (24, 5) (24, 13) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 20) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 10) (7, 22) (7, 29) (29, 22) (29, 0) (29, 7) (29, 11) (25, 9) (13, 28) (13, 24) (23, 0) (23, 1) (23, 20) (1, 19) (1, 23) (17, 26) (17, 11) (11, 5) (11, 21) (11, 29) (11, 17) (27, 3) (20, 9) (20, 10) (20, 18) (20, 23) (20, 14) (14, 5) (14, 21) (14, 2) (14, 16) (14, 20) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 28, 22, 29, 23
Node 1: 19, 23
Node 2: 22, 14
Node 3: 15, 7, 27
Node 4: 15, 8, 16
Node 5: 9, 24, 14, 11
Node 6: 18
Node 7: 3, 15, 10, 22, 29
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 5, 18, 25, 20
Node 10: 21, 18, 7, 20
Node 11: 5, 21, 29, 17
Node 13: 28, 24
Node 14: 5, 21, 2, 16, 20
Node 15: 3, 19, 7, 4
Node 16: 4, 14
Node 17: 26, 11
Node 18: 9, 10, 6, 20
Node 19: 15, 28, 26, 1
Node 20: 9, 10, 18, 23, 14
Node 21: 28, 10, 11, 14
Node 22: 2, 0, 29, 7
Node 23: 0, 1, 20
Node 24: 5, 13
Node 25: 9
Node 26: 19, 17
Node 27: 3
Node 28: 21, 0, 19, 13
Node 29: 22, 0, 7, 11

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them:

- Node 0, Node 7, Node 14, Node 15, Node 18, Node 19, Node 20, Node 21, and Node 29 each have 4 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each:
\( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 33 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (22, 29, 23)>
- <7, (22, 10, 29)>
- <14, (21, 2, 16)>
- <15, (19, 28, 7)>
- <18, (9, 6, 20)>
- <19, (28, 26, 1)>
- <20, (18, 23, 14)>
- <21, (11, 17, 28)>
- <29, (0, 7, 11)>
