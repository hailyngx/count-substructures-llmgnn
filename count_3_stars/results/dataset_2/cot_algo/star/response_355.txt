Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 11) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 2) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 2) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 10, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {2, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 3}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 12}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 11: {2, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 14: {4, 6}

Nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 13 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 63

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [63].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 12)>, <2, (3, 11, 12)>, <4, (1, 5, 14)>, <6, (1, 10, 11)>, <8, (1, 5, 13)>, <10, (2, 6, 13)>, <12, (2, 9, 11)>, <13, (2, 8, 10)>
