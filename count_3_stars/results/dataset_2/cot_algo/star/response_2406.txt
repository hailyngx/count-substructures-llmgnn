Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 6, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 different 3-stars.
- Node 7 also has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 different 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, but it cannot form any 3-stars as it does not have at least 3 neighbors connected.
- Node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 each have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 20 = 40. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 6)>
<5, (6, 7, 3)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>  

So the final answer is [40].
