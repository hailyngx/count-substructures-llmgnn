Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {1, 2, 9}
Node 1 neighbors: {0, 3, 6, 7}
Node 2 neighbors: {0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 3 neighbors: {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
Node 4 neighbors: {3, 8}
Node 5 neighbors: {2, 7, 9}
Node 6 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 8}
Node 7 neighbors: {1, 2, 5, 9}
Node 8 neighbors: {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
Node 9 neighbors: {0, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (2, 7, 9)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (2, 3, 8)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (3, 6, 8)>

Total number of unique 3-stars formed in the graph: [6]
