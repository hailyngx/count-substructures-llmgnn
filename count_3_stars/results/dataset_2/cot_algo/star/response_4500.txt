Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 2) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 1) (4, 8) (4, 14) (2, 10) (18, 8) (18, 5) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 5) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 9) (15, 10) (15, 1) (15, 12) (5, 18) (5, 14) (5, 19) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 7) (12, 15) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 3) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- For node 8 with neighbors {4, 11, 13, 18}, we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. 
- For node 13 with neighbors {1, 10, 8, 16}, we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For node 10 with neighbors {2, 11, 13, 15, 17}, we can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- For node 11 with neighbors {8, 10, 17, 19}, we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For node 17 with neighbors {1, 10, 11}, we can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- For node 14 with neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5}, we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For node 1 with neighbors {9, 13, 15, 17}, we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For node 15 with neighbors {1, 10, 12}, we can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 28.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<8, (4, 11, 13)>
<13, (1, 10, 8)>
<10, (2, 11, 15)>
<11, (8, 10, 17)>
<17, (1, 10, 11)>
<14, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (9, 13, 15)>
<15, (1, 10, 12)>
