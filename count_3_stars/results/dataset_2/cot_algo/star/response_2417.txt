Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars formed can be calculated as follows:

1. Nodes with neighbors:
   - Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 6, 9}
   - Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}
   - Node 2: {3, 8, 9}
   - Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 7}
   - Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 9}
   - Node 5: {0, 1, 7}
   - Node 6: {0, 1, 8, 9}
   - Node 7: {3, 4, 5}
   - Node 8: {1, 2, 6, 9}
   - Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}

2. Calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
   - Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) --> 10 3-stars
   - Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) --> 10 3-stars
   - Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) --> 4 3-stars
   - Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) --> 4 3-stars
   - Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) --> 4 3-stars
   - Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) --> 4 3-stars
   - Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) --> 10 3-stars

3. Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <6, 8, 9>
