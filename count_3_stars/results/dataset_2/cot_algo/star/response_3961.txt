Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 17) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 18) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 6) (29, 25) (7, 3) (7, 23) (7, 13) (21, 23) (21, 17) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 20) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 0) (13, 18) (20, 8) (20, 11) (25, 29) (25, 5) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 3) (27, 22) (10, 17) (10, 11) (17, 9) (17, 21) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 23) (0, 13) (0, 28) (0, 11) (11, 20) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (22, 26) (22, 27) (1, 17) (28, 9) (28, 26) (28, 2) (28, 0) (28, 24) (18, 26) (18, 13) (5, 25) (5, 16) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 16) (6, 29) (6, 11) (6, 24) (6, 15) (24, 28) (24, 6) (24, 16) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 6) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 24) (16, 3) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 16) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 4) (23, 7) (23, 21) (23, 17) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {13, 28, 11}
- Node 1: {17}
- Node 2: {13, 14, 19, 28, 29}
- Node 3: {7, 12, 16}
- Node 4: {14}
- Node 5: {16, 25}
- Node 6: {11, 15, 24, 29}
- Node 7: {3, 13, 23}
- Node 8: {13, 14, 20}
- Node 9: {17, 26, 28}
- Node 10: {11, 17}
- Node 11: {0, 6, 10, 20}
- Node 12: {3, 14, 15}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 7, 8, 18}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 8, 12}
- Node 15: {6, 12, 19}
- Node 16: {3, 5, 15, 24}
- Node 17: {1, 9, 10, 21, 23}
- Node 18: {13, 26}
- Node 19: {2, 15, 16}
- Node 20: {8, 11}
- Node 21: {17, 23}
- Node 22: {26, 27}
- Node 23: {7, 17, 21}
- Node 24: {6, 16, 28}
- Node 25: {5, 29}
- Node 26: {9, 18, 22, 28}
- Node 27: {22}
- Node 28: {0, 2, 9, 24, 26}
- Node 29: {2, 25, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 9: <9, (17, 26, 28)>
- Node 17: <17, (1, 10, 21)>
- Node 26: <26, (9, 18, 28)>, <26, (22, 27, 28)>
- Node 28: <28, (0, 24, 26)>

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars identified, so the final answer is [7].
