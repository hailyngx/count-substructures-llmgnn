Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 11) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {8, 11, 13, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {7, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 5: {7, 8, 11}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 10}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 5, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 8, 11}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 11: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 12: {7, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 12}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. We will check each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to 4 neighbor nodes, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 is connected to 5 neighbor nodes, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 is connected to 5 neighbor nodes, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 is connected to 4 neighbor nodes, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 is connected to 4 neighbor nodes, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 is connected to 5 neighbor nodes, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 is connected to 5 neighbor nodes, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 is connected to 4 neighbor nodes, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Calculating the sum of the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 56
Thus, the final answer is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 8, 11>
<0, 8, 13>
<0, 11, 13>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 10>
<2, 6, 10>
<2, 7, 14>
<4, 6, 10>
<4, 9, 11>
<5, 7, 11>
