Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 0) (5, 4) (2, 6) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 0) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 7) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 2: {6, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6, 13}
- Node 9: {6, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 13: {2, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {6, 7, 9, 13, 0}

Next, let's apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 76

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [76].

Next, listing the unique 3-stars found:

- <1, (3, 8, 12)>
- <1, (3, 8, 11)>
- <1, (3, 11, 12)>
- <1, (8, 11, 12)>
- <3, (8, 10, 13)>
- <3, (7, 11, 14)>
- <3, (1, 8, 12)>
- <3, (1, 4, 12)>
- <3, (0, 12, 14)>
- <6, (7, 14, 9)>
- <6, (2, 13, 14)>
- <6, (8, 7, 11)>
- <6, (6, 9, 14)>
- <8, (11, 7, 14)>
- <9, (10, 13, 14)>
- <12, (0, 1, 3)>
- <13, (2, 8, 10)>
- <13, (8, 14, 10)>
- <13, (8, 14, 2)>
- <13, (14, 7, 10)>
- <14, (6, 9, 13)>
