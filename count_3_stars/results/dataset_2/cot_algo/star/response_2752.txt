Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first need to find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 9 (degree: 4)
- Node 1 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 8 (degree: 4)
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 7, 8, 9 (degree: 4)
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9 (degree: 5)
- Node 4 neighbors: 7, 9 (degree: 2)
- Node 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 8 (degree: 4)
- Node 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 9 (degree: 4)
- Node 7 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5 (degree: 4)
- Node 8 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6 (degree: 4)
- Node 9 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6 (degree: 5)

We can see that nodes 3 and 9 have a degree of 5, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \).

- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 10 = 20 \), and we can list the unique 3-stars found:

<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>
