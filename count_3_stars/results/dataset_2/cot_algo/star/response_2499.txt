Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (3, 4) (3, 0) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 10) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 12) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 13) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 10) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 12) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 12) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {7, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 5: {4, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 8, 11}
- Node 8: {7, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 8, 12}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 8, 9, 12, 13}

Now, we check for nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0 and Node 1 each have 6 neighbors, so they can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars each.
- Node 4, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 11, Node 12, and Node 13 each have 6 neighbors, so they can form 20 3-stars each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [140].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 12, 14)>
- <1, (0, 10, 13)>
- <4, (7, 9, 11)>
- <7, (4, 8, 11)>
- <8, (7, 9, 10)>
- <9, (4, 8, 11)>
- <11, (4, 7, 9)>
- <12, (0, 1, 14)>
- <13, (1, 12, 14)>
