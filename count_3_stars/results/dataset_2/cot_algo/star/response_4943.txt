Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 14) (14, 7) (14, 13) (17, 13) (17, 16) (2, 18) (2, 10) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 6) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (6, 18) (6, 5) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 5) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 9) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 9) (8, 3) (8, 19) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 16) (0, 16) (0, 9) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 0) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 0) (10, 2) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

1: {5, 15, 9, 10}
2: {18, 10}
3: {11, 8, 19}
4: {7, 12, 13}
5: {1, 6, 13}
6: {5, 18}
7: {4, 11, 15, 19, 14}
8: {3, 19}
9: {18, 1, 15, 0}
10: {2, 1}
11: {7, 3, 12}
12: {4, 11, 19, 16}
13: {4, 14, 17, 5}
14: {7, 13}
15: {7, 1, 9}
16: {17, 12, 0}
17: {13, 16}
18: {2, 6, 9}
19: {7, 3, 8, 12}

Now, let's check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if they form any 3-stars:

Node 1: 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 3: 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 5: 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 6: 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 7: 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
Node 8: 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 9: 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 10: 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 11: 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 12: 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 13: 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 15: 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 16: 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 17: 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
Node 18: 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 19: 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30].

Unique 3-stars: 
<(1, 5, 15)>, <(1, 5, 9)>, <(1, 5, 10)>, <(1, 9, 15)>, <(3, 8, 19)>, <(3, 11, 12)>, <(7, 11, 3)>, <(7, 11, 12)>, <(7, 11, 19)>, <(7, 12, 16)>, <(7, 12, 19)>, <(7, 12, 4)>, <(7, 12, 11)>, <(7, 15, 1)>, <(7, 15, 9)>, <(9, 15, 1)>, <(12, 19, 7)>, <(12, 19, 16)>, <(12, 19, 4)>, <(12, 4, 13)>, <(13, 14, 7)>, <(13, 14, 4)>, <(13, 14, 17)>, <(13, 4, 7)>, <(14, 4, 7)>, <(14, 13, 4)>, <(15, 1, 7)>, <(16, 12, 17)>, <(18, 2, 6)>, <(19, 3, 7)>, <(19, 7, 12)>
