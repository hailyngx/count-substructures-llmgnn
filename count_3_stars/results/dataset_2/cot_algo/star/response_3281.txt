Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 13) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 14) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 1) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 2: {8, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 10: {4, 8, 11}
- Node 11: {2, 5, 10, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 4, 14}
- Node 13: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 5, 11, 12}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 74 \]

Putting the final number inside brackets: [74]
