Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (21, 28) (21, 0) (21, 11) (0, 21) (0, 14) (0, 9) (27, 3) (27, 5) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 3) (22, 18) (22, 16) (20, 3) (20, 9) (25, 6) (25, 23) (25, 28) (25, 14) (10, 11) (10, 26) (10, 9) (10, 29) (11, 21) (11, 18) (11, 10) (8, 1) (8, 23) (8, 13) (23, 25) (23, 8) (23, 29) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 24) (7, 3) (12, 4) (12, 26) (12, 19) (6, 1) (6, 25) (6, 28) (6, 14) (28, 21) (28, 25) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 5) (14, 0) (14, 25) (14, 6) (17, 29) (17, 24) (17, 2) (29, 10) (29, 23) (29, 17) (26, 10) (26, 13) (26, 12) (26, 16) (24, 13) (24, 17) (4, 12) (19, 18) (19, 12) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 20) (9, 10) (9, 28) (3, 27) (3, 18) (3, 20) (3, 7) (3, 15) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 15) (15, 3) (15, 16) (2, 17) (5, 1) (5, 27) (5, 28) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

1: {5, 6, 8}
21: {0, 11, 28}
0: {9, 14, 21}
27: {3, 5}
18: {3, 9, 11, 19, 22}
22: {16, 18}
20: {3, 9}
25: {6, 14, 23, 28}
10: {9, 11, 26, 29}
11: {10, 18, 21}
8: {1, 13, 23}
23: {8, 25, 29}
13: {8, 24, 26}
7: {3}
12: {4, 19, 26}
6: {1, 14, 25, 28}
28: {5, 6, 9, 21, 25}
14: {0, 6, 25}
17: {2, 24, 29}
29: {10, 17, 23}
26: {10, 12, 13, 16}
24: {13, 17}
4: {12}
19: {9, 12, 18}
9: {0, 10, 18, 20, 28}
3: {7, 15, 18, 20, 27}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

1: 1 3-star 
21: 1 3-star
0: 1 3-star
18: 10 3-stars
9: 10 3-stars
26: 4 3-stars
3: 10 3-stars

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars from the above calculations, we get: 

1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 37

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [37].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <21, 0, 11>, <18, 3, 9>, <18, 3, 11>, <18, 3, 19>, <18, 3, 22>, <18, 9, 11>, <18, 9, 19>, <18, 9, 22>, <18, 11, 19>, <18, 11, 22>, <9, 10, 11>, <9, 10, 26>, <9, 10, 29>, <9, 11, 18>, <9, 11, 20>, <9, 11, 28>, <9, 18, 19>, <9, 18, 22>, <9, 20, 28>, <3, 7, 15>, <3, 7, 18>, <3, 7, 20>, <3, 15, 16>, <3, 15, 18>, <3, 15, 20>, <3, 16, 18>, <3, 16, 20>
