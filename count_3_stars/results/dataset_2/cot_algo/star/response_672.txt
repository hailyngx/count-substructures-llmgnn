Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first determine the neighborhood set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
Node 1: {0, 2}
Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 7}
Node 4: {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 5: {3, 4}
Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 7}
Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 9}
Node 9: {0, 4, 7, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 76 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [76].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
