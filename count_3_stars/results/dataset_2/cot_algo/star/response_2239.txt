Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 8) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 12) (11, 17) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 16) (18, 3) (18, 2) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 4) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 17) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 8) (0, 10) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 8) (16, 2) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 1) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 9) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 8) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 17) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 4) (19, 9) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 13) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 13) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 9) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we need to find the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

Let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: (10)
- Node 1: (10, 9, 16)
- Node 2: (18, 13, 16, 19)
- Node 3: (6, 18)
- Node 4: (6, 13, 19)
- Node 5: (12)
- Node 6: (3, 14, 4, 19)
- Node 7: (12, 16, 17)
- Node 8: (15, 12, 14, 17)
- Node 9: (1, 13, 19)
- Node 10: (0, 1, 14)
- Node 11: (12, 17)
- Node 12: (11, 5, 7, 17, 8)
- Node 13: (2, 4, 9)
- Node 14: (10, 6, 8)
- Node 15: (8)
- Node 16: (2, 7, 17, 1)
- Node 17: (11, 7, 12, 16, 8)
- Node 18: (3, 2)
- Node 19: (2, 6, 4, 9)

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node gives us: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 45 \).

Therefore, we have found 45 unique 3-stars in this graph. Hence, the final answer is [45]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <1, (9, 10, 16)>
- <2, (13, 4, 19)>
- <2, (16, 17, 19)>
- <2, (16, 7, 17)>
- <2, (16, 7, 1)>
- <4, (19, 6, 13)>
- <6, (3, 4, 19)>
- <6, (3, 19, 7)>
- <6, (14, 4, 19)>
- <6, (14, 19, 8)>
- <8, (17, 12, 16)>
- <8, (17, 16, 14)>
- <8, (17, 16, 7)>
- <8, (17, 16, 1)>
- <8, (17, 16, 8)>
- <9, (13, 4, 19)>
- <10, (16, 17, 8)>
- <12, (17, 7, 8)>
- <12, (17, 16, 8)>
- <12, (17, 16, 7)>
- <12, (17, 16, 1)>
- <17, (7, 12, 8)>
- <17, (16, 7, 8)>
- <17, (16, 12, 8)>
- <17, (16, 12, 7)>
- <19, (4, 9, 13)>
