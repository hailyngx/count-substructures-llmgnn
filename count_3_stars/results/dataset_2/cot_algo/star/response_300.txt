Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 14) (9, 13) (5, 6) (28, 27) (28, 24) (28, 2) (22, 9) (22, 27) (22, 7) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 0) (17, 1) (17, 8) (17, 27) (17, 4) (20, 7) (20, 3) (20, 23) (20, 10) (3, 20) (3, 21) (3, 23) (3, 19) (3, 18) (21, 3) (21, 19) (16, 19) (29, 4) (29, 10) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 25) (8, 26) (19, 3) (19, 21) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 15) (10, 20) (10, 29) (26, 8) (26, 7) (11, 24) (11, 18) (24, 28) (24, 11) (24, 23) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 12) (23, 20) (23, 3) (23, 24) (7, 22) (7, 20) (7, 26) (7, 13) (2, 6) (2, 28) (2, 1) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 25) (27, 28) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 27) (13, 25) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 13) (25, 14) (12, 15) (18, 3) (18, 11) (4, 17) (4, 29) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 1, 25
- Node 1: 0, 2, 17
- Node 2: 1, 6, 14, 28
- Node 3: 18, 19, 20, 21, 23
- Node 4: 8, 17, 29
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 2, 5, 9
- Node 7: 13, 20, 22, 26
- Node 8: 4, 17, 19, 25, 26
- Node 9: 6, 9, 13, 14, 22
- Node 10: 20, 29
- Node 11: 18, 24
- Node 12: 15
- Node 13: 7, 9, 13, 25, 27
- Node 14: 2, 9, 14, 15, 25
- Node 15: 12, 14, 19
- Node 16: 19
- Node 17: 1, 4, 8, 27
- Node 18: 3, 11, 19
- Node 19: 3, 8, 15, 16, 18, 21
- Node 20: 3, 7, 10, 23
- Node 21: 3, 19
- Node 22: 7, 9, 13, 27
- Node 23: 3, 20, 24
- Node 24: 11, 23, 28
- Node 25: 0, 8, 13, 14, 25
- Node 26: 7, 8
- Node 27: 13, 17, 22, 27, 28
- Node 28: 2, 24, 27, 28
- Node 29: 4, 10

Now, let's identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 27 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

For nodes 1, 17, 27:
- They have 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is formed with each:
  - Node 1: <1, 0, 2>, <1, 17, 27>
  - Node 17: <17, 1, 8>, <17, 4, 27>
  - Node 27: <27, 17, 28>, <27, 13, 22>

For nodes 8, 19, 25:
- They have 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars are formed with each:
  - Node 8: <8, 4, 25>, <8, 19, 25>, <8, 19, 26>, <8, 19, 27>, <8, 25, 26>, <8, 25, 27>
  - Node 19: <19, 3, 15>, <19, 8, 25>, <19, 8, 27>, <19, 15, 16>, <19, 15, 18>, <19, 15, 21>, <19, 15, 25>, <19, 16, 21>, <19, 18, 21>, <19, 21, 27>
  - Node 25: <25, 0, 13>, <25, 0, 14>, <25, 13, 14>, <25, 13, 27>, <25, 14, 27>, <25, 13, 25>, <25, 14, 25>, <25, 25, 27>, <25, 14, 27>, <25, 13, 27>

For node 2:
- It has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed:
  - Node 2: <2, 6, 28>, <2, 14, 28>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 14, 25>

For node 20:
- It has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed:
  - Node 20: <20, 3, 7>, <20, 3, 10>, <20, 7, 23>, <20, 10, 29>

Summing up the 3-stars, we have a total of [35].
