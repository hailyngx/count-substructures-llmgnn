Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 16) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 18) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 19) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (6, 17) (6, 7) (9, 18) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 16) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 16) (13, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (19, 1) (19, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 15) (12, 8) (12, 4) (16, 14) (16, 18) (16, 13) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 15) (15, 17) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 0) 

Response:
First, we will list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 8, 11, 15
- Node 1: 0, 3, 13, 19
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 1, 11, 13, 19
- Node 4: 2, 5, 12, 15
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7, 11, 15
- Node 6: 7, 17
- Node 7: 2, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 12
- Node 9: 18
- Node 10: 11
- Node 11: 0, 3, 5, 10
- Node 12: 4, 8
- Node 13: 1, 3, 14, 15
- Node 14: 13, 16, 17
- Node 15: 0, 4, 5, 13, 17
- Node 16: 14, 13, 18
- Node 17: 6, 14, 15, 18
- Node 18: 9, 16, 17
- Node 19: 1, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 8, 11, 15 (5 neighbors) -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 0, 3, 13, 19 (4 neighbors) -> No 3-star
- Node 4: 2, 5, 12, 15 (4 neighbors) -> No 3-star
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7, 11, 15 (5 neighbors) -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: 1, 3, 14, 15 (4 neighbors) -> No 3-star
- Node 14: 13, 16, 17 (3 neighbors) -> 1 3-star
- Node 15: 0, 4, 5, 13, 17 (5 neighbors) -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: 14, 13, 18 (3 neighbors) -> 1 3-star
- Node 17: 6, 14, 15, 18 (4 neighbors) -> No 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 5, 15)>
- <5, (0, 4, 15)>
- <15, (0, 4, 5)>
- <14, 13, 16>
