Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {5, 9}
- Node 2: {9, 8, 3}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 7, 6, 2, 0}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 8, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 1, 4, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 3}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 7, 2}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 2, 1, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars (nodes with 3 or more neighbors):

- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50, which can be represented as [50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (5, 1, 9)>
- <3, (5, 9, 3)>
- <3, (5, 9, 7)>
- <3, (5, 9, 6)>
- <3, (5, 9, 2)>
- <3, (5, 9, 0)>
- <5, (9, 1, 3)>
- <5, (9, 7, 3)>
- <5, (9, 6, 3)>
- <5, (9, 2, 3)>
- <5, (9, 0, 3)>
- <7, (4, 0, 3)>
- <7, (4, 0, 6)>
- <7, (4, 0, 7)>
- <7, (4, 0, 8)>
- <7, (4, 3, 6)>
- <7, (4, 3, 7)>
- <7, (4, 3, 8)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- <7, (0, 3, 6)>
- <7, (0, 3, 7)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>
