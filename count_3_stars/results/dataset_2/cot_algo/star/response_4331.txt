Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 19) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 12) (17, 6) (17, 3) (8, 11) (8, 12) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 14) (2, 15) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 19) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 15) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 0) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 15) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 15) (13, 9) (13, 16) (13, 18) (1, 0) (1, 16) (1, 18) (18, 5) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 11) (11, 8) (11, 18) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 16) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 19
Node 1: 0, 16
Node 2: 15
Node 3: 0, 10, 17
Node 4: 0, 7
Node 5: 7, 15, 18
Node 6: 7, 14, 17
Node 7: 4, 5, 6
Node 8: 11, 12
Node 9: 10, 13, 14, 19
Node 10: 3, 9, 12
Node 11: 8, 18
Node 12: 8, 10, 15
Node 13: 9, 16, 18
Node 14: 6, 9, 15
Node 15: 2, 5, 12, 14, 16
Node 16: 1, 13, 15, 19
Node 17: 3, 6
Node 18: 1, 5, 11, 13
Node 19: 0, 9, 16

For each node that has three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of:

Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 4: [inom{2}{2}] = 1
Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 10: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 15: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 18: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 19: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Adding all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get a total of 36 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 16>
<0, 3, 19>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 9, 19>
<5, 7, 15>
<5, 9, 18>
<6, 7, 14>
<8, 11, 18>
<9, 10, 12>
<9, 13, 16>
<9, 14, 15>
<12, 10, 15>
<13, 16, 18>
<14, 15, 6>
<15, 12, 14>
<18, 1, 13>
