Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 13) (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (10, 18) (10, 1) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 17) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 18) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 18) (17, 2) (17, 1) (17, 3) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 0) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 15) (12, 9) (12, 2) (3, 5) (3, 17) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 13) (0, 8) (0, 15) (0, 19) (14, 2) (14, 18) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 14) (13, 16) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 15, 19}
- Node 1: {6, 10, 15, 17, 18}
- Node 2: {12, 14, 15, 17}
- Node 3: {5, 17}
- Node 4: {11, 13, 19}
- Node 5: {3, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {6, 15, 16}
- Node 8: {0, 11, 18}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 18}
- Node 11: {4, 8}
- Node 12: {2, 9}
- Node 13: {4, 9, 15, 16}
- Node 14: {2, 18}
- Node 15: {0, 1, 2, 7, 13}
- Node 16: {7, 13}
- Node 17: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 18: {8, 10, 14, 18}
- Node 19: {0, 4}

Now, we will identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 15, and 18 have 5 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives: 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 34.

Therefore, the final answer is [34], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (6, 10, 17)>, <1, (6, 10, 15)>, <1, (6, 17, 18)>, <1, (10, 15, 17)>, <1, (15, 17, 18)>, <2, (12, 14, 17)>, <6, (1, 7, 15)>, <8, (0, 11, 18)>, <9, (5, 12, 13)>, <9, (6, 12, 13)>, <15, (0, 7, 13)>, <15, (1, 7, 13)>, <15, (1, 13, 16)>, <15, (7, 13, 16)>, <18, (10, 14, 18)>.
