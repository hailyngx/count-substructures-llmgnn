Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 1) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 8) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create a visual representation of the graph:

```plaintext
    0 --- 8 --- 3   1 --- 4
    |     |     |   |     |
    2 --- 6 --- 2   |     |
            |       13    7
            14 - 11      |
             \           |
              10 --- 9   5
``` 

Now, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 14, 2}
- Node 1: {4, 13}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 7, 0, 11}
- Node 3: {5, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 13, 7, 12}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 6, 12}
- Node 6: {5, 2, 14, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 10, 12, 6, 7, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {9, 11, 8, 12}
- Node 11: {10, 14, 2}
- Node 12: {5, 4, 10, 8}
- Node 13: {5, 9, 4, 10, 1}
- Node 14: {6, 11, 0, 1, 2}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {12, 10, 6}.
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {8, 5, 4}.
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {5, 10, 9}.

Since there are 3 3-stars identified, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <8, (12, 10, 6)>
- <12, (8, 5, 4)>
- <13, (5, 10, 9)>
