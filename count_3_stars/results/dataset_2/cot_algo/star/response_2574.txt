Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {6}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 and 4 have 4 neighbors, so they each contribute \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 and 9 have 5 neighbors, so they each contribute \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3, 5, and 6 also have 6 neighbors each, so they contribute \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the contributions, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 68 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [68], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>
