Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 27) (8, 23) (8, 28) (23, 8) (23, 7) (23, 1) (26, 5) (26, 28) (26, 21) (26, 3) (26, 12) (28, 8) (28, 26) (28, 19) (6, 7) (6, 25) (21, 26) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 17) (25, 6) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 24) (27, 9) (27, 25) (27, 13) (2, 5) (2, 17) (12, 26) (12, 24) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 20) (16, 18) (16, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 20) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 11) (24, 3) (24, 13) (15, 19) (19, 28) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 20) (7, 9) (7, 23) (7, 6) (29, 25) (1, 23) (1, 10) (3, 26) (3, 24) (3, 14) (3, 4) (14, 16) (14, 3) (17, 21) (17, 2) (20, 21) (20, 10) (20, 11) (20, 19) (22, 21) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (13, 27) (13, 24) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 10, 19
- Node 1: 10, 23
- Node 2: 5, 17
- Node 3: 4, 14, 24, 26
- Node 4: 3, 10, 11
- Node 5: 2, 9, 11, 26
- Node 6: 7, 25
- Node 7: 6, 9, 23
- Node 8: 23, 28
- Node 9: 5, 7, 11, 27
- Node 10: 0, 1, 4, 18, 20
- Node 11: 4, 5, 9, 20, 24
- Node 12: 24, 26
- Node 13: 18, 24, 27
- Node 14: 3, 16
- Node 15: 19
- Node 16: 14, 18
- Node 17: 2, 21
- Node 18: 10, 13, 16
- Node 19: 0, 15, 20, 28
- Node 20: 10, 11, 19, 21
- Node 21: 17, 20, 22, 26
- Node 22: 21
- Node 23: 1, 7, 8
- Node 24: 3, 11, 12, 13, 25
- Node 25: 6, 24, 27, 29
- Node 26: 3, 5, 12, 21, 28
- Node 27: 9, 13, 25
- Node 28: 8, 19, 26
- Node 29: 25

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 5, 9, and 26 have exactly 3 neighbors, so each forms a 3-star.
- Node 10, 11, 20, and 24 have more than 3 neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them using \( \binom{n}{3} \):

  - Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the 3-stars from individual nodes, we get a total of 3-stars as follows:
1 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 9) + 1 (from node 26) + 10 (from node 10) + 10 (from node 11) + 4 (from node 20) + 10 (from node 24) = 37

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [37].
