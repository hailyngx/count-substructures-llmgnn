Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 7) (15, 24) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 3) (27, 16) (8, 0) (13, 14) (23, 14) (23, 3) (23, 29) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 24) (12, 17) (12, 22) (12, 26) (6, 28) (6, 18) (6, 26) (6, 4) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 10) (28, 2) (4, 6) (4, 5) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 25) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 25) (17, 22) (2, 28) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 21) (22, 12) (22, 17) (22, 2) (22, 5) (22, 21) (25, 18) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 11) (11, 15) (11, 7) (11, 25) (14, 13) (14, 23) (14, 10) (1, 9) (29, 23) (9, 25) (9, 1) (9, 0) (19, 2) (0, 8) (0, 28) (0, 18) (0, 9) (0, 24) (20, 26) (20, 10) (26, 12) (26, 6) (26, 20) (26, 16) (21, 27) (21, 2) (21, 22) (24, 15) (24, 12) (24, 0) (5, 4) (5, 22) (3, 27) (3, 23) (16, 27) (16, 26) (10, 28) (10, 14) (10, 20) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the provided edge list:

- Node 0: 8, 28, 18, 9, 24
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 28, 22, 19, 21
- Node 3: 27, 23
- Node 4: 6, 5
- Node 5: 4, 22
- Node 6: 28, 18, 26, 4
- Node 7: 15, 12, 11, 17
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 25, 1, 0
- Node 10: 28, 14, 20
- Node 11: 15, 7, 25
- Node 12: 7, 24, 17, 22, 26
- Node 13: 14
- Node 14: 13, 23, 10
- Node 15: 27, 7, 11, 24
- Node 16: 27, 26
- Node 17: 7, 12, 25, 22
- Node 18: 6, 0, 25
- Node 19: 2
- Node 20: 26, 10
- Node 21: 27, 2, 22
- Node 22: 12, 17, 2, 5, 21
- Node 23: 14, 3, 29
- Node 24: 15, 12, 0
- Node 25: 18, 17, 9, 11
- Node 26: 6, 12, 20, 16
- Node 27: 15, 21, 3, 16
- Node 28: 6, 2, 10, 0
- Node 29: 23

For each node that has three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of:

- Node 0: [1] (<0, 28, 18>)
- Node 2: [1] (<2, 28, 21>)
- Node 6: [1] (<6, 28, 18>)
- Node 7: [1] (<7, 12, 17>)
- Node 12: [3] (<12, 7, 17>, <12, 17, 22>, <12, 24, 0>)
- Node 14: [1] (<14, 23, 10>)
- Node 15: [1] (<15, 7, 11>)
- Node 17: [1] (<17, 7, 12>)
- Node 18: [1] (<18, 6, 25>)
- Node 22: [3] (<22, 12, 17>, <22, 17, 21>, <22, 2, 28>)
- Node 25: [1] (<25, 17, 11>)
- Node 26: [1] (<26, 12, 20>)
- Node 27: [1] (<27, 15, 21>)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get [14].
