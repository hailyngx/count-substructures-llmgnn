Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 7) (22, 13) (22, 15) (22, 20) (7, 13) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 18) (21, 7) (21, 15) (0, 20) (0, 2) (20, 22) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 3) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 29) (17, 29) (17, 18) (17, 26) (29, 6) (29, 17) (29, 19) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 19) (28, 8) (28, 15) (3, 20) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 14) (8, 28) (8, 15) (9, 25) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 14) (23, 24) (16, 7) (16, 24) (4, 13) (4, 23) (4, 10) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 27) (12, 2) (24, 11) (24, 23) (24, 16) (24, 19) (19, 29) (19, 11) (19, 24) (19, 1) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 23) (1, 19) (1, 25) (26, 20) (26, 17) (26, 2) (26, 27) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 10) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 17) (10, 4) (10, 25) (10, 27) (27, 2) (27, 26) (27, 10) (15, 22) (15, 21) (15, 28) (15, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 29.

For each node, we will list its neighbors:
- Node 0: {2, 20}
- Node 1: {19, 25}
- Node 2: {0, 12, 26, 27}
- Node 3: {5, 11, 14, 20}
- Node 4: {10, 13, 23}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 18}
- Node 6: {5, 14, 29}
- Node 7: {13, 16, 18, 21}
- Node 8: {15, 28}
- Node 9: {25}
- Node 10: {4, 25, 27}
- Node 11: {3, 19, 23, 24}
- Node 12: {2}
- Node 13: {4, 7, 22}
- Node 14: {3, 6, 23}
- Node 15: {8, 21, 22, 28}
- Node 16: {7, 24}
- Node 17: {18, 26, 29}
- Node 18: {5, 7, 17}
- Node 19: {1, 11, 24, 29}
- Node 20: {0, 3, 22, 26}
- Node 21: {7, 15}
- Node 22: {13, 15, 20}
- Node 23: {4, 11, 14, 24}
- Node 24: {11, 16, 19, 23}
- Node 25: {1, 9, 10}
- Node 26: {2, 17, 20, 27}
- Node 27: {2, 10, 26}
- Node 28: {8, 15}
- Node 29: {6, 17, 19}

Now let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 1 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 2 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (11, 14, 20)>
- Node 4 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 18)>
- Node 6 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (13, 16, 21)>
- Node 8 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 9 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 10 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star: <11, (3, 19, 23)>
- Node 12 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 13 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 14 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 15 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 16 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star: <17, (18, 26, 29)>
- Node 18 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 19 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star: <20, (3, 22, 26)>
- Node 21 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 22 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star: <23, (11, 14, 24)>
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star: <24, (11, 16, 19)>
- Node 25 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 26 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 27 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 28 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 29 does not form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 5
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
