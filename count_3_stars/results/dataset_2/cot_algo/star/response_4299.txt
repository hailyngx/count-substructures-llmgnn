Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 9) (7, 13) (21, 11) (12, 25) (12, 15) (12, 26) (27, 24) (5, 6) (5, 26) (5, 18) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 18) (28, 6) (28, 10) (13, 7) (13, 26) (13, 1) (26, 12) (26, 5) (26, 13) (4, 15) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 25) (16, 17) (16, 22) (16, 23) (16, 15) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 23) (29, 22) (29, 3) (2, 23) (2, 14) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 29) (22, 25) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 8) (10, 28) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 25) (11, 21) (11, 24) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 14) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 19) (18, 8) (3, 5) (3, 29) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 14) (14, 2) (14, 24) (14, 3) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 15) (20, 23) (23, 16) (23, 9) (23, 2) (23, 20) (25, 12) (25, 6) (25, 19) (25, 22) (25, 10) (8, 0) (8, 18) (8, 17) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 16) (15, 17) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 8, 10}
- Node 1: {0, 9, 13}
- Node 2: {3, 14, 23}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 10, 14, 29}
- Node 4: {15}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 18, 25, 26}
- Node 6: {5, 10, 18, 25, 28}
- Node 7: {9, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 17, 18}
- Node 9: {1, 7, 23}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 6, 25, 28}
- Node 11: {21, 24}
- Node 12: {15, 25, 26}
- Node 13: {1, 7, 26}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 24}
- Node 15: {4, 12, 16, 17}
- Node 16: {15, 17, 22, 23}
- Node 17: {8, 15, 16}
- Node 18: {5, 6, 8, 19}
- Node 19: {18, 22, 25}
- Node 20: {23}
- Node 21: {11}
- Node 22: {16, 19, 25, 29}
- Node 23: {2, 9, 16, 20}
- Node 24: {11, 14, 27}
- Node 25: {5, 6, 10, 12, 19, 22}
- Node 26: {5, 12, 13}
- Node 27: {24}
- Node 28: {6, 10}
- Node 29: {3, 22}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, Node 10, Node 15, Node 16, Node 18, Node 22, Node 25

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 80

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [80].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <3, 2, 14>
- <5, 6, 18>
- <6, 10, 25>
- <10, 0, 1>
- <15, 4, 12>
- <16, 15, 17>
- <18, 5, 19>
- <22, 16, 23>
- <25, 12, 26>
