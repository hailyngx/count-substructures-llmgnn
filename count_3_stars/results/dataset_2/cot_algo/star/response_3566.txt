Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 14) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 11) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 12) (11, 9) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 12) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 8, 13
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 12
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7, 10, 13
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 12
- Node 5: 0, 6, 12, 14
- Node 6: 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 9, 12, 13
- Node 9: 8, 11, 14
- Node 10: 3, 12, 13
- Node 11: 9
- Node 12: 2, 4, 5, 8, 10
- Node 13: 1, 3, 8, 10, 12, 14
- Node 14: 0, 5, 9, 13

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 3, 8, 13, and 12 have 5 or more neighbors, so we need to consider the number of 3-stars for these nodes.
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 60 \), which can be represented as [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 13)>, <1, (3, 8, 13)>, <1, (4, 8, 13)>, <1, (3, 8, 13)>, <1, (2, 8, 13)>, <3, (1, 8, 13)>, <3, (1, 10, 13)>, <3, (8, 10, 13)>, <8, (12, 13, 14)>, <13, (12, 14, 5)>
