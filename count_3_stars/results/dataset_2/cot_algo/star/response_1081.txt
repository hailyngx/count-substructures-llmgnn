Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 23) (18, 12) (18, 29) (22, 18) (12, 18) (12, 27) (27, 12) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 23) (0, 20) (0, 3) (0, 21) (0, 17) (20, 0) (20, 6) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 7) (29, 18) (29, 4) (19, 26) (19, 2) (19, 28) (19, 10) (26, 19) (26, 25) (26, 4) (1, 27) (1, 15) (1, 25) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 25) (3, 0) (3, 24) (21, 0) (21, 23) (21, 5) (21, 14) (4, 29) (4, 26) (4, 23) (4, 25) (10, 19) (10, 2) (10, 14) (8, 28) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 6) (8, 7) (28, 19) (28, 8) (6, 20) (6, 8) (6, 14) (5, 21) (5, 8) (5, 24) (5, 14) (14, 21) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 5) (14, 16) (23, 18) (23, 27) (23, 21) (23, 4) (23, 2) (24, 3) (24, 5) (24, 9) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 15) (25, 4) (25, 8) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 23) (16, 14) (16, 13) (13, 27) (13, 16) (9, 24) (7, 17) (7, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 20, 3, 21, 17, 18
- Node 1: 27, 15, 25
- Node 2: 19, 10, 23
- Node 3: 0, 24
- Node 4: 29, 26, 23, 25
- Node 5: 21, 8, 24, 14
- Node 6: 20, 8, 14
- Node 7: 17, 8
- Node 8: 28, 25, 6, 5, 7
- Node 9: 24
- Node 10: 19, 2, 14
- Node 12: 18, 27
- Node 13: 27, 16
- Node 14: 21, 10, 6, 5, 16
- Node 15: 17, 1, 25
- Node 16: 14, 13
- Node 17: 0, 15, 7
- Node 18: 22, 23, 12, 29, 0
- Node 19: 26, 2, 10, 28
- Node 20: 0, 6
- Node 21: 23, 0, 5, 14
- Node 22: 18
- Node 23: 21, 27, 4, 2, 18
- Node 24: 3, 5, 9
- Node 25: 26, 1, 15, 4, 8
- Node 26: 19, 25, 4
- Node 27: 12, 1, 13, 23
- Node 28: 19, 8
- Node 29: 18, 4

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: Ineligible (4 neighbors)
- Node 1: Ineligible (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: Ineligible (2 neighbors)
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: Ineligible (4 neighbors)
- Node 6: Ineligible (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: Ineligible (2 neighbors)
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 10: Ineligible (3 neighbors)
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 2 3-stars
- Node 15: Ineligible (3 neighbors)
- Node 16: Ineligible (2 neighbors)
- Node 17: Ineligible (3 neighbors)
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 19: Ineligible (4 neighbors)
- Node 20: Ineligible (2 neighbors)
- Node 21: Ineligible (4 neighbors)
- Node 22: Ineligible (1 neighbor)
- Node 23: Ineligible (5 neighbors)
- Node 24: Ineligible (3 neighbors)
- Node 25: 1 3-star
- Node 26: Ineligible (3 neighbors)
- Node 27: 1 3-star
- Node 28: Ineligible (2 neighbors)
- Node 29: Ineligible (2 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (19, 10, 23)>
- <4, (29, 26, 23)>
- <8, (28, 25, 6)>
- <12, (18, 27, 23)>
- <14, (21, 10, 6)>
- <18, (22, 23, 12)>
- <27, (1, 13, 23)>
