Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 9) (10, 0) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 1) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 1) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 15) (13, 2) (13, 15) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 7) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 15) (7, 5) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: {10, 1}
- Node 1: {11, 18, 4, 0, 12}
- Node 2: {16, 6, 18, 13}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 4: {16, 8, 19, 1}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 12}
- Node 6: {7, 2, 18, 12}
- Node 7: {6, 19, 15, 5}
- Node 8: {11, 4, 14}
- Node 9: {11, 10}
- Node 10: {9, 0}
- Node 11: {16, 1, 19, 9, 8}
- Node 12: {6, 1, 5}
- Node 13: {2, 15}
- Node 14: {8, 15}
- Node 15: {14, 13, 19, 7}
- Node 16: {11, 2, 4}
- Node 18: {6, 2, 1}
- Node 19: {11, 4, 15, 7}

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars by applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 
\[ 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 33 \]

So, there are a total of 33 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [33].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (18, 4, 12)>, <1, (18, 4, 0)>, <1, (18, 4, 15)>, <1, (18, 12, 5)>, <1, (4, 0, 12)>, <1, (4, 0, 15)>, <1, (4, 12, 5)>, <1, (0, 12, 5)>, <4, (16, 11, 19)>, <4, (8, 11, 14)>, <4, (19, 11, 15)>, <7, (6, 19, 15)>, <11, (16, 1, 19)>, <11, (16, 8, 4)>, <11, (1, 4, 0)>, <11, (1, 4, 12)>, <11, (19, 4, 15)>, <15, (14, 13, 19)>
