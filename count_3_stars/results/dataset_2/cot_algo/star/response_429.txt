Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 11) (9, 12) (26, 19) (26, 23) (3, 16) (15, 23) (15, 17) (15, 2) (0, 28) (0, 24) (0, 17) (0, 25) (20, 1) (20, 8) (2, 15) (2, 24) (8, 20) (8, 25) (19, 26) (19, 21) (19, 28) (19, 24) (19, 6) (29, 9) (29, 27) (29, 16) (29, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 4) (23, 26) (23, 15) (1, 20) (1, 13) (6, 19) (6, 22) (4, 11) (4, 22) (4, 5) (22, 6) (22, 4) (12, 9) (12, 16) (12, 28) (12, 18) (16, 3) (16, 29) (16, 12) (16, 27) (25, 9) (25, 0) (25, 8) (27, 29) (27, 16) (27, 21) (27, 17) (24, 0) (24, 2) (24, 19) (24, 28) (14, 18) (14, 7) (28, 0) (28, 19) (28, 12) (28, 24) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 5) (21, 19) (21, 27) (21, 17) (18, 12) (18, 14) (18, 13) (13, 1) (13, 18) (17, 15) (17, 0) (17, 27) (17, 21) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (10, 29) (10, 7) (10, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:
- First, we determine the neighbor set for each node:
    - Node 0: {17, 24, 25, 28}
    - Node 1: {13, 20}
    - Node 2: {15, 24}
    - Node 3: {16}
    - Node 4: {5, 11, 22}
    - Node 5: {4, 7, 10, 11}
    - Node 6: {19, 22}
    - Node 7: {5, 10, 14}
    - Node 8: {20, 25}
    - Node 9: {11, 12, 25, 29}
    - Node 10: {5, 7, 29}
    - Node 11: {4, 5, 9}
    - Node 12: {9, 16, 18, 28}
    - Node 13: {1, 18}
    - Node 14: {7, 18}
    - Node 15: {2, 17, 23}
    - Node 16: {3, 12, 27, 29}
    - Node 17: {0, 15, 21, 27}
    - Node 18: {12, 13, 14}
    - Node 19: {6, 21, 24, 26, 28}
    - Node 20: {1, 8}
    - Node 21: {17, 19, 27}
    - Node 22: {4, 6}
    - Node 23: {15, 26}
    - Node 24: {0, 2, 19, 28}
    - Node 25: {0, 8, 9}
    - Node 26: {19, 23}
    - Node 27: {16, 17, 21, 29}
    - Node 28: {0, 12, 19, 24}
    - Node 29: {9, 10, 16, 27}

- Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 9, 12, 16, 17, 19, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 43 \]

Hence, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [43].

Unique 3-stars found:
<9, 11, 12>, <9, 11, 25>, <9, 11, 29>, <9, 12, 25>, <9, 12, 29>, <9, 25, 29>, <12, 16, 28>, <12, 16, 29>, <12, 18, 28>, <12, 18, 13>, <16, 27, 29>, <17, 19, 21>, <17, 19, 27>, <17, 21, 27>, <19, 21, 27>, <19, 26, 23>, <19, 26, 24>, <19, 23, 15>, <19, 24, 28>, <24, 28, 12>, <24, 28, 19>
