Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 12) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 13) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 4) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 3) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 4) (16, 14) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 4) (9, 10) (18, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 18) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 19) (4, 16) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 3) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) (3, 8) (3, 16) (3, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighborhood sets for each node:

Node 0: {5, 10, 16, 4}
Node 1: {6, 7, 14, 15}
Node 3: {8, 12, 16}
Node 4: {0, 15, 16, 19}
Node 5: {0, 6, 11}
Node 6: {0, 1, 5, 7, 12, 13}
Node 7: {1, 6, 18}
Node 8: {3, 14, 19}
Node 9: {10}
Node 10: {0, 9}
Node 11: {5, 13, 19}
Node 12: {3, 6, 13, 15, 17}
Node 13: {6, 11, 12}
Node 14: {1, 8, 16, 17}
Node 15: {1, 4, 12}
Node 16: {0, 3, 4, 14}
Node 17: {12, 14}
Node 18: {7}
Node 19: {4, 8, 11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 16>, <0, 4, 15>, <0, 4, 19>, <1, 6, 12>, <1, 6, 13>, <1, 6, 7>, <3, 8, 12>, <4, 0, 15>, <4, 0, 19>, <4, 15, 12>, <4, 12, 13>, <6, 0, 1>, <6, 0, 5>, <6, 0, 7>, <6, 1, 7>, <12, 3, 16>, <14, 1, 16>, <14, 1, 17>, <14, 8, 16>, <19, 8, 11>
