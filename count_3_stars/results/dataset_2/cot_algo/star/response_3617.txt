Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (10, 15) (10, 12) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 17) (13, 3) (13, 9) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 11) (8, 9) (8, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 4) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 17) (11, 18) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 14) (4, 16) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 11}
Node 1: {0, 5, 6}
Node 2: {11, 14}
Node 3: {9, 13, 14, 18}
Node 4: {5, 14, 16}
Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 6, 7}
Node 6: {0, 1, 5}
Node 7: {5, 9}
Node 8: {9, 12}
Node 9: {3, 7, 8, 13}
Node 10: {12, 15}
Node 11: {0, 2, 17, 18}
Node 12: {8, 10, 14, 17}
Node 13: {3, 9}
Node 14: {2, 3, 4, 12}
Node 15: {10, 17, 18}
Node 16: {4, 17, 19}
Node 17: {11, 12, 15, 16}
Node 18: {3, 11, 15, 16, 19}
Node 19: {16, 18}

Now, let's find the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars: nodes 0, 3, 5, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 52 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (9, 13, 14)>
<5, (6, 7, 0)>
<9, (7, 8, 13)>
<11, (17, 18, 0)>
<12, (17, 10, 14)>
<14, (12, 2, 3)>
<15, (17, 11, 18)>
<16, (19, 17, 4)>
<17, (11, 12, 15)>
<18, (15, 16, 19)>
