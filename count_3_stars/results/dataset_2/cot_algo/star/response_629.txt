Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 18) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 17) (1, 14) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 16) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 0) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 15) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 16) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 9) (6, 17) (6, 10) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 9) (9, 19) (9, 15) (9, 14) (16, 5) (16, 10) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 15, 18}
- Node 1: {14}
- Node 2: {10, 11}
- Node 3: {8, 14}
- Node 4: {10, 14, 17}
- Node 5: {0, 12, 13, 16}
- Node 6: {10, 17}
- Node 7: {8, 12, 13, 15, 18}
- Node 8: {3, 7, 13}
- Node 9: {14, 15, 19}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 6, 16}
- Node 11: {2, 17, 18}
- Node 12: {5, 7, 13}
- Node 13: {5, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 9, 3}
- Node 15: {0, 7, 9, 19}
- Node 16: {5, 10}
- Node 17: {4, 6, 11}
- Node 18: {0, 7, 11}
- Node 19: {9, 15}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph:
Since we have the neighbors for each node, we can count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors.

The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
So, we need to calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives: 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 15, 18)>, <4, (10, 14, 17)>, <5, (0, 12, 13)>, <7, (8, 12, 13)>, <7, (12, 13, 15)>, <7, (13, 8, 12)>, <7, (13, 12, 15)>, <7, (13, 15, 18)>, <9, (14, 15, 19)>, <10, (2, 4, 6)>, <13, (5, 7, 8)>, <13, (5, 7, 12)>, <13, (7, 8, 12)>, <13, (7, 12, 15)>, <13, (12, 5, 7)>, <13, (12, 7, 15)>, <14, (3, 9, 14)>, <15, (0, 9, 15)>, <16, (5, 10, 16)>, <17, (4, 6, 11)>, <18, (0, 7, 11)>
