Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {6, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 10, 14}
- Node 8: {5, 10, 13}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 10, 11}
- Node 10: {4, 6, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 4, 10, 0}
- Node 13: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 14: {3, 6, 7}

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, Node 10, and Node 12

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 74. 

Therefore, the final answer is [74] and the unique 3-stars found are as follows: 
<1, (2, 6, 12)>, 
<1, (3, 7, 12)>, 
<1, (6, 7, 10)>, 
<1, (6, 12, 10)>, 
<1, (3, 12, 14)>, 
<3, (5, 8, 13)>, 
<3, (6, 10, 14)>, 
<3, (1, 12, 14)>, 
<5, (3, 8, 13)>, 
<6, (4, 10, 12)>, 
<6, (10, 12, 14)>, 
<6, (2, 10, 14)>, 
<10, (4, 6, 12)>.
