Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (13, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 14) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {7, 9, 10}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 11}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 8: {7, 9, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 8, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 11: {4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 8, 11}
- Node 13: {5}
- Node 14: {8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1, with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3, with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4, with 4 neighbors: No 3-stars possible
- Node 5, with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7, with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8, with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9, with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10, with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11, with 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12, with 4 neighbors: No 3-stars possible

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 90

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [90].
