Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 24) (5, 28) (5, 14) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 26) (1, 28) (1, 22) (3, 9) (3, 21) (3, 26) (10, 17) (10, 7) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 23) (17, 11) (26, 1) (26, 3) (26, 6) (26, 7) (29, 17) (29, 18) (0, 7) (0, 21) (7, 10) (7, 26) (7, 0) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 12) (21, 19) (18, 29) (18, 20) (11, 17) (11, 24) (11, 25) (24, 5) (24, 11) (24, 22) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 28) (19, 21) (19, 15) (19, 13) (12, 21) (12, 20) (12, 28) (20, 18) (20, 12) (20, 27) (20, 6) (20, 16) (8, 25) (8, 27) (23, 17) (23, 15) (23, 14) (23, 16) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 14) (25, 11) (25, 8) (27, 20) (27, 8) (27, 6) (14, 5) (14, 23) (14, 13) (14, 4) (6, 26) (6, 20) (6, 27) (6, 22) (22, 1) (22, 24) (22, 6) (28, 5) (28, 1) (28, 15) (28, 12) (2, 4) (4, 14) (4, 2) (16, 20) (16, 23) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

1: 26, 28, 22
2: 4
3: 9, 21, 26
4: 2, 14
5: 24, 28, 14
6: 26, 20, 27, 22
7: 10, 26, 0
8: 25, 27
9: 17, 3, 13
10: 17, 7
11: 17, 24, 25
12: 21, 20, 28
13: 9, 19, 14
14: 5, 23, 13, 4
15: 19, 23, 28
16: 20, 23
17: 9, 10, 29, 23, 11
18: 29, 20
19: 21, 15, 13
20: 18, 12, 27, 6, 16
21: 3, 0, 12, 19
22: 1, 24, 6
23: 17, 15, 14, 16
24: 5, 11, 22
25: 8, 11
26: 1, 3, 6, 7
27: 20, 8, 6
28: 1, 15, 12, 5
29: 17, 18

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 47

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [47].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 26, 28, 22>, <3, 9, 21, 26>, <5, 24, 11, 13>, <6, 26, 20, 22>, <9, 17, 29, 23>, <12, 21, 19, 28>, <14, 23, 13, 4>, <17, 10, 11, 29, 23>, <20, 12, 27, 6, 22>, <21, 3, 0, 12, 19>, <26, 1, 7, 6>, <28, 15, 12, 5>
