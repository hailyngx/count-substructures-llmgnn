Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 8) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 17) (0, 8) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (6, 7) (6, 13) (15, 9) (19, 4) (19, 9) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 10) (9, 16) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 13) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 17) (16, 9) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (17, 0) (17, 18) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the neighborhood sets for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {8, 12, 17}
Node 1 neighbors: {3, 5, 7, 10}
Node 2 neighbors: {3, 7, 12}
Node 3 neighbors: {1, 2, 10, 11}
Node 4 neighbors: {7, 13, 19}
Node 5 neighbors: {1, 12, 14}
Node 6 neighbors: {7, 13}
Node 7 neighbors: {1, 2, 4, 6}
Node 8 neighbors: {0, 11, 14, 18}
Node 9 neighbors: {10, 12, 15, 16, 19}
Node 10 neighbors: {1, 3, 9, 13}
Node 11 neighbors: {3, 8, 18}
Node 12 neighbors: {0, 2, 5, 9}
Node 13 neighbors: {4, 6, 10}
Node 14 neighbors: {5, 8}
Node 15 neighbors: {9}
Node 16 neighbors: {9}
Node 17 neighbors: {0, 18}
Node 18 neighbors: {8, 11, 17}
Node 19 neighbors: {4, 9}

Next, we will identify the nodes that form or can potentially form 3-stars:

Potential 3-star nodes: 1, 3, 7, 9, 10, 12, 18

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 18: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 31

Therefore, the final answer is [31], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 5, 10)>, <3, (1, 2, 10)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (10, 12, 19)>, <10, (1, 3, 13)>, <12, (0, 2, 5)>, <18, (8, 11, 17)>
