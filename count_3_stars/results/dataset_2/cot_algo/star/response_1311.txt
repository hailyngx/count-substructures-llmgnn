Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 11) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 12) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 10) (8, 5) (8, 17) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 18) (7, 0) (7, 10) (10, 2) (10, 7) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 13) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 13) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 17) (11, 9) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 13) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 11) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 12) (17, 8) (17, 18) (4, 0) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {7, 4, 18}
Node 1 neighbors: {3, 14, 13}
Node 2 neighbors: {6, 12, 16, 10}
Node 3 neighbors: {1, 19, 12}
Node 4 neighbors: {0}
Node 5 neighbors: {9, 8, 16, 14}
Node 6 neighbors: {2}
Node 7 neighbors: {0, 10}
Node 8 neighbors: {5, 17}
Node 9 neighbors: {5, 18, 15, 11}
Node 10 neighbors: {2, 7}
Node 11 neighbors: {9, 19, 18, 13}
Node 12 neighbors: {3, 2, 14}
Node 13 neighbors: {1, 15, 16, 11}
Node 14 neighbors: {5, 1, 12}
Node 15 neighbors: {9, 19, 18, 13}
Node 16 neighbors: {5, 2, 13}
Node 17 neighbors: {8, 18}
Node 18 neighbors: {9, 0, 15, 11, 17}
Node 19 neighbors: {3, 15, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

\( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) for nodes 0, 3, 16, 19
\( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) for node 1, as it has 4 neighbors
\( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) for node 5
\( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) for node 9
\( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) for node 11
\( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) for node 13
\( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) for node 15
\( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) for node 18

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 35

Thus, the final answer is [35], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (7, 18, 4)>
<1, (3, 14, 13)>
<3, (1, 19, 12)>
<5, (9, 8, 16)>
<9, (5, 18, 15)>
<11, (9, 19, 18)>
<13, (1, 15, 16)>
<15, (9, 13, 18)>
<16, (5, 2, 13)>
<18, (9, 15, 17)>
