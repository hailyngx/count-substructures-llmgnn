Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 12) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 19) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 18) (2, 18) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 13) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 15) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 18) (13, 1) (17, 11) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 0) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (15, 2) (15, 5) 

Response:
The given graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
   1 --- 5 --- 6           10 --- 0 --- 11 --- 16
   |     |     |            |           |      |
   13    8 --- 3           19 --- 7     18     12 --- 4
           |                          |       |
           15                         2       14
```

Now, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {10, 11, 16, 19}
- Node 1: {5, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {3, 15, 18}
- Node 3: {2, 8, 12}
- Node 4: {12, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 15}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 10}
- Node 7: {16, 18, 19}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 8, 14}
- Node 9: {8, 14, 19}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 11: {0, 16, 17, 18}
- Node 12: {3, 4, 16}
- Node 13: {1, 18}
- Node 14: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 15: {2, 5}
- Node 16: {0, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 17: {11}
- Node 18: {2, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 19: {0, 7, 9}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0, Node 11, and Node 16 have 4 neighbors each, so they each contribute \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1, Node 5, Node 8, and Node 14 have 4 neighbors each, so they each contribute 4 3-stars.
- Node 7, Node 9, and Node 18 have 3 neighbors each, so they each contribute \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3, Node 6, Node 10, and Node 12 have 3 neighbors each, so they each contribute 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 10, 11, 16>
- <1, 8, 10, 13>
- <5, 6, 1, 15>
- <8, 14, 4, 9>
- <7, 16, 12>
- <9, 14, 19>
- <11, 18, 7>
- <3, 6, 10>
- <2, 18, 13>
- <0, 11, 19>
