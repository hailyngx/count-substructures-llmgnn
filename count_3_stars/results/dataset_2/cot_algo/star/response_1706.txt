Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 29) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 24) (6, 18) (6, 20) (9, 24) (9, 10) (7, 21) (7, 3) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 12) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 17) (23, 25) (0, 21) (0, 10) (0, 5) (20, 6) (20, 2) (20, 11) (1, 26) (1, 27) (1, 8) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 3) (28, 26) (28, 17) (28, 14) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 15) (29, 13) (29, 19) (29, 24) (10, 9) (10, 21) (10, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 3) (12, 21) (12, 4) (3, 7) (3, 26) (3, 4) (3, 27) (19, 29) (19, 27) (14, 26) (14, 28) (11, 20) (11, 4) (8, 1) (8, 16) (8, 18) (25, 23) (25, 16) (15, 23) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 24) (15, 2) (17, 23) (17, 28) (27, 1) (27, 3) (27, 19) (27, 16) (2, 13) (2, 20) (2, 15) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 15) (16, 8) (16, 25) (16, 27) (24, 22) (24, 9) (24, 29) (24, 15) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
Node 0: {21, 10, 5}
Node 1: {26, 27, 8}
Node 2: {13, 20, 15}
Node 3: {7, 26, 4, 27}
Node 4: {12, 11, 3}
Node 5: {13, 0, 15}
Node 6: {18, 20}
Node 7: {21, 3}
Node 8: {1, 16, 18}
Node 9: {24, 10}
Node 10: {9, 21, 0}
Node 11: {20, 4}
Node 12: {21, 4}
Node 13: {22, 5, 2, 29}
Node 14: {26, 28}
Node 15: {23, 5, 18, 24, 2}
Node 16: {8, 25, 27}
Node 17: {23, 28}
Node 18: {6, 8, 15}
Node 19: {29, 27}
Node 20: {6, 2, 11}
Node 21: {7, 10, 0, 12}
Node 22: {13, 23, 24}
Node 23: {22, 15, 17, 25}
Node 24: {22, 9, 29, 15}
Node 25: {23, 16}
Node 26: {1, 28, 14, 3}
Node 27: {1, 3, 19, 16}
Node 28: {26, 17, 14}
Node 29: {13, 19, 24}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed from those nodes:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 10: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 15: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 16: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 18: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 20: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 21: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 22: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 23: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 24: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 26: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 27: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 28: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 29: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 45 3-stars.
Thus, the final answer is [45].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<3, (7, 4, 26)>
<4, (12, 11, 3)>
<5, (13, 0, 15)>
<13, (22, 5, 29)>
<15, (23, 18, 24)>
<21, (7, 10, 12)>
<23, (22, 17, 25)>
<24, (22, 9, 29)>
<26, (1, 28, 3)>
<27, (1, 19, 16)>
