Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
From the given information, we can construct the graph and identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is insufficient to form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 55 \).   
So, the final answer is [55], and the unique 3-stars found are:   
<0, (1, 2, 8)>   
<0, (1, 2, 5)>  
<0, (1, 5, 6)>  
<0, (2, 5, 6)>  
<1, (0, 2, 5)>  
<1, (2, 5, 6)>  
<2, (0, 1, 5)>  
<2, (0, 5, 6)>  
<2, (5, 6, 9)>  
<3, (0, 4, 8)>  
<4, (3, 8, 9)>  
<5, (0, 1, 2)>  
<5, (1, 2, 6)>  
<5, (2, 6, 9)>  
<6, (1, 5, 6)>  
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
