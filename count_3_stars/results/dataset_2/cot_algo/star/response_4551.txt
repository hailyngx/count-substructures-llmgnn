Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 9) (17, 2) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 12) (3, 7) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 15) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 14) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 6) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 5) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 12) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 15) (5, 8) (5, 16) (5, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 5) (18, 1) (4, 3) (4, 11) (13, 9) (14, 10) (14, 15) (14, 19) (14, 16) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {16}
- Node 1: {9, 16, 6, 18}
- Node 2: {17, 8, 7}
- Node 3: {7, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 11}
- Node 5: {8, 16, 12}
- Node 6: {19, 1, 12}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 11, 15}
- Node 8: {2, 9, 19, 5, 12}
- Node 9: {17, 8, 1, 13}
- Node 10: {12, 19, 14}
- Node 11: {7, 4, 15}
- Node 12: {10, 8, 6, 5}
- Node 13: {9}
- Node 14: {10, 15, 19, 16}
- Node 15: {11, 7, 14}
- Node 16: {0, 1, 14, 5}
- Node 17: {9, 2}
- Node 18: {1}
- Node 19: {10, 8, 14, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [36]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
