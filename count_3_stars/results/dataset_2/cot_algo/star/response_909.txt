Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 2) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 14) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 10, 12, 2 (Degree: 5)
- Node 1: 13, 10, 11, 2 (Degree: 4)
- Node 2: 0, 1, 14 (Degree: 3)
- Node 3: 9, 8, 11, 12, 14 (Degree: 5)
- Node 4: 7, 12, 0, 5, 14 (Degree: 5)
- Node 5: 4, 7, 8 (Degree: 3)
- Node 6: 9, 14, 10 (Degree: 3)
- Node 7: 4, 12, 0, 9, 5 (Degree: 5)
- Node 8: 13, 5, 14, 11, 3 (Degree: 5)
- Node 9: 7, 6, 3 (Degree: 3)
- Node 10: 6, 11, 0, 1 (Degree: 4)
- Node 11: 8, 10, 3, 1 (Degree: 4)
- Node 12: 4, 7, 0, 3 (Degree: 4)
- Node 13: 8, 1 (Degree: 2)
- Node 14: 4, 6, 8, 3, 2 (Degree: 5)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [54].

Unique 3-stars found:
