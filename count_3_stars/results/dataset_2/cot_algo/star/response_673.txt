Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 23) (22, 17) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 12) (23, 13) (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 1) (25, 8) (25, 28) (12, 23) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 9) (12, 28) (27, 12) (27, 10) (27, 6) (0, 1) (0, 19) (5, 23) (5, 6) (5, 18) (6, 27) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (28, 25) (28, 12) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 10) (19, 0) (19, 29) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 15) (13, 23) (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 9) (18, 5) (18, 26) (8, 25) (8, 11) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 21) (10, 27) (10, 29) (21, 9) (21, 4) (21, 24) (4, 12) (4, 21) (11, 8) (11, 24) (24, 21) (24, 11) (24, 14) (15, 26) (15, 7) (15, 16) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (14, 20) (14, 24) (14, 3) (14, 7) (7, 20) (7, 15) (7, 14) (1, 25) (1, 0) (1, 13) (17, 22) (17, 23) (17, 2) (16, 15) (16, 2) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are neighbors to each node:

- Node 0: [1, 19]
- Node 1: [0, 13, 25]
- Node 2: [3, 6, 16, 17]
- Node 3: [2, 6, 14]
- Node 4: [12, 21]
- Node 5: [6, 18, 23]
- Node 6: [2, 3, 5, 27]
- Node 7: [14, 15, 20]
- Node 8: [11, 25]
- Node 9: [12, 13, 21]
- Node 10: [27, 29]
- Node 11: [8, 24]
- Node 12: [4, 9, 23, 27, 28]
- Node 13: [1, 9, 23, 26]
- Node 14: [3, 7, 20, 24]
- Node 15: [7, 16, 26]
- Node 16: [2, 15]
- Node 17: [2, 22, 23]
- Node 18: [5, 26]
- Node 19: [0, 29]
- Node 20: [7, 14, 25]
- Node 21: [4, 9, 24]
- Node 22: [17, 23]
- Node 23: [5, 12, 13, 17, 22]
- Node 24: [11, 14, 21]
- Node 25: [1, 8, 20, 28]
- Node 26: [13, 15, 18]
- Node 27: [6, 10, 12]
- Node 28: [12, 25, 29]
- Node 29: [10, 19, 28]

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes [4, 9, 28]: <12, (4, 9, 28)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes [1, 9, 23]: <13, (1, 9, 23)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes [7, 20, 24]: <14, (7, 20, 24)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes [7, 16, 26]: <15, (7, 16, 26)>
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with nodes [5, 12, 17]: <23, (5, 12, 17)>
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes [1, 20, 28]: <25, (1, 20, 28)>
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes [13, 15, 18]: <26, (13, 15, 18)>
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with nodes [6, 10, 12]: <27, (6, 10, 12)>
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes [9, 25, 29]: <28, (9, 25, 29)>

Counting up the unique 3-stars gives us a total of [9].
