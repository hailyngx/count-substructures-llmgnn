Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 0) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 10) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 10) (10, 12) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 11) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 1, 9, 13, 10}
- Node 1: {4, 3, 14, 5, 0}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 5, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 1, 14, 5}
- Node 4: {7, 0, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 2, 11}
- Node 6: {7, 9, 2, 13}
- Node 7: {4, 12, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {13, 2, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {6, 11, 14, 0}
- Node 10: {12, 0}	
- Node 11: {9, 8, 14, 5}
- Node 12: {7, 8, 10}
- Node 13: {6, 8, 0}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 9, 2, 11}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 64 \)

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [64].

Unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 14)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 11, 14)>, <3, (4, 7, 12)>, <3, (5, 11, 14)>, <4, (7, 12, 8)>, <5, (1, 11, 14)>.
