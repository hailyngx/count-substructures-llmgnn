Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 27) (15, 1) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 2) (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 8) (1, 15) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 13) (21, 27) (21, 0) (21, 29) (26, 1) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 17) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 26) (17, 29) (17, 25) (29, 21) (29, 17) (29, 23) (29, 11) (10, 4) (10, 23) (10, 5) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 9) (6, 1) (6, 25) (6, 16) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 22) (4, 2) (22, 3) (22, 4) (22, 11) (22, 24) (25, 17) (25, 6) (16, 5) (16, 6) (16, 24) (16, 20) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 8) (24, 9) (24, 13) (2, 27) (2, 4) (2, 13) (20, 26) (20, 16) (20, 18) (8, 0) (8, 24) (9, 19) (9, 24) (9, 7) (12, 14) (12, 18) (13, 1) (13, 24) (13, 2) (11, 26) (11, 29) (11, 22) (28, 7) (7, 9) (7, 28) (18, 20) (18, 12) (23, 29) (23, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

- Node 0: 27, 21, 8
- Node 1: 15, 26, 6, 13
- Node 2: 27, 4, 13
- Node 3: 15, 17, 22
- Node 4: 10, 19, 22, 2
- Node 5: 10, 19, 16
- Node 6: 1, 25, 16
- Node 7: 9, 28
- Node 8: 27, 0, 24
- Node 9: 19, 24, 7
- Node 10: 4, 23, 5
- Node 11: 26, 29, 22
- Node 12: 14, 18
- Node 13: 1, 24, 2
- Node 14: 12
- Node 15: 3, 27, 1
- Node 16: 5, 6, 24, 20
- Node 17: 3, 26, 29, 25
- Node 18: 20, 12
- Node 19: 5, 4, 9
- Node 20: 26, 16, 18
- Node 21: 27, 0, 29
- Node 22: 3, 4, 11, 24
- Node 23: 29, 10
- Node 24: 22, 16, 8, 9, 13
- Node 25: 17, 6
- Node 26: 1, 20, 11, 17
- Node 27: 15, 21, 0, 2
- Node 28: 7
- Node 29: 21, 17, 23, 11

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 29 (21 nodes)

Total number of 3-stars: \(\binom{21}{3} = 1330\)

Therefore, the final answer is [1330].
