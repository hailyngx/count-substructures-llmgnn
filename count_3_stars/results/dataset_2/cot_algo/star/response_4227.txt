Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 14) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 10) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 4) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 1) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 3) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 5) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:
```
Node 0 neighbors: 6, 8, 9, 13, 4
Node 1 neighbors: 8, 10, 14, 5
Node 2 neighbors: 10, 3, 11
Node 3 neighbors: 9, 4, 10, 5, 2
Node 4 neighbors: 9, 0, 11, 5, 3
Node 5 neighbors: 1, 11, 4, 3, 10
Node 6 neighbors: 9, 7, 10, 11, 0
Node 7 neighbors: 6, 9, 14
Node 8 neighbors: 13, 0, 11, 1
Node 9 neighbors: 6, 4, 3, 7, 0
Node 10 neighbors: 6, 1, 2, 3, 5
Node 11 neighbors: 6, 8, 2, 5, 4
Node 13 neighbors: 8, 14, 0
Node 14 neighbors: 13, 7, 1
```

Next, we look for nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form a total of \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form a total of \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form a total of \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form a total of \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form a total of \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form a total of \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get a total of \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 9, 13>, <0, 4, 11>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 10>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 10>, <4, 5, 10>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 14>, <6, 9, 10>, <6, 9, 11>, <6, 10, 11>, <9, 7, 14>, <9, 8, 13>, <9, 8, 11>, <9, 8, 1>, <9, 13, 14>, <9, 11, 4>, <9, 5, 10>, <5, 1, 8>, <5, 1, 14>, <5, 1, 10>, <5, 1, 11>, <5, 1, 4>, <5, 1, 3>, <5, 11, 4>, <5, 11, 3>, <5, 11, 10>, <5, 4, 3>, <5, 4, 10>, <5, 3, 10>.
