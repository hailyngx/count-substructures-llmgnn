Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 7, 3, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 4, 7, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 8, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 6, 0}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8, 1, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 6, 0, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 9, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 4, 0, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 1, 6, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 2, 1}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1, 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4, 3-stars: There are 4 neighbors, so 4 choose 3 is 4, since this node has exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 6, 3-stars: There are 5 neighbors, so 5 choose 3 is 10.
- Node 8, 3-stars: There are 4 neighbors, so 4 choose 3 is 4, since this node has exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 9, 3-stars: There are 4 neighbors, so 4 choose 3 is 4, since this node has exactly 3 neighbors.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the final answer is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- <9, (5, 6, 2)>
