Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 8) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 1) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 13) (15, 3) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 2) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 8) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 12) (13, 3) (19, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (17, 16) (17, 0) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 8) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 14) (14, 9) (14, 18) (14, 1) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 18) (8, 12) (7, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {10, 17, 5}
- Node 1: {11, 16, 10, 14}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 12}
- Node 3: {11, 15, 13}
- Node 4: {6, 9, 18, 2}
- Node 5: {0, 19, 12}
- Node 6: {9, 18, 8, 4}
- Node 7: {10}
- Node 8: {11, 6, 18, 12}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 2, 14, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 7, 1}
- Node 11: {3, 1, 8}
- Node 12: {16, 9, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 13: {3}
- Node 14: {9, 1, 18}
- Node 15: {3}
- Node 16: {12, 17, 1}
- Node 17: {16, 0}
- Node 18: {6, 4, 14, 8}
- Node 19: {5}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: Has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 1: Has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: Has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 3: Has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 4: Has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: Has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 6: Has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: Has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: Has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10: Has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 11: Has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 12: Has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14: Has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 16: Has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 18: Has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the final answer is [36], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (10, 14, 16)>, <4, (2, 6, 18)>, <4, (6, 9, 18)>, <4, (18, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 9, 18)>, <6, (9, 4, 18)>, <6, (18, 4, 8)>, <8, (6, 12, 18)>, <9, (4, 12, 14)>, <9, (6, 12, 14)>, <9, (12, 2, 5)>, <9, (12, 5, 14)>.
