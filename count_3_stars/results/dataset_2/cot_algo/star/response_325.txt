Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 5) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 11) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 16) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 0) (17, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 7) (18, 19) (18, 0) (19, 18) (19, 16) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 2) (14, 11) (7, 1) (7, 11) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 0) (12, 1) (12, 0) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 5) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 5) (5, 15) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 0) 

Response:
There are 18 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. 

For these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars based on their neighbor sets:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 66. 

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [66]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
