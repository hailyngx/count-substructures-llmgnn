Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 16) (4, 7) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 16) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (10, 3) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 18) (16, 9) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 15) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 19) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 19) (17, 9) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 11) (1, 5) (1, 11) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 17) (11, 1) (11, 18) (2, 4) (2, 17) (19, 0) (19, 6) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 18) (14, 13) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {11, 12, 19}
- Node 1: {5, 11}
- Node 2: {4, 17}
- Node 3: {6, 10, 18}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 17}
- Node 5: {1, 9, 12}
- Node 6: {3, 17, 19}
- Node 7: {4, 12, 16}
- Node 8: {13, 16}
- Node 9: {5, 15, 16, 17}
- Node 10: {3}
- Node 11: {0, 17, 18, 1}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 13: {8, 14, 16}
- Node 14: {13}
- Node 15: {9, 16, 18}
- Node 16: {7, 8, 9, 13, 15}
- Node 17: {2, 4, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 18: {3, 11, 15}
- Node 19: {0, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 9 forms 4 3-stars: <9, (5, 15, 16)>, <9, (5, 17, 16)>, <9, (15, 16, 17)>, <9, (5, 15, 17)>
- Node 11 forms 4 3-stars: <11, (0, 17, 18)>, <11, (1, 17, 18)>, <11, (12, 17, 18)>, <11, (17, 18, 15)>
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star: <12, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star: <16, (7, 8, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
