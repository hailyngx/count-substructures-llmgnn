Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 1 neighbors: 0, 4
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3 neighbors: 6, 8, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 7 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8 neighbors: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 53

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [53].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 4, 5, 9>
- <0, 4, 7, 9>
- <0, 5, 7, 9>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <7, 8, 9>
