Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 11) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 5) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 10) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 12) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 11
- Node 1: 5, 7, 9, 11
- Node 2: 0, 4, 11, 14
- Node 3: 8, 13
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 13
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7, 11, 12
- Node 6: 4, 8, 13
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8, 10, 14
- Node 8: 3, 6, 7, 11
- Node 9: 1, 10, 11, 13, 14
- Node 10: 7, 9, 12, 13
- Node 11: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 12: 5, 10, 14
- Node 13: 3, 4, 6, 9, 10
- Node 14: 2, 7, 9, 12

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 62

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [62].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (5, 7, 11)>
- <2, (0, 11, 14)>
- <5, (1, 7, 11)>
- <7, (1, 5, 11)>
- <9, (1, 10, 13)>
- <10, (7, 9, 13)>
- <11, (1, 5, 8)>
