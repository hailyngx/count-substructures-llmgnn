Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 26) (11, 25) (16, 17) (16, 29) (16, 23) (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (29, 16) (29, 17) (29, 1) (1, 2) (1, 29) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 24) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 23) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 9) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 24) (17, 16) (17, 29) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 21) (26, 11) (26, 13) (26, 19) (21, 19) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 19) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 28) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 27) (14, 4) (25, 11) (25, 22) (25, 18) (27, 14) (27, 22) (27, 10) (6, 15) (6, 14) (24, 8) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 10) (18, 19) (18, 25) (18, 23) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 0) (22, 14) (22, 25) (22, 27) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 23) (10, 2) (10, 27) (10, 24) (23, 16) (23, 13) (23, 18) (23, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 15, 23}
- Node 1: {2, 29}
- Node 2: {1, 9, 10}
- Node 3: {5, 12, 15}
- Node 4: {0, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 11, 19}
- Node 6: {14, 15}
- Node 7: {9, 12, 15, 24}
- Node 8: {9, 13, 24}
- Node 9: {7, 8, 28, 2, 10}
- Node 10: {9, 24, 27, 2}
- Node 11: {5, 25, 26}
- Node 12: {3, 4, 7, 24}
- Node 13: {8, 23, 26}
- Node 14: {4, 6, 22, 27}
- Node 15: {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 16: {17, 23, 29}
- Node 17: {16, 29}
- Node 18: {19, 23, 25}
- Node 19: {5, 18, 21, 26}
- Node 21: {19, 28}
- Node 22: {4, 14, 25, 27}
- Node 23: {0, 13, 16, 18}
- Node 24: {7, 10, 12, 8}
- Node 25: {11, 18, 22}
- Node 26: {11, 13, 19}
- Node 27: {10, 14, 22}
- Node 28: {21, 9}
- Node 29: {1, 16, 17}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 2 neighbors, cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors, cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [46]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 4, 15>, <2, 9, 28>, <3, 7, 15>, <5, 11, 19>, <9, 10, 24>, <12, 7, 24>, <12, 4, 14>, <12, 3, 24>, <14, 4, 22>, <16, 17, 29>, 
<18, 19, 25>, <22, 4, 27>, <22, 14, 25>, <22, 14, 27>, <22, 25, 27>, <23, 0, 18>, <23, 0, 13>, <23, 0, 16>, <24, 7, 10>, <25, 11, 18>.
