Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 6) (14, 12) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: {8, 1, 6, 10, 2}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 13, 0}
- Node 2: {8, 6, 3, 0}
- Node 3: {2, 14, 6}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 13}
- Node 5: {9, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {12, 2, 0, 11, 3}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 12}
- Node 8: {13, 4, 2, 10, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 1, 11, 10, 7}
- Node 10: {9, 8, 13, 0, 14}
- Node 11: {9, 14, 6}
- Node 12: {7, 14, 6}
- Node 13: {8, 4, 1, 10}
- Node 14: {12, 10, 11, 3, 6}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. [\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars]
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. [\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars]
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. [\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars]
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. [\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars]
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. [\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars]
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. [\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars]
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. [\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars]
Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. [\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars]
Node 11 has 3 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. [\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars]
Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. [\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars]

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52].
