Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 14) (14, 15) (14, 18) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 17) (9, 6) (9, 1) (2, 13) (2, 7) (18, 14) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 10) (4, 17) (4, 6) (4, 10) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 2) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (19, 11) (19, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 19) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 2) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {1, 3, 8}
Node 1: {0, 9, 12, 13, 15}
Node 2: {7, 13}
Node 3: {0, 5, 6}
Node 4: {6, 10, 17}
Node 5: {3, 6, 10, 11, 17}
Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 9}
Node 7: {2}
Node 8: {0, 11, 12}
Node 9: {1, 6, 17}
Node 10: {4, 5}
Node 11: {5, 8, 12, 16, 19}
Node 12: {1, 8, 11, 19}
Node 13: {1, 2, 15, 16}
Node 14: {15, 18}
Node 15: {1, 13, 14}
Node 16: {11, 13}
Node 17: {4, 5, 9}
Node 18: {14}
Node 19: {11, 12}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: Node 0, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, Node 12

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
\[ \text{Node 0: } \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \text{Node 5: } \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Node 6: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Node 8: } \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \text{Node 12: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 10)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 11, 12)>
<12, (1, 8, 19)>
