Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 11) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 8, 14, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 6, 12}
- Node 2: {9, 13}
- Node 3: {10, 11}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 13}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 7, 12}
- Node 11: {3, 5, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 4, 6, 10}
- Node 13: {2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 11}

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:
From the neighbors list above, we see that nodes 0, 6, and 13 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate \( \binom{4}{3} \) for each of them.

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 20 + 20 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 14)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 8, 13)>
<6, (1, 12, 4)>
<6, (7, 8, 13)>
<6, (9, 7, 13)>
<13, (2, 5, 11)>
<13, (2, 6, 8)>
<13, (2, 6, 11)>
<13, (2, 6, 5)>
<13, (5, 4, 11)>
<13, (5, 6, 11)>
