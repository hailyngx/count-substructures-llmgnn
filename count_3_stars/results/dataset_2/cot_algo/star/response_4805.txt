Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 5) (15, 27) (15, 5) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 23) (27, 6) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 12) (28, 16) (28, 1) (29, 10) (29, 5) (7, 12) (7, 20) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 7) (9, 22) (9, 24) (9, 3) (9, 1) (22, 9) (22, 19) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 27) (4, 3) (4, 20) (20, 7) (20, 4) (20, 21) (20, 24) (14, 11) (14, 26) (14, 13) (26, 14) (26, 21) (6, 27) (6, 24) (6, 2) (24, 9) (24, 20) (24, 6) (24, 8) (19, 22) (19, 0) (25, 8) (18, 16) (18, 13) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 29) (5, 23) (23, 27) (23, 5) (23, 1) (1, 11) (1, 28) (1, 9) (1, 23) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 25) (8, 0) (21, 20) (21, 26) (13, 14) (13, 18) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {17, 19, 2, 8}
- Node 1: {11, 28, 9, 23}
- Node 2: {10, 6, 0}
- Node 3: {11, 9, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {27, 3, 20}
- Node 5: {16, 15, 29, 23}
- Node 6: {27, 24, 2}
- Node 7: {12, 20}
- Node 8: {3, 24, 25, 0}
- Node 9: {22, 24, 3, 1}
- Node 10: {17, 2, 29}
- Node 11: {3, 14, 1, 2}
- Node 12: {15, 17, 7}
- Node 13: {14, 18}
- Node 14: {11, 26, 13}
- Node 15: {27, 5, 12}
- Node 16: {28, 5}
- Node 17: {10, 12, 0}
- Node 18: {16, 13}
- Node 19: {22, 0}
- Node 20: {7, 4, 21, 24}
- Node 21: {20, 26}
- Node 22: {9, 19}
- Node 23: {27, 5, 1}
- Node 24: {9, 20, 6, 8}
- Node 25: {8}
- Node 26: {14, 21}
- Node 27: {15, 4, 23, 6}
- Node 28: {16, 1}
- Node 29: {10, 5}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 20, 24, 27.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 1: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 2: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 3: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 4: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 5: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 6: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 8: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 9: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 10: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 11: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 12: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 20: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 24: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 27: C(4, 3) = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 39

Therefore, the final answer is [39].

Unique 3-stars: <0, 17, 19>, <1, 11, 23>, <2, 10, 6>, <3, 11, 9>, <4, 27, 20>, <5, 16, 29>, <6, 24, 27>, <8, 3, 24>, <9, 22, 24>, <10, 17, 29>, <11, 14, 1>, <12, 15, 7>, <20, 7, 21>, <24, 20, 6>, <27, 15, 5>.
