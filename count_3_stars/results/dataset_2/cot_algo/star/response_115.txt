Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Given the provided graph, let's first find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 7, 8}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors: Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 62, so the final answer is [62].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <4, 8, 9>
- <4, 9, 9>
- <8, 9, 9>
