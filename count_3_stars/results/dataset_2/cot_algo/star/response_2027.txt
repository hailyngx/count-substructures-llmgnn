Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 3) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Given the provided graph, we will first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 7, 8
Node 2 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 9, 11
Node 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 12, 13, 14
Node 4 neighbors: 7, 11, 12, 13
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 9
Node 6 neighbors: 2, 5, 11, 12, 14
Node 7 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 10
Node 8 neighbors: 1, 13
Node 9 neighbors: 2, 5, 12
Node 10 neighbors: 7, 12, 14
Node 11 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 13
Node 12 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 9, 10
Node 13 neighbors: 3, 4, 8, 11, 14
Node 14 neighbors: 3, 6, 10, 13

This graph does not contain any node with less than 3 neighbors. We will now calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 62. 

Therefore, the final answer is [62] and the unique 3-stars found are: 

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 11>

<4, 7, 13>
<4, 11, 13>
<5, 6, 11>
<5, 6, 12>
<5, 9, 12>
<6, 11, 12>
<6, 11, 14>
