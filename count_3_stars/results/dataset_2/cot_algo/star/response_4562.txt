Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 4, 7, 3, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 4, 3, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 1, 6, 2, 8, 0}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 9, 4, 3, 6, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 6, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8, 2, 1, 7}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 72 \)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [72]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>
