Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 46

Therefore, the final answer is [46].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
