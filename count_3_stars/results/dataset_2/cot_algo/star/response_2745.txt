Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {7, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors to count the 3-star formations:
- Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars
- Node 3: has 6 neighbors, so it forms 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
- Node 7: has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars
- Node 8: has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars
- Node 9: has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars

Counting all the 3-stars from the nodes with three or more neighbors, we get 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 78.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [78].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 8, 9>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <7, 8, 9>
