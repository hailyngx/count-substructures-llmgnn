Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 26) (22, 23) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 14) (23, 10) (23, 0) (23, 12) (8, 4) (8, 22) (8, 24) (6, 4) (6, 28) (6, 26) (28, 6) (28, 16) (17, 29) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 0) (17, 21) (29, 17) (29, 11) (26, 7) (26, 6) (26, 10) (26, 25) (16, 28) (16, 2) (16, 5) (13, 17) (25, 17) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 5) (27, 25) (27, 9) (11, 29) (11, 5) (14, 23) (10, 23) (10, 26) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 20) (0, 23) (0, 17) (0, 10) (0, 2) (24, 22) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 15) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 24) (15, 18) (2, 16) (2, 0) (2, 24) (2, 9) (2, 20) (9, 27) (9, 2) (9, 21) (9, 20) (12, 23) (21, 17) (21, 9) (1, 10) (1, 18) (20, 22) (20, 10) (20, 2) (20, 9) (5, 16) (5, 25) (5, 11) (18, 7) (18, 15) (18, 1) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {7, 8, 6, 15}
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {4, 15, 18, 26}
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: {23, 20, 24, 8}
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors: {22, 14, 10, 0, 12}
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {4, 22, 24}
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {4, 28, 26}
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors: {29, 13, 25, 0, 21}
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: {17, 11, 25}
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: {7, 6, 10, 25}
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: {28, 2, 5}
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors: {17, 26, 27, 5}
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: {16, 0, 24, 9, 20}
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: {23, 26, 0, 1, 20}
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {23, 17, 10, 2}
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: {4, 7, 24, 18}
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {27, 2, 21, 20}
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: {22, 10, 2, 9}
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {16, 25, 11}
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: {7, 15, 1}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node and then sum them up:

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 68

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [68].
