Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 2) (0, 14) (0, 12) (3, 16) (3, 12) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 6) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 4) (13, 1) (13, 7) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 10) (15, 14) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 18) (8, 17) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 7) (18, 19) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (7, 13) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 16) (7, 9) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 4) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 2) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 16) (9, 7) (9, 12) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {12, 14}
- Node 1: {2, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 14, 17}
- Node 3: {12, 16}
- Node 4: {5, 10, 16}
- Node 5: {4, 11, 19}
- Node 6: {2, 11, 17}
- Node 7: {8, 10, 13, 16, 9}
- Node 8: {10, 11, 17, 7}
- Node 9: {7, 12}
- Node 10: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 11: {5, 6, 8, 19}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 9, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 7}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 12, 15}
- Node 15: {14}
- Node 16: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 17: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 18: {19}
- Node 19: {5, 11, 18}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 15, 18
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors (counting how many 3-stars can be formed):
  - Node 1: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Total number of 3-stars: 3

Therefore, the final answer is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (12, 14, 15)>, <1, (2, 10, 13)>, <18, (19, 11, 5)>.
