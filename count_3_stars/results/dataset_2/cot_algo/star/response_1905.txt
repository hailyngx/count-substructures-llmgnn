Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 20) (14, 16) (17, 25) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 5) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 1) (3, 13) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 24) (25, 17) (25, 6) (25, 2) (23, 13) (23, 2) (23, 24) (28, 8) (28, 7) (29, 27) (29, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 9) (26, 18) (26, 24) (26, 11) (24, 3) (24, 23) (24, 26) (24, 5) (6, 18) (6, 25) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 16) (21, 6) (21, 12) (21, 8) (21, 2) (16, 14) (16, 6) (16, 15) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 24) (11, 3) (11, 26) (11, 19) (11, 8) (1, 18) (1, 0) (1, 6) (8, 28) (8, 21) (8, 11) (8, 27) (7, 28) (7, 10) (19, 17) (19, 11) (27, 29) (27, 8) (12, 0) (12, 21) (20, 22) (20, 9) (15, 18) (15, 16) (15, 2) (10, 7) (10, 4) (2, 25) (2, 23) (2, 21) (2, 15) (4, 29) (4, 10) (9, 0) (9, 20) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 9, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 18}
- Node 2: {15, 21, 23, 25}
- Node 3: {5, 11, 13, 17, 24}
- Node 4: {10, 29}
- Node 5: {3, 13, 17, 24}
- Node 6: {1, 16, 18, 21, 25}
- Node 7: {8, 10, 28}
- Node 8: {11, 21, 27, 28}
- Node 9: {0, 20}
- Node 10: {4, 7}
- Node 11: {3, 8, 19, 26}
- Node 12: {0, 21}
- Node 13: {3, 5, 22, 23}
- Node 14: {16}
- Node 15: {2, 16, 18}
- Node 16: {6, 14, 15}
- Node 17: {3, 5, 11, 19, 25}
- Node 18: {1, 6, 15, 22, 26}
- Node 19: {11, 17}
- Node 20: {9, 22}
- Node 21: {2, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 22: {13, 18, 20}
- Node 23: {2, 13, 24}
- Node 24: {3, 5, 23, 26}
- Node 25: {2, 6, 17}
- Node 26: {11, 18, 24}
- Node 27: {8, 29}
- Node 28: {7, 8}
- Node 29: {4, 27}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
\[ 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 68 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
- <3, (5, 13, 17)>
- <3, (5, 13, 24)>
- <3, (11, 17, 19)>
- <3, (13, 22, 23)>
- <5, (3, 13, 24)>
- <6, (1, 16, 18)>
- <8, (11, 27, 28)>
- <15, (2, 16, 18)>
- <17, (3, 5, 11)>
- <18, (6, 15, 26)>
- <21, (2, 6, 12)>
- <22, (13, 18, 20)>
