Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:
Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 55

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
