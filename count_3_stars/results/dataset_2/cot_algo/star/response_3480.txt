Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 25) (5, 22) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 27) (6, 9) (6, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 24) (0, 5) (0, 20) (0, 11) (0, 26) (0, 13) (20, 9) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 7) (20, 23) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 10) (24, 8) (24, 1) (24, 29) (26, 0) (26, 14) (26, 11) (26, 3) (17, 20) (17, 28) (17, 27) (17, 18) (16, 28) (16, 14) (28, 17) (28, 16) (28, 15) (10, 2) (10, 18) (21, 12) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 16) (3, 26) (3, 13) (7, 6) (7, 20) (7, 13) (1, 2) (1, 24) (1, 29) (1, 11) (1, 13) (29, 24) (29, 1) (29, 25) (29, 23) (11, 0) (11, 26) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 2) (19, 11) (19, 23) (22, 5) (22, 12) (27, 9) (27, 17) (18, 17) (18, 10) (18, 15) (25, 5) (25, 29) (25, 15) (12, 21) (12, 22) (15, 28) (15, 18) (15, 25) (23, 20) (23, 29) (23, 19) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are as follows: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}.

Let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 13, 20, 26, 11}
- Node 1: {2, 11, 24, 13, 29}
- Node 2: {1, 8, 19, 10}
- Node 3: {26, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 25, 22}
- Node 6: {9, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 20, 13}
- Node 8: {2, 14, 24}
- Node 9: {6, 20, 27}
- Node 10: {2, 18}
- Node 11: {0, 26, 1, 19}
- Node 12: {21, 22}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 7, 1}
- Node 14: {8, 26, 16}
- Node 15: {28, 18, 25}
- Node 16: {14, 28}
- Node 17: {20, 27, 18, 28}
- Node 18: {10, 17, 15}
- Node 19: {2, 11, 23}
- Node 20: {0, 7, 9, 17, 23}
- Node 21: {12, 22}
- Node 22: {5, 12, 22}
- Node 23: {20, 19, 29}
- Node 24: {8, 1, 29}
- Node 25: {5, 15, 29}
- Node 26: {0, 14, 3, 11}
- Node 27: {9, 17}
- Node 28: {15, 16, 17}
- Node 29: {1, 23, 24, 25}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 20 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <20, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <2, (1, 8, 10)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <1, (2, 11, 24)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <8, (2, 14, 24)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <14, (8, 16, 26)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <18, (10, 15, 17)>
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <28, (15, 16, 17)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <12, (21, 22, 22)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <22, (5, 12, 22)>
  
Total number of 3-stars: [9].
