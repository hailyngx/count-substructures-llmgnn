Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 8}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 66

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [66].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 5, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 7, 8>
<6, 1, 3, 4>
<7, 2, 5, 8>
