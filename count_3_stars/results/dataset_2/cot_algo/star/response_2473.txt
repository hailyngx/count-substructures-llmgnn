Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 7) (2, 18) (2, 8) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 12) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 15) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 14) (6, 5) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 7) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 15) (19, 1) (19, 16) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 19) (9, 13) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 7) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 1) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 19) (1, 12) (13, 9) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can start by identifying the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 10, 17, 4, 12
- Node 1: 14, 5, 19, 12
- Node 2: 18, 8
- Node 3: 4, 11, 16
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 17, 6, 1, 15
- Node 6: 10, 18, 14, 5
- Node 7: 17, 11, 15
- Node 8: 2, 16, 15
- Node 9: 13
- Node 10: 0, 17, 6
- Node 11: 14, 3, 7
- Node 12: 18, 0, 1
- Node 13: 9
- Node 14: 11, 6, 1
- Node 15: 8, 5, 7
- Node 16: 17, 3, 8, 19
- Node 17: 10, 16, 0, 5, 7
- Node 18: 2, 6, 12
- Node 19: 1, 16

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is:
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 32 \]

Therefore, the final answer is [32], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (10, 17, 4)>
<1, (14, 5, 19)>
<5, (17, 6, 15)>
<6, (10, 18, 14)>
<7, (17, 11, 15)>
<8, (2, 16, 15)>
<10, (0, 17, 6)>
<11, (14, 3, 7)>
<12, (18, 0, 1)>
<14, (11, 6, 1)>
<16, (17, 3, 8)>
<17, (10, 16, 0)>
<17, (16, 3, 8)>
<17, (0, 5, 7)>
<17, (7, 11, 15)>
<18, (2, 6, 12)>
