Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 9) (13, 18) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 20) (4, 7) (4, 25) (4, 29) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 24) (7, 1) (10, 22) (10, 11) (10, 27) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 27) (11, 25) (11, 17) (12, 27) (12, 0) (27, 10) (27, 11) (27, 12) (27, 20) (1, 7) (1, 26) (1, 28) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 2) (2, 26) (2, 5) (2, 21) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 6) (19, 26) (19, 17) (19, 28) (19, 9) (23, 11) (23, 26) (3, 28) (3, 6) (28, 1) (28, 19) (28, 3) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 16) (24, 7) (24, 0) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 6) (5, 22) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 16) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 29) (15, 21) (0, 12) (0, 24) (0, 15) (14, 18) (18, 13) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 21) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 18) (29, 4) (29, 15) (20, 22) (20, 27) (25, 4) (25, 11) (21, 2) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 18) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {12, 24, 15}
- Node 1: {7, 26, 28}
- Node 2: {5, 21, 26}
- Node 3: {6, 28}
- Node 4: {7, 25, 29}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 22}
- Node 6: {3, 8, 17}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 15, 24}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 21}
- Node 9: {13, 16, 19}
- Node 10: {11, 22, 27}
- Node 11: {10, 17, 25, 27}
- Node 12: {0, 27}
- Node 13: {9, 18}
- Node 14: {18}
- Node 15: {0, 7, 15, 21, 29}
- Node 16: {6, 9, 18}
- Node 17: {6, 11, 19}
- Node 18: {13, 14, 16, 21}
- Node 19: {9, 17, 26, 28}
- Node 20: {22, 27}
- Node 21: {2, 8, 15, 18}
- Node 22: {5, 10, 20}
- Node 23: {11, 26}
- Node 24: {0, 7}
- Node 25: {4, 11}
- Node 26: {1, 2, 19, 23}
- Node 27: {10, 11, 12, 20}
- Node 28: {1, 3, 19}
- Node 29: {4, 15}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: <1, (7, 26, 28)>
- Node 5: <5, (2, 8, 22)>
- Node 6: <6, (8, 17, 21)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 15, 24)>
- Node 9: <9, (13, 16, 19)>
- Node 11: <11, (17, 25, 27)>
- Node 15: <15, (7, 21, 29)>
- Node 18: <18, (13, 16, 21)>
- Node 19: <19, (17, 26, 28)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
