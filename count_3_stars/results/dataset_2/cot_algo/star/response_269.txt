Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-star formations:

- Node 3, 4, 7, 9, 14, 19, 20, 21, 26, 27, 28, 29 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-star formations:

- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
  - Node 14 forms 1 3-star: <14, (20, 28, 29)>
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
  - Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, (7, 20, 25)>, <3, (7, 20, 28)>, <3, (20, 25, 28)>, <3, (7, 25, 28)>
  - Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <4, (16, 18, 27)>, <4, (16, 20, 27)>, <4, (18, 20, 27)>, <4, (16, 18, 20)>
  - Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <7, (3, 9, 24)>, <7, (15, 9, 24)>, <7, (3, 15, 24)>, <7, (3, 9, 15)>, <7, (15, 16, 24)>, <7, (15, 20, 24)>, <7, (16, 20, 24)>, <7, (3, 15, 16)>, <7, (3, 16, 24)>, <7, (9, 16, 24)>
  - Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <9, (18, 21, 27)>, <9, (18, 29, 27)>, <9, (21, 29, 27)>, <9, (18, 21, 29)>, <9, (18, 21, 7)>, <9, (21, 27, 29)>, <9, (27, 28, 29)>, <9, (18, 28, 29)>, <9, (18, 27, 28)>, <9, (21, 27, 28)>
  - Node 19 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <19, (11, 23, 25)>, <19, (11, 10, 25)>, <19, (10, 23, 25)>, <19, (11, 23, 10)>, <19, (23, 25, 2)>, <19, (2, 11, 25)>, <19, (2, 10, 25)>, <19, (2, 23, 25)>, <19, (2, 23, 11)>, <19, (2, 11, 10)>
  - Node 20 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <20, (3, 10, 14)>, <20, (3, 14, 28)>, <20, (10, 14, 29)>, <20, (3, 10, 29)>
  - Node 21 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <21, (9, 26, 29)>, <21, (9, 21, 26)>, <21, (9, 21, 29)>, <21, (26, 28, 29)>
  - Node 26 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <26, (12, 21, 29)>, <26, (12, 6, 29)>, <26, (6, 21, 29)>, <26, (12, 21, 29)>
  - Node 27 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <27, (5, 9, 15)>, <27, (5, 9, 27)>, <27, (5, 15, 27)>, <27, (9, 15, 27)>
  - Node 28 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <28, (14, 20, 29)>, <28, (14, 27, 29)>, <28, (14, 20, 29)>, <28, (20, 27, 29)>
  - Node 29 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <29, (12, 14, 21)>, <29, (12, 14, 26)>, <29, (12, 21, 26)>, <29, (14, 21, 26)>, <29, (9, 14, 29)>, <29, (9, 21, 29)>, <29, (14, 21, 29)>, <29, (9, 14, 21)>, <29, (9, 12, 26)>, <29, (14, 26, 21)>

Adding up all the unique 3-star formations, the total count is 1 (from node 14) + 4 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 7) + 10 (from node 9) + 10 (from node 19) + 4 (from node 20) + 4 (from node 21) + 4 (from node 26) + 4 (from node 27) + 4 (from node 28) + 10 (from node 29) = 65.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [65].
