The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 21) (7, 14) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 18) (21, 17) (21, 7) (22, 9) (22, 5) (22, 10) (23, 11) (23, 26) (23, 18) (9, 22) (9, 2) (9, 3) (26, 23) (26, 28) (26, 27) (28, 26) (28, 19) (28, 5) (28, 10) (28, 25) (20, 8) (20, 4) (20, 24) (6, 8) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 12) (16, 27) (11, 23) (11, 4) (11, 29) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 2) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 0) (1, 0) (1, 25) (1, 13) (29, 11) (29, 4) (29, 18) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 22) (5, 28) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 25) (27, 26) (27, 16) (18, 7) (18, 23) (18, 15) (18, 29) (18, 5) (8, 14) (8, 20) (8, 6) (19, 28) (19, 24) (25, 28) (25, 1) (25, 5) (12, 15) (12, 13) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 12) (24, 7) (24, 20) (24, 19) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 14) (4, 20) (4, 11) (4, 29) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: {1, 2, 10}
- Node 1 neighbors: {0, 13, 25}
- Node 2 neighbors: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 3 neighbors: {4, 9}
- Node 4 neighbors: {3, 11, 14, 20, 29}
- Node 5 neighbors: {2, 5, 18, 22, 25, 28}
- Node 6 neighbors: {8}
- Node 7 neighbors: {14, 18, 21, 24}
- Node 8 neighbors: {6, 14, 20}
- Node 9 neighbors: {2, 3, 22}
- Node 10 neighbors: {0, 22, 28}
- Node 11 neighbors: {4, 23, 29}
- Node 12 neighbors: {13, 15}
- Node 13 neighbors: {1, 12, 15}
- Node 14 neighbors: {4, 7, 8, 17}
- Node 15 neighbors: {12, 13, 18}
- Node 16 neighbors: {27}
- Node 17 neighbors: {14, 21}
- Node 18 neighbors: {5, 7, 15, 18, 23, 29}
- Node 19 neighbors: {24, 28}
- Node 20 neighbors: {4, 8, 20, 24}
- Node 21 neighbors: {7, 17}
- Node 22 neighbors: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 23 neighbors: {11, 18, 26}
- Node 24 neighbors: {7, 19, 20}
- Node 25 neighbors: {1, 5, 28}
- Node 26 neighbors: {23, 27, 28}
- Node 27 neighbors: {16, 26}
- Node 28 neighbors: {5, 10, 19, 25, 26}
- Node 29 neighbors: {4, 11, 18}

Next, let's determine the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 8, 17, 19, 24
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 5, 18, 28

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: Only node 17 can form a 3-star, so we have 1 additional 3-star.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
  - Node 5 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
  - Node 18 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
  - Node 28 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total 3-stars = 1 (from node 17) + 20 (from node 5) + 20 (from node 18) + 10 (from node 28) = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [51].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <17, (14, 21, 7)>
- <5, (2, 22, 28)>
- <18, (5, 23, 29)>
- <28, (10, 19, 25)>
