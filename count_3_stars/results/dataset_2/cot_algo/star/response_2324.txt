Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, we will list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors, inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, no 3-star formed
- Node 2: 4 neighbors, no 3-star formed
- Node 3: 4 neighbors, no 3-star formed
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, no 3-star formed
- Node 5: 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, no 3-star formed
- Node 7: 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed
- Node 8: 6 neighbors, inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, no 3-star formed

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 20 = 31

Therefore, the final answer is [31], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
