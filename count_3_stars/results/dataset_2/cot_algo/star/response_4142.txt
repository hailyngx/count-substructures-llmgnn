Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 26) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 23) (16, 9) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 28) (5, 7) (5, 20) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 3) (4, 25) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 14) (15, 27) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 2) (27, 6) (0, 12) (0, 6) (20, 5) (20, 17) (2, 16) (2, 15) (2, 27) (2, 18) (2, 25) (18, 2) (18, 6) (12, 0) (12, 28) (12, 22) (28, 5) (28, 12) (26, 11) (26, 10) (26, 8) (17, 20) (17, 13) (1, 13) (1, 22) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 10) (23, 16) (13, 17) (13, 1) (10, 26) (10, 19) (10, 21) (10, 22) (21, 19) (21, 10) (21, 22) (21, 29) (24, 11) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 29) (3, 9) (3, 7) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 22) (22, 12) (22, 1) (22, 10) (22, 21) (22, 14) (8, 26) (8, 24) (8, 29) (6, 27) (6, 0) (6, 18) (6, 25) (29, 21) (29, 24) (29, 8) (25, 4) (25, 2) (25, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {12, 6}
- Node 1: {13, 22}
- Node 2: {16, 15, 27, 18, 25}
- Node 3: {9, 7}
- Node 4: {25}
- Node 5: {9, 19, 28, 7, 20}
- Node 6: {27, 0, 18, 25}
- Node 7: {5, 3, 14}
- Node 8: {26, 24, 29}
- Node 9: {16, 5, 24, 14, 3}
- Node 10: {26, 19, 21, 22}
- Node 11: {16, 24, 26}
- Node 12: {0, 28, 22}
- Node 13: {17, 1}
- Node 14: {9, 7, 22}
- Node 15: {27, 2}
- Node 16: {11, 2, 23, 9}
- Node 17: {13, 20}
- Node 18: {2, 6}
- Node 19: {5, 21, 10}
- Node 20: {5, 17}
- Node 21: {19, 10, 22, 29}
- Node 22: {12, 1, 10, 21, 14}
- Node 23: {16}
- Node 24: {11, 9, 8, 29}
- Node 25: {4, 2, 6}
- Node 26: {11, 8, 10}
- Node 27: {15, 2, 6}
- Node 28: {5, 12}
- Node 29: {21, 24, 8}

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors: Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9, Node 10, Node 16, Node 22, and Node 24.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 57

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 57, which can be represented as [57]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (15, 18, 25)>, <2, (16, 23, 9)>, <5, (19, 10, 21)>, <6, (0, 12, 28)>, <7, (5, 3, 14)>, <9, (3, 7, 14)>, <10, (19, 21, 29)>, <16, (2, 23, 9)>, <16, (11, 24, 26)>, <22, (1, 10, 21)>.
