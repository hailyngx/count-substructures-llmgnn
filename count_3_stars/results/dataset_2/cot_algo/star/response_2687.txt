Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
Node 1: Neighbors {5, 9}
Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7}
Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 8}
Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 6}
Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 8}
Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 7, 9}
Node 9: Neighbors {1, 6, 8}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:
Node 0, 6 3-stars: [1]
Node 2, 5 3-stars: [1]
Node 3, 4 3-stars: [1]
Node 4, 4 3-stars: [1]
Node 5, 4 3-stars: [1]
Node 8, 5 3-stars: [1]
Node 6 doesn't have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
Node 1 and Node 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so they don't form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us: [6]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
