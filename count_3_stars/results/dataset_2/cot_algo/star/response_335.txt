Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 3) (9, 27) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 29) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 8) (0, 7) (0, 20) (0, 19) (20, 9) (20, 0) (20, 28) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 24) (8, 21) (28, 20) (28, 11) (28, 16) (29, 4) (29, 16) (29, 18) (21, 8) (21, 26) (21, 18) (11, 28) (11, 12) (11, 15) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 22) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 19) (16, 27) (13, 15) (17, 25) (17, 6) (17, 24) (17, 27) (25, 17) (25, 23) (23, 25) (23, 10) (26, 21) (26, 2) (26, 15) (26, 27) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 22) (19, 1) (22, 3) (22, 19) (22, 24) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 2) (14, 3) (14, 18) (2, 26) (2, 6) (15, 11) (15, 13) (15, 26) (15, 6) (24, 8) (24, 17) (24, 22) (10, 23) (18, 29) (18, 21) (18, 14) (12, 5) (12, 11) (27, 9) (27, 16) (27, 17) (27, 26) (1, 5) (1, 19) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {7, 20, 19}
- Node 1: {5, 19}
- Node 2: {6, 26}
- Node 3: {9, 14, 22}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 29}
- Node 5: {9, 12, 1}
- Node 6: {17, 15, 2}
- Node 7: {4, 8, 0, 19}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 21, 24}
- Node 9: {5, 3, 20, 27}
- Node 10: {23}
- Node 11: {28, 12, 15}
- Node 12: {5, 11}
- Node 13: {15}
- Node 14: {3, 18}
- Node 15: {11, 13, 26, 6}
- Node 16: {28, 29, 19, 27}
- Node 17: {6, 25, 24, 27}
- Node 18: {29, 21, 14}
- Node 19: {7, 0, 16, 22, 1}
- Node 20: {9, 0, 28}
- Node 21: {8, 26, 18}
- Node 22: {3, 19, 24}
- Node 23: {25, 10}
- Node 24: {8, 17, 22}
- Node 25: {17, 23}
- Node 26: {21, 2, 15, 27}
- Node 27: {9, 16, 17, 26}
- Node 28: {20, 11, 16}
- Node 29: {4, 16, 18}

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 5, 12, 1, 9, 20, 4, 7, 8, 28, 16, 19, 3, 14, 6, 15, 26, 22, 24, 17, and 29 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they can form.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [41]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
- <5, 9, 12, 1>
- <9, 5, 3, 27>
- <9, 20, 0, 28>
- <4, 7, 8, 29>
- <7, 4, 1, 19>
- <8, 4, 21, 24>
- <28, 20, 11, 16>
- <16, 28, 27, 29>
- <19, 7, 0, 22>
- <3, 9, 14, 22>
- <6, 17, 15, 26>
