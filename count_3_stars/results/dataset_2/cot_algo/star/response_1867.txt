Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (16, 4) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 18) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 19) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 4) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 14) (7, 13) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 15) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 19) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 12) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 12) (10, 16) (10, 3) (5, 17) (5, 15) (5, 12) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 0) (18, 6) (18, 14) (13, 1) (13, 7) (0, 4) (0, 12) 

Response:
The central idea is to find all the 3-stars in the given graph. Let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {4, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 13}
- Node 2: {6, 11, 19}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 10, 19}
- Node 4: {0, 8, 16}
- Node 5: {12, 15, 17}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 9, 18}
- Node 7: {13, 14, 15, 17}
- Node 8: {4, 11}
- Node 9: {6, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {3, 16}
- Node 11: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 9, 15, 19}
- Node 13: {1, 7}
- Node 14: {7, 15, 18}
- Node 15: {5, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 16: {4, 10}
- Node 17: {5, 7, 19}
- Node 18: {6, 14}
- Node 19: {2, 3, 12, 17}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 12: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 17: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 19: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 33

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (6, 11, 19)>
- <3, (1, 6, 10)>
- <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- <7, (13, 14, 15)>
- <9, (6, 11, 12)>
- <12, (0, 5, 15)>
- <15, (5, 7, 14)>
- <17, (5, 7, 19)>
- <19, (3, 12, 17)>
