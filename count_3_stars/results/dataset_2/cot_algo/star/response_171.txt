Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Calculating the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 4
- Node 1: degree = 6
- Node 2: degree = 5
- Node 3: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 5
- Node 5: degree = 4
- Node 6: degree = 2
- Node 7: degree = 3
- Node 8: degree = 5
- Node 9: degree = 2

There are no isolated vertices in the graph.

Next, we find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 1 neighbors: {0, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2 neighbors: {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 3 neighbors: {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 4 neighbors: {0, 2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5 neighbors: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6 neighbors: {1, 4}
- Node 7 neighbors: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 8 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 9 neighbors: {1, 5}

Now we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the final answer is [54], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>
