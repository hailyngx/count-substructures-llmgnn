Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (27, 28) (27, 9) (27, 26) (27, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 17) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 13) (11, 29) (11, 20) (8, 1) (8, 23) (8, 26) (23, 8) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 25) (26, 27) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 16) (22, 21) (22, 4) (28, 27) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 24) (5, 24) (13, 27) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (16, 26) (16, 28) (16, 6) (18, 19) (18, 13) (18, 6) (7, 3) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 9) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 25) (0, 10) (0, 17) (3, 7) (3, 24) (3, 9) (6, 16) (6, 18) (6, 7) (6, 2) (17, 21) (17, 0) (17, 2) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 24) (20, 21) (20, 11) (20, 7) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 3) (24, 14) (24, 2) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 17) (2, 24) (25, 19) (25, 4) (25, 12) (12, 14) (12, 25) (29, 11) (9, 27) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: {10, 17}
- Node 1 neighbors: {8, 9}
- Node 2 neighbors: {6, 17, 19, 24}
- Node 3 neighbors: {7, 9, 24}
- Node 4 neighbors: {13, 22, 25}
- Node 5 neighbors: {24}
- Node 6 neighbors: {2, 7, 16, 18}
- Node 7 neighbors: {3, 6, 9, 20}
- Node 8 neighbors: {1, 23, 26}
- Node 9 neighbors: {1, 3, 7, 27}
- Node 10 neighbors: {0, 11, 14}
- Node 11 neighbors: {10, 13, 20, 28, 29}
- Node 12 neighbors: {14, 25}
- Node 13 neighbors: {4, 11, 18, 27}
- Node 14 neighbors: {10, 12, 24}
- Node 16 neighbors: {6, 26, 28}
- Node 17 neighbors: {0, 2, 21}
- Node 18 neighbors: {6, 13, 19}
- Node 19 neighbors: {2, 18, 25, 26}
- Node 20 neighbors: {7, 11, 21}
- Node 21 neighbors: {17, 20, 22}
- Node 22 neighbors: {4, 21}
- Node 23 neighbors: {8}
- Node 24 neighbors: {2, 3, 5, 14, 28}
- Node 25 neighbors: {2, 12, 19}
- Node 26 neighbors: {8, 16, 19, 27}
- Node 27 neighbors: {9, 13, 26, 28}
- Node 28 neighbors: {11, 16, 24, 27}
- Node 29 neighbors: {11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars based on the neighbor sets:
- Node 11, 3-star count: 1
- Node 13, 3-star count: 1
- Node 19, 3-star count: 1
- Node 24, 3-star count: 1
- Node 26, 3-star count: 1
- Node 27, 3-star count: 1
- Node 28, 3-star count: 1

Total number of 3-stars: 7

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
The unique 3-stars found are:
- <11, (13, 18, 29)>
- <13, (4, 18, 27)>
- <19, (2, 18, 26)>
- <24, (2, 14, 28)>
- <26, (16, 19, 27)>
- <27, (13, 26, 28)>
- <28, (16, 24, 27)>
