Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (17, 19) (17, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 18) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (0, 10) (0, 5) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 4) (14, 9) (14, 15) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 18) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 15) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 4) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 16) (15, 14) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 5) (12, 5) (12, 19) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 12) (18, 8) (18, 3) (18, 16) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (19, 17) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are given below:

Node 0: {5, 10}
Node 1: {2, 6}
Node 2: {1, 4, 10, 15}
Node 3: {5, 7, 16, 18}
Node 4: {2, 11, 16}
Node 5: {0, 3, 12, 15}
Node 6: {1, 7, 11}
Node 7: {3, 6, 10, 15, 17}
Node 8: {9, 10, 18}
Node 9: {8, 14, 19}
Node 10: {0, 2, 7, 8, 19}
Node 11: {4, 6}
Node 12: {5, 19}
Node 14: {9, 15}
Node 15: {2, 5, 7, 14}
Node 16: {3, 4, 18}
Node 17: {7, 19}
Node 18: {3, 8, 16}
Node 19: {9, 10, 12, 17}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors.

Node 0: [0]
Node 1: [0]
Node 2: [1]
Node 3: [0]
Node 4: [1]
Node 5: [1]
Node 6: [0]
Node 7: [2]
Node 8: [0]
Node 9: [0]
Node 10: [1]
Node 11: [0]
Node 12: [0]
Node 14: [0]
Node 15: [1]
Node 16: [0]
Node 17: [0]
Node 18: [0]
Node 19: [0]

Total number of 3-stars: [6]

Unique 3-stars found: 
<2, (1, 15, 7)>
<15, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 16, 11)>
<5, (15, 0, 3)>
<7, (15, 2, 17)>
<10, (19, 0, 2)>
