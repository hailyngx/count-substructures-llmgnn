Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 4) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 4) (15, 2) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 2) (13, 14) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 1) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 12) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 4) (17, 16) (17, 7) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 7) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 5) (1, 10) (1, 18) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 7) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 18) (4, 16) (4, 15) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

1. Node 0 neighbors: 9, 10, 6
2. Node 1 neighbors: 10, 18
3. Node 2 neighbors: 15, 13, 7
4. Node 3 neighbors: 16, 15, 10, 19
5. Node 4 neighbors: 16, 15, 14
6. Node 5 neighbors: 11, 12, 18
7. Node 6 neighbors: 0, 19, 14
8. Node 7 neighbors: 17, 2, 18
9. Node 8 neighbors: 9, 12
10. Node 9 neighbors: 8, 0
11. Node 10 neighbors: 3, 0, 1
12. Node 11 neighbors: 16, 5, 15
13. Node 12 neighbors: 8, 19, 5
14. Node 13 neighbors: 2, 14
15. Node 14 neighbors: 13, 4, 6
16. Node 15 neighbors: 11, 3, 19, 4, 2
17. Node 17 neighbors: 16, 7
18. Node 18 neighbors: 5, 1, 7
19. Node 19 neighbors: 3, 15, 6, 12

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors (degree 3 or higher) and calculate the number of 3-stars based on the neighbor sets:

1. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - <3, (16, 15, 10)>
   - <3, (16, 15, 19)>
   - <3, (16, 10, 19)>
   - <3, (15, 10, 19)>

2. Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
   - <4, (16, 15, 14)>

3. Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
   - <5, (11, 12, 18)>

4. Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
   - <6, (0, 19, 14)>

5. Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   - <15, (11, 3, 19)>
   - <15, (11, 3, 4)>
   - <15, (11, 19, 4)>
   - <15, (3, 19, 4)>
   - <15, (11, 3, 2)>
   - <15, (11, 19, 2)>
   - <15, (11, 4, 2)>
   - <15, (3, 19, 2)>
   - <15, (3, 4, 2)>
   - <15, (19, 4, 2)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 17
Therefore, the final answer is [17].
