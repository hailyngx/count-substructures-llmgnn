Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 2) (14, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 11}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 10}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 11}
- Node 9: {0, 10, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 11: {4, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {7, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 5, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {2, 9}

Now, let's identify the center nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2, Node 8, Node 9, and Node 13 each have 6 or more neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each center node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 44 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 14)>, <2, (1, 7, 12)>, <2, (4, 8, 11)>, <2, (4, 11, 12)>, <2, (7, 12, 13)>, <8, (0, 11, 12)>, <9, (0, 10, 13)>, <9, (0, 9, 14)>, <13, (5, 9, 12)>
