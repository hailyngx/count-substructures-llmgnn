Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 18) (9, 2) (9, 12) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 18) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 18) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 16) (1, 16) (1, 14) (15, 19) (15, 7) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 17) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 4) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 18) (7, 10) (7, 15) (7, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 12) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 17) (13, 0) (13, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 6, 13}
- Node 1: {14, 16}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 8, 9, 19}
- Node 3: {2, 11, 16}
- Node 4: {0, 6}
- Node 5: {12, 18}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 19}
- Node 7: {10, 13, 15}
- Node 8: {2, 16, 17, 18}
- Node 9: {2, 12}
- Node 10: {7, 14, 18}
- Node 11: {3, 18}
- Node 12: {5, 9, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 7}
- Node 14: {1, 10, 12}
- Node 15: {7, 19}
- Node 16: {1, 3, 8, 17}
- Node 17: {8, 16, 18}
- Node 18: {5, 10, 11, 17, 18}
- Node 19: {2, 6, 15}

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19.

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars in each of these nodes:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 10: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 18: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 19: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Total number of 3-stars: 29

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 13>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 14, 16>, <2, 3, 16>, <2, 8, 16>, <2, 9, 12>, <2, 9, 18>, <2, 12, 14>, <2, 18, 17>, <2, 18, 17>, <3, 11, 18>, <7, 10, 14>, <8, 16, 17>, <10, 14, 12>, <12, 5, 18>, <12, 9, 5>, <14, 10, 18>, <14, 12, 5>, <16, 1, 17>, <16, 3, 8>, <16, 8, 17>, <16, 8, 18>, <18, 10, 17>, <18, 11, 5>, <18, 17, 5>, <18, 17, 10>, <18, 17, 11>
