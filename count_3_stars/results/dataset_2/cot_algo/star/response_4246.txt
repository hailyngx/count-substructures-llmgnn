Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 14) (22, 15) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 29) (16, 26) (14, 22) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 4) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 15) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 27) (3, 24) (3, 26) (3, 18) (15, 13) (15, 22) (15, 17) (15, 6) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 20) (20, 0) (5, 11) (5, 6) (21, 25) (21, 24) (28, 7) (7, 28) (7, 29) (7, 27) (7, 26) (19, 22) (19, 2) (29, 16) (29, 7) (29, 26) (1, 14) (1, 24) (1, 27) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 19) (26, 16) (26, 3) (26, 7) (26, 29) (24, 3) (24, 21) (24, 1) (24, 12) (27, 9) (27, 7) (27, 1) (27, 8) (4, 14) (4, 10) (4, 25) (25, 13) (25, 21) (25, 4) (25, 23) (8, 27) (8, 12) (8, 18) (10, 4) (12, 24) (12, 8) (23, 13) (23, 25) (18, 6) (18, 3) (18, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 6, 20}
- Node 1: {14, 24, 27}
- Node 2: {13, 9, 19}
- Node 3: {24, 26, 18}
- Node 4: {14, 10, 25}
- Node 5: {11, 6}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 15, 0}
- Node 7: {28, 29, 27, 26}
- Node 8: {27, 12, 18}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 27}
- Node 10: {4}
- Node 11: {0, 5, 17}
- Node 12: {8, 24}
- Node 13: {22, 25, 2, 15, 23}
- Node 14: {22, 17, 1, 4}
- Node 15: {13, 22, 17, 6}
- Node 16: {29, 26}
- Node 17: {11, 14, 15}
- Node 18: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 19: {22, 2}
- Node 20: {0}
- Node 21: {25, 24}
- Node 22: {13, 19, 14, 15}
- Node 23: {13, 25}
- Node 24: {3, 21, 1, 12}
- Node 25: {13, 21, 4, 23}
- Node 26: {16, 3, 7, 29}
- Node 27: {9, 7, 1, 8}
- Node 28: {7}
- Node 29: {16, 26, 7}

Now we can identify the 3-stars:

- Node 13 forms a 3-star with leaves (22, 23, 25).
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with leaves (13, 17, 22).
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with leaves (11, 14, 15).
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves (14, 24, 27).
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with leaves (1, 21, 12).
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with leaves (4, 21, 23).
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with leaves (16, 7, 29).
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with leaves (1, 8, 9).

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars is [8].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<13, (22, 23, 25)>  
<15, (13, 17, 22)>  
<17, (11, 14, 15)>  
<1, (14, 24, 27)>  
<24, (1, 12, 21)>  
<25, (4, 21, 23)>  
<26, (16, 29, 7)>  
<27, (1, 8, 9)>
