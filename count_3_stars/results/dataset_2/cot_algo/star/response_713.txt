Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 5}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 57.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [57].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
