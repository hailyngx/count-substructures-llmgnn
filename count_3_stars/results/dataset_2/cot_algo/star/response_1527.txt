Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 0: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42. Therefore, the final answer is [42].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 5, 7>
- <0, 1, 5, 8>
- <0, 1, 7, 8>
- <0, 5, 6, 7>
- <0, 5, 6, 9>
- <1, 3, 5, 9>
- <1, 3, 6, 9>
- <1, 5, 6, 9>
- <2, 3, 5, 6>
- <2, 3, 6, 9>
- <2, 5, 6, 9>
- <4, 7, 8, 9>
- <5, 6, 7, 9>
