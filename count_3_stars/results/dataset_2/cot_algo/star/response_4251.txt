Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighborhood sets for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 2, 8, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 7}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 0, 7}
- Node 3: {6, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 8, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 2, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 1, 2, 0}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 3, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 1, 4, 7}

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (6, 2, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<2, (6, 8, 0)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<5, (9, 8, 1)>
<6, (3, 2, 4)>
<7, (5, 9, 1)>
<8, (5, 9, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>
