Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 18) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 9) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (1, 16) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (7, 19) (13, 17) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 15) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 0) (0, 19) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 12) (2, 17) (2, 9) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 18) (5, 14) (5, 18) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 18) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {19}
- Node 1: {3, 10, 12, 16}
- Node 2: {9, 17}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 11}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {14, 18}
- Node 6: {9, 11, 14, 15, 16}
- Node 7: {19}
- Node 8: {15, 16, 17}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 19}
- Node 10: {1, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {3, 6, 15, 16}
- Node 12: {1, 10, 18}
- Node 13: {17}
- Node 14: {5, 6, 10, 17}
- Node 15: {6, 8, 11, 18}
- Node 16: {1, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 17: {2, 8, 13, 14, 18}
- Node 18: {5, 12, 15, 17}
- Node 19: {0, 7, 9}

By applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, we find the following 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 10, 16>
- <6, 11, 15>
- <8, 15, 18>
- <11, 15, 16>
- <12, 10, 18>
- <14, 6, 17>
- <16, 6, 8>
- <17, 15, 18>
- <18, 12, 15>
- <19, 9, 7>
