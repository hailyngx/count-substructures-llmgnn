Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}

Now, we need to identify the 3-stars in this graph. 

Node 1, 8, and 9 have 6, 5, and 5 neighbors respectively, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 20 + 10 + 10 = 40 \]

Therefore, there are 40 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>
