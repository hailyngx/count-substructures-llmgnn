This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 24) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 15) (11, 21) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 20) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (9, 13) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 27) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 26) (8, 16) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 1) (23, 3) (23, 8) (23, 1) (23, 24) (15, 22) (15, 20) (20, 16) (20, 15) (20, 29) (26, 25) (26, 4) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 2) (17, 9) (17, 18) (29, 8) (29, 20) (29, 5) (29, 14) (14, 22) (14, 29) (14, 2) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 27) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 21) (19, 24) (19, 0) (7, 16) (7, 3) (2, 28) (2, 14) (2, 19) (4, 26) (0, 28) (0, 19) (0, 12) (21, 11) (21, 19) (12, 28) (12, 0) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 1) (5, 27) (27, 9) (27, 18) (27, 5) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 24) (1, 8) (1, 23) (1, 5) (1, 10) (24, 13) (24, 23) (24, 19) (24, 10) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the neighbors for each node are as follows:

- Node 0 has neighbors: {28, 19, 12}
- Node 1 has neighbors: {8, 23, 5, 10}
- Node 2 has neighbors: {28, 14, 19}
- Node 3 has neighbors: {25, 7, 23}
- Node 4 has neighbor: {26}
- Node 5 has neighbors: {22, 29, 1, 27}
- Node 6 has neighbors: {16, 9}
- Node 7 has neighbors: {16, 3}
- Node 8 has neighbors: {16, 23, 10, 29, 1}
- Node 9 has neighbors: {13, 6, 17, 27}
- Node 10 has neighbors: {8, 24, 1}
- Node 11 has neighbor: {21}
- Node 12 has neighbor: {28, 0}
- Node 13 has neighbors: {22, 24, 9}
- Node 14 has neighbors: {22, 29, 2}
- Node 15 has neighbors: {22, 20}
- Node 16 has neighbors: {6, 8, 20, 7}
- Node 17 has neighbors: {9, 18}
- Node 18 has neighbors: {17, 19, 27}
- Node 19 has neighbors: {18, 21, 24, 0, 2}
- Node 20 has neighbors: {16, 15, 29}
- Node 21 has neighbors: {11, 19}
- Node 22 has neighbors: {13, 14, 5, 15}
- Node 23 has neighbors: {3, 8, 1, 24}
- Node 24 has neighbors: {13, 23, 19, 10}
- Node 25 has neighbors: {3, 26}
- Node 26 has neighbors: {25, 4}
- Node 27 has neighbors: {9, 18, 5}
- Node 28 has neighbors: {0, 12, 2}
- Node 29 has neighbors: {8, 20, 5, 14}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

From the list of neighbors, only nodes 1, 8, 9, 10, 13, 19, 22, 23, 24, and 29 have 3 or more neighbors, so we calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:

- inom{4}{3} 3-stars for node 1: <1, 5, 8>, <1, 10, 8>, <1, 5, 23>, <1, 8, 23>
- inom{5}{3} 3-stars for node 8: <8, 10, 1>, <8, 1, 23>, <8, 1, 29>, <8, 1, 16>, <8, 16, 20>
- inom{4}{3} 3-stars for node 9: <9, 13, 6>, <9, 13, 17>, <9, 6, 27>, <9, 17, 27>
- inom{4}{3} 3-stars for node 10: <10, 8, 1>, <10, 8, 24>, <10, 1, 24>, <10, 24, 19>
- inom{3}{3} 3-stars for node 13: <13, 22, 24>
- inom{5}{3} 3-stars for node 19: <19, 24, 21>, <19, 24, 0>, <19, 21, 11>, <19, 21, 24>, <19, 0, 12>
- inom{4}{3} 3-stars for node 22: <22, 13, 24>, <22, 13, 15>, <22, 24, 15>, <22, 15, 20>
- inom{4}{3} 3-stars for node 23: <23, 8, 1>, <23, 8, 24>, <23, 1, 24>, <23, 24, 19>
- inom{4}{3} 3-stars for node 24: <24, 19, 21>, <24, 19, 0>, <24, 21, 11>, <24, 21, 19>
- inom{4}{3} 3-stars for node 29: <29, 8, 1>, <29, 8, 20>, <29, 20, 16>, <29, 16, 6>

Adding up the total number of unique 3-stars, we get [30].
