Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's organize the given edges based on the nodes they connect:

Node 0: {9, 2, 8, 7, 1}
Node 1: {5, 6, 0, 7}
Node 2: {8, 0, 3, 4}
Node 3: {5, 9, 6, 2, 8}
Node 4: {2}
Node 5: {9, 1, 7, 3}
Node 6: {1, 7, 3, 8}
Node 7: {5, 6, 8, 0, 1}
Node 8: {6, 2, 0, 7, 3}
Node 9: {5, 3, 0}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: inom5{3} = 10
Node 1: Only has 4 neighbors, so no 3-star.
Node 2: inom4{3} = 4
Node 3: inom5{3} = 10
Node 4: Cannot form a 3-star with only 1 neighbor.
Node 5: inom4{3} = 4
Node 6: inom4{3} = 4
Node 7: inom5{3} = 10
Node 8: inom5{3} = 10
Node 9: inom3{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 53

Therefore, the final answer is [53].

Unique 3-stars:
