Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (11, 12) (11, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 4) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {4, 5, 9}
Node 1 neighbors: {2, 4, 7, 8, 13, 14}
Node 2 neighbors: {1, 3, 5, 9}
Node 3 neighbors: {2, 4, 14}
Node 4 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 11}
Node 5 neighbors: {0, 2, 7, 9, 13}
Node 6 neighbors: {4, 13}
Node 7 neighbors: {1, 5, 8, 9, 12, 14}
Node 8 neighbors: {1, 7, 10}
Node 9 neighbors: {0, 2, 5, 7, 13}
Node 10 neighbors: {1, 4, 8, 13, 14}
Node 11 neighbors: {4, 12}
Node 12 neighbors: {7, 11, 14}
Node 13 neighbors: {1, 5, 6, 9, 10}
Node 14 neighbors: {1, 3, 7, 10, 12}

Now, we will check for each node how many 3-stars can be formed:

Node 1 can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 4 can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 7 can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 9 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars 
Node 13 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars 
Node 14 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars 

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 90

Thus, the final answer is [90]. 

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 4, 13)>, <1, (2, 5, 13)>, <1, (2, 9, 13)>, <1, (4, 7, 14)>, <1, (4, 10, 14)>, <1, (7, 10, 14)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 9, 10)>, <4, (1, 10, 14)>, <7, (5, 9, 13)>
