Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's build the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 6}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 64 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [64].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 1, 4, 6>
- <1, 3, 5, 6>
- <1, 3, 6, 8>
- <2, 3, 4, 9>
- <2, 6, 8, 9>
