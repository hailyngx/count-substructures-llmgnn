Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (12, 6) (12, 14) 

Response:
The given graph can be described as follows:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, 9, and 11.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 10, and 11.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 9, and 13.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 9, 11, and 13.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 13, and 14.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 9, 14.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 8, and 14.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7.
Node 10 is connected to nodes 2.
Node 11 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 13.
Node 12 is connected to nodes 6 and 14.
Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 8, and 11.
Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 7, 8, and 12.

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9, 11: <1, 7, 9, 11>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, 13: <5, 1, 3, 13>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, 7: <6, 3, 5, 7>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, 14: <8, 2, 4, 14>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, 7: <9, 1, 4, 7>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, 13: <11, 1, 4, 13>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, 5: <13, 3, 4, 5>

Therefore, counting the total number of unique 3-stars gives us [7].
