Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 7) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: {6, 10, 11, 12}
Node 1: {2, 5, 11, 14}
Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 9, 14}
Node 3: {6, 13}
Node 4: {2, 8, 11, 12, 14}
Node 5: {1, 2, 8, 9, 11}
Node 6: {0, 3, 10, 12}
Node 7: {9, 13}
Node 8: {4, 5, 9, 13}
Node 9: {5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 10: {0, 6, 12}
Node 11: {0, 1, 4, 5, 14}
Node 12: {0, 4, 6, 10}
Node 13: {3, 7, 8}
Node 14: {1, 2, 4, 11}

Next, for nodes that have three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars each node is part of:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 65 \). 

Thus, the final answer is [65], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (6, 10, 12)>
<1, (2, 5, 11)>
<2, (1, 5, 14)>
<4, (2, 11, 14)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 12)>
<8, (5, 9, 13)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
<11, (1, 4, 14)>
<13, (3, 7, 8)>
<14, (2, 4, 11)>
