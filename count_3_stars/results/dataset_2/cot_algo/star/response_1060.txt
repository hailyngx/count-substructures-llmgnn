Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 5) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 0) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 1) (18, 13) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 9) (5, 17) (5, 14) (19, 18) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 16) (16, 17) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 15) (14, 5) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 2) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 3) (2, 15) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 1) (15, 16) (15, 2) (15, 13) (13, 18) (13, 1) (13, 15) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 8, 12, 16
Node 1: 9, 13, 18
Node 2: 3, 15
Node 3: 7, 14, 16, 2
Node 4: 8, 6, 18
Node 5: 17, 14
Node 6: 11, 17, 4, 7
Node 7: 12, 3, 18, 6
Node 8: 4, 0
Node 9: 10, 11, 1
Node 10: 11, 17, 9
Node 11: 10, 9, 6
Node 12: 7, 0
Node 13: 18, 1, 15
Node 14: 5, 3
Node 15: 16, 2, 13
Node 16: 17, 0, 3, 15
Node 17: 10, 6, 16, 5
Node 18: 4, 7, 19, 1, 13
Node 19: 18

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 11, 13, 16, and 18 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to find the number of 3-stars that can be formed with these nodes.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Total = [ inom{9}{3} + inom{9}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{5}{3}]

Total = [84 + 84 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10]
Total = [208]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 208.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (8, 12, 16)>
<1, (9, 13, 18)>
<3, (7, 14, 16)>
<6, (4, 11, 17)>
<9, (10, 11, 1)>
<11, (9, 10, 17)>
<13, (1, 18, 15)>
<16, (0, 3, 15)>
<18, (7, 13, 19)>
<18, (1, 13, 15)>
