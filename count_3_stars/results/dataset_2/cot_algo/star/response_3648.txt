Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 6) (17, 21) (2, 29) (2, 20) (29, 2) (29, 8) (29, 24) (29, 3) (8, 29) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 27) (13, 6) (24, 29) (24, 3) (26, 12) (26, 4) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 0) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 4) (15, 11) (16, 22) (16, 25) (16, 27) (21, 17) (21, 9) (21, 22) (4, 14) (4, 26) (4, 15) (4, 22) (22, 16) (22, 21) (22, 4) (22, 5) (11, 15) (0, 1) (0, 28) (3, 29) (3, 24) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 23) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 27) (28, 10) (28, 20) (7, 20) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 18) (20, 2) (20, 28) (20, 7) (20, 19) (19, 7) (19, 20) (19, 25) (25, 16) (25, 19) (25, 5) (9, 1) (9, 21) (18, 7) (18, 27) (27, 13) (27, 16) (27, 28) (27, 18) (5, 22) (5, 25) (5, 10) (23, 6) (12, 8) (12, 26) (12, 28) (10, 28) (10, 7) (10, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by examining each node that has three or more neighbors and applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \).

Here are the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 (neighbors: 8, 15, 9, 0)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 14, 26, 15, 22)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 22, 25, 10)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 17, 13, 23)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 29, 13, 12, 1)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 14, 8, 15, 27, 6)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 4, 13)
- Node 15 (neighbors: 13, 1, 4, 11)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 22, 25, 27)
- Node 17 (neighbors: 6, 21)
- Node 20 (neighbors: 2, 28, 7, 19)
- Node 21 (neighbors: 17, 9, 22)
- Node 22 (neighbors: 16, 21, 4, 5)
- Node 25 (neighbors: 16, 19, 5)
- Node 27 (neighbors: 13, 28, 18, 16)
- Node 28 (neighbors: 0, 12, 27, 10, 20)

Now, calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: Not enough neighbors
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: Not enough neighbors
- Node 17: Not enough neighbors
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: Not enough neighbors
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 42 \)

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [42].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 8, 9, 15>
- <1, 8, 0, 15>
- <1, 9, 0, 15>
- <1, 8, 13, 15>
- <4, 14, 22, 26>
- <5, 10, 22, 25>
- <13, 14, 6, 27>
- <13, 8, 27, 28>
- <13, 15, 1, 27>
- <13, 15, 11, 27>
- <20, 7, 19, 28>
- <22, 4, 5, 25>
- <28, 10, 12, 27>
- <28, 10, 20, 27>
