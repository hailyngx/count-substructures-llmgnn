Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 5) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 4) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 16) (13, 16) (13, 18) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 13) (18, 2) (5, 15) (5, 8) (6, 12) (6, 19) (11, 14) (11, 7) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 19) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 10) (16, 8) (16, 13) (19, 17) (19, 6) (19, 0) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 6) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 2, 7, 10, 19
Node 1: 4, 10, 15
Node 2: 0, 8, 9, 12, 18
Node 3: 9, 12
Node 4: 1, 7, 14, 17
Node 5: 8, 15
Node 6: 12, 19
Node 7: 0, 4, 11
Node 8: 2, 5, 16
Node 9: 2, 3, 10, 15
Node 10: 0, 1, 9
Node 11: 7, 14
Node 12: 2, 3, 6
Node 13: 16, 18
Node 14: 4, 11, 17
Node 15: 1, 5, 9
Node 16: 8, 13
Node 17: 4, 14, 19
Node 18: 2, 13, 14
Node 19: 0, 6, 17

Now we can identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 2: 5 neighbors
Node 4: 4 neighbors
Node 7: 3 neighbors
Node 8: 3 neighbors
Node 9: 4 neighbors
Node 12: 3 neighbors
Node 14: 3 neighbors
Node 15: 3 neighbors
Node 17: 3 neighbors
Node 18: 3 neighbors
Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 10>, <0, 7, 11>, <2, 8, 5>, <2, 8, 16>, <2, 8, 13>, <2, 9, 10>, <4, 1, 15>, <4, 7, 11>, <9, 15, 3>, <9, 15, 2>, <9, 2, 12>, <15, 1, 10>, <15, 1, 4>, <15, 9, 2>, <16, 8, 13>, <16, 8, 5>, <18, 2, 13>, <18, 2, 14>, <19, 17, 0>, <19, 17, 14>
