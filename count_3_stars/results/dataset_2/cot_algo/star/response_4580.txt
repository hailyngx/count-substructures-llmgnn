Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 8) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 15) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 13) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 3) (2, 6) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 0) (0, 18) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 13) (5, 18) (5, 19) (5, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 1) (19, 5) (19, 1) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 8) (12, 16) (12, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 15) (3, 16) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 9) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 15) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {18, 14}
- Node 1: {11, 13, 19}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {16, 17, 12, 9}
- Node 4: {7, 10, 17}
- Node 5: {18, 8, 19}
- Node 6: {7, 2, 18, 15}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 15}
- Node 8: {11, 16, 5, 15}
- Node 9: {14, 15, 3}
- Node 10: {4, 17, 13}
- Node 11: {1, 14, 8}
- Node 12: {16, 3}
- Node 13: {10, 14, 1}
- Node 14: {11, 0, 13, 9}
- Node 15: {7, 9, 6, 8}
- Node 16: {12, 3, 8}
- Node 17: {4, 10, 3}
- Node 18: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 19: {5, 1}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 8, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16 all have 4 neighbors each.

For nodes with 4 neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is:
\[ 4 \times 7 = 28 \]

Therefore, the final answer is [28], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (16, 12, 17)>
<4, (7, 10, 17)>
<6, (7, 2, 18)>
<8, (11, 16, 5)>
<14, (0, 13, 9)>
<15, (7, 9, 6)>
<16, (12, 3, 8)>
