Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 2 neighbors: 6, 7
Node 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 8, 9
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6
Node 5 neighbors: 1, 7
Node 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 9
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8
Node 8 neighbors: 3, 7, 9
Node 9 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 58

Therefore, the final answer is [58].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 3, 4>
<0, 1, 3, 7>
<0, 1, 4, 7>
<1, 3, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 5, 7>
<7, 8, 9, 0>
<7, 8, 9, 3>
<7, 8, 9, 1>
<7, 0, 5, 1>
<7, 0, 9, 3>
