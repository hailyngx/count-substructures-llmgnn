Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 17) (6, 3) (6, 5) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 13) (7, 19) (7, 10) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 5) (11, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 18) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 2) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 19) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 2) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 18) (14, 1) (14, 18) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 2) (18, 10) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {3, 8, 13}
Node 1 neighbors: {11, 14, 18}
Node 2 neighbors: {8, 9, 12, 17, 19}
Node 3 neighbors: {0, 6, 15}
Node 4 neighbors: {8, 13}
Node 5 neighbors: {6, 9, 10, 13, 15}
Node 6 neighbors: {3, 5}
Node 7 neighbors: {10, 19}
Node 8 neighbors: {0, 2, 13}
Node 9 neighbors: {2, 5, 12}
Node 10 neighbors: {5, 7, 17, 18}
Node 11 neighbors: {1}
Node 12 neighbors: {2, 8, 9}
Node 13 neighbors: {4, 5, 8, 10, 18}
Node 14 neighbors: {1, 18}
Node 15 neighbors: {3, 5, 17}
Node 17 neighbors: {10, 15, 19, 2}
Node 18 neighbors: {1, 10, 13, 14}
Node 19 neighbors: {2, 7, 17}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].
