Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 3) (15, 13) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 14) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 25) (6, 19) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 13) (9, 12) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 17) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 28) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 17) (1, 10) (1, 19) (21, 2) (21, 29) (8, 23) (8, 19) (3, 15) (3, 13) (3, 18) (5, 6) (5, 25) (5, 10) (26, 28) (26, 16) (28, 22) (28, 26) (28, 4) (28, 10) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 29) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 8) (24, 27) (24, 16) (16, 0) (16, 26) (16, 24) (4, 28) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 14) (11, 7) (29, 21) (29, 7) (29, 14) (14, 27) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 29) (14, 25) (17, 0) (17, 23) (17, 4) (17, 2) (25, 6) (25, 5) (25, 14) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 4) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 28) (10, 2) (18, 3) (20, 6) (20, 9) (2, 21) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 10) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list format:

1: {10, 19}
2: {4, 10, 17, 21}
3: {13, 15, 18}
4: {2, 13, 17, 28}
5: {6, 10, 25}
6: {5, 9, 19, 20, 25}
7: {0, 11, 29}
8: {19, 23}
9: {6, 9, 12, 13, 20}
10: {1, 2, 5, 28}
11: {7}
12: {9, 14}
13: {3, 4, 9, 15}
14: {12, 22, 25, 27, 29}
15: {3, 13}
16: {0, 24, 26}
17: {0, 2, 4, 23}
18: {3}
19: {1, 6, 8}
20: {6, 9}
21: {2, 29}
22: {14, 23, 28}
23: {7, 17, 22}
24: {0, 16, 27}
25: {5, 6, 14}
26: {16, 28}
27: {0, 14, 24}
28: {4, 10, 22, 26}
29: {7, 14, 21}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

\[
\binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 50
\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <6, (5, 9, 20)>
- <9, (6, 12, 13)>
- <14, (22, 25, 27)>
- <0, (7, 16, 24)>
- <2, (4, 17, 28)>
- <4, (2, 13, 17)>
- <5, (6, 10, 25)>
- <12, (9, 14, 22)>
- <13, (3, 4, 9)>
- <16, (0, 24, 26)>
- <17, (0, 2, 4)>
- <19, (1, 6, 8)>
- <22, (14, 23, 28)>
- <23, (7, 17, 22)>
- <25, (5, 6, 14)>
- <26, (16, 28, 4)>
- <28, (2, 10, 22)>
- <29, (7, 14, 21)>
