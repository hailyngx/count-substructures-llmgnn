Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 0) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 4, 8, 2, 11, 13
- Node 1: Neighbors are 9, 14, 10, 12
- Node 2: Neighbors are 4, 0, 13
- Node 3: Neighbors are 5, 7, 14, 4
- Node 4: Neighbors are 3, 0, 11, 6, 2
- Node 5: Neighbors are 9, 13, 3, 10, 14
- Node 6: Neighbors are 4, 8, 7, 12, 13
- Node 7: Neighbors are 3, 8, 6
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 7, 6
- Node 9: Neighbors are 5, 14, 1, 13
- Node 10: Neighbors are 5, 1
- Node 11: Neighbors are 4, 12, 0
- Node 12: Neighbors are 1, 6, 11
- Node 13: Neighbors are 5, 9, 0, 2, 14, 6
- Node 14: Neighbors are 5, 9, 1, 3, 13

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 2, 10
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 14

For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 74 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [74].
