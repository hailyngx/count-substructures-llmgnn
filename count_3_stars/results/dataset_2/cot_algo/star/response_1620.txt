Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 22) (7, 26) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 27) (4, 22) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 18) (12, 7) (12, 22) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 26) (0, 19) (14, 26) (14, 9) (14, 13) (28, 21) (28, 16) (28, 23) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 16) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 5) (16, 28) (16, 1) (16, 29) (10, 21) (10, 3) (26, 7) (26, 0) (26, 14) (26, 3) (25, 9) (25, 19) (27, 21) (27, 24) (22, 7) (22, 4) (22, 12) (22, 24) (11, 1) (11, 17) (24, 27) (24, 22) (24, 20) (6, 17) (6, 20) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 18) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 25) (9, 19) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 18) (19, 0) (19, 25) (19, 9) (19, 29) (29, 16) (29, 19) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 26) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 20) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 5) (20, 24) (20, 6) (20, 13) (23, 28) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 26, 19}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 2, 11, 16}
- Node 2: Neighbors {8, 1, 9, 13}
- Node 3: Neighbors {12, 10, 26}
- Node 4: Neighbors {22, 0, 1, 15}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8, 15, 18}
- Node 6: Neighbors {17, 20}
- Node 7: Neighbors {12, 22, 26}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 5, 18}
- Node 9: Neighbors {14, 2, 25, 19}
- Node 10: Neighbors {21, 3}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 17}
- Node 12: Neighbors {7, 22, 3}
- Node 13: Neighbors {14, 2, 20}
- Node 14: Neighbors {26, 9, 13}
- Node 15: Neighbors {4, 18, 5}
- Node 16: Neighbors {28, 1, 29}
- Node 17: Neighbors {11, 6, 18}
- Node 18: Neighbors {8, 15, 17, 5}
- Node 19: Neighbors {0, 25, 9, 29}
- Node 20: Neighbors {24, 6, 13}
- Node 21: Neighbors {28, 10, 27}
- Node 22: Neighbors {7, 4, 12, 24}
- Node 23: Neighbor {}
- Node 24: Neighbors {27, 22, 20}
- Node 25: Neighbors {9, 19}
- Node 26: Neighbors {7, 0, 14, 3}
- Node 27: Neighbors {21, 24}
- Node 28: Neighbors {21, 16, 23}
- Node 29: Neighbors {19, 16}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: [C(3, 3)] = 1
- Node 1: [C(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 2: [C(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 4: [C(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 8: [C(3, 3)] = 1
- Node 9: [C(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 12: [C(3, 3)] = 1
- Node 14: [C(3, 3)] = 1
- Node 15: [C(3, 3)] = 1
- Node 16: [C(3, 3)] = 1
- Node 18: [C(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 19: [C(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 20: [C(3, 3)] = 1
- Node 22: [C(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 24: [C(3, 3)] = 1
- Node 26: [C(4, 3)] = 4

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 4, 26, 19>
- <1, 4, 2, 11>
- <2, 8, 1, 9>
- <4, 22, 7, 12>
- <8, 2, 5, 18>
- <9, 14, 2, 25>
- <12, 7, 22, 3>
- <14, 26, 9, 13>
- <15, 4, 18, 5>
- <16, 28, 1, 29>
- <18, 8, 15, 17>
- <19, 0, 25, 9>
- <20, 24, 6, 13>
- <22, 7, 4, 12>
- <24, 27, 21>
- <26, 7, 0, 14>

Each unique 3-star is listed only once.
