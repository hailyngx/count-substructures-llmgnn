Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 19) (7, 17) (14, 9) (14, 8) (17, 7) (17, 15) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 0) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 2) (0, 18) (0, 15) (1, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 8) (16, 6) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 6) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 15) (2, 3) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 2) (15, 6) (15, 12) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 13) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 3) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 15) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 18, 15
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 19, 13, 15, 3
- Node 3: 5, 4, 2, 13
- Node 4: 18, 19, 3
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7
- Node 6: 18, 11, 16, 8, 15
- Node 7: 5, 19, 17
- Node 8: 14, 11, 16, 6
- Node 9: 14, 12
- Node 11: 6, 8, 12
- Node 12: 9, 11, 15, 13
- Node 13: 2, 12, 3
- Node 14: 9, 8
- Node 15: 17, 0, 2, 6, 12
- Node 16: 8, 6
- Node 17: 7, 15
- Node 18: 4, 19, 6, 0
- Node 19: 4, 7, 18, 2

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars each node participates in:

- Node 0, 2, 12, and 15 each have 4 neighbors, so they form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 3, 6, 8, and 19 each have 5 neighbors, so they form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 18 each have fewer than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is the sum of the 3-stars formed by each node, which is 4*4 + 10*4 = 64. Thus, the final answer is [64].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (15, 17, 2)>
<2, (3, 13, 12)>
<3, (2, 5, 13)>
<6, (15, 8, 11)>
<8, (6, 11, 16)>
<12, (13, 9, 15)>
<15, (17, 0, 6)>
<18, (4, 19, 6)>
<19, (2, 7, 4)>
