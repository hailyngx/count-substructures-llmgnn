28. Node 28 neighbors: [3, 11, 20, 23, 26]
29. Node 29 neighbors: [2, 17]

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

1. Node 1, 21, 2 forms a 3-star: <1, 21, 2>
2. Node 1, 21, 25 forms a 3-star: <1, 21, 25>
3. Node 1, 7, 26 forms a 3-star: <1, 7, 26>
4. Node 1, 9, 27 forms a 3-star: <1, 9, 27>
5. Node 1, 12, 24 forms a 3-star: <1, 12, 24>
6. Node 2, 21, 19 forms a 3-star: <2, 21, 19>
7. Node 3, 22, 13 forms a 3-star: <3, 22, 13>
8. Node 3, 11, 28 forms a 3-star: <3, 11, 28>
9. Node 3, 4, 23 forms a 3-star: <3, 4, 23>
10. Node 4, 12, 16 forms a 3-star: <4, 12, 16>

13. Node 6, 26, 7 forms a 3-star: <6, 26, 7>
14. Node 9, 16, 18 forms a 3-star: <9, 16, 18>
15. Node 9, 27, 20 forms a 3-star: <9, 27, 20>
16. Node 10, 25, 8 forms a 3-star: <10, 25, 8>
17. Node 11, 15, 5 forms a 3-star: <11, 15, 5>
18. Node 12, 4, 23 forms a 3-star: <12, 4, 23>
19. Node 17, 10, 24 forms a 3-star: <17, 10, 24>
20. Node 17, 29, 2 forms a 3-star: <17, 29, 2>
21. Node 19, 21, 25 forms a 3-star: <19, 21, 25>
22. Node 24, 17, 19 forms a 3-star: <24, 17, 19>
23. Node 26, 7, 1 forms a 3-star: <26, 7, 1>
24. Node 27, 20, 0 forms a 3-star: <27, 20, 0>
25. Node 28, 11, 3 forms a 3-star: <28, 11, 3>
26. Node 28, 20, 23 forms a 3-star: <28, 20, 23>

Thus, there are 26 unique 3-stars in total, denoted by [26].
