Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 2) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 14) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 6) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 1) 

Response:
The central nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 7, 11, 12, 14, 3. So, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 10, 14, 6, 2, 9. So, the number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 7, 11, 1, 6, 9. So, the number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 7, 8, 12, 0, 8. So, the number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 7, 8, 13, 14. So, the number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 8, 12, 1, 2. So, the number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 13, 5, 11, 6, 3. So, the number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 10, 11, 12, 1. So, the number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 8, 10, 0, 9, 2. So, the number of 3-stars with node 11 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 14, 0, 6, 3, 9. So, the number of 3-stars with node 12 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 5. So, the number of 3-stars with node 13 as the center is 1.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 12, 0, 1, 5. So, the number of 3-stars with node 14 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Adding up all these values, we get a total of 77 three-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the answer would be [77], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 12, 14)>, <1, (6, 9, 11)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 12)>, <5, (7, 8, 13)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 11)>, <9, (1, 10, 11)>, <11, (0, 2, 8)>, <12, (0, 3, 9)>, <13, (4, 5, 8)>, <14, (0, 1, 5)>
