Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 12) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 13) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {6, 8, 9, 14}
Node 1: {2, 5, 6, 10}
Node 2: {1, 3, 8}
Node 3: {2, 7, 12}
Node 4: {11, 12, 13, 14}
Node 5: {1, 6, 8}
Node 6: {0, 1, 5, 10}
Node 7: {3, 9}
Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 9, 14}
Node 9: {0, 7, 8, 13, 14}
Node 10: {1, 6, 11, 13, 14}
Node 11: {4, 10, 14}
Node 12: {3, 4, 13}
Node 13: {4, 9, 10, 12}
Node 14: {0, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars from each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't contribute any 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't contribute any 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't contribute any 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't contribute any 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes 10 3-stars.
Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes 10 3-stars.
Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't contribute any 3-stars.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't contribute any 3-stars.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
Node 14 has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 76

Therefore, the final answer is [76], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 9, 14)>, <1, (5, 6, 10)>, <4, (10, 13, 14)>, <8, (0, 9, 14)>
