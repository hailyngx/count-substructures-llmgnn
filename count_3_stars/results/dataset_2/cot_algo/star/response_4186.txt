Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 35 = 79 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [79].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
