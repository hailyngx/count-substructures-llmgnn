Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 9) (16, 19) (16, 5) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 18) (13, 6) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 7) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 1) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 8) (19, 2) (7, 17) (7, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 12) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 5) (9, 11) (10, 5) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 18) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 5) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: neighbors {3, 8, 18}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 4, 8, 12}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 6, 7, 14, 19}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 3, 5}
- Node 5: neighbors {4, 10, 16, 18}
- Node 6: neighbors {2, 12, 13, 18}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 17}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 1, 19}
- Node 9: neighbors {11}
- Node 10: neighbors {5}
- Node 11: neighbors {9, 14}
- Node 12: neighbors {1, 6, 17}
- Node 13: neighbors {6, 17, 18, 19}
- Node 14: neighbors {2, 3, 11}
- Node 16: neighbors {5, 19}
- Node 17: neighbors {7, 12, 13, 18}
- Node 18: neighbors {0, 5, 6, 13, 17}
- Node 19: neighbors {2, 8, 13, 16}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 18: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 19: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the final answer is [48].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 8, 18)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 10, 16)>
<6, (0, 12, 13)>
<8, (0, 1, 19)>
<12, (1, 6, 17)>
<13, (6, 17, 18)>
<14, (2, 3, 11)>
<17, (7, 12, 18)>
<18, (0, 5, 13)>
<19, (2, 8, 13)>
