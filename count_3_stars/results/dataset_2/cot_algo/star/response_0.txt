Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 29) (1, 10) (3, 0) (3, 27) (3, 12) (20, 5) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 11) (20, 10) (25, 20) (25, 18) (10, 1) (10, 20) (10, 17) (17, 10) (19, 28) (28, 19) (28, 26) (28, 4) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 24) (13, 15) (26, 20) (26, 28) (26, 11) (26, 0) (29, 9) (29, 23) (29, 21) (7, 24) (7, 27) (7, 22) (16, 12) (16, 24) (16, 14) (4, 28) (4, 13) (4, 22) (22, 7) (22, 4) (22, 27) (22, 8) (11, 20) (11, 26) (11, 14) (11, 15) (11, 2) (14, 16) (14, 11) (14, 8) (12, 3) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 23) (18, 25) (18, 12) (18, 6) (18, 21) (0, 3) (0, 26) (24, 13) (24, 7) (24, 16) (8, 22) (8, 14) (8, 15) (2, 11) (2, 6) (27, 3) (27, 7) (27, 22) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 23) (23, 29) (23, 12) (23, 6) (15, 13) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 6) (21, 29) (21, 18) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighborhood set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 26}
- Node 1: {10}
- Node 2: {6, 11}
- Node 3: {0, 12, 27}
- Node 4: {13, 22, 28}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 20}
- Node 6: {2, 15, 18, 23}
- Node 7: {22, 24, 27}
- Node 8: {14, 15, 22}
- Node 9: {5, 29}
- Node 10: {1, 17, 20}
- Node 11: {2, 14, 15, 20, 26}
- Node 12: {3, 16, 18, 23}
- Node 13: {4, 5, 15, 24}
- Node 14: {8, 11, 16}
- Node 15: {6, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 16: {12, 14, 24}
- Node 17: {10}
- Node 18: {6, 12, 21, 25}
- Node 19: {28}
- Node 20: {5, 10, 11, 25, 26}
- Node 21: {18, 29}
- Node 22: {4, 7, 8, 27}
- Node 23: {6, 12, 29}
- Node 24: {7, 13, 16}
- Node 25: {18, 20}
- Node 26: {0, 11, 20, 28}
- Node 27: {3, 7, 22}
- Node 28: {4, 19, 26}
- Node 29: {9, 21, 23}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with center at node 5.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with center at node 10.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with center at node 28.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with center at node 29.

Total 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 22

Thus, the total number of 3-stars for the given graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, 9, 13>
- <10, 1, 17>
- <13, 4, 24>
- <20, 5, 10>
- <20, 5, 11>
- <20, 5, 26>
- <26, 0, 11>
- <28, 4, 19>
- <28, 4, 26>
- <29, 9, 21>
