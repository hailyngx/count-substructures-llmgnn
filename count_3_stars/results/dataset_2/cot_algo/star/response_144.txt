Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:

- Node 0: {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 does not form any 3-star because it has only 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes {3, 4, 9}.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 4, 8}.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes {4, 7, 8}.
- Node 8 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars with different combinations of its neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 24

Therefore, the final answer is [24] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 3, 4, 9>
- <3, 1, 4, 8>
- <6, 4, 7, 8>
- <8, 3, 6, 9>
- <8, 1, 6, 9>
- <8, 2, 6, 9>
- <8, 0, 6, 9>
- <8, 2, 6, 7>
- <8, 0, 6, 7>
- <8, 0, 2, 6>
- <8, 0, 2, 9>
- <8, 0, 2, 7>
- <8, 0, 7, 9>
- <8, 6, 7, 9>
- <8, 2, 7, 9>
- <8, 3, 6, 7>
- <8, 1, 6, 7>
- <8, 1, 2, 6>
- <8, 1, 2, 9>
- <8, 1, 2, 7>
- <8, 1, 7, 9>
- <6, 4, 7, 0>
- <6, 4, 7, 2>
- <6, 4, 7, 9>
