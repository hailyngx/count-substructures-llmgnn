Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 0, 3, 2, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 1, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 7, 8, 0}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 0, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 7, 8, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9, 6, 1, 4, 0, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 6, 4, 7, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 8, 7}

Now, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8 have 5 or more neighbors.
- We'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 58

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [58], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
