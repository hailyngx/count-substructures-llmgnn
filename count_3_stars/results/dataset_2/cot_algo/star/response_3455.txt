Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 4) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 10) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 6) (10, 5) (10, 7) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: {2, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {4, 11, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 8, 12}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 8, 10}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {8, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {5, 7}
- Node 11: {1, 4, 9, 3}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 13: {3, 5, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 3, 4}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <3, (5, 12, 13)>, <3, (5, 12, 14)>, <3, (5, 13, 14)>, <3, (12, 13, 14)>, <3, (4, 11, 14)>, <3, (5, 6, 14)>, <3, (4, 6, 11)>, <3, (4, 5, 14)>, <3, (4, 6, 12)>, <3, (6, 12, 13)> 
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <4, (1, 11, 12)>, <4, (1, 6, 11)>, <4, (1, 12, 6)>, <4, (6, 11, 12)>, <4, (5, 11, 14)>, <4, (5, 6, 11)>, <4, (5, 6, 14)>, <4, (5, 12, 14)>, <4, (6, 12, 14)>, <4, (11, 12, 14)>
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <5, (3, 7, 10)>, <5, (3, 12, 13)>, <5, (3, 4, 11)>, <5, (3, 6, 12)>, <5, (7, 10, 13)>, <5, (4, 10, 11)>, <5, (3, 10, 13)>, <5, (3, 4, 12)>, <5, (4, 6, 12)>, <5, (4, 11, 12)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors, forming \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars: <12, (1, 3, 9)>, <12, (1, 3, 13)>, <12, (1, 6, 9)>, <12, (1, 6, 13)>, <12, (1, 9, 11)>, <12, (1, 9, 13)>, <12, (3, 6, 13)>, <12, (3, 9, 11)>, <12, (3, 9, 13)>, <12, (5, 6, 13)>, <12, (5, 9, 13)>, <12, (3, 5, 6)>, <12, (3, 5, 13)>, <12, (4, 6, 14)>, <12, (4, 9, 11)>, <12, (4, 6, 11)>, <12, (4, 9, 13)>, <12, (6, 11, 14)>, <12, (6, 12, 13)>, <12, (9, 11, 13)>
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is [34].
