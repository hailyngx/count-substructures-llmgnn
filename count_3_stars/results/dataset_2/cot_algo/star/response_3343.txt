Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 21) (26, 4) (4, 26) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 18) (0, 3) (0, 22) (0, 19) (27, 6) (22, 0) (22, 11) (22, 24) (23, 8) (23, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 24) (11, 22) (11, 17) (8, 23) (8, 29) (8, 15) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 29) (29, 8) (29, 17) (29, 20) (29, 14) (21, 26) (21, 25) (24, 22) (24, 10) (24, 15) (3, 0) (3, 28) (3, 16) (20, 29) (20, 13) (20, 19) (13, 4) (13, 20) (13, 2) (5, 26) (5, 23) (5, 18) (5, 28) (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 12) (6, 27) (6, 1) (6, 25) (14, 29) (14, 18) (14, 16) (28, 3) (28, 5) (28, 1) (28, 12) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 14) (19, 0) (19, 20) (19, 16) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 24) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 28) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 25) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 2) (25, 16) (16, 3) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 25) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 22, 19}
- Node 1: {6, 28, 12}
- Node 2: {10, 13, 25}
- Node 3: {0, 28, 16}
- Node 4: {26, 7, 13, 17}
- Node 5: {26, 23, 18, 28}
- Node 6: {27, 1, 25}
- Node 7: {4, 15, 18}
- Node 8: {23, 29, 15}
- Node 9: {26}
- Node 10: {12, 2, 24}
- Node 11: {22, 17}
- Node 12: {10, 1, 28}
- Node 13: {4, 20, 2}
- Node 14: {29, 18, 16}
- Node 15: {7, 8, 24}
- Node 16: {3, 14, 19, 25}
- Node 17: {4, 11, 29}
- Node 18: {5, 7, 14}
- Node 19: {0, 20, 16}
- Node 20: {29, 13, 19}
- Node 21: {26, 25}
- Node 22: {0, 11, 24}
- Node 23: {8, 5}
- Node 24: {22, 10, 15}
- Node 25: {21, 6, 2, 16}
- Node 26: {9, 5, 21, 4}
- Node 27: {6}
- Node 28: {3, 5, 1, 12}
- Node 29: {8, 17, 20, 14}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 13, 17}
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {23, 18, 28}
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with neighbors {20, 2, 4}
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors {14, 19, 25}

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives a final number inside brackets:

\[ [4] \]

Listing the unique 3-stars found inside <>:

\[ <4, 7, 13, 17>, <5, 23, 18, 28>, <13, 20, 2, 4>, <16, 14, 19, 25> \]
