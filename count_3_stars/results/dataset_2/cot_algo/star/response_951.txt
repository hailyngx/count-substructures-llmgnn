Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first need to determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 3}

Next, we identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, 4, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 34 3-stars in the graph, represented as [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <1, 6, 7, 8>
- <4, 3, 5, 7>
- <7, 1, 4, 6>
- <8, 1, 4, 5>
