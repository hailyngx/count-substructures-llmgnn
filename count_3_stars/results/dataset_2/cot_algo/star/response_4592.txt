Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 8) (14, 17) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 19) (5, 14) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 15) (8, 19) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 12) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 11) (10, 14) (10, 0) (10, 1) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 4) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 16) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 11) (13, 19) (13, 1) (13, 4) (11, 6) (11, 18) (11, 4) 

Response:
By examining the given edges, we can construct the neighborhood sets for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {5, 9, 10, 4}
Node 1 neighbors: {10, 13}
Node 2 neighbors: {7, 16}
Node 3 neighbors: {15, 7, 12}
Node 4 neighbors: {0, 16, 13, 11}
Node 5 neighbors: {14, 0}
Node 6 neighbors: {15, 9, 11}
Node 7 neighbors: {3, 9, 2}
Node 8 neighbors: {15, 19}
Node 9 neighbors: {6, 7, 0, 19}
Node 10 neighbors: {14, 0, 1}
Node 11 neighbors: {6, 18, 4}
Node 12 neighbors: {3, 19, 16}
Node 13 neighbors: {1, 4, 19}
Node 14 neighbors: {5, 10}
Node 15 neighbors: {3, 18, 8, 6}
Node 16 neighbors: {12, 4, 2}
Node 17 neighbors: {14}
Node 18 neighbors: {15, 19, 11}
Node 19 neighbors: {9, 8, 18, 13, 12}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars each node forms:

Node 0 forms 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 4 forms 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 9 forms 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 10 forms 3-stars: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 13 forms 3-stars: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 15 forms 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 18 forms 3-stars: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 19 forms 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 25

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 4, 13>, <0, 4, 16>, <0, 5, 10>, <0, 9, 19>, <4, 11, 6>, <9, 19, 12>, <9, 19, 13>, <15, 3, 7>, <15, 3, 12>, <15, 6, 9>, <15, 6, 11>, <15, 8, 19>, <18, 11, 6>, <19, 12, 16>, <19, 12, 3>, <19, 12, 16>, <19, 13, 1>, <19, 13, 4>, <19, 13, 12>, <19, 18, 11>
