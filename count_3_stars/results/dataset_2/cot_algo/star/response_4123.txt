Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 9, 4}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 0, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {5, 0, 2, 9, 4}
- Node 4: {6, 2, 3, 1}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {7, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 0, 1}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {8, 3, 1}

Now, we can identify that nodes 2, 3, 5, and 7 each have 5 or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 40 possible 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>.
