Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 5) (17, 7) (22, 2) (22, 27) (22, 16) (22, 20) (23, 10) (23, 9) (4, 20) (4, 26) (8, 28) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 27) (26, 4) (26, 1) (26, 11) (21, 19) (28, 8) (28, 12) (28, 18) (28, 5) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 25) (5, 17) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (9, 23) (9, 27) (9, 19) (10, 23) (10, 3) (12, 28) (12, 24) (12, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 20) (6, 0) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 16) (11, 26) (11, 29) (25, 13) (25, 18) (0, 6) (27, 14) (27, 22) (27, 1) (27, 9) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 6) (24, 12) (24, 7) (24, 29) (7, 17) (7, 24) (7, 18) (18, 28) (18, 5) (18, 25) (18, 7) (18, 16) (19, 21) (19, 9) (19, 20) (16, 22) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 18) (15, 6) (15, 29) (20, 22) (20, 4) (20, 6) (20, 19) (29, 11) (29, 24) (29, 15) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {6}

Node 1: {2, 26, 27, 6}

Node 2: {1, 16, 22}

Node 3: {6, 10, 12}

Node 4: {20, 26}

Node 5: {13, 16, 17, 18, 28}

Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 15, 20}

Node 7: {17, 18, 24}

Node 8: {5, 18, 28}

Node 9: {19, 21, 23, 27}

Node 10: {3, 23}

Node 11: {26, 29}

Node 12: {3, 24, 28}

Node 13: {5, 14, 25}

Node 14: {13, 17, 27}

Node 15: {6, 29}

Node 16: {2, 5, 18, 22}

Node 17: {14, 5, 7}

Node 18: {5, 7, 16, 25, 28}

Node 19: {9, 20, 21}

Node 20: {4, 6, 19, 22}

Node 21: {19, 27}

Node 22: {2, 16, 20, 27}

Node 23: {9, 10}

Node 24: {7, 12, 29}

Node 25: {13, 18}

Node 26: {1, 4, 11}

Node 27: {9, 14, 21, 22, 1}

Node 28: {5, 8, 12, 18}

Node 29: {11, 15, 24}

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 1, Node 5, Node 6, Node 9, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 20, Node 22, Node 24, Node 26, Node 27, Node 28

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: \(4+10+10+4+1+1+1+4+1+10+4+4+1+1+10+4 = 65\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [65].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <1, (6, 26, 27)>, <5, (13, 16, 18)>, <6, (0, 1, 20)>, <9, (19, 21, 27)>, <12, (3, 24, 28)>, <13, (5, 14, 25)>, <14, (17, 27, 5)>, <16, (2, 18, 22)>, <17, (7, 14, 5)>, <18, (5, 7, 28)>, <20, (4, 6, 22)>, <22, (2, 20, 27)>, <24, (7, 12, 29)>, <26, (1, 4, 11)>, <27, (9, 22, 1)>, <28, (5, 12, 18)>.
