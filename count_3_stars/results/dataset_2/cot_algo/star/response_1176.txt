Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 2) (16, 8) (16, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 17) (1, 15) (1, 2) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 18) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 14) (8, 16) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 18) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 17) (17, 7) (17, 15) (17, 5) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 15) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 1) (19, 12) (19, 9) (14, 10) (14, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 17) (5, 18) (18, 3) (18, 8) (18, 5) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 19) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 9) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 19) (9, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {12, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {15, 2}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 11}
- Node 3: {11, 4, 18}
- Node 4: {3, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 11, 17, 18}
- Node 6: {8, 15, 16}
- Node 7: {2, 13, 15, 17}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 12, 18, 16}
- Node 9: {0, 10, 13, 19}
- Node 10: {9, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {10, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 12: {0, 8, 19}
- Node 13: {9, 7, 14}
- Node 14: {13, 10}
- Node 15: {1, 6, 7, 17}
- Node 16: {6, 8}
- Node 17: {5, 7, 15}
- Node 18: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 19: {9, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 5, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars. 
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  
Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 13 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (5, 9, 12)>, <5, (0, 11, 17)>, <9, (0, 10, 13)>, <8, (4, 6, 12)>, <8, (4, 6, 18)>, <8, (4, 12, 18)>, <8, (6, 12, 18)>, <8, (16, 6, 18)>, <8, (16, 8, 18)>, <8, (6, 8, 16)>, <8, (12, 16, 18)>, <8, (12, 8, 18)>, <8, (12, 16, 8)>.
