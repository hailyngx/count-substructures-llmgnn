Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 17) (26, 10) (26, 2) (26, 17) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 5) (21, 7) (21, 15) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 11) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 25) (6, 23) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 29) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 20) (15, 21) (15, 5) (15, 4) (23, 5) (23, 6) (23, 11) (23, 25) (2, 26) (2, 22) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 1) (18, 9) (18, 19) (18, 0) (18, 12) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 20) (25, 6) (25, 23) (25, 27) (25, 29) (27, 25) (27, 16) (12, 18) (12, 17) (12, 28) (1, 22) (1, 29) (29, 11) (29, 25) (29, 1) (14, 22) (14, 8) (14, 20) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 13) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 28) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 4) (13, 28) (16, 27) (17, 9) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 12) (28, 12) (28, 4) (28, 13) (20, 10) (20, 19) (20, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {8, 13, 18}
- Node 1: {22, 29}
- Node 2: {22, 26}
- Node 3: {4, 11, 13}
- Node 4: {3, 13, 15, 28}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 11, 15, 23}
- Node 6: {5, 23, 25}
- Node 7: {5, 11, 15, 21}
- Node 8: {0, 10, 14}
- Node 9: {17, 18}
- Node 10: {8, 20, 26}
- Node 11: {3, 5, 7, 23, 29}
- Node 12: {17, 18, 28}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 4, 28}
- Node 14: {8, 20, 22}
- Node 15: {4, 5, 7, 21}
- Node 16: {27}
- Node 17: {9, 12, 19, 26}
- Node 18: {0, 9, 12, 19}
- Node 19: {18, 20}
- Node 20: {10, 14, 19}
- Node 21: {5, 7, 15}
- Node 22: {1, 2, 14}
- Node 23: {5, 6, 11, 25}
- Node 25: {6, 23, 27, 29}
- Node 26: {2, 10, 17}
- Node 27: {16, 25}
- Node 28: {4, 12, 13}
- Node 29: {1, 11, 25}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 11, 23}. Therefore, one 3-star is formed.
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 23, 29}. Therefore, one 3-star is formed.
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 4, 28}. Therefore, one 3-star is formed.
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 21}. Therefore, one 3-star is formed.
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 18, 26}. Therefore, one 3-star is formed.
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 12, 19}. Therefore, one 3-star is formed.
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 23, 29}. Therefore, one 3-star is formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <5, 6, 11, 23>
- <11, 5, 23, 29>
- <13, 0, 4, 28>
- <15, 4, 5, 21>
- <17, 9, 18, 26>
- <18, 9, 12, 19>
- <25, 6, 23, 29>
