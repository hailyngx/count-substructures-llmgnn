Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 4, 6, 8
Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 2: 1, 9
Node 3: 0, 1, 6
Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9
Node 5: 8, 9
Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8
Node 7: 1, 6, 8
Node 8: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 20 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 80 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [80].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
