Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 7) (14, 9) (14, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we can start by listing out the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 9, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {6, 10, 7}
- Node 2: {6, 10, 8, 3, 7, 4}
- Node 3: {5, 0, 7, 12}
- Node 4: {2, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {13, 8, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 10, 2}
- Node 7: {2, 13, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 8: {5, 10, 2, 12}
- Node 9: {6, 14, 10, 0}
- Node 10: {9, 6, 11, 8, 1, 2}
- Node 11: {10, 13}
- Node 12: {8, 13, 3}
- Node 13: {5, 11, 12, 4, 7}
- Node 14: {9, 4}

Now, we need to check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars. 
Node 2, Node 3, Node 7, Node 8, Node 10, and Node 13 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 68 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [68], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 7, 13)>, 
<3, (2, 7, 13)>, 
<7, (2, 3, 13)>, 
<8, (2, 10, 12)>, 
<10, (2, 6, 8)>,
<13, (5, 7, 11)>.
