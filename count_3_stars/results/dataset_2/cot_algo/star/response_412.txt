Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we can first determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {2, 3, 5}
Node 1: {3, 5}
Node 2: {0, 3, 7, 8}
Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 4: {3, 6, 7, 9}
Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
Node 6: {4, 5, 7}
Node 7: {2, 4, 6, 9}
Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 1: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 3: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 0 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 64

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 8, 9>
<7, 4, 9> 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [64].
