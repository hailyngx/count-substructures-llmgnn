Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 8}


Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 3 can form a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 5}
- Node 4 can form a 3-star with neighbors {7, 8, 9}
- Node 5 can form a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 6}
- Node 8 can form a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 7}

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of 4. So, the final answer is [4].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
