Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 6}

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, and Node 7 have three or more neighbors.
- Node 6 has exactly three neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 7 have four neighbors, so each forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has four neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>
