Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 19) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 18) (4, 14) (18, 4) (18, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 17) (0, 2) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 15) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 8) (11, 7) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 4) (12, 1) (12, 15) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 13) (6, 18) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 13) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 6) (17, 15) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 13) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 10) (15, 16) (15, 12) (15, 7) (15, 17) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 12, 13, 14
- Node 2: 0, 10, 16
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 14, 18
- Node 5: 14, 16, 17
- Node 6: 7, 13, 17, 18
- Node 7: 3, 6, 11, 13, 15
- Node 8: 3, 9, 11, 17
- Node 9: 8, 19
- Node 10: 2, 13, 19
- Node 11: 7, 8
- Node 12: 1, 15
- Node 13: 1, 6, 7, 10, 19
- Node 14: 1, 4, 5
- Node 15: 7, 12, 16, 17
- Node 16: 2, 5, 15
- Node 17: 5, 6, 8, 15
- Node 18: 4, 6
- Node 19: 9, 10, 13

We see that the nodes 1, 7, 13, 15, and 17 have 5 or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 29 \), which we represent as [29].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (12, 13, 14)>, <7, (3, 6, 13)>, <7, (6, 13, 17)>, <7, (7, 13, 15)>, <7, (11, 13, 15)>, <7, (13, 15, 19)>, <13, (1, 7, 19)>, <13, (6, 7, 19)>, <13, (7, 10, 19)>, <13, (7, 13, 19)>, <15, (7, 16, 17)>, <15, (12, 15, 17)>, <15, (15, 16, 17)>, <15, (15, 17, 19)>, <17, (6, 8, 15)>, <17, (6, 13, 15)>, <17, (8, 15, 17)>, <17, (15, 16, 17)>.
