Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 4) (5, 11) (6, 18) (6, 16) (4, 10) (4, 17) (18, 6) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 19) (8, 15) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 9) (19, 8) (19, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 15) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 9) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (7, 14) (7, 19) (7, 9) (15, 8) (15, 0) (15, 13) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by examining each node's neighbor set and identifying the 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors. 

Here is the breakdown of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has neighbors: {11, 2, 14, 15, 12}. 
  - Number of 3-stars: [1]
  - Unique 3-stars: <0, (11, 15, 2)>

- Node 3 has neighbors: {10, 17, 12, 9}. 
  - Number of 3-stars: [3]
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (10, 17, 12)>, <3, (10, 17, 9)>, <3, (17, 12, 9)>

- Node 14 has neighbors: {0, 1, 7, 9}. 
  - Number of 3-stars: [1]
  - Unique 3-stars: <14, (0, 1, 7)>

- Node 16 has neighbors: {6, 12, 9}. 
  - Number of 3-stars: [1]
  - Unique 3-stars: <16, (12, 6, 9)>

- Node 17 has neighbors: {10, 13, 3, 2, 4}. 
  - Number of 3-stars: [1]
  - Unique 3-stars: <17, (10, 13, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is the sum of the individual counts, which is [7].
