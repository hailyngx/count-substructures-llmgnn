Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 27) (1, 3) (1, 23) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 26) (3, 22) (7, 17) (21, 28) (21, 11) (10, 26) (10, 27) (10, 2) (10, 28) (11, 21) (11, 29) (11, 20) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 17) (8, 29) (19, 3) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 15) (26, 3) (26, 10) (26, 19) (26, 29) (28, 21) (28, 10) (28, 4) (28, 14) (5, 18) (5, 29) (13, 16) (13, 20) (25, 27) (25, 14) (25, 24) (25, 2) (27, 9) (27, 10) (27, 25) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 12) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 18) (2, 10) (2, 25) (2, 22) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 24) (22, 17) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 16) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 14) (14, 28) (14, 25) (14, 15) (23, 1) (23, 15) (29, 11) (29, 8) (29, 26) (29, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 24) (24, 25) (24, 22) (24, 12) (24, 20) (17, 7) (17, 4) (17, 0) (17, 22) (20, 11) (20, 13) (20, 24) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {12, 16, 17}
- Node 1: {3, 23}
- Node 2: {10, 14, 22, 25}
- Node 3: {1, 19, 22, 26}
- Node 4: {9, 17, 28}
- Node 5: {18, 29}
- Node 6: {9, 12}
- Node 7: {17}
- Node 8: {29}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 27}
- Node 10: {2, 26, 27, 28}
- Node 11: {20, 21, 29}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 24}
- Node 13: {16, 20}
- Node 14: {2, 15, 25, 28}
- Node 15: {14, 23}
- Node 16: {0, 13, 18}
- Node 17: {0, 4, 7, 22}
- Node 18: {5, 16, 19}
- Node 19: {3, 15, 18, 26}
- Node 20: {11, 13, 24}
- Node 21: {11, 28}
- Node 22: {2, 3, 17, 24}
- Node 23: {1, 15}
- Node 24: {12, 20, 22}
- Node 25: {2, 14, 24, 27}
- Node 26: {3, 10, 19, 29}
- Node 27: {9, 10, 25}
- Node 28: {10, 14, 21, 4}
- Node 29: {11, 26, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
<4, (9, 17, 28)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
