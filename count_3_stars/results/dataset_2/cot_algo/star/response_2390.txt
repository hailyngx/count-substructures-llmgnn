Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) 

Response:
Since the graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges, it is not evident that the graph is a 3-star graph. We need to determine if there are any 3-stars in the graph from the given edge list.

First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {10, 7, 2}
- Node 1: {3, 12}
- Node 2: {3, 13, 11, 4, 0}
- Node 3: {9, 6, 1, 14, 2}
- Node 4: {8, 13, 7, 2, 14}
- Node 5: {8, 7, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 10, 3, 11}
- Node 7: {5, 13, 4, 0, 14}
- Node 8: {5, 4, 14}
- Node 9: {6, 11, 14, 3, 12}
- Node 10: {6, 11, 0}
- Node 11: {9, 6, 10, 12, 2}
- Node 12: {1, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {4, 2, 7}
- Node 14: {5, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7}

Now, we can see if there are any 3-stars within the graph:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 14, 2: <3, (1, 14, 2)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 8, 14, 13: <4, (8, 14, 13)>
  
There are a total of 2 unique 3-stars formed in this graph. So, the final number of 3-stars is [2].
