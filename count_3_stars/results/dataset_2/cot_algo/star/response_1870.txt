Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 0) (6, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 10) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 9) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 7, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 7, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 9, 10}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 6, 12}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 13}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 13, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 4, 11, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 5, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 3, 7, 10, 12}

    - <1, (5, 13, 10)>
    - <1, (13, 10, 14)>
    - <1, (13, 11, 12)>
    - <1, (11, 12, 14)>

- Node 2: 0 3-stars found as it has only 4 neighbors

- Node 3: \[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]
    - <3, (1, 7, 14)>
    - <3, (2, 8, 9)>

- Node 13: \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
    - <13, (0, 1, 5)>
    - <13, (1, 5, 13)>

- Node 14: 0 3-stars found as it has only 5 neighbors

Summing up all the 3-stars calculated for each node: 
\[ 10 + 20 + 0 + 20 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 0\] = 65

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [65].
