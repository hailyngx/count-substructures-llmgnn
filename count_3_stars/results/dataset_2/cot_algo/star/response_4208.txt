Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 13, 10
- Node 1: 3, 5, 9, 12
- Node 2: 5, 6, 7, 12
- Node 3: 1, 7, 11, 13
- Node 4: 6, 8, 10, 11, 14
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 14
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12
- Node 7: 2, 3, 8, 9, 11
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7, 10
- Node 9: 1, 7, 12
- Node 10: 0, 4, 6, 8, 14
- Node 11: 3, 4, 7, 14
- Node 12: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 13: 0, 3
- Node 14: 4, 5, 10, 11

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors

For the nodes listed above, we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 72 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [72]. Listed 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 7, 11)>
- <4, (6, 8, 10)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <6, (2, 4, 12)>
- <7, (3, 8, 11)>
- <8, (4, 6, 10)>
- <10, (4, 6, 14)>
- <11, (3, 4, 14)>
- <12, (1, 2, 9)>
- <14, (4, 5, 11)>
