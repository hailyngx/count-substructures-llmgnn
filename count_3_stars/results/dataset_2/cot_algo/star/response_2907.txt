Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the given graph to better understand its structure:

```
         1--2--11
       / |   |  |
     3   9--6--12
      \  |  |   |
       \ |  |   |
         13--0--10
        /|     /|
      7--4----8-14
```

From the given edges, we can see that the nodes and their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 5, 6, 3, 10, 8, 13
- Node 1: 9, 3, 2, 14
- Node 2: 1, 11, 4, 8, 14
- Node 3: 1, 0
- Node 4: 7, 8, 12, 14, 2
- Node 5: 9, 6, 0, 10
- Node 6: 5, 9, 12, 0
- Node 7: 4, 13
- Node 8: 4, 2, 0, 12
- Node 9: 5, 6, 1, 13, 12
- Node 10: 5, 0, 12
- Node 11: 2
- Node 12: 9, 6, 10, 4, 8, 13
- Node 13: 9, 7, 12, 0, 14
- Node 14: 1, 4, 2, 13

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[
\sum_{v \in V} \binom{d_v}{3} = \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 102
\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [102].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 10>, <0, 5, 13>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 10, 12>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 14>, <1, 9, 13>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 14>, <2, 8, 12>, <4, 8, 12>, <4, 8, 13>, <8, 12, 13>
