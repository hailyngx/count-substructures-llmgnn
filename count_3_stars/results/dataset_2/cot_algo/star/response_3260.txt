- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 5, 6
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 21, 4, 13, 17
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 14
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 11, 2, 24, 27
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 21, 4, 19, 28
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 26, 22, 18, 20
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 0, 29
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 16, 7

- Node 20 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 14, 27
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 3, 13, 8, 5
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 9, 26, 16
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 15, 26, 29
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 7, 27
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 19, 18
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 9, 23, 17
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 24, 20
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 8, 0
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 23, 10

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 26, 27

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
2: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
11: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
12: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
17: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
19: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
20: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
21: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
22: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
26: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
27: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42].

Unique 3-stars:

<3, 21, 11, 20>
<4, 8, 19, 28>
<4, 5, 13, 21>
<4, 5, 17, 13>

<9, 26, 23, 15>
<13, 21, 5, 17>
<17, 26, 19, 5>
