Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3}  = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 56

Therefore, the final number is [56].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
