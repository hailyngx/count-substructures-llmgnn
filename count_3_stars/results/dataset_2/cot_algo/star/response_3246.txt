Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 18) (4, 18) (4, 1) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 3) (13, 12) (13, 11) (15, 16) (15, 0) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 10) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (14, 2) (14, 12) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 9) (17, 6) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 12) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 15) (0, 6) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 19) (12, 1) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 18) (10, 2) (10, 16) 

Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. 

For each node, let's identify its neighbors:
- Node 0: {5, 8, 15, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 19, 12}
- Node 2: {8, 19, 10, 14, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 18}
- Node 4: {18, 1}
- Node 5: {9, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {18, 11, 17, 0}
- Node 7: {2, 18, 16}
- Node 8: {9, 2, 0, 18}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 17}
- Node 10: {2, 16}
- Node 11: {13, 6}
- Node 12: {13, 14, 19, 1}
- Node 13: {12, 11}
- Node 14: {2, 12}
- Node 15: {0, 16}
- Node 16: {15, 7, 10}
- Node 17: {9, 6}
- Node 18: {8, 4, 6, 7, 3}
- Node 19: {2, 1, 12}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 7, which we need to represent as [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 15)>
<2, (8, 19, 10)>
<6, (18, 11, 17)>
<8, (9, 2, 18)>
<12, (13, 14, 19)>
<18, (8, 4, 6)>
<19, (2, 1, 12)>
