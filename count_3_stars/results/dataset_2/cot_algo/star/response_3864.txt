Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 46
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>
