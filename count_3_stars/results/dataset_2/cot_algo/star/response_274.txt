Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
There are four nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
Node 0 has neighbors: 9, 6, 3, 4, 8, 2
inom{6}{3} = 20

For node 2:
Node 2 has neighbors: 6, 3, 8, 7, 0
inom{5}{3} = 10

For node 6:
Node 6 has neighbors: 9, 1, 7, 2, 4, 0
inom{6}{3} = 20

For node 8:
Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 0, 7, 2
inom{6}{3} = 20

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 70, which can be written as [70].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
