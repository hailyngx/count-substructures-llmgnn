Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 10) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 14) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 7) (9, 10) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 6, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 8, 14}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {8, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {7, 10}
- Node 10: {1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 11: {0, 4, 5, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {7, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 11, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 5, 6, 11}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, Node 10, and Node 14 have 6 or more neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars. 

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up these counts: 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 74

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [74], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 6, 11)>, <0, (2, 6, 14)>, <0, (4, 6, 10)>, <0, (4, 6, 11)>, <0, (4, 11, 14)>, <0, (6, 11, 14)>, <2, (6, 11, 14)>.
