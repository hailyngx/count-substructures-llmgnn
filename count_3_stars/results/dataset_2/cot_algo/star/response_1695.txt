Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: neighbors {3, 5, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 7, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Now let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
