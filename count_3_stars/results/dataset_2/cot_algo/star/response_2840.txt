Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 8) (3, 15) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 12) (10, 17) (10, 4) (17, 10) (17, 2) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 18) (18, 3) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 7) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 0) (0, 16) (0, 1) (7, 18) (7, 13) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (6, 14) (6, 19) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 13) (19, 6) (19, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 12) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 5) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 16}
Node 1: {0, 13, 16, 5}
Node 2: {9, 13, 17, 19}
Node 3: {8, 15, 18}
Node 4: {5, 8, 10}
Node 5: {1, 4, 12, 18}
Node 6: {14, 19}
Node 7: {13, 18}
Node 8: {3, 4, 14, 15, 16, 18}
Node 9: {2, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Node 10: {4, 17}
Node 11: {9}
Node 12: {5, 9, 15}
Node 13: {1, 2, 7, 9}
Node 14: {6, 8, 9}
Node 15: {3, 8, 12}
Node 16: {0, 1, 8}
Node 17: {2, 10}
Node 18: {3, 5, 7, 8}
Node 19: {2, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 8: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 15: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 18: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 5, 12>
<8, 14, 9>
<9, 12, 5>
<13, 1, 5>
<13, 7, 18>
<14, 8, 9>
<16, 0, 1>
<16, 0, 8>
<16, 1, 5>
<17, 2, 9>
<2, 13, 7>
<3, 8, 12>
<4, 8, 5>
<4, 10, 17>
<5, 4, 10>
<5, 12, 15>
<8, 15, 3>
<9, 11, 14>
<9, 12, 15>
<9, 13, 1>
