Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 15) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 16) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 13) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 9) (13, 1) (13, 12) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (19, 0) (19, 11) (19, 10) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 8) (12, 15) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 9) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 19) (11, 5) (3, 14) (3, 8) (6, 8) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 12) (9, 17) (9, 16) (10, 19) (10, 5) (5, 0) (5, 11) (5, 10) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 5, 19}
- Node 1: {2, 18, 17, 13}
- Node 2: {18, 1, 16, 15}
- Node 3: {14, 8}
- Node 4: {7, 11, 17}
- Node 5: {0, 11, 10}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {4, 15}
- Node 8: {16, 6, 12, 3}
- Node 9: {17, 16}
- Node 10: {19, 5}
- Node 11: {4, 18, 0, 19, 5}
- Node 12: {17, 13, 8, 15}
- Node 13: {1, 12}
- Node 14: {3, 16}
- Node 15: {7, 2, 12}
- Node 16: {2, 14, 8, 9}
- Node 17: {4, 1, 12, 9}
- Node 18: {2, 11, 1}
- Node 19: {0, 11, 10}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 

\[ 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, 5, 11>
- <1, 2, 18>
- <1, 2, 17>
- <1, 2, 13>
- <2, 15, 16>
- <4, 7, 17>
- <8, 12, 13>
- <11, 18, 5>
- <16, 9, 17>
- <19, 10, 5>
