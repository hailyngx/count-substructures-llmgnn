Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 7) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 8) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 8) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 14) 

Response:
The nodes are connected as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 11, 13, 4, 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 12, 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 13, 12, 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 12, 14, 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 0, 14.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 8, 7, 14.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 10, 3, 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 10, 5, 13, 2, 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 10, 5, 1, 0, 14.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 7.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 11, 8, 7, 13.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 0.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 2, 14, 3, 1.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 10, 5, 2, 0, 7.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 12, 3, 8.

Following the instructions, we will now find the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60, so there are a total of 60 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [60]. 

And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
