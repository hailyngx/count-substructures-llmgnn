Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 16) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 19) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 18) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 4) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 13) (7, 11) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 14) (0, 2) (0, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 19) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 14) (15, 5) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 18) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 12) (16, 6) (16, 9) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: (2, 5)
- Node 1: (4, 8)
- Node 2: (4, 8, 17, 18, 0)
- Node 3: (10, 19)
- Node 4: (1, 8, 2, 12, 9)
- Node 5: (11, 0, 19, 15)
- Node 6: (16)
- Node 7: (11)
- Node 8: (1, 2, 19)
- Node 9: (4, 16, 13, 12)
- Node 10: (3, 17, 14)
- Node 11: (7, 5, 17)
- Node 12: (9, 4, 14)
- Node 13: (9, 17, 18)
- Node 14: (10, 12, 19)
- Node 15: (5)
- Node 16: (6, 9)
- Node 17: (10, 11, 13, 2, 18)
- Node 18: (17, 2, 19, 13)
- Node 19: (3, 18, 8, 5, 14)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 56 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (8, 17, 18)>, <4, (1, 2, 12)>, <5, (11, 0, 19)>, <8, (1, 2, 19)>, <9, (4, 13, 16)>, <10, (3, 14, 17)>, <12, (4, 9, 14)>, <13, (9, 17, 18)>, <14, (10, 12, 19)>, <17, (10, 11, 18)>, <18, (13, 17, 19)>, <19, (5, 14, 18)>
