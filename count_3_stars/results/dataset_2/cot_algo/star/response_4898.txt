Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 0) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: {6, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {7, 12}
- Node 2: {9, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 8, 11}
- Node 8: {0, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 8, 11}
- Node 11: {0, 7, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 4, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 13}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 5: 6 neighbors (forms 20 3-stars)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (forms 4 3-stars)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (forms 4 3-stars)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (forms 4 3-stars)
- Node 10: 4 neighbors (forms 4 3-stars)
- Node 11: 5 neighbors (forms 10 3-stars)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (forms 4 3-stars)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (does not form any 3-star)
- Node 14: 6 neighbors (forms 20 3-stars)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 70

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [70].
