Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 6) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (1, 12) (1, 2) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 14) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 8, 10, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {12, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 9, 11, 3, 1}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 4, 2, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8, 0, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 2, 12, 3, 10}
- Node 6: Neighbors {13, 3, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {8, 10, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {13, 4, 14, 0, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 2, 0}
- Node 10: Neighbors {5, 11, 0, 12, 7}
- Node 11: Neighbors {13, 10, 7, 2}
- Node 12: Neighbors {5, 13, 10, 7, 1}
- Node 13: Neighbors {8, 12, 11, 6}
- Node 14: Neighbors {8, 7, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with {9, 2, 12}
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with {13, 4, 14}
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with {13, 10, 7}

Since each of the nodes above only forms 1 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <5, (9, 2, 12)>
- <8, (13, 4, 14)>
- <12, (13, 10, 7)>
