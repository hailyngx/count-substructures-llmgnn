Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 16) (14, 10) (17, 3) (17, 19) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 16) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 18) (11, 3) (11, 19) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 15) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 15) (12, 1) (15, 6) (15, 2) (15, 12) (19, 17) (19, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (16, 14) (16, 4) (10, 14) (10, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [28] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 13)>
<2, (4, 12, 15)>
<3, (10, 17, 19)>
<4, (2, 9, 16)>
<5, (6, 7, 12)>
<6, (5, 15, 18)>
<7, (0, 5, 14)>
<8, (0, 9, 13)>
<11, (3, 18, 19)>
<12, (2, 5, 15)>
<13, (0, 8, 5)>
<14, (0, 7, 10)>
<15, (2, 6, 12)>
<16, (4, 14, 16)>
<17, (3, 10, 19)>
