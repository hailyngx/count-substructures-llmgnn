Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (13, 12) (13, 14) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 4) (3, 11) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 12) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 7) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 7, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 9, 12}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 3: {5, 11}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 9: {1, 7, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 8, 11}
- Node 11: {3, 4, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {12, 14}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 9, 13}

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 5 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, we have 1 3-star per node.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we use the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to calculate the number of 3-stars.

Calculations:
- Node 0: \binom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: \binom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: \binom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: \binom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: \binom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: \binom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: \binom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: \binom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: \binom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 11: \binom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: \binom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 14: \binom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars:
4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 68

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [68].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 12)>
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- <9, (1, 7, 14)>
- <11, (3, 4, 12)>
- <12, (0, 1, 9)>
- <14, (4, 5, 9)>
