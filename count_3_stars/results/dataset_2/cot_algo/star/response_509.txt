Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 11) (0, 25) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 29) (27, 8) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 24) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 22) (3, 8) (15, 20) (15, 2) (15, 5) (15, 29) (20, 15) (20, 26) (20, 4) (20, 19) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 2) (28, 11) (28, 22) (28, 2) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 7) (26, 20) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 25) (26, 17) (6, 22) (21, 10) (21, 23) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 12) (10, 21) (10, 19) (25, 0) (25, 27) (25, 26) (25, 19) (16, 1) (16, 13) (24, 1) (29, 27) (29, 15) (29, 5) (2, 15) (2, 11) (2, 28) (2, 9) (7, 13) (7, 19) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 29) (19, 20) (19, 10) (19, 25) (19, 7) (17, 26) (17, 23) (17, 4) (22, 3) (22, 28) (22, 6) (22, 12) (23, 0) (23, 21) (23, 17) (12, 3) (12, 18) (12, 22) (4, 20) (4, 17) (8, 27) (8, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 27, 11, 25, 23
- Node 1: 3, 16, 24
- Node 2: 15, 11, 28, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 12, 22, 8
- Node 4: 20, 17
- Node 5: 3, 15, 18, 29
- Node 6: 22
- Node 7: 13, 19, 9
- Node 8: 27, 3
- Node 9: 2, 7
- Node 10: 21, 19
- Node 11: 0, 2, 28
- Node 12: 3, 18, 22
- Node 13: 26, 16, 7
- Node 15: 20, 2, 5, 29
- Node 16: 1, 13
- Node 17: 26, 4, 23
- Node 18: 26, 5, 12
- Node 19: 20, 25, 10, 7
- Node 20: 15, 26, 4, 19
- Node 21: 10, 23
- Node 22: 3, 28, 6, 12
- Node 23: 0, 21, 17
- Node 24: 1
- Node 25: 0, 27, 26, 19
- Node 26: 13, 20, 18, 25, 17
- Node 27: 0, 25, 29, 8
- Node 28: 11, 22, 2
- Node 29: 27, 15, 5

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3, 5, 15, 19, 25, and 26

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (11, 23, 27)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 22, 15)>, <3, (8, 27, 29)>, <5, (15, 18, 29)>, <15, (2, 20, 29)>, <15, (5, 20, 29)>, <15, (15, 20, 29)>, <19, (7, 20, 25)>, <19, (7, 20, 10)>, <25, (0, 26, 27)>, <25, (19, 26, 20)>, <25, (19, 26, 17)>, <25, (19, 26, 25)>, <26, (13, 25, 17)>, <26, (13, 25, 20)>, <26, (13, 25, 18)>, <26, (17, 25, 20)>, <26, (17, 25, 18)>, <26, (17, 25, 13)>, <26, (18, 25, 20)>
