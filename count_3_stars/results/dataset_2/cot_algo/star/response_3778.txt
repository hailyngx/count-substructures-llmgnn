Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 10) (6, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (18, 10) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 7) (8, 11) (8, 2) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 19) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 12) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 7) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 13) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 14) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 19) (13, 16) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 18) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 17) (0, 19) (17, 2) (17, 0) (14, 7) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 11, 9, 13, 17, 19
Node 1 neighbors: 11, 16, 7
Node 2 neighbors: 8, 17, 7
Node 3 neighbors: 11, 4, 19
Node 4 neighbors: 5, 3
Node 5 neighbors: 12, 15, 4, 10
Node 6 neighbors: 10
Node 7 neighbors: 2, 1, 14
Node 8 neighbors: 11, 2
Node 9 neighbors: 15, 0, 19
Node 10 neighbors: 5, 6, 18
Node 11 neighbors: 16, 3, 1, 0, 8
Node 12 neighbors: 16, 5, 15, 13
Node 13 neighbors: 16, 12, 0
Node 14 neighbors: 7
Node 15 neighbors: 16, 5, 9, 12
Node 16 neighbors: 11, 15, 12, 1, 13
Node 17 neighbors: 2, 0
Node 18 neighbors: 10
Node 19 neighbors: 3, 9, 0

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 15, and Node 16

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 10: inom{3}{3} = 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 16: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding these up: 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 43

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 9, 19>
<0, 9, 13>
<0, 13, 19>
<0, 17, 19>
<0, 11, 13>
<0, 11, 19>
<0, 11, 17>
<0, 11, 9>
<1, 7, 14>
<5, 10, 6>
<3, 4, 19>
<11, 8, 2>
<11, 16, 1>
<11, 16, 13>
<11, 16, 3>
<11, 16, 12>
<11, 16, 15>
<16, 1, 7>
<16, 12, 15>
<16, 13, 12>
