Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 18) (17, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 7) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (5, 2) (5, 15) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 9) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 3) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 15) (1, 0) (6, 14) (6, 15) (6, 11) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 3) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 3) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 19) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 15) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 4) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are:

- Node 0: {1, 7, 14, 16}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 11}
- Node 3: {7, 9, 18, 19}
- Node 4: {2, 15, 19}
- Node 5: {2, 15}
- Node 6: {11, 14, 15}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 8, 12}
- Node 8: {7, 10}
- Node 9: {3, 13, 16}
- Node 10: {8, 12, 18}
- Node 11: {2, 6, 13}
- Node 12: {7, 10, 17}
- Node 13: {9, 11, 16}
- Node 14: {0, 6}
- Node 15: {4, 5, 6, 18}
- Node 16: {0, 9, 13, 15}
- Node 17: {12}
- Node 18: {3, 10, 15, 19}
- Node 19: {4, 18}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, 16, 18

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed:
\[ \sum_{{v \in V, |N(v)| \geq 3}} \binom{{|N(v)|}}{3} = \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 14)>, <0, (1, 7, 16)>, <0, (14, 6, 15)>, <0, (16, 9, 13)>, <2, (4, 15, 19)>, <3, (7, 9, 18)>, <4, (15, 18, 19)>, <6, (11, 14, 15)>, <7, (8, 10, 12)>, <15, (4, 18, 19)>, <16, (9, 13, 15)>, <18, (10, 15, 19)>.
