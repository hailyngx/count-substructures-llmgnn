Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 28) (16, 5) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 29) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (6, 11) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (21, 10) (21, 13) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 20) (22, 8) (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 23) (0, 26) (20, 18) (20, 29) (20, 12) (20, 13) (12, 15) (12, 20) (12, 19) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 24) (8, 5) (8, 22) (8, 2) (8, 4) (14, 27) (14, 1) (14, 23) (4, 18) (4, 27) (4, 8) (4, 1) (26, 0) (26, 23) (28, 16) (28, 17) (28, 10) (29, 5) (29, 15) (29, 20) (23, 11) (23, 27) (23, 14) (23, 26) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 28) (17, 9) (17, 28) (17, 25) (17, 3) (25, 17) (25, 1) (24, 2) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 19) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 3) (19, 13) (13, 21) (13, 20) (13, 3) (13, 19) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 25) 

Response:
First, we need to find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 26)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (nodes 9, 7, 14, 4)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (nodes 7, 8, 24, 22)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (nodes 5, 17, 13, 19)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (nodes 18, 8, 1, 27)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (nodes 16, 8, 29, 3)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (nodes 11, 9, 19)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (nodes 2, 1)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (nodes 5, 22, 2, 4)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (nodes 6, 17, 1)
- Node 10: 3 neighbors (nodes 21, 18, 28)
- Node 11: 3 neighbors (nodes 6, 23, 19)
- Node 12: 3 neighbors (nodes 15, 20, 19)
- Node 13: 4 neighbors (nodes 21, 20, 3, 19)
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (nodes 27, 1, 23)
- Node 15: 3 neighbors (nodes 27, 29, 12)
- Node 16: 2 neighbors (nodes 5, 28)
- Node 17: 4 neighbors (nodes 9, 28, 25, 3)
- Node 18: 4 neighbors (nodes 4, 10, 20, 21)
- Node 19: 4 neighbors (nodes 11, 12, 3, 13)
- Node 20: 4 neighbors (nodes 18, 29, 12, 13)
- Node 21: 2 neighbors (nodes 10, 13)
- Node 22: 2 neighbors (nodes 8, 24)
- Node 23: 4 neighbors (nodes 11, 27, 14, 26)
- Node 24: 1 neighbor (node 2)
- Node 25: 2 neighbors (nodes 17, 1)
- Node 26: 2 neighbors (nodes 0, 23)
- Node 27: 4 neighbors (nodes 15, 4, 14, 23)
- Node 28: 3 neighbors (nodes 16, 17, 10)
- Node 29: 4 neighbors (nodes 5, 15, 20, 12)

Next, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars.

Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, Node 8, Node 13, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19, Node 20, Node 23, and Node 27 all have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the 3-stars for these nodes.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 4: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 5: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 8: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 13: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 17: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 18: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 19: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 20: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 23: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 27: 4 choose 3 = 4

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 4, 14>, <1, 4, 27>, <1, 4, 23>, <1, 14, 27>, <1, 27, 23>, <4, 23, 27>, <5, 8, 22>, <5, 8, 2>, <5, 8, 4>, <5, 22, 2>, <5, 22, 8>, <5, 2, 8>, <8, 22, 24>, <17, 28, 10>, <17, 28, 3>, <17, 10, 3>, <17, 3, 25>, <28, 10, 17>, <28, 10, 3>, <28, 17, 3>, <28, 17, 25>, <10, 18, 20>, <10, 18, 21>, <10, 20, 21>, <18, 20, 29>, <18, 20, 13>, <18, 20, 21>, <18, 29, 20>, <20, 29, 12>, <20, 29, 13>, <20, 13, 19>, <20, 13, 3>, <29, 15, 12>, <29, 15, 20>, <29, 15, 27>, <29, 12, 20>, <23, 14, 27>, <23, 14, 1>, <23, 14, 26>, <23, 27, 14>, <27, 4, 8>, <27, 4, 1>, <27, 4, 14>, <27, 8, 4>
