Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 23) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 16) (22, 15) (22, 1) (9, 23) (26, 18) (26, 5) (0, 27) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (27, 0) (27, 14) (27, 5) (1, 22) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (4, 24) (4, 20) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 7) (18, 26) (18, 10) (18, 28) (18, 21) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 21) (5, 26) (5, 27) (5, 1) (5, 17) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 2) (7, 8) (7, 29) (7, 19) (7, 28) (29, 7) (2, 6) (2, 23) (2, 28) (19, 7) (19, 25) (19, 12) (21, 18) (21, 17) (16, 22) (10, 18) (10, 20) (23, 13) (23, 9) (23, 2) (25, 19) (25, 28) (25, 14) (14, 13) (14, 27) (14, 25) (14, 24) (14, 15) (24, 4) (24, 14) (24, 20) (28, 18) (28, 7) (28, 2) (28, 25) (15, 22) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 12) (11, 8) (11, 20) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 15) (20, 4) (20, 10) (20, 24) (20, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 8, 27
- Node 1: 0, 5, 22
- Node 2: 6, 23, 28
- Node 3: 0, 6, 12
- Node 4: 14, 20, 24
- Node 5: 1, 17, 26, 27
- Node 6: 2, 3, 15, 17
- Node 7: 8, 19, 28, 29
- Node 8: 0, 7, 11
- Node 9: 13, 23
- Node 10: 18, 20
- Node 11: 8, 20
- Node 12: 3, 15, 19
- Node 13: 9, 14, 22, 23
- Node 14: 4, 13, 15, 24, 25, 27
- Node 15: 6, 12, 14, 22
- Node 16: 22
- Node 17: 5, 6, 21
- Node 18: 10, 21, 26, 28
- Node 19: 7, 12, 25
- Node 20: 4, 10, 11, 24
- Node 21: 17, 18
- Node 22: 1, 13, 15, 16
- Node 23: 2, 9, 13
- Node 24: 4, 14, 20
- Node 25: 14, 19, 28
- Node 26: 5, 18
- Node 27: 0, 5, 14
- Node 28: 2, 7, 18, 25
- Node 29: 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 22: 6 3-stars
- Node 27: 4 3-stars
- Node 14: 15 3-stars
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 20: 1 3-star

Total 3-stars: 1 + 6 + 4 + 15 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].

Unique 3-stars found: 
- <22, (1, 13, 15)>
- <27, (0, 14, 5)>
- <27, (5, 14, 25)>
- <27, (14, 24, 4)>
- <27, (14, 5, 1)>
- <14, (4, 25, 24)>
- <14, (4, 24, 20)>
- <14, (5, 24, 20)>
- <14, (13, 22, 15)>
- <14, (13, 23, 9)>
- <14, (15, 12, 6)>
- <14, (15, 22, 6)>
- <14, (15, 12, 3)>
- <14, (15, 22, 6)>
- <14, (15, 22, 6)>
- <8, (0, 7, 11)>
- <20, (4, 11, 10)>
