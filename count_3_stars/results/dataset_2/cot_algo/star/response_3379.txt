Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 16) (22, 28) (22, 20) (5, 27) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 23) (10, 18) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 18) (4, 23) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (7, 19) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 19) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 24) (21, 28) (21, 25) (21, 17) (28, 22) (28, 21) (28, 14) (28, 23) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 20) (26, 25) (1, 8) (1, 29) (1, 27) (17, 21) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 15) (24, 2) (24, 26) (24, 19) (24, 29) (0, 17) (0, 25) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 28) (18, 10) (18, 11) (29, 1) (29, 24) (29, 6) (6, 4) (6, 17) (6, 29) (6, 3) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 24) (3, 6) (3, 14) (14, 7) (14, 28) (14, 3) (14, 15) (20, 22) (20, 26) (15, 17) (15, 14) (25, 21) (25, 26) (25, 0) (25, 16) (16, 22) (16, 9) (16, 25) (27, 13) (27, 5) (27, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: {17, 25}
- Node 1: {8, 27, 29}
- Node 2: {8, 9, 13, 24}
- Node 3: {6, 14}
- Node 4: {6, 23}
- Node 5: {27}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 17, 29}
- Node 7: {14, 19}
- Node 8: {1, 2}
- Node 9: {2, 16, 23}
- Node 10: {18}
- Node 11: {18, 19, 23}
- Node 12: {13, 19}
- Node 13: {2, 12, 22, 26, 27}
- Node 14: {3, 7, 15, 28}
- Node 15: {14, 17}
- Node 16: {9, 22, 25}
- Node 17: {0, 6, 15, 21}
- Node 18: {10, 11}
- Node 19: {7, 11, 12, 24}
- Node 20: {22, 26}
- Node 21: {17, 21, 25, 28}
- Node 22: {13, 16, 20, 28}
- Node 23: {4, 9, 11, 28}
- Node 24: {2, 19, 26, 29}
- Node 25: {16, 21, 25}
- Node 26: {13, 20, 24, 25}
- Node 27: {1, 13, 5}
- Node 28: {22, 23, 14, 21}
- Node 29: {1, 6, 24}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 10
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 15, 18, 20
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 7

Calculating the 3-stars from the nodes above:

- For nodes 0, 5, and 10: We have [0] 3-stars.
- For nodes 15, 18, and 20:

<15, (14, 17, 21)>
<18, (10, 11, 19)>

So, we have [2] 3-stars from nodes with 4 neighbors.
- For nodes 1, 4, and 7:

<1, (27, 29, 8)>
<4, (6, 23, 13)>
<7, (19, 14, 28)>

So, we have [3] 3-stars from nodes with 5 neighbors.

Adding them up, we get a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
