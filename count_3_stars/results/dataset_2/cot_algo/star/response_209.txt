Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 5) (3, 13) (3, 4) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 9) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 2) (9, 17) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 18) (0, 11) (0, 14) (1, 14) (1, 17) (7, 14) (7, 2) (5, 16) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 10) (19, 2) (19, 12) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 4) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 13) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 5) (13, 16) (13, 3) (13, 10) 

Response:
The 3-star graph formed from the given information is as follows:
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: (16, 14, 0, 12), so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: (11, 13, 2, 5), so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (13, 4), so it forms 1 3-star
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: (11, 17, 0, 1, 7), so it forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: (14, 1, 12, 9), so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (10, 18, 2), so it forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: (17), so it doesn't form any 3-star
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (16, 6, 8, 19, 7), so it forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: (2, 18), so it doesn't form any 3-star
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: (11, 14), so it doesn't form any 3-star 
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: (14, 17), so it doesn't form any 3-star
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: (14, 2), so it doesn't form any 3-star
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (16, 18, 4, 10), so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors: (2, 12), so it doesn't form any 3-star
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (3, 5, 12, 10), so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (11, 17, 19, 4), so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (6, 5, 4, 13), so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: (6, 8, 5), so it forms 1 3-star
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: (16, 3, 10), so it forms 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars formed = 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].
