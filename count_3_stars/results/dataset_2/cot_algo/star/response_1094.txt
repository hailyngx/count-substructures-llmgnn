Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: 3, 5, 11, 14
- Node 1: 2, 5, 12, 14
- Node 2: 1, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14
- Node 3: 0, 9, 10, 13
- Node 4: 6, 8, 10
- Node 5: 0, 1, 9, 12, 13
- Node 6: 4, 10, 13, 14
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 2, 4
- Node 9: 3, 5, 11
- Node 10: 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
- Node 11: 0, 2, 9, 12
- Node 12: 1, 2, 5, 10, 11, 13
- Node 13: 3, 5, 6, 12
- Node 14: 0, 1, 2, 6

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars by applying the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = [4]
- Node 1: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = [4]
- Node 2: [\( \binom{6}{3} \)] = [20]
- Node 3: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 4 neighbors.
- Node 4: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: [\( \binom{5}{3} \)] = [10]
- Node 6: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = [4]
- Node 7: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 9: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = [1]
- Node 10: [\( \binom{5}{3} \)] = [10]
- Node 11: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = [4]
- Node 12: [\( \binom{6}{3} \)] = [20]
- Node 13: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 4 neighbors.
- Node 14: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 4 neighbors.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 73

Therefore, the final number to be put inside brackets is [73], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, 5, 14>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 2, 12>
- <1, 5, 14>
- <2, 10, 12>
- <9, 11, 12>
