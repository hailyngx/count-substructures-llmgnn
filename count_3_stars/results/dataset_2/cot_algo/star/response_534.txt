Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 4}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {5, 8, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 6, 10}
- Node 12: {0, 7, 10}
- Node 13: {7, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 13}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 70.

Therefore, the final answer is [70], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 11)>, <0, (2, 5, 11)>, <0, (5, 10, 12)>, <0, (5, 10, 2)>, <2, (0, 5, 11)>, <2, (0, 5, 14)>, <5, (0, 2, 11)>, <5, (0, 2, 14)>, <5, (2, 11, 6)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (4, 9, 13)>, <7, (5, 9, 13)>, <7, (9, 8, 13)>, <9, (3, 8, 13)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 13)>, <9, (7, 8, 5)>, <9, (7, 8, 10)>, <9, (8, 5, 10)>, <10, (5, 8, 13)>.
