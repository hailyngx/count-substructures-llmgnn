Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 9) (2, 10) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 9) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 0) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 3, 5, 11, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 3, 6, 5, 10}
- Node 2: {3, 13, 14, 9, 10}
- Node 3: {1, 0, 14, 10, 2}
- Node 4: {12, 0, 10, 1}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 0}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 12}
- Node 8: {10, 6, 12}
- Node 9: {12, 14, 2, 0}
- Node 10: {4, 1, 3, 8, 2}
- Node 11: {13, 14, 0}
- Node 12: {4, 7, 8, 13, 9}
- Node 13: {12, 2, 11}
- Node 14: {3, 11, 9, 2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with more than 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 64

Therefore, the final result is [64].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 4, 10>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 3, 10>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 4, 10>
- <1, 4, 12>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 5, 10>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <1, 7, 12>
- <3, 4, 10>
- <3, 10, 12>
- <4, 7, 12>
- <6, 8, 10>
- <9, 12, 13>
