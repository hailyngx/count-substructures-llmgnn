Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 11) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 8) (26, 27) (13, 22) (13, 27) (13, 18) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 7) (22, 12) (14, 1) (14, 12) (17, 20) (17, 15) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 6) (7, 24) (21, 7) (21, 5) (21, 15) (20, 17) (25, 23) (25, 8) (25, 4) (11, 9) (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 6) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 27) (12, 19) (27, 26) (27, 13) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 8) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 1) (18, 13) (18, 27) (18, 2) (15, 26) (15, 17) (15, 21) (29, 1) (29, 10) (4, 25) (4, 0) (3, 16) (3, 19) (8, 26) (8, 25) (8, 27) (8, 28) (8, 10) (28, 8) (24, 7) (24, 10) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 29) (1, 23) (5, 21) (5, 11) (5, 2) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 10) (19, 12) (19, 3) (10, 29) (10, 8) (10, 24) (10, 6) (10, 23) (23, 25) (23, 1) (23, 10) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for the given graph:

1: {14, 11, 2, 29, 23}
2: {18, 5, 1}
3: {16, 19}
4: {25, 0}
5: {21, 11, 2}
6: {13, 7, 16, 10}
7: {22, 21, 6, 24}
8: {26, 25, 27, 28, 10}
9: {26, 11}
10: {29, 8, 24, 6, 23}
11: {9, 16, 1, 5}
12: {22, 14, 27, 19}
13: {22, 27, 18, 6}
14: {1, 12}
15: {26, 17, 21}
16: {11, 3, 6}
17: {20, 15}
18: {13, 27, 2}
19: {12, 3}
20: {17}
21: {7, 5, 15}
22: {13, 7, 12}
23: {25, 1, 10}
24: {7, 10}
25: {23, 8, 4}
26: {9, 15, 8, 27}
27: {26, 13, 12, 18, 8}
28: {8}
29: {1, 10}

Now let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{18}{3} + \binom{21}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{14}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{10}{3} = 816\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 816. 

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, 11, 5>, <1, 11, 16>, <1, 11, 29>, <1, 23, 29>, <2, 5, 21>, <6, 7, 21>, <6, 10, 23>, <8, 25, 26>, <8, 25, 27>, <8, 25, 10>, <8, 25, 23>, <8, 25, 28>, <8, 26, 27>, <8, 26, 15>, <8, 26, 17>, <8, 26, 21>, <8, 27, 13>, <8, 27, 12>, <8, 27, 18>, <8, 27, 26>, <10, 24, 7>, <10, 24, 6>, <10, 23, 1>, <12, 22, 7>, <12, 22, 13>, <12, 27, 13>, <12, 27, 18>, <13, 22, 7>, <13, 22, 12>, <13, 22, 14>, <13, 22, 12>, <13, 27, 18>, <15, 17, 20>, <25, 23, 1>
