Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's first find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For each node, let's identify its neighbors:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 4, Node 5, and Node 8 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form 10 unique 3-stars each. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>
