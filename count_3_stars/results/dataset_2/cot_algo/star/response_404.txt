Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 12) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 10) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 13}
- Node 11: {2, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 10, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 8, 12}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0, Node 5, Node 9, and Node 14 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 19 3-stars. So the final answer is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 8, 14)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6, 9, 10)>
- <9, (0, 4, 5, 7)>
- <14, (0, 8, 12)>
