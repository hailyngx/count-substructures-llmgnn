Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 9) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 4) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 10) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 4: {10, 11}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 11, 12}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {2, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 11: {4, 5, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 12: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 13: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 14: {3, 9, 11}

Next, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 20 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 1, 7>
<6, 2, 12>
<8, 5, 13>
<8, 5, 7>
