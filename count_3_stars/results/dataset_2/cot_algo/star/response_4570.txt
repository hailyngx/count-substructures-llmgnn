Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 15) (16, 6) (4, 18) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 17) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 1) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 14) (8, 10) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (5, 17) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 17) (19, 3) (19, 12) (15, 16) (15, 18) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 19) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 0) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 18) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 4, 10, 3
- Node 1 neighbors: 9, 13, 2, 14
- Node 2 neighbors: 6, 12, 1, 14
- Node 3 neighbors: 16, 7, 13, 19, 0
- Node 4 neighbors: 18, 0
- Node 5 neighbors: 17
- Node 6 neighbors: 16, 9, 2
- Node 7 neighbors: 3, 17
- Node 8 neighbors: 10, 13
- Node 9 neighbors: 6, 18, 1
- Node 10 neighbors: 0, 8, 14
- Node 11 neighbors: 16, 17
- Node 12 neighbors: 13, 2, 19
- Node 13 neighbors: 8, 12, 3, 1
- Node 14 neighbors: 10, 2, 1
- Node 15 neighbors: 16, 18
- Node 16 neighbors: 11, 3, 15, 6
- Node 17 neighbors: 5, 11, 7, 18
- Node 18 neighbors: 4, 9, 15, 17
- Node 19 neighbors: 3, 12

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18

For each of these nodes, we can calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) where \( n \) is the number of neighbors for that node.

Calculating:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (16, 7, 19)>
- <3, (16, 13, 1)>
- <3, (16, 13, 2)>
- <3, (16, 13, 12)>
- <0, (4, 10, 3)>
- <13, (8, 12, 1)>
- <13, (8, 3, 1)>
- <13, (8, 3, 2)>
- <13, (12, 3, 1)>
- <14, (10, 2, 1)>
- <16, (11, 15, 6)>
- <16, (11, 15, 18)>
- <16, (11, 6, 9)>
- <16, (3, 15, 18)>
- <17, (5, 11, 7)>
- <17, (5, 7, 18)>
- <17, (11, 7, 18)>
- <17, (11, 18, 5)>
- <18, (4, 15, 17)>
- <18, (9, 15, 17)>
- <18, (4, 17, 5)>
- <18, (5, 17, 9)>
