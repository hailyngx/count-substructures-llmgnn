Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 19) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 13) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 16) (0, 14) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 15) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 19) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 7) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 1) (16, 14) (16, 4) (16, 18) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 1) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 13) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 20 nodes and 60 edges. Below is the process to find the number of unique 3-stars in this graph:

1. Make a list of neighbors for each node:
   - Node 0: {14}
   - Node 1: {6, 19}
   - Node 2: {5, 11, 13, 12}
   - Node 3: {14}
   - Node 4: {13, 16}
   - Node 5: {6, 2}
   - Node 6: {5, 1, 7, 12}
   - Node 7: {9, 6, 13}
   - Node 8: {9, 11, 19}
   - Node 9: {8, 18, 7}
   - Node 10: {18, 19, 1}
   - Node 11: {8, 2, 12, 15}
   - Node 12: {6, 11, 2}
   - Node 13: {4, 2, 15, 7}
   - Node 14: {17, 0, 3, 16}
   - Node 15: {18, 11, 13}
   - Node 16: {14, 4, 18}
   - Node 17: {14, 19}
   - Node 18: {9, 10, 15, 16}
   - Node 19: {17, 8, 10, 1}

2. Identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
   Nodes: 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of the above nodes:
   Nodes 2, 8, 19 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they contribute 1 3-star each.
   Nodes 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18 have more than 3 neighbors, so we need to calculate inom{n}{3} for each of them.
   
   The total number of 3-stars is: 3 (from nodes with exactly 3 neighbors) + 220 (from nodes with more than 3 neighbors) = 223
   Therefore, the final answer is [223].

4. List the unique 3-stars: 
   <2, (5, 11, 13)>, <8, (9, 11, 19)>, <19, (8, 10, 1)>, <6, (5, 1, 12)>, <7, (9, 6, 13)>, <9, (8, 18, 7)>, <10, (18, 19, 1)>, <11, (8, 2, 15)>, <13, (4, 2, 15)>, <15, (18, 11, 13)>, <16, (14, 4, 18)>, <18, (9, 10, 15)>
