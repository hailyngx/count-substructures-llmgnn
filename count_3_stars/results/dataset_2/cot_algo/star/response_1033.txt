Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 2: 3, 9 (degree 2)
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 (degree 5)
- Node 4: 0, 3, 7, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 8, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 6: 3, 8, 9 (degree 3)
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7 (degree 5)
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5, 6 (degree 4)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Nodes with degree 5: 0, 3, 5, 8 (4 nodes) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each
Nodes with degree 4: 1, 4, 9 (3 nodes) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each

Total 3-stars = \( 4 \times 10 + 3 \times 4 = 40 + 12 = 52 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [52].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 5, 8>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <5, 8, 9>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <3, 1, 7>
