Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (13, 3) (13, 14) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 14) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 3) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 9, 11, 7, 3
- Node 1: 5, 9, 11, 8
- Node 2: 8, 3, 7
- Node 3: 9, 10, 2, 13, 0, 6
- Node 4: 5, 10, 11, 12, 14
- Node 5: 9, 1, 11, 4, 14
- Node 6: 10, 7, 3
- Node 7: 2, 0, 6
- Node 8: 11, 2, 12, 1
- Node 9: 5, 3, 1, 0, 12
- Node 10: 3, 6, 4
- Node 11: 5, 1, 0, 4, 8
- Node 12: 9, 4, 8, 14
- Node 13: 3, 14
- Node 14: 5, 4, 13, 12

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 76

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [76].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 8, 11)>
- <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- <4, (5, 10, 11)>
- <5, (1, 11, 14)>
- <9, (0, 12, 5)>
- <11, (1, 4, 8)>
- <12, (4, 8, 14)>
