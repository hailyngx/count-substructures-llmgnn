Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8, 2, 5}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {7, 0}
- Node 3: {7, 1, 6, 9, 5}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 9, 5, 0}
- Node 5: {4, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 9, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 2}
- Node 8: {4, 1, 6, 9, 5, 0}
- Node 9: {4, 3, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 5 neighbors, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 5 neighbors, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 6 neighbors, \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars is 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 52, so we put this inside brackets as [52].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 8, 5)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 0)>
<3, (6, 9, 8)>
