Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 0) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 3) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 6) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 5) (9, 13) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 10, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 8, 11}
- Node 3: {2, 9, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {3, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 12: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 4, 6, 8, 13}

Next, let's find the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 10, 13} (5 neighbors)
- Node 3: {2, 9, 10, 12, 13} (5 neighbors)
- Node 4: {0, 6, 11, 12, 14} (5 neighbors)
- Node 5: {2, 8, 10, 11, 13} (5 neighbors)
- Node 8: {2, 5, 10, 11, 14} (5 neighbors)
- Node 10: {0, 3, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Node 11: {2, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Node 13: {0, 1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 14} (7 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( inom{7}{3} = 35 \)

Summing up these, we get a total of 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 35 = 85 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer to the question is [85], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, 1, 2>, 
<0, 1, 4>, 
<0, 1, 13>, 
<0, 2, 4>, 
<0, 2, 13>, 
<0, 4, 10>, 
<0, 10, 13>, 
<1, 3, 13>, 
<2, 3, 13>, 
<4, 6, 12>, 
<4, 6, 14>, 
<5, 8, 10>, 
<5, 8, 11>, 
<5, 10, 13>, 
<5, 11, 13>, 
<8, 10, 11>, 
<8, 10, 14>, 
<8, 11, 14>, 
<8, 13, 14>, 
<10, 13, 14>.
