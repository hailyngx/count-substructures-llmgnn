Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:
First, we'll create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 13, 5, 6, 9
Node 1 neighbors: 3, 2, 0, 8, 7
Node 2 neighbors: 1, 10, 13, 7, 14, 4
Node 3 neighbors: 1, 11, 13, 8
Node 4 neighbors: 6, 2, 5
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 12
Node 6 neighbors: 10, 8, 0, 4
Node 7 neighbors: 1, 2
Node 8 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 12
Node 9 neighbors: 11, 13, 0, 14
Node 10 neighbors: 6, 12, 2, 14
Node 11 neighbors: 3, 9, 12
Node 12 neighbors: 10, 11, 8, 13, 5
Node 13 neighbors: 3, 12, 2, 9, 0
Node 14 neighbors: 10, 9, 2

Now, we'll identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 12>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 14>
<1, 8, 3>
<1, 8, 6>
<2, 10, 14>
<2, 13, 9>
