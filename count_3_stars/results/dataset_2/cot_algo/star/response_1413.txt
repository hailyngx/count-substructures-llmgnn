Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 7) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (4, 9) (4, 3) (12, 2) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 13) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
1. Node 0: {9, 10, 11, 2, 1}
2. Node 1: {10, 8, 0, 5}
3. Node 2: {13, 0, 12, 14}
4. Node 3: {6, 10, 8, 5, 4}
5. Node 4: {9, 3}
6. Node 5: {10, 11, 13, 1, 3}
7. Node 6: {9, 3, 8, 13}
8. Node 7: {9, 11, 13}
9. Node 8: {6, 13, 3, 1}
10. Node 9: {6, 4, 7, 0}
11. Node 10: {11, 0, 3, 5, 14}
12. Node 11: {10, 14, 7, 0, 5}
13. Node 12: {2}
14. Node 13: {6, 8, 5, 2, 7}
15. Node 14: {10, 11, 2}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
1. Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
2. Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
3. Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
4. Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
5. Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
6. Node 6: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
7. Node 8: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
8. Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
9. Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10
10. Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10
11. Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 74

Therefore, the final answer is [74], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 10, 11)>
<1, (10, 8, 5)>
<2, (13, 0, 12)>
<3, (6, 10, 8)>
<5, (10, 11, 13)>
<6, (9, 3, 8)>
<8, (6, 13, 3)>
<9, (6, 4, 7)>
<10, (11, 14, 7)>
<11, (10, 14, 5)>
<13, (6, 8, 7)>
