Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 9) (3, 11) (3, 2) (15, 16) (15, 0) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (18, 19) (18, 12) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 5) (0, 15) (0, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 6) (1, 17) (1, 7) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 9) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 4) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 10) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 9) (9, 16) (9, 19) (9, 10) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by looking at the neighbor set of each node:

- Node 0: [5, 15]
- Node 1: [7, 17]
- Node 2: [3, 4]
- Node 3: [2, 11]
- Node 4: [2, 6, 10]
- Node 5: [0, 7, 12, 13]
- Node 6: [4, 10, 13]
- Node 7: [1, 5, 8, 12, 17]
- Node 8: [7, 10]
- Node 9: [10, 16, 19]
- Node 10: [4, 6, 8, 9, 19]
- Node 11: [3, 14, 16, 19]
- Node 12: [5, 7, 18]
- Node 13: [5, 6]
- Node 14: [11, 12, 17]
- Node 15: [0, 16]
- Node 16: [9, 11, 15]
- Node 17: [1, 7, 14]
- Node 18: [12, 19]
- Node 19: [9, 10, 11, 18]

From the neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 4, 5, 10, and 12 have 3 or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars. Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars are: <4, (2, 6, 10)>, <5, (0, 7, 12)>, <5, (7, 12, 17)>, <5, (12, 13, 6)>, <5, (13, 6, 4)>, <10, (4, 6, 13)>, <10, (6, 13, 5)>, <10, (13, 5, 12)>, <10, (5, 12, 7)>, <10, (12, 7, 17)>, <12, (5, 7, 17)>.
