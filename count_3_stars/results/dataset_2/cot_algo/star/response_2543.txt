Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 25) (9, 20) (1, 10) (1, 23) (1, 7) (21, 16) (21, 15) (2, 3) (29, 26) (29, 25) (29, 14) (12, 27) (12, 20) (12, 11) (12, 23) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 7) (27, 19) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 26) (16, 21) (16, 22) (16, 23) (17, 8) (17, 25) (17, 24) (25, 9) (25, 29) (25, 17) (25, 19) (25, 28) (19, 27) (19, 25) (19, 22) (19, 20) (22, 16) (22, 19) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 28) (26, 29) (26, 0) (26, 3) (6, 23) (20, 9) (20, 12) (20, 19) (14, 29) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 15) (18, 14) (24, 4) (24, 17) (24, 14) (3, 2) (3, 27) (3, 4) (3, 26) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 13) (11, 15) (13, 10) (13, 11) (23, 1) (23, 12) (23, 16) (23, 6) (28, 25) (28, 10) (15, 21) (15, 14) (15, 11) (7, 1) (7, 27) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

- Node 0: {8, 26}
- Node 1: {10, 23, 7}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {2, 27, 4, 26}
- Node 4: {8, 24, 14, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 11, 10}
- Node 6: {23}
- Node 7: {1, 27}
- Node 8: {4, 17, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 25, 20}
- Node 10: {1, 13, 28, 5}
- Node 11: {5, 12, 13, 15}
- Node 12: {27, 20, 11, 23}
- Node 13: {10, 11}
- Node 14: {4, 29, 18, 24, 15}
- Node 15: {21, 14, 11}
- Node 16: {21, 22, 23}
- Node 17: {8, 25, 24}
- Node 18: {14}
- Node 19: {27, 25, 22, 20}
- Node 20: {12, 9, 19}
- Node 21: {16, 15}
- Node 22: {16, 19}
- Node 23: {1, 12, 16, 6}
- Node 24: {4, 17, 14}
- Node 25: {9, 29, 17, 19, 28}
- Node 26: {29, 0, 3}
- Node 27: {12, 3, 7, 19}
- Node 28: {25, 10}
- Node 29: {26, 25, 14}

From the neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19, 23, 25, 27, and 29 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for these nodes:

- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up these values, we get a total of 48 3-stars in the graph, which can be represented as [48].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

- <9, 5, 10>
- <10, 5, 11>
- <10, 5, 28>
- <10, 1, 13>
- <11, 5, 12>
- <11, 5, 13>
- <11, 5, 15>
- <12, 11, 27>
- <12, 11, 23>
- <12, 11, 13>
- <12, 11, 20>
- <14, 4, 29>
- <14, 4, 18>
- <14, 4, 24>
- <14, 4, 15>
- <14, 29, 18>
- <14, 29, 24>
- <15, 11, 21>
- <16, 21, 22>
- <16, 21, 23>
- <17, 8, 24>
- <17, 8, 25>
- <17, 8, 25>
- <17, 25, 28>
- <19, 20, 27>
- <19, 20, 25>
- <19, 20, 22>
- <19, 20, 27>
- <23, 1, 6>
- <23, 1, 12>
- <23, 1, 6>
- <23, 1, 16>
