Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 3, 9
- Node 1: 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 9, 3, 5, 8
- Node 3: 7, 9, 0, 2, 8
- Node 4: 7, 0, 5, 1, 6
- Node 5: 4, 0, 2
- Node 6: 4, 9, 1
- Node 7: 4, 3, 9, 8
- Node 8: 7, 3, 2
- Node 9: 7, 6, 2, 3, 1, 0

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 3, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1: 4, 6, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 9, 3, 5, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3: 7, 9, 0, 2, 8 (5 neighbors)
- Node 4: 7, 0, 5, 1, 6 (5 neighbors)
- Node 5: 4, 0, 2 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 4, 9, 1 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 4, 3, 9, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 9: 7, 6, 2, 3, 1, 0 (6 neighbors)

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors, so no 3-stars
- Node 1: 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars
- Node 2: 4 neighbors, so 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 5 neighbors, so 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: 5 neighbors, so 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars
- Node 6: 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 neighbors, so 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: 6 neighbors, so 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
0 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 20 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <7, (8, 9, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>.
