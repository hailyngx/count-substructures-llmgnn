Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 15) (16, 13) (16, 4) (16, 6) (5, 17) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 12) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 4) (1, 15) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 4) (14, 15) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 18) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 14) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 10) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 10) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 12) (10, 13) (10, 7) (12, 9) (12, 19) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 18) (18, 8) (18, 0) (4, 16) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 11, 19, 18
- Node 1: 15, 7
- Node 2: 9, 8, 7
- Node 3: 8, 4
- Node 4: 16, 6, 3, 14
- Node 5: 17
- Node 6: 16, 9, 4
- Node 7: 11, 1, 2, 10
- Node 8: 3, 2, 14, 18
- Node 9: 6, 2, 12, 9
- Node 10: 13, 7
- Node 11: 7, 19, 0, 15
- Node 12: 9, 19
- Node 13: 16, 17, 10
- Node 14: 17, 8, 19, 4, 15
- Node 15: 11, 1, 14
- Node 16: 13, 4, 6
- Node 17: 5, 14, 13
- Node 18: 0, 8
- Node 19: 11, 14, 0, 12

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 4 + 4 + 10 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <4, 6, 16>
- <4, 8, 14>
- <4, 14, 17>
- <6, 9, 16>
- <7, 10, 13>
- <7, 10, 19>
- <7, 11, 15>
- <7, 11, 19>
- <8, 14, 17>
- <8, 14, 19>
- <9, 12, 19>
- <11, 15, 14>
- <12, 19, 0>
- <14, 15, 11>
- <14, 15, 19>
- <14, 17, 13>
- <14, 17, 19>
- <15, 11, 19>
