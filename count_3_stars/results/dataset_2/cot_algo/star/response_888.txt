Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 3) (11, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 1) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 5) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 12, 14, 3}
- Node 1: {14, 2, 5}
- Node 2: {9, 8, 14, 5, 1, 13}
- Node 3: {7, 10, 0, 14, 13, 5}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 12, 0, 10, 6}
- Node 5: {7, 2, 12, 3, 1}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 9, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 6, 5}
- Node 8: {4, 2, 14}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {4, 3}
- Node 11: {9}
- Node 12: {4, 0, 5}
- Node 13: {9, 2, 3}
- Node 14: {8, 0, 3, 1, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 90

Therefore, the final answer is [90]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 14, 2)>, <0, (3, 14, 1)>, <0, (3, 1, 5)>, <0, (14, 2, 1)>, <3, (7, 5, 2)>, <3, (7, 5, 1)>, <4, (7, 8, 12)>, <4, (7, 0, 6)>, <4, (8, 0, 6)>, <4, (12, 0, 5)>.
