Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 5) (22, 7) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 11) (5, 22) (5, 28) (5, 7) (9, 21) (9, 11) (28, 5) (28, 18) (29, 6) (29, 14) (29, 24) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 23) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 26) (6, 29) (6, 19) (6, 4) (26, 22) (26, 8) (26, 14) (26, 17) (18, 28) (18, 21) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 17) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 29) (14, 26) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 4) (12, 24) (12, 25) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 23) (25, 12) (25, 27) (25, 0) (27, 13) (27, 25) (27, 10) (27, 20) (7, 22) (7, 5) (7, 19) (7, 20) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 0) (20, 27) (20, 7) (0, 25) (0, 11) (0, 21) (0, 23) (21, 9) (21, 18) (21, 0) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 23) (16, 1) (10, 8) (10, 27) (24, 29) (24, 12) (23, 2) (23, 17) (23, 0) (23, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node.

```
Node 0 neighbors: 25, 11, 21, 23
Node 1 neighbors: 4, 16, 23
Node 2 neighbors: 3, 8, 23
Node 3 neighbors: 2, 14, 15
Node 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 12, 13
Node 5 neighbors: 7, 22, 28
Node 6 neighbors: 4, 19, 29
Node 7 neighbors: 5, 19, 20, 22
Node 8 neighbors: 2, 10, 26
Node 9 neighbors: 11, 21
Node 10 neighbors: 8, 27
Node 11 neighbors: 0, 9, 15
Node 12 neighbors: 4, 24, 25
Node 13 neighbors: 4, 14, 22, 27
Node 14 neighbors: 3, 13, 26, 29
Node 15 neighbors: 3, 11
Node 16 neighbors: 1
Node 17 neighbors: 19, 23, 26
Node 18 neighbors: 21, 28
Node 19 neighbors: 6, 7, 17
Node 20 neighbors: 7, 27
Node 21 neighbors: 9, 18, 0
Node 22 neighbors: 5, 7, 13, 26
Node 23 neighbors: 1, 2, 0, 17
Node 24 neighbors: 6, 12, 29
Node 25 neighbors: 0, 12, 27
Node 26 neighbors: 8, 14, 17, 22
Node 27 neighbors: 10, 13, 20, 25
Node 28 neighbors: 5, 18, 29
Node 29 neighbors: 6, 14, 24, 28
```

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes forming 3-stars: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29

Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{16}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \) = 560

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [560].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (11, 21, 23)>
<1, (4, 12, 16)>
<3, (2, 14, 15)>
<4, (1, 6, 13)>
<5, (7, 22, 28)>
<6, (19, 24, 29)>
<7, (5, 20, 27)>
<11, (0, 15, 21)>
<12, (4, 25, 29)>
<13, (14, 22, 27)>
<14, (3, 13, 26)>
<22, (5, 13, 26)>
<23, (1, 17, 23)>
<26, (14, 17, 22)>
<27, (10, 13, 25)>
<29, (6, 24, 28)>
