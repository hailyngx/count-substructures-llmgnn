Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 9) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 13) (9, 6) (12, 19) (27, 10) (27, 26) (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 28) (26, 13) (26, 27) (26, 14) (26, 16) (26, 7) (21, 0) (21, 14) (17, 20) (20, 17) (20, 2) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 20) (2, 25) (3, 14) (3, 8) (28, 13) (28, 5) (28, 8) (28, 18) (14, 26) (14, 21) (14, 3) (19, 22) (19, 12) (19, 11) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 28) (8, 10) (11, 19) (24, 23) (24, 15) (7, 26) (7, 29) (7, 15) (7, 1) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 23) (29, 10) (18, 28) (18, 0) (23, 24) (23, 29) (23, 16) (4, 5) (4, 1) (0, 21) (0, 18) (0, 1) (15, 24) (15, 7) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 16) (16, 26) (16, 29) (16, 23) (16, 1) (16, 25) (10, 27) (10, 8) (10, 29) (10, 25) (25, 2) (25, 16) (25, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {21, 18, 1}
- Node 1: {13, 7, 4, 0, 16}
- Node 2: {22, 5, 20, 25}
- Node 3: {14, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 1}
- Node 5: {22, 6, 2, 4, 28}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {26, 29, 15, 1}
- Node 8: {6, 3, 28, 10}
- Node 9: {13, 6}
- Node 10: {27, 8, 29, 25}
- Node 11: {19}
- Node 12: {19}
- Node 13: {26, 1, 28, 9}
- Node 14: {3, 21, 26}
- Node 15: {24, 7}
- Node 16: {26, 29, 23, 1, 25}
- Node 17: {20}
- Node 18: {28, 0}
- Node 19: {22, 12, 11}
- Node 20: {17, 2}
- Node 21: {0, 14}
- Node 22: {19, 5, 2}
- Node 23: {24, 29, 16}
- Node 24: {23, 15}
- Node 25: {2, 16, 10}
- Node 26: {13, 27, 14, 16, 7}
- Node 27: {10, 26}
- Node 28: {13, 5, 8, 18}
- Node 29: {7, 16, 23, 10}

Next, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: Node 11, Node 12, Node 17

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 11: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 17: inom{1}{3} = 0
Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 = 2
Therefore, the final result is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <11, 19, 12>
- <12, 19, 11>
