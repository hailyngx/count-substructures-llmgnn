Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 9) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 1) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 9) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {6, 14, 4}
- Node 1: {9, 2}
- Node 2: {14, 12, 13, 1}
- Node 3: {10, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 0, 14, 9}
- Node 5: {13, 4, 10, 7}
- Node 6: {7, 12, 8, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 12, 10, 9, 13}
- Node 8: {6, 14, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {7, 12, 13, 8, 4, 1}
- Node 10: {5, 7, 13, 3}
- Node 11: {12}
- Node 12: {6, 7, 2, 11, 9}
- Node 13: {5, 7, 2, 10, 9}
- Node 14: {0, 8, 4, 2}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate how many 3-stars are formed:

- Node 0, 4 3-star(s)
- Node 2, 4 3-star(s)
- Node 4, 1 3-star(s)
- Node 6, 1 3-star(s)
- Node 7, 1 3-star(s)
- Node 9, 1 3-star(s)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (6, 4, 14)>
<2, (14, 12, 13)>
<4, (5, 6, 0)>
<6, (7, 12, 8)>
<7, (5, 12, 13)>
<9, (7, 12, 13)>
