The edges are as follows: (14, 23) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 18) (7, 14) (7, 21) (7, 29) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 9) (8, 24) (8, 0) (8, 18) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 15) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 27) (25, 20) (25, 9) (2, 17) (2, 16) (2, 4) (29, 7) (29, 19) (0, 8) (0, 20) (0, 15) (0, 6) (6, 21) (6, 0) (6, 3) (28, 16) (28, 24) (26, 4) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 27) (16, 2) (16, 28) (16, 24) (16, 22) (18, 17) (18, 8) (15, 13) (15, 0) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 24) (4, 2) (4, 26) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 13) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 23) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 27) (19, 29) (19, 22) (19, 9) (22, 16) (22, 19) (22, 11) (3, 17) (3, 6) (24, 8) (24, 28) (24, 16) (24, 15) (24, 23) (9, 21) (9, 25) (9, 19) (27, 20) (27, 1) (27, 5) (11, 13) (11, 22) (23, 14) (23, 12) (23, 24) (10, 14) (10, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 20, 6, 15}
- Node 1: {15, 4, 27}
- Node 2: {17, 16, 4}
- Node 3: {17, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 26, 1, 12, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 10, 27}
- Node 6: {21, 0, 3}
- Node 7: {14, 21, 29}
- Node 8: {24, 0, 18}
- Node 9: {21, 25, 19}
- Node 10: {14, 5}
- Node 11: {13, 22}
- Node 12: {13, 15, 4, 23}
- Node 13: {12, 15, 11}
- Node 14: {23, 7, 10}
- Node 15: {13, 0, 1, 12, 24}
- Node 16: {2, 28, 24, 22}
- Node 17: {3, 2, 18}
- Node 18: {17, 8}
- Node 19: {29, 22, 9}
- Node 20: {25, 0, 27}
- Node 21: {7, 6, 9}
- Node 22: {16, 19, 11}
- Node 23: {12, 24, 14}
- Node 24: {8, 28, 16, 15, 23}
- Node 25: {20, 9}
- Node 26: {4}
- Node 27: {20, 1, 5}
- Node 28: {16, 24}
- Node 29: {7, 19}

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 4, 15, 24, and 27 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23, 25, and 29 have 3 neighbors each. 

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 38 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [38], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (8, 20, 6)>
- <4, (2, 1, 12)>
- <15, (13, 1, 12)>
- <24, (16, 28, 23)>
- <27, (1, 5, 20)>
- <2, (17, 16, 4)>
- <6, (21, 0, 3)>
- <7, (21, 29, 14)>
- <8, (0, 18, 24)>
- <9, (21, 25, 19)>
- <12, (13, 15, 4)>
- <14, (23, 7, 10)>
- <16, (2, 28, 24)>
- <17, (3, 18, 2)>
- <21, (7, 9, 6)>
- <22, (16, 19, 11)>
- <23, (12, 14, 24)>
- <25, (20, 9, 0)>
- <29, (21, 7, 19)>
