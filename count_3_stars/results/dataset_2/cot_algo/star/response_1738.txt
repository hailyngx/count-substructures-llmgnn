Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 8, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify which nodes can form a 3-star:

- Node 1 can form a 3-star with its neighbor set {0, 2, 3, 5, 7} by choosing any 3 neighbors. This gives (inom{5}{3}) = 10 possible 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form a 3-star with its neighbor set {1, 3, 5, 9} by choosing any 3 neighbors. This gives (inom{4}{3}) = 4 possible 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form a 3-star with its neighbor set {1, 2, 4, 7} by choosing any 3 neighbors. This gives (inom{4}{3}) = 4 possible 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form a 3-star with its neighbor set {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8} by choosing any 3 neighbors. This gives (inom{6}{3}) = 20 possible 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form a 3-star with its neighbor set {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9} by choosing any 3 neighbors. This gives (inom{6}{3}) = 20 possible 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form a 3-star with its neighbor set {2, 6, 7, 8} by choosing any 3 neighbors. This gives (inom{4}{3}) = 4 possible 3-stars.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars, we get 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 62.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- <7, (0, 1, 6)>
- <7, (1, 5, 6)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
