Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 8) (0, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 3, 4, 8, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 13, 14, 6, 4}
- Node 3: {5, 1, 4}
- Node 4: {5, 1, 3, 10, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 1, 4, 3}
- Node 6: {10, 2}
- Node 7: {1, 11, 13, 12, 0}
- Node 8: {9, 1, 11, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {9, 11, 6, 12, 4}
- Node 11: {10, 7, 13, 8}
- Node 12: {10, 13, 7, 14}
- Node 13: {9, 11, 12, 2, 7}
- Node 14: {2, 12}

Next, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes (nodes with three or more neighbors):
- Node 1: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( 10 \)
- Node 9: \( 10 \)
- Node 10: \( 10 \)
- Node 11: \( 10 \)
- Node 12: \( 10 \)
- Node 13: \( 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 101 \)

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [101], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 3, 11>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 3, 12>, <1, 4, 12>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 11>, <1, 5, 12>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 13>, <2, 4, 14>, <2, 5, 13>, <2, 5, 14>, <2, 13, 14>, <3, 4, 5>, <7, 11, 13>, <8, 9, 10>, <8, 9, 13>, <8, 10, 11>, <8, 11, 13>, <9, 10, 11>, <9, 10, 13>, <9, 11, 13>, <10, 11, 13>, <12, 10, 13>, <12, 13, 14>
