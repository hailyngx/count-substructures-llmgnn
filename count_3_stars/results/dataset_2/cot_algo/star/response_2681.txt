Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 3) (15, 29) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 23) (4, 7) (4, 22) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (3, 15) (3, 25) (3, 0) (3, 13) (25, 3) (25, 8) (25, 14) (25, 10) (6, 2) (6, 13) (6, 16) (9, 21) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 7) (12, 9) (12, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 11) (29, 15) (29, 22) (29, 24) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 23) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 28) (18, 24) (26, 2) (16, 6) (16, 28) (16, 8) (16, 14) (28, 13) (28, 16) (14, 25) (14, 16) (19, 11) (19, 0) (22, 4) (22, 29) (22, 20) (22, 1) (22, 21) (21, 9) (21, 22) (21, 2) (8, 25) (8, 17) (8, 16) (2, 6) (2, 26) (2, 21) (2, 23) (0, 3) (0, 19) (23, 27) (23, 5) (23, 2) (11, 9) (11, 17) (11, 19) (10, 25) (10, 12) (10, 20) (20, 27) (20, 22) (20, 10) (1, 7) (1, 22) (1, 24) (24, 29) (24, 18) (24, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 15: {27, 3, 29}
- Node 27: {15, 20, 23}
- Node 4: {7, 22}
- Node 7: {4, 12, 5, 1}
- Node 3: {15, 25, 0, 13}
- Node 25: {3, 8, 14, 10}
- Node 6: {2, 13, 16}
- Node 9: {21, 11, 12}
- Node 12: {7, 9, 10}
- Node 17: {13, 8, 11}
- Node 29: {15, 22, 24}
- Node 5: {7, 13, 23}
- Node 18: {24}
- Node 26: {2}
- Node 16: {6, 28, 8, 14}
- Node 28: {13, 16}
- Node 14: {25, 16}
- Node 19: {11, 0}
- Node 22: {4, 29, 20, 1, 21}
- Node 21: {9, 22, 2}
- Node 8: {25, 17, 16}
- Node 2: {6, 26, 21, 23}
- Node 0: {3, 19}
- Node 23: {27, 5, 2}
- Node 11: {9, 17, 19}
- Node 10: {25, 12, 20}
- Node 20: {27, 22, 10}
- Node 1: {7, 22, 24}
- Node 24: {29, 18, 1}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors that can form 3-stars:
- Node 15: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 27: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 25: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 22: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 16: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 24: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 40

Therefore, the final answer is [40], and the unique 3-stars are:
<15, (27, 3, 29)>, <7, (4, 12, 5)>, <3, (15, 25, 0)>, <25, (3, 14, 10)>, <12, (7, 9, 10)>, <13, (6, 17, 5)>, <22, (4, 29, 20)>, <16, (6, 28, 14)>, <24, (29, 18, 1)>.
