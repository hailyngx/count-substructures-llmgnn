Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 0) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 8, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 2: {1, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 3: {7, 11}
- Node 4: {13, 14}
- Node 5: {9, 10, 12}
- Node 6: {1, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 9, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 13: {4, 7, 11}
- Node 14: {4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}

Now, we need to find the 3-stars in the graph. We will look for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1, Node 2, Node 7, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, and Node 14 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 88 \). 

So, the final answer is [88], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 7, 10>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 11>, <1, 6, 7>, 
<2, 7, 11>, <7, 11, 13>, <9, 11, 14>, <9, 10, 14>, 
<10, 11, 14>, <11, 13, 7>, <11, 14, 4>.
