Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 10) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 5, 3}
- Node 1: {4, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 2: {13, 14, 10}
- Node 3: {6, 5, 11, 7, 0, 12}
- Node 4: {8, 1, 11}
- Node 5: {12, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {10, 3, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {9, 8, 3, 10}
- Node 8: {4, 11, 0, 1, 7}
- Node 9: {14, 10, 7, 13}
- Node 10: {6, 9, 7, 1, 2}
- Node 11: {6, 4, 8, 3, 14, 12}
- Node 12: {5, 3, 11}
- Node 13: {6, 9, 2, 14}
- Node 14: {9, 11, 1, 2, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 3, Node 8, Node 10, Node 11, and Node 14 have 4 or more neighbors, so the number of 3-stars in each of these nodes is \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\).
- The total number of 3-stars is \(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20\).

Therefore, the final result is [20].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (6, 11, 8)>
- <8, (4, 1, 11)>
- <10, (6, 1, 9)>
- <11, (6, 3, 14)>
- <14, (9, 2, 11)>
