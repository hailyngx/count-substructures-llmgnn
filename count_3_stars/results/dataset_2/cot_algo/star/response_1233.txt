Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 6) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {1, 3, 9, 11, 13}
Node 1: {0, 8, 10, 13, 14}
Node 2: {9, 11, 14}
Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 9, 10}
Node 4: {12}
Node 5: {3, 6, 10, 13}
Node 6: {3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13}
Node 7: {6, 12}
Node 8: {1, 9}
Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 8, 14}
Node 10: {1, 3, 5, 6, 12, 13}
Node 11: {0, 2, 12, 14}
Node 12: {4, 6, 7, 10, 11}
Node 13: {0, 1, 5, 6, 10}
Node 14: {1, 2, 9, 11}

Now, let's identify the 3-star formations:

Node 10 forms a 3-star with three neighbors: <10, (3, 5, 6)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with three neighbors: <6, (3, 5, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
