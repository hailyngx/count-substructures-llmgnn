Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 16) (15, 12) (8, 19) (8, 7) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 9) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 17) (1, 16) (1, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 18) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 19) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 13) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 14) (10, 4) (10, 0) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 6) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 13) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first find the neighborhood nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 10, 17}
- Node 1: {16, 5}
- Node 3: {6, 9, 5, 12}
- Node 4: {18, 9, 10, 6}
- Node 5: {11, 3, 1}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 14, 7}
- Node 7: {8, 6}
- Node 8: {19, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 18}
- Node 10: {4, 0}
- Node 11: {16, 14, 0, 5}
- Node 12: {15, 3, 13}
- Node 13: {17, 12, 19}
- Node 14: {11, 16, 19, 6}
- Node 15: {16, 12}
- Node 16: {11, 17, 1, 15, 14}
- Node 17: {16, 0, 13}
- Node 18: {4, 19, 9}
- Node 19: {8, 18, 13, 14}

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 19 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <0, 11, 17>
2. <3, 6, 9>
3. <3, 6, 12>
4. <3, 9, 18>
5. <4, 6, 14>
6. <4, 9, 18>
7. <6, 7, 14>
8. <9, 18, 19>
9. <11, 14, 16>
10. <13, 17, 19>
