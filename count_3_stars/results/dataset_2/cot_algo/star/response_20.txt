Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (26, 20) (26, 25) (18, 24) (18, 28) (18, 13) (22, 17) (22, 29) (22, 7) (22, 21) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 15) (0, 11) (0, 5) (20, 26) (20, 12) (20, 6) (6, 20) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 16) (28, 18) (28, 6) (28, 21) (21, 22) (21, 6) (21, 28) (21, 16) (21, 14) (14, 21) (13, 18) (13, 10) (1, 25) (1, 19) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 17) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 5) (4, 9) (4, 27) (4, 23) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 3) (27, 5) (29, 22) (29, 23) (29, 3) (16, 6) (16, 21) (16, 3) (7, 22) (7, 23) (7, 17) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 27) (5, 12) (2, 27) (24, 18) (24, 12) (19, 1) (19, 23) (25, 26) (25, 1) (12, 9) (12, 20) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 17) (3, 10) (3, 27) (3, 29) (3, 16) (23, 4) (23, 29) (23, 7) (23, 19) (17, 22) (17, 15) (17, 7) (17, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {11, 5}
- Node 1: {25, 19}
- Node 2: {27}
- Node 3: {10, 27, 29, 16}
- Node 4: {9, 27, 23}
- Node 5: {0, 8, 27, 12}
- Node 6: {20, 28, 21, 16}
- Node 7: {22, 23, 17}
- Node 8: {9, 15, 5}
- Node 9: {8, 4, 12}
- Node 10: {11, 13, 3}
- Node 11: {10, 0, 15}
- Node 12: {9, 20, 5, 24, 17}
- Node 13: {18, 10}
- Node 14: {21}
- Node 15: {11, 8, 17}
- Node 16: {6, 21, 3}
- Node 17: {22, 13, 7, 12, 15}
- Node 18: {24, 13, 28}
- Node 19: {1, 23}
- Node 20: {26, 12, 6}
- Node 21: {22, 6, 28, 16, 14}
- Node 22: {17, 29, 7, 21}
- Node 23: {4, 27, 29, 7, 19}
- Node 24: {18, 12}
- Node 25: {26, 1}
- Node 26: {20, 25}
- Node 27: {4, 2, 5, 3}
- Node 28: {18, 6, 21}
- Node 29: {22, 23, 3}

Next, we count the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 67 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [67]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (10, 16, 29)>
- <5, (0, 8, 27)>
- <6, (20, 21, 28)>
- <7, (22, 23, 17)>
- <8, (9, 15, 5)>
- <9, (8, 4, 12)>
- <12, (9, 20, 5)>
- <15, (11, 17, 8)>
- <16, (6, 21, 3)>
- <17, (22, 13, 7)>
- <18, (24, 13, 28)>
- <21, (22, 6, 28)>
- <22, (17, 29, 7)>
- <23, (4, 27, 29)>
- <27, (4, 2, 5)>
