Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 4) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 14) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 10, 13
- Node 2: 3, 7, 10, 11
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 8, 10, 14
- Node 4: 1, 6, 13, 14
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8, 12, 14
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 7: 2, 5, 9, 13
- Node 8: 3, 5, 9, 13
- Node 9: 0, 7, 8, 10
- Node 10: 1, 3, 9, 11
- Node 11: 2, 10, 14
- Node 12: 5, 13
- Node 13: 1, 4, 7, 8, 12
- Node 14: 3, 4, 5, 11

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed with node 3.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 5.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 7.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 8.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 10.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 13.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 14.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed with nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 56 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 10)>, <3, (1, 2, 14)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 10)>, <3, (1, 6, 14)>, <3, (1, 8, 10)>, <3, (1, 8, 14)>, <3, (1, 10, 14)>, <5, (7, 8, 13)>, <5, (7, 8, 14)>, <5, (7, 12, 13)>, <5, (8, 12, 13)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 13)>, <7, (5, 9, 13)>, <7, (6, 9, 13)>, <10, (3, 4, 14)>, <10, (9, 11, 14)>, <13, (1, 4, 7)>, <13, (1, 4, 8)>, <13, (1, 4, 12)>, <13, (1, 7, 8)>, <13, (1, 7, 12)>, <13, (1, 8, 12)>, <13, (4, 7, 12)>.
