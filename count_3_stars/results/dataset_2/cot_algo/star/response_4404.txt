Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {4, 5, 9}
Node 1: {2, 3, 6, 7}
Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 7}
Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 9}
Node 4: {0, 3, 6, 7, 8}
Node 5: {0, 2, 8, 9}
Node 6: {1, 4}
Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 8: {4, 5, 7, 9}
Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 51

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [51].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
