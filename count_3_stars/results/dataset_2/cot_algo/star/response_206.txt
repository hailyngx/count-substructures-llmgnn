Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 15) (9, 2) (9, 19) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 16) (17, 1) (17, 3) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 4) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 18) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (1, 14) (1, 17) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 16) (12, 6) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 13) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 13) (18, 5) (18, 11) (18, 19) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 3) (19, 13) (7, 8) (7, 3) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 7) (2, 9) (2, 19) (2, 13) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 19) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 13, 16}
- Node 1: {14, 17}
- Node 2: {9, 13, 19}
- Node 3: {7, 14, 17, 19}
- Node 4: {6, 8, 10, 16}
- Node 5: {15, 18}
- Node 6: {4, 10, 12, 15}
- Node 7: {3, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 19}
- Node 10: {4, 6, 11}
- Node 11: {10, 14, 18}
- Node 12: {6}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 16, 19}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 11, 16}
- Node 15: {5, 6, 16}
- Node 16: {0, 4, 13, 14, 15}
- Node 17: {1, 3}
- Node 18: {5, 11, 19}
- Node 19: {2, 3, 9, 13, 18}

Now, let's find how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 13: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 16: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 19: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 35.

Unique 3-stars found:
