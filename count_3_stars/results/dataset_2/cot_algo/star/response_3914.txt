Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 10) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 12) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 2: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 8, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 7, 11}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 10: {6, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 13: {5, 7, 10}
- Node 14: {0, 4, 6, 10, 11}

Now we can count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, there are a total of 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 64 3-stars in the graph. 
So, the final answer is [64], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (3, 7, 11)>, <7, (0, 8, 12)>, <1, (2, 8, 12)>, <5, (6, 9, 12)>, 
<8, (3, 7, 11)>, <14, (0, 6, 10)>
