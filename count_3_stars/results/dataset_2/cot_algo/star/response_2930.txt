Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 13) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 17) (2, 15) (18, 3) (18, 10) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 16) (4, 19) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 16) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (7, 3) (7, 16) (7, 14) (16, 19) (16, 4) (16, 7) (1, 12) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 0) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 17) (14, 12) (14, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 15, 2, 4, 6, 17
- Node 1: 12
- Node 2: 15
- Node 3: 15, 7, 6, 18
- Node 4: 19, 12, 16, 0
- Node 5: 9, 8
- Node 6: 3, 12, 17, 0
- Node 7: 3, 16, 14
- Node 8: 5, 13, 12
- Node 9: 5, 10, 13
- Node 10: 9, 13, 18, 11
- Node 11: 10, 19, 17
- Node 12: 8, 4, 14, 6, 1
- Node 13: 9, 8, 10
- Node 14: 12, 7
- Node 15: 3, 0, 2
- Node 16: 19, 4, 7
- Node 17: 6, 11, 0
- Node 18: 3, 10
- Node 19: 11, 4, 16

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 12, and Node 16 each have 5 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 16 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding them up, we have a total of 39 3-stars in the graph: [39].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (15, 2, 4)>
- <0, (15, 4, 6)>
- <0, (15, 4, 17)>
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 4, 17)>
- <0, (4, 6, 17)>
- <3, (15, 7, 6)>
- <3, (15, 7, 18)>
- <3, (15, 6, 18)>
- <3, (7, 6, 18)>
- <4, (19, 16, 7)>
- <4, (19, 16, 0)>
- <4, (19, 7, 0)>
- <4, (16, 7, 0)>
- <6, (12, 14, 7)>
- <6, (12, 14, 0)>
- <6, (12, 7, 0)>
- <6, (14, 7, 0)>
- <12, (8, 14, 7)>
- <12, (8, 14, 6)>
- <12, (8, 7, 6)>
- <12, (14, 7, 6)>
- <16, (19, 4, 7)>
