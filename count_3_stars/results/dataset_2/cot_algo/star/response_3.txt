Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 12) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 12) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (6, 11) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 14) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4)

    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
    - Unique 3-stars: <5, (2, 12, 11)>, <5, (2, 12, 0)>, <5, (2, 11, 0)>, <5, (12, 11, 0)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {4, 14, 10, 12}
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {3, 14, 12, 7}

    - Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 11, 7)>, <3, (1, 11, 2)>, <3, (1, 11, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 2)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (11, 7, 2)>, <3, (11, 7, 8)>, <3, (11, 2, 8)>, <3, (7, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: {9, 11, 13}
    - Number of 3-stars: 1
    - Unique 3-star: <10, (9, 11, 13)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {1, 3, 12}
    - Number of 3-stars: 1
    - Unique 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 12)>
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors: {5, 9, 1, 11, 7, 4}
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <12, (5, 9, 1)>, <12, (5, 9, 11)>, <12, (5, 9, 7)>, <12, (5, 9, 4)>, <12, (5, 1, 11)>, <12, (5, 1, 7)>, <12, (5, 1, 4)>, <12, (5, 11, 7)>, <12, (5, 11, 4)>, <12, (5, 7, 4)>, <12, (9, 1, 11)>, <12, (9, 1, 7)>, <12,... 
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {5, 3, 8, 0}
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <2, (5, 3, 8)>, <2, (5, 3, 0)>, <2, (5, 8, 0)>, <2, (3, 8, 0)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {3, 2, 0}
    - Number of 3-stars: 1
    - Unique 3-star: <8, (3, 2, 0)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {9, 12, 13, 0}
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <4, (9, 12, 13)>, <4, (9, 12, 0)>, <4, (9, 13, 0)>, <4, (12, 13, 0)>
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: {11, 14}
    - No 3-star formed with less than 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {9, 1, 6, 13}
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <14, (9, 1, 6)>, <14, (9, 1, 13)>, <14, (9, 6, 13)>, <14, (1, 6, 13)>
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: {10, 4, 14}
    - Number of 3-stars: 1
    - Unique 3-star: <13, (10, 4, 14)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 = 54

Therefore, the final answer is [54].
