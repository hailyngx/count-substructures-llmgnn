Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 15) (7, 3) (7, 16) (7, 5) (12, 5) (12, 15) (4, 8) (4, 10) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 0) (0, 8) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 19) (17, 8) (17, 11) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 15) (10, 16) (10, 14) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 11) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 16) (16, 2) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 19) (11, 13) (11, 17) (11, 15) (11, 19) (5, 7) (5, 12) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 10) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {8}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {10, 13, 14, 16, 18}
- Node 3: {6, 7}
- Node 4: {8, 10}
- Node 5: {7, 12}
- Node 6: {3, 14}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 16}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 9, 17}
- Node 9: {1, 8, 13}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 14, 15, 16}
- Node 11: {13, 15, 17, 19}
- Node 12: {5, 15}
- Node 13: {2, 9, 11, 19}
- Node 14: {2, 6, 10}
- Node 15: {10, 12, 15, 18, 19}
- Node 16: {2, 7, 10, 19}
- Node 17: {8, 11}
- Node 18: {2, 15}
- Node 19: {11, 13, 15, 16}

Now, we identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 16 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 43. 

Thus, the final answer is [43], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (10, 14, 16)>, <7, (3, 5, 16)>, <10, (2, 14, 16)>, <13, (9, 11, 19)>, <15, (10, 15, 19)>
