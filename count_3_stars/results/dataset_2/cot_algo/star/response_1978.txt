Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 13) (5, 14) (5, 1) (5, 10) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 10) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 8, 11}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 7, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 7, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 14}
- Node 10: {5, 8, 12}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 12: {3, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 3, 12}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 8, 9}

Now, we apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 12: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 14: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 44\)

Therefore, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 3, 12>
- <1, 5, 10>
- <1, 5, 14>
- <1, 9, 13>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <2, 8, 11>
- <3, 6, 12>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 7, 14>
- <6, 8, 14>
- <8, 10, 12>
- <13, 12, 0>
