Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 10) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 12) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {3, 2, 11, 12, 5}
Node 1: {6, 11}
Node 2: {4, 9, 0, 5}
Node 3: {7, 0, 14, 6, 12}
Node 4: {7, 8, 10, 2}
Node 5: {7, 8, 0, 2, 14}
Node 6: {1, 3, 8, 12}
Node 7: {4, 3, 10, 9, 5, 8}
Node 8: {4, 7, 6, 5, 10}
Node 9: {7, 2, 14, 13}
Node 10: {4, 7, 8}
Node 11: {1, 0, 14}
Node 12: {3, 6, 0, 13}
Node 13: {9, 12}
Node 14: {3, 9, 11, 5}

Now we will check for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors - inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 2 has 5 neighbors - inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 3 has 5 neighbors - inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 5 has 5 neighbors - inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 6 has 4 neighbors - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 7 has 6 neighbors - inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 8 has 5 neighbors - inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 9 has 4 neighbors - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 10 has 3 neighbors - 1 3-star
Node 11 has 3 neighbors - 1 3-star
Node 12 has 4 neighbors - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 14 has 4 neighbors - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 78

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [78].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 2, 11>, <0, 2, 12>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 11, 14>, <2, 5, 14>,
<3, 0, 6>, <3, 0, 12>, <3, 0, 14>, <3, 6, 12>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 7, 5>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 10>, <3, 12, 13>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 14>, <6, 3, 12>, <7, 4, 10>, <7, 4, 8>, <7, 4, 10>, <7, 5, 8>, <7, 5, 14>, <7, 8, 10>, <7, 8, 5>, <8, 10, 4>, <9, 13, 12>, <9, 13, 12>, <9, 14, 11>, <10, 4, 7>
