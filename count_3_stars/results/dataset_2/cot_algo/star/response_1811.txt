Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 8}
Node 1: {0, 7, 8, 9}
Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 9}
Node 3: {4, 6, 8}
Node 4: {3, 6, 8}
Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 7, 9}
Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
Node 7: {1, 5, 6}
Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}
Node 9: {1, 2, 5}

Next, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars each node forms:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 55 \)

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [55].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 8, 6>, <1, 8, 4>, <1, 8, 3>, <1, 7, 6>, <1, 7, 5>, <2, 6, 5>, <3, 8, 6>, <4, 8, 6>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 2>, <5, 6, 0>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 8, 0>, <6, 8, 4>, <6, 3, 4>, <7, 6, 1>, <8, 6, 4>, <8, 6, 3>, <8, 6, 0>, <8, 6, 5>, <9, 2, 5>
