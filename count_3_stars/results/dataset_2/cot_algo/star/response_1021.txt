Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 8) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {9, 4, 7, 13, 10}
- Node 1: {6, 3, 2, 10}
- Node 2: {1, 14}
- Node 3: {9, 1, 14, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 0, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 8, 12, 11}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 1, 12}
- Node 7: {4, 0}
- Node 8: {5, 14, 12}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 3, 13, 0}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 4, 0}
- Node 11: {5, 4, 13}
- Node 12: {5, 6, 3, 8}
- Node 13: {9, 11, 14, 0}
- Node 14: {3, 2, 8, 13}

Next, let's find the 3-star formations:

- Node 0, Node 9, Node 4: <0, 9, 4>
- Node 0, Node 9, Node 13: <0, 9, 13>
- Node 0, Node 9, Node 10: <0, 9, 10>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
