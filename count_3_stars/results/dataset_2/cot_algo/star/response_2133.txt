Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5, 8
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 7, 8

Next, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the final answer is [48], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>.
