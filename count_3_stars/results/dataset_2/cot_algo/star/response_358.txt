Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 8) (2, 7) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 1) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 19) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 12) (14, 16) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 8) (19, 18) (19, 12) (19, 15) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (4, 10) (4, 16) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 6) (16, 14) (16, 4) (16, 6) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (6, 16) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 6}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 12, 18}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 4: {10, 16}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 8, 18}
- Node 6: {0, 12, 13, 16}
- Node 7: {2, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 11, 17}
- Node 9: {1, 8, 10, 15}
- Node 10: {4, 9, 11, 17}
- Node 11: {8, 10, 17}
- Node 12: {1, 6, 7, 19}
- Node 13: {6, 7, 15}
- Node 14: {12, 16}
- Node 15: {9, 13, 19}
- Node 16: {4, 6, 14}
- Node 17: {8, 10, 11}
- Node 18: {1, 5, 19}
- Node 19: {12, 15, 18}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and count the number of 3-stars formed by each of them:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <1, 5, 9, 12>
    - <1, 5, 9, 18>
    - <1, 5, 12, 18>
    - <1, 9, 12, 18>
    
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <5, 8, 9, 18>
    - <5, 8, 9, 1>
    - <5, 8, 18, 1>
    - <5, 9, 18, 1>
    
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <6, 0, 12, 13>
    - <6, 12, 13, 16>
    - <6, 12, 13, 7>
    - <6, 12, 16, 7>
    
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <8, 5, 9, 17>
    - <8, 5, 9, 1>
    - <8, 5, 17, 1>
    - <8, 9, 17, 1>
    
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <9, 8, 10, 15>
    - <9, 8, 10, 1>
    - <9, 10, 15, 1>
    - <9, 10, 15, 8>
    
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <10, 4, 9, 11>
    - <10, 4, 9, 17>
    - <10, 11, 17, 9>
    - <10, 17, 11, 9>
    
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <11, 10, 17, 8>
    
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <12, 1, 6, 19>
    - <12, 1, 7, 19>
    - <12, 6, 13, 7>
    - <12, 13, 7, 19>
    
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <13, 6, 7, 15>
    
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <16, 4, 6, 14>
    
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <17, 8, 10, 11>
    
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <18, 1, 5, 19>
    
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <19, 12, 15, 18>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of 24 3-stars formed. Therefore, the final answer is [24].
