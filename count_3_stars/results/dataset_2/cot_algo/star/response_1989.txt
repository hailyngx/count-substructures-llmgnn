Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 14) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 21) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 22) (17, 4) (22, 17) (22, 19) (22, 11) (23, 18) (23, 21) (23, 16) (20, 25) (20, 13) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 8) (25, 10) (1, 14) (1, 29) (1, 28) (1, 13) (6, 17) (6, 21) (6, 26) (21, 27) (21, 23) (21, 6) (21, 8) (21, 2) (0, 16) (0, 18) (0, 8) (16, 23) (16, 0) (16, 18) (19, 14) (19, 22) (19, 25) (19, 12) (8, 25) (8, 21) (8, 0) (28, 1) (28, 12) (28, 13) (11, 22) (11, 20) (11, 24) (24, 11) (24, 4) (24, 9) (3, 26) (3, 12) (29, 15) (29, 27) (29, 1) (10, 25) (26, 6) (26, 3) (26, 2) (2, 15) (2, 21) (2, 26) (2, 4) (9, 25) (9, 24) (9, 12) (18, 23) (18, 0) (18, 16) (4, 17) (4, 24) (4, 2) (12, 19) (12, 28) (12, 3) (12, 9) (13, 20) (13, 1) (13, 28) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's find the total number of 3-stars.

For each node, we will determine its neighbors and check if it forms any 3-star. Let's start the calculation:

1. Node 0: Neighbors = {16, 18, 8}
2. Node 1: Neighbors = {14, 29, 28, 13}
3. Node 2: Neighbors = {15, 21, 26, 4}
4. Node 3: Neighbors = {26, 12}
5. Node 4: Neighbors = {17, 24, 2}
6. Node 5: No edges connected.
7. Node 6: Neighbors = {17, 21, 26}
8. Node 7: No edges connected.
9. Node 8: Neighbors = {25, 21, 0}
10. Node 9: Neighbors = {25, 24, 12}
11. Node 10: Neighbors = {25}
12. Node 11: Neighbors = {22, 20, 24}
13. Node 12: Neighbors = {19, 28, 3, 9}
14. Node 13: Neighbors = {20, 1, 28}
15. Node 14: Neighbors = {15, 1, 19}
16. Node 15: Neighbors = {27, 29, 14, 2}
17. Node 16: Neighbors = {23, 0, 18}
18. Node 17: Neighbors = {6, 22, 4}
19. Node 18: Neighbors = {23, 0, 16}
20. Node 19: Neighbors = {14, 22, 25, 12}
21. Node 20: Neighbors = {25, 11, 13}
22. Node 21: Neighbors = {27, 23, 6, 8, 2}
23. Node 22: Neighbors = {17, 19, 11}
24. Node 23: Neighbors = {18, 21, 16}
25. Node 24: Neighbors = {11, 4, 9}
26. Node 25: Neighbors = {20, 25, 19, 8, 10}
27. Node 26: Neighbors = {6, 3, 2}
28. Node 27: Neighbors = {15, 29, 21}
29. Node 28: Neighbors = {1, 12, 13}
30. Node 29: Neighbors = {15, 27, 1}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 12, 15, 19, 25, and 28 have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star
- Node 15 forms 2 3-stars: <15, (27, 29, 21)> and <15, (14, 2, 1)>
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star
- Node 25 forms 3 3-stars: <25, (20, 19, 8)>, <25, (20, 11, 10)>, and <25, (19, 12, 8)>
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
