Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 3) (7, 21) (7, 26) (7, 13) (21, 6) (21, 7) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 29) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 23) (11, 28) (11, 22) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 23) (1, 22) (3, 9) (3, 1) (22, 11) (22, 1) (22, 23) (23, 10) (23, 1) (23, 22) (23, 24) (5, 14) (5, 20) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 29) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 8) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 15) (4, 2) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 20) (18, 13) (19, 4) (19, 15) (26, 7) (26, 16) (28, 11) (28, 0) (28, 12) (20, 5) (20, 18) (29, 21) (29, 0) (24, 6) (24, 23) (24, 8) (24, 27) (12, 28) (12, 25) (12, 8) (16, 26) (15, 9) (15, 21) (15, 4) (15, 19) (17, 6) (17, 27) (25, 12) (25, 8) (8, 21) (8, 14) (8, 24) (8, 12) (8, 25) (2, 4) (2, 27) (27, 24) (27, 17) (27, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 18) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node. Then, we will identify and count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

### Neighbor Sets:
- Node 0: {14, 28, 29}
- Node 1: {3, 10, 22, 23}
- Node 2: {4, 27}
- Node 3: {1, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 15, 18, 19}
- Node 5: {14, 20}
- Node 6: {9, 17, 21, 24}
- Node 7: {13, 21, 26}
- Node 8: {12, 14, 21, 24, 25}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 15}
- Node 10: {1, 13, 18, 23}
- Node 11: {22, 28}
- Node 12: {8, 25, 28}
- Node 13: {7, 10, 18}
- Node 14: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 15: {4, 9, 19, 21}
- Node 16: {26}
- Node 17: {6, 27}
- Node 18: {4, 10, 13, 20}
- Node 19: {4, 15}
- Node 20: {5, 18}
- Node 21: {6, 7, 8, 15, 29}
- Node 22: {1, 11, 23}
- Node 23: {1, 10, 22, 24}
- Node 24: {6, 8, 23, 27}
- Node 25: {8, 12}
- Node 26: {7, 16}
- Node 27: {2, 17, 24}
- Node 28: {0, 11, 12}
- Node 29: {21, 0}

### 3-Stars:
- Node 6: <6, (9, 21, 24)>, <6, (9, 17, 21)>, <6, (21, 17, 27)>
- Node 8: <8, (21, 14, 24)>
- Node 9: <9, (6, 3, 15)>
- Node 12: <12, (8, 25, 28)>
- Node 13: <13, (18, 7, 10)>
- Node 14: <14, (0, 8, 28)>
- Node 15: <15, (9, 4, 19)>, <15, (21, 4, 9)>
- Node 18: <18, (4, 10, 13)>, <18, (4, 13, 20)>
- Node 21: <21, (6, 7, 8)>, <21, (6, 15, 9)>, <21, (7, 13, 10)>, <21, (8, 14, 24)>, <21, (15, 9, 4)>
- Node 22: <22, (1, 11, 23)>
- Node 24: <24, (6, 8, 27)>, <24, (8, 23, 27)>
- Node 27: <27, (2, 17, 24)>

There are a total of 17 unique 3-stars, so the final number inside brackets is [17].
