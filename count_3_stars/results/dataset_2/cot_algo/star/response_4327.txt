Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) 

Response:
Based on the given edges:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 9, 12, 4, 3, 14
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 5, 6, 2, 1, 0
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 9, 14, 12, 13
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 9, 3, 13, 8
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 5, 1, 11, 7
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 11, 12, 4
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 3, 10, 7, 12
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 1, 13, 4, 2, 0
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 6, 1, 8, 4
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 5, 10, 8, 13
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3, 11, 14
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 10, 11
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 9, 8, 2
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 2
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 9, 8, 0, 14

Now, we see that nodes 5, 9, and 8 each have 5 or more neighbors, and can form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives us a total of 30 3-stars, so the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <5, (9, 3, 14)>
- <5, (9, 4, 12)>
- <9, (6, 12, 13)>
- <9, (6, 1, 0)>
- <8, (1, 13, 4)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>
- <8, (1, 4, 10)>
- <8, (1, 3, 11)>
- <8, (13, 4, 6)>
- <8, (13, 1, 3)>
