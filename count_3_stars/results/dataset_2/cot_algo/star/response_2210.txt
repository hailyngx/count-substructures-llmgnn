Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 6, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: Nodes 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-star formations:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32. 
This final number is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
