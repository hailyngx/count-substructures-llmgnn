Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 15) (27, 0) (27, 17) (27, 8) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 23) (3, 12) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 16) (10, 21) (10, 1) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 20) (22, 11) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 6) (22, 5) (23, 3) (23, 22) (23, 28) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 29) (12, 26) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 26) (1, 6) (26, 12) (26, 1) (26, 29) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 4) (8, 27) (8, 15) (4, 22) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 9) (18, 4) (18, 17) (13, 17) (13, 28) (17, 27) (17, 25) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 13) (21, 0) (21, 10) (21, 20) (19, 15) (6, 22) (6, 1) (24, 28) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 29) (16, 25) (9, 25) (9, 4) (14, 28) (20, 11) (20, 12) (20, 21) (29, 12) (29, 26) (29, 15) (5, 22) (5, 7) (5, 28) (28, 23) (28, 13) (28, 24) (28, 14) (28, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 27, 21, 15
- Node 1: 10, 7, 26, 6
- Node 2: 7, 17, 4
- Node 3: 25, 11, 23, 12
- Node 4: 22, 2, 18, 9
- Node 5: 22, 7, 28
- Node 6: 22, 1
- Node 7: 12, 2, 1, 5
- Node 8: 27, 15
- Node 9: 25, 4
- Node 10: 21, 1
- Node 11: 25, 3, 22, 20
- Node 12: 7, 3, 20, 29, 26
- Node 13: 17, 28
- Node 14: 28
- Node 15: 0, 8, 19, 29
- Node 16: 25
- Node 17: 27, 25, 2, 18, 13
- Node 18: 4, 17
- Node 19: 15
- Node 20: 11, 12, 21
- Node 21: 0, 10, 20
- Node 22: 11, 4, 6, 5, 23
- Node 23: 3, 22, 28
- Node 24: 28
- Node 25: 3, 17, 9, 16
- Node 26: 12, 1, 29
- Node 27: 0, 8, 17
- Node 28: 23, 13, 24, 5, 14
- Node 29: 12, 26, 15

Now, we'll identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 1: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 2: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 3: <3, (12, 25, 11)>
- Node 4: <4, (2, 9, 22)>
- Node 5: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 6: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 7: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 8: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 9: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 10: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 11: <11, (3, 20, 25)>
- Node 12: <12, (26, 3, 29)>
- Node 13: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 14: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 15: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 16: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 17: <17, (25, 27, 13)>
- Node 18: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 19: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 20: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 21: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 22: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 23: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 24: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 25: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 26: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 27: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 28: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]
- Node 29: [CANNOT FORM a 3-star]

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars found are <3, (12, 25, 11)>, <4, (2, 9, 22)>, and <17, (25, 27, 13)>.
