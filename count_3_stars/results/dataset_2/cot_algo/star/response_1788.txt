Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 13) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 14) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 10) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 1) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

1: {8, 4, 11, 14}
2: {9, 4, 12, 0, 10}
3: {9, 6, 8}
4: {12, 2, 1}
5: {9, 0, 10, 7}
6: {9, 14, 3, 13}
7: {5, 0, 11, 14}
8: {13, 3, 1, 11}
9: {5, 6, 2, 11, 3, 13, 0}
10: {5, 12, 2}
11: {9, 8, 7, 14, 1}
12: {4, 2, 10}
13: {9, 6, 8, 14}
14: {6, 13, 7, 11, 1}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 2, 11, and 13: <9, (2, 11, 13)>
2. Node 14 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 6, 11, and 13: <14, (6, 11, 13)>

Total number of 3-stars = 2, so the final answer is [2].
