Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 1) (16, 9) (16, 5) (16, 6) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 14) (4, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 0) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 10) (17, 0) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 15) (18, 9) (18, 2) (8, 11) (8, 5) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 0) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 12) (1, 16) (1, 14) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 0) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 19) (14, 1) (14, 13) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 12) (13, 15) (13, 14) 

Response:
We can start by listing the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {9, 17, 19, 12}
- Node 1: {16, 14}
- Node 2: {7, 18, 14}
- Node 3: {11, 7, 12}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {16, 8, 12}
- Node 6: {16, 9, 19}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 2}
- Node 8: {11, 5}
- Node 9: {16, 6, 18, 0}
- Node 10: {17, 12}
- Node 11: {3, 8, 15}
- Node 12: {3, 10, 5, 0}
- Node 13: {15, 14}
- Node 14: {15, 2, 19, 1, 13}
- Node 15: {11, 18, 13, 14}
- Node 16: {1, 9, 5, 6}
- Node 17: {10, 0}
- Node 18: {15, 9, 2}
- Node 19: {6, 14, 0}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0, Node 3, Node 5, Node 12, Node 14, and Node 19 each have 4 or more neighbors, thus they can form 3-stars.
- Node 9 and Node 16 each have exactly 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 3-star each.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: 1 3-star
- For Node 16: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 23 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [23], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 17, 19)>, <3, (11, 7, 12)>, <5, (16, 8, 12)>, <12, (3, 10, 5)>, <14, (15, 2, 19)>, <19, (6, 14, 0)>, <9, (16, 6, 19)>, <16, (1, 9, 5)>.
