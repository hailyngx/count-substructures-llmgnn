Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 12) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 10) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 19) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 1) (4, 9) (4, 17) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 1) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 18) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 16) (8, 2) (8, 17) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 0) (1, 10) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 19) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 13) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 18) (10, 16) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 7) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 10}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 10, 15, 18}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 8, 19}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 13, 15}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 17}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 12, 17}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 10, 11}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 16, 17}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 11, 16, 19}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 1, 7, 14, 16}
- Node 11: Neighbors {7, 9, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {5, 11, 18}
- Node 13: Neighbors {3, 17, 19}
- Node 14: Neighbors {10, 18}
- Node 15: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 16: Neighbors {8, 9, 10}
- Node 17: Neighbors {4, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 18: Neighbors {1, 12, 14}
- Node 19: Neighbors {2, 9, 13}

Now let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 14, 15, 18, and 19 do not have 3 or more neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 5, 8, 10, 16, and 17 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they each form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 and 12 have 3 neighbors, so each can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 10) + 1 (from node 16) + 1 (from node 17) + 1 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 12) + 4 (from node 9) = 10. 

So, the final answer is [10], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<5, 0, 2, 12>
<8, 2, 16, 17>
<10, 0, 1, 7>
<16, 8, 9, 10>
<17, 4, 5, 13>
<7, 3, 10, 11>
<12, 5, 11, 18>
<9, 4, 11, 19>
<9, 11, 16, 19>
<9, 16, 19, 2>
