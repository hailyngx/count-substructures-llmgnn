Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
Let's first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 7, 8}

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: \( 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
