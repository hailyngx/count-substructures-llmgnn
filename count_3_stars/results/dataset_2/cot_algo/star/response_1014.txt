Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 4: {7, 13, 0, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {13, 8, 11, 10}
- Node 13: {4, 5, 12, 2, 6}
- Node 0: {4, 7, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 14, 1}
- Node 9: {7, 8}
- Node 1: {8, 6, 14}
- Node 6: {7, 13, 0, 1, 2, 12}
- Node 10: {5, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {5, 14, 12}
- Node 14: {4, 8, 1, 10, 11, 2}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 12}
- Node 12: {13, 6, 10, 11, 3}
- Node 2: {13, 6, 14, 3}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 5, 13, 0, 6, 10, 11, 14, 3, 12, and 2.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: [comb(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 7: [comb(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 5: [comb(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 13: [comb(5, 3)] = 10
- Node 0: [comb(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 6: [comb(6, 3)] = 20
- Node 10: [comb(3, 3)] = 1
- Node 11: [comb(3, 3)] = 1
- Node 14: [comb(6, 3)] = 20
- Node 3: [comb(3, 3)] = 1
- Node 12: [comb(5, 3)] = 10
- Node 2: [comb(4, 3)] = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 79

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [79], and the unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 13, 0)>
<7, (4, 0, 6)>
<5, (13, 8, 11)>
<13, (4, 5, 12)>
<0, (4, 7, 3)>
<6, (7, 13, 0)>
<10, (5, 12, 14)>
<11, (5, 14, 12)>
<14, (4, 8, 1)>
<3, (0, 2, 12)>
<12, (13, 6, 10)>
<2, (13, 6, 14)>
