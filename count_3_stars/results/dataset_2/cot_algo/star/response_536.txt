Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 14) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 2: {7, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 8, 14}
- Node 4: {5, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 10}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 13}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 7, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 6, 11}
- Node 11: {1, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1: <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 5: <5, (3, 4, 11)>, <5, (3, 11, 12)>, <5, (3, 12, 14)>, <5, (4, 11, 12)>, <5, (4, 12, 14)>, <5, (11, 12, 14)>
- Node 7: <7, (2, 9, 13)>, <7, (4, 6, 11)>, <7, (4, 11, 12)>, <7, (5, 11, 12)>
- Node 11: [1]

There are a total of 1 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 12 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer is [12].
