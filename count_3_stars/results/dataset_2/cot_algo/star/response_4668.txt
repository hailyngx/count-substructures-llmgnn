Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 15) (10, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (6, 17) (6, 12) (3, 16) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 4) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 2) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 18) (19, 15) (19, 2) (19, 4) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 18) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 9) (7, 11) (7, 16) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 13) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 9) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 12) (4, 11) (4, 19) (14, 5) (14, 12) (13, 10) (13, 9) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first calculate the number of neighbors for each node. Then, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form. 

| Node | Neighbors |
|------|-----------|
| 0    | 4         |
| 1    | 3         |
| 2    | 4         |
| 3    | 2         |
| 4    | 2         |
| 5    | 2         |
| 6    | 2         |
| 7    | 2         |
| 8    | 4         |
| 9    | 4         |
| 10   | 2         |
| 11   | 3         |
| 12   | 4         |
| 13   | 2         |
| 14   | 2         |
| 15   | 4         |
| 16   | 5         |
| 17   | 3         |
| 18   | 3         |
| 19   | 3         |

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 32 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32]. 

Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (16, 8, 18)>, <2, (19, 12, 15)>, <8, (16, 0, 18)>, <9, (15, 13, 16)>, <11, (1, 4, 7)>, <12, (1, 2, 14)>, <15, (9, 10, 19)>, <16, (0, 3, 7)>, <17, (0, 6, 12)>, <18, (8, 0, 9)>, <19, (2, 4, 15)>
