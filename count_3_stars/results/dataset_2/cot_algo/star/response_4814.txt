Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (2, 9) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 8) (8, 18) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 5) (1, 0) (1, 16) (1, 5) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 4) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 13) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 19) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 17) (4, 12) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 15) (7, 16) (7, 5) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 15) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 16) (15, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 16) (5, 14) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 15) (19, 14) (19, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 16}
- Node 2: {9, 18}
- Node 3: {10, 11}
- Node 4: {0, 9, 12, 17}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 14, 15}
- Node 6: {9, 10}
- Node 7: {5, 16}
- Node 8: {11, 18}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 6, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 6, 16}
- Node 11: {3, 8, 13}
- Node 12: {4, 15, 17}
- Node 13: {11, 17, 19}
- Node 14: {0, 5, 9, 19}
- Node 15: {5, 12, 16, 18}
- Node 16: {1, 7, 10, 15}
- Node 17: {4, 12, 13}
- Node 18: {2, 8, 15}
- Node 19: {13, 14}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 7, 12
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 15, 17, 18
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 9, 14
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: 13

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 7, 12 --> 0 * 1 = 0
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 15, 17, 18 --> 8 * 4 = 32
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 9, 14 --> 2 * 10 = 20
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: 13 --> 1 * 20 = 20

Total number of 3-stars: 0 + 32 + 20 + 20 = 72

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [72].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <4, (0, 12, 17), 18>
- <5, (1, 7, 15), 16>
- <8, (11, 18, 15), 17>
- <10, (3, 6, 16), 15>
- <11, (3, 8, 13), 17>
- <13, (11, 17, 19), 14>
- <14, (0, 5, 9), 19>
- <15, (5, 12, 16), 18>
- <17, (4, 12, 13), 15>
- <18, (2, 8, 15), 4>
- <19, (13, 14, 9), 0>
