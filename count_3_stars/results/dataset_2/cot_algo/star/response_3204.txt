Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (5, 6) (5, 3) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 4) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {2, 3, 12, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {3, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {1, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {9, 11}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {4, 7, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {3, 4, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 12, 13}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1: 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
- Node 3: 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
- Node 6: 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
- Node 9: 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
- Node 11: 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
- Node 14: 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 120

Therefore, the final answer is [120], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 6, 9, 11>
<1, 6, 9, 14>
<1, 6, 3, 9>
<1, 6, 3, 11>
<1, 6, 9, 11>
<3, 4, 13, 14>
<3, 4, 13, 14>
<3, 4, 13, 14>
<3, 4, 13, 14>
<3, 4, 13, 14>
<6, 1, 9, 11>
<6, 1, 9, 14>
<6, 1, 3, 9>
<6, 1, 3, 11>
<6, 14, 1, 9>
