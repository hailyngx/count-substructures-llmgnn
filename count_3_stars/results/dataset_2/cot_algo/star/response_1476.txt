Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) 

Response:
The first step is to list the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 7, 9, 1}
- Node 1: {5, 8, 2, 7, 6, 0}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 8, 1}
- Node 3: {7, 6}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 1, 8, 4}
- Node 6: {9, 4, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 8: {5, 4, 2, 0, 1}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 7, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9.

For these nodes, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 62 \)

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 8, 7)>
<1, (2, 8, 5)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<1, (6, 5, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (8, 5, 4)>
<1, (8, 5, 6)>
<1, (8, 7, 4)>
<4, (5, 8, 0)>
<4, (5, 8, 2)>
<4, (5, 8, 1)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<4, (7, 8, 2)>
<6, (4, 8, 0)>
<6, (4, 8, 2)>
<6, (4, 8, 1)>
<7, (9, 6, 7)>
<8, (6, 9, 7)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<8, (9, 6, 4)>
<9, (4, 0, 7)>
