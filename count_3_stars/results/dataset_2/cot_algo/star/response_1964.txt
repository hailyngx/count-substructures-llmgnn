Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5
Node 1: 2, 4, 6
Node 2: 0, 1, 8
Node 3: 0, 5, 6, 7
Node 4: 0, 1, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 7, 8
Node 6: 1, 3, 5
Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 9
Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
Node 9: 0, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 38 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [38], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
