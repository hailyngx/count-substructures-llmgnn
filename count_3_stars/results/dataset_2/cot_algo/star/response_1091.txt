Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 23) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 14) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 16) (15, 23) (15, 0) (15, 14) (0, 15) (0, 27) (0, 18) (27, 0) (27, 2) (27, 16) (1, 26) (1, 21) (1, 20) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 20) (21, 5) (21, 22) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 24) (14, 26) (14, 15) (14, 23) (16, 3) (16, 27) (16, 18) (10, 6) (10, 29) (10, 5) (17, 28) (17, 25) (17, 12) (25, 17) (25, 22) (25, 11) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 22) (4, 2) (22, 21) (22, 25) (22, 4) (22, 5) (11, 25) (11, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 2) (29, 10) (29, 18) (20, 1) (20, 21) (24, 3) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 23) (23, 9) (23, 15) (23, 14) (23, 24) (19, 1) (2, 9) (2, 27) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 7) (12, 17) (12, 6) (13, 9) (5, 21) (5, 10) (5, 22) (5, 24) (18, 0) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 29) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {15, 27, 18}
- Node 1: {26, 21, 20, 19}
- Node 2: {9, 27, 4, 11, 7}
- Node 3: {28, 24, 16}
- Node 4: {22, 2}
- Node 5: {21, 10, 22, 24}
- Node 6: {10, 7, 12}
- Node 7: {9, 6, 18, 2}
- Node 9: {2, 7, 13, 23}
- Node 10: {6, 5, 29}
- Node 11: {25, 2}
- Node 12: {17, 6}
- Node 13: {9}
- Node 14: {26, 15, 23}
- Node 15: {23, 0, 14}
- Node 16: {3, 27, 18}
- Node 17: {28, 25, 12}
- Node 18: {0, 16, 7, 29}
- Node 19: {1}
- Node 20: {1, 21}
- Node 21: {1, 20, 5, 22}
- Node 22: {21, 25, 4, 5}
- Node 23: {9, 15, 14, 24}
- Node 24: {3, 28, 5, 23}
- Node 25: {17, 22, 11}
- Node 26: {1, 28, 14}
- Node 27: {0, 2, 16}
- Node 28: {26, 3, 17, 24}
- Node 29: {10, 18}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 7, Node 9, Node 15, Node 16, Node 18, Node 21, Node 22, Node 23, Node 24, Node 25, Node 26, Node 27, Node 28, Node 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Nodes 0, 15, 16, and 27 have exactly 3 neighbors, so each forms 1 3-star.
- Nodes 1, 5, 13, 19, and 26 have more than 3 neighbors, so we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each:
  - Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 13: No 3-star can be formed with less than 3 neighbors.
  - Node 19: No 3-star can be formed with less than 3 neighbors.
  - Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  
Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from nodes with exactly 3 neighbors) + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (15, 0, 27)>, <1, (26, 1, 21)>, <5, (21, 5, 22)>, and <26, (1, 26, 14)>
