Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 7: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 7, 8, 2

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 4, 6, and 7 have 5 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 28 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 2, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
