Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 19) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 7) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 14) (4, 17) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 15) (2, 16) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 5) (7, 13) (7, 10) (7, 15) (15, 6) (15, 7) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 3) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 18) (12, 16) (12, 14) (9, 18) (9, 14) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 17) (3, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 14
- Node 2: 5, 8, 16
- Node 3: 4, 14, 17
- Node 4: 3, 17
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 18
- Node 6: 5, 15, 17
- Node 7: 10, 13, 15
- Node 8: 2, 11, 13
- Node 9: 14, 18
- Node 10: 7, 11, 13, 14
- Node 11: 8, 10, 16, 19
- Node 12: 14, 16
- Node 13: 7, 8, 10, 16
- Node 14: 1, 3, 9, 10, 12
- Node 15: 6, 7
- Node 16: 2, 11, 12, 13, 19
- Node 17: 3, 4, 6
- Node 18: 5, 9, 19
- Node 19: 11, 18, 16

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 2 forms 1 three-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 three-star.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) three-stars.
- Node 6 forms 1 three-star.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{3}{3} =1 \) three-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 three-star.
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) three-stars.
- Node 11 forms 1 three-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 three-star.
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) three-stars.
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) three-stars.
- Node 16 forms 1 three-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 three-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 three-star.

The total number of 3-stars formed is 31, so the answer is [31].

Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
<2, (5, 8, 16)>
<3, (4, 14, 17)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (5, 15, 17)>
<7, (10, 13, 15)>
<8, (2, 11, 16)>
<10, (7, 11, 13)>
<12, (14, 16, 19)>
<13, (7, 8, 10)>
<14, (1, 3, 9)>
<16, (2, 13, 19)>
<18, (5, 9, 19)>
