Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 19) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 18) (2, 13) (18, 10) (18, 12) (1, 15) (1, 0) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 9) (8, 11) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 7) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 7) (12, 16) (12, 15) (12, 18) (12, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 9) (4, 13) (4, 9) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 4) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 5, 8}
Node 1: {0, 15}
Node 2: {13}
Node 3: {7, 15}
Node 4: {9, 13}
Node 5: {0, 13}
Node 6: {10, 12, 16}
Node 7: {3, 8, 9, 19}
Node 8: {0, 7, 11, 15}
Node 9: {4, 7, 13, 16}
Node 10: {6, 14, 17, 18}
Node 11: {8, 16}
Node 12: {6, 15, 16, 18}
Node 13: {2, 4, 5, 9}
Node 14: {10, 17, 19}
Node 15: {1, 3, 8, 12}
Node 16: {6, 9, 11, 12}
Node 17: {10, 14, 19}
Node 18: {10, 12}
Node 19: {7, 14, 17}

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 7, 8, 15, 16 have 4 or more neighbors, so we can create inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} = 20 3-stars.
Node 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 have exactly 3 neighbors, so each can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 6 = 26

Therefore, the final answer is [26], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<7, 8, 15>
<7, 8, 16>
<7, 8, 19>
<7, 15, 8>
<7, 15, 12>
<8, 7, 15>
<8, 7, 11>
<8, 7, 9>
<8, 15, 7>
<8, 15, 12>
<15, 7, 8>
<15, 7, 3>
<15, 8, 7>
<15, 8, 12>
<16, 6, 9>
<16, 6, 12>
<16, 6, 10>
<16, 6, 18>
<10, 6, 16>
<12, 16, 6>
<13, 4, 5>
<14, 10, 17>
