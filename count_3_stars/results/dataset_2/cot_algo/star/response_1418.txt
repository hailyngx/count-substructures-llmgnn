Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 22) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 13) (9, 23) (2, 16) (2, 28) (29, 25) (29, 23) (29, 4) (1, 3) (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 20) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 13) (21, 27) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 8) (20, 9) (20, 11) (20, 0) (26, 1) (26, 7) (26, 17) (28, 2) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 8) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 21) (13, 24) (24, 13) (24, 7) (19, 5) (19, 3) (15, 0) (7, 26) (7, 24) (7, 16) (7, 17) (25, 29) (25, 12) (23, 9) (23, 29) (23, 11) (23, 27) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 7) (16, 22) (6, 17) (6, 18) (4, 29) (4, 1) (4, 22) (22, 5) (22, 16) (22, 4) (8, 0) (8, 28) (17, 26) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 27) (18, 6) (18, 12) (14, 27) (27, 21) (27, 23) (27, 17) (27, 14) (12, 3) (12, 25) (12, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 20, 28, 15, 8
- Node 1: 3, 21, 26, 4
- Node 2: 16, 28
- Node 3: 1, 19, 12
- Node 4: 29, 1, 22
- Node 5: 9, 13, 19, 22, 16
- Node 6: 17, 18
- Node 7: 26, 24, 16, 17
- Node 8: 0, 28
- Node 9: 5, 20, 13, 23
- Node 10: 11
- Node 11: 10, 23, 20
- Node 12: 3, 25, 18
- Node 13: 5, 9, 21, 24
- Node 14: 27
- Node 15: 0
- Node 16: 5, 2, 7, 22
- Node 17: 26, 7, 6, 27
- Node 18: 6, 12
- Node 19: 5, 3
- Node 20: 9, 11, 0
- Node 21: 1, 28, 13, 27
- Node 22: 5, 16, 4
- Node 23: 11, 29, 9, 27
- Node 24: 13, 7
- Node 25: 29, 12
- Node 26: 1, 7, 17
- Node 27: 21, 23, 17, 14
- Node 28: 2, 21, 0, 8
- Node 29: 25, 23, 4

Now, let's count the 3-stars:

- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars <5, (9, 13, 16)>, <5, (9, 19, 22)>, <5, (9, 19, 16)>, <5, (9, 22, 16)>, <5, (13, 19, 22)>, <5, (13, 19, 16)>, <5, (13, 22, 16)>, <5, (19, 22, 16)>, <5, (19, 22, 16)>, <5, (5, 22, 16)>
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <9, (5, 13, 20)>, <9, (5, 13, 23)>, <9, (5, 20, 23)>, <9, (13, 20, 23)>
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <13, (5, 9, 21)>, <13, (5, 9, 24)>, <13, (5, 21, 24)>, <13, (9, 21, 24)>
- Node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <16, (2, 5, 7)>, <16, (2, 5, 22)>, <16, (2, 7, 22)>, <16, (5, 7, 22)>
- Node 21: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <21, (1, 13, 27)>, <21, (1, 19, 27)>, <21, (13, 19, 27)>, <21, (13, 21, 27)>
- Node 22: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star <22, (5, 16, 4)>
- Node 27: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <27, (21, 23, 17)>, <27, (21, 17, 14)>, <27, (23, 17, 14)>, <27, (21, 23, 14)>

The total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is 27, so the final answer is [27].
