Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (1, 10) (1, 14) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 14) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we'll first determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 10, 2, 14, 8, 13}
- Node 1: {10, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 4, 0, 3}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 10, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 10, 3, 2}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 12, 4}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 10, 11, 0}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 0, 14}
- Node 9: {6, 11, 13, 12}
- Node 10: {4, 6, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 11: {9, 6, 12}
- Node 12: {5, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {9, 0, 14, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 8, 1, 13}

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we'll calculate the possible 3-stars:

- Node 0: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

The total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is 60. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 6, 10>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 6, 14>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 10, 3>, <0, 10, 1>, <0, 10, 14>, <0, 3, 4>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 12>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 4, 3>, <6, 9, 11>, <6, 9, 13>, <6, 9, 12>, <6, 7, 8>, <9, 12, 13>, <10, 4, 3>, <10, 4, 2>, <10, 6, 11>, <10, 6, 0>, <10, 3, 7>, <11, 9, 12>, <12, 5, 9>, <12, 5, 11>, <12, 9, 13>, <13, 9, 0>, <13, 9, 14>, <14, 1, 10>, <14, 1, 13>, <14, 1, 8>
