Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 23) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 9) (17, 19) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 9) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 23) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 4) (20, 25) (20, 9) (20, 4) (20, 6) (2, 15) (18, 1) (18, 27) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 23) (7, 26) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 22) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 19) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 20) (9, 22) (9, 28) (22, 12) (22, 9) (22, 28) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 24) (13, 5) (21, 23) (26, 14) (26, 7) (26, 5) (26, 8) (26, 27) (19, 17) (19, 1) (19, 0) (24, 5) (24, 29) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 24) (29, 4) (28, 0) (28, 9) (28, 22) (28, 27) (27, 18) (27, 26) (27, 28) (8, 3) (8, 26) (8, 15) (4, 25) (4, 20) (4, 29) (6, 16) (6, 20) (6, 12) (15, 2) (15, 8) (23, 14) (23, 3) (23, 7) (23, 21) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {28, 29, 19}
- Node 1: {17, 3, 19, 9, 18}
- Node 2: {15}
- Node 3: {1, 25, 23, 8}
- Node 4: {25, 20, 29}
- Node 5: {11, 13, 26, 24}
- Node 6: {16, 20, 12}
- Node 7: {12, 29, 23, 26}
- Node 8: {3, 26, 15}
- Node 9: {17, 1, 20, 22, 28}
- Node 11: {16, 5}
- Node 12: {7, 6, 22}
- Node 13: {5}
- Node 14: {17, 26, 23}
- Node 15: {2, 8}
- Node 16: {11, 6}
- Node 17: {14, 1, 9, 19}
- Node 18: {1, 27}
- Node 19: {17, 1, 0}
- Node 20: {25, 9, 4, 6}
- Node 21: {23}
- Node 22: {12, 9, 28}
- Node 23: {14, 3, 7, 21}
- Node 24: {5, 29}
- Node 25: {3, 20, 4}
- Node 26: {14, 7, 5, 8, 27}
- Node 27: {18, 26, 28}
- Node 28: {0, 9, 22, 27}
- Node 29: {7, 0, 24, 4}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (17, 3, 9)>
- <1, (17, 3, 18)>
- <1, (17, 3, 19)>
- <1, (17, 9, 18)>
- <1, (17, 9, 19)>
- <1, (3, 18, 19)>
- <1, (9, 18, 19)>
- <3, (1, 25, 23)>
- <5, (11, 13, 24)>
- <7, (12, 29, 23)>
- <9, (1, 20, 22)>
- <20, (25, 9, 4)>
- <23, (14, 3, 7)>
- <26, (14, 7, 8)>
- <26, (27, 8, 18)>
- <26, (27, 28, 8)>
- <26, (27, 28, 18)>
- <28, (9, 22, 27)>
- <29, (7, 0, 24)>
