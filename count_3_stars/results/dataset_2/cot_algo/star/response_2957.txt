Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 19) (2, 9) (8, 19) (4, 18) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 1) (0, 7) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 16) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 6) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 19) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 9) (19, 12) (19, 8) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 1) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 9) (15, 4) (15, 13) (15, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 16) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 16) (10, 14) (10, 3) (6, 4) (6, 18) (6, 13) (6, 15) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 7
Node 1 neighbors: 16, 18, 19
Node 2 neighbors: 9
Node 3 neighbors: 9, 10, 11, 14, 19
Node 4 neighbors: 6, 11, 15, 18
Node 5 neighbors: 6, 7, 13, 16
Node 6 neighbors: 4, 5, 13, 15, 18
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 5, 12
Node 8 neighbors: 19
Node 9 neighbors: 2, 3, 11, 16
Node 10 neighbors: 3, 14
Node 11 neighbors: 3, 4, 9, 19
Node 12 neighbors: 7, 19
Node 13 neighbors: 5, 6, 15, 17
Node 14 neighbors: 3, 10, 17
Node 15 neighbors: 4, 6, 13
Node 16 neighbors: 1, 5, 9
Node 17 neighbors: 13, 14
Node 18 neighbors: 1, 4, 6
Node 19 neighbors: 3, 8, 11, 12, 1

Now let's count the number of 3-stars:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.

Adding them up: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49].

List of unique 3-stars:

<4, (6, 13, 15)>
<5, (6, 13, 15)>
<6, (4, 13, 18)>
<11, (3, 11, 19)>
<13, (5, 6, 15)>
<16, (1, 9, 16)>
<18, (1, 4, 6)>
<19, (3, 11, 12)>
