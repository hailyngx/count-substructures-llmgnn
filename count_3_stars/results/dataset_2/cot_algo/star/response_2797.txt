Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 8) (14, 12) (14, 9) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 18) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 18) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 13) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (5, 2) (5, 16) (6, 13) (6, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 16) (15, 7) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 13) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 18) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 10) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 17, 16, 18
- Node 2: 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: 2, 11
- Node 4: 9, 19, 11
- Node 5: 2, 16
- Node 6: 13, 10
- Node 7: 12, 15, 19, 9
- Node 8: 10, 17, 0
- Node 9: 4, 7, 14, 2, 16
- Node 10: 8, 6, 16, 18
- Node 11: 3, 4, 18
- Node 12: 7, 14
- Node 13: 17, 15, 19, 6
- Node 14: 12, 9
- Node 15: 7, 13
- Node 16: 1, 5, 9, 18, 10
- Node 17: 8, 1, 13
- Node 18: 11, 1, 16, 10
- Node 19: 4, 7, 13

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1, Node 9, Node 16, and Node 18 have 5 neighbors each.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <1, (5, 9, 16)>
- <9, (4, 16, 19)>
- <16, (1, 10, 18)>
- <18, (1, 10, 11)>
