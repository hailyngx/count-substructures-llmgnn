Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 5) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 4) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 2) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 16) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 5) (8, 1) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 13) (12, 15) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 13) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 19) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 18) (13, 5) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 0) (15, 10) (15, 12) (15, 2) (2, 11) (2, 15) (16, 14) (16, 3) (16, 10) (16, 9) (0, 19) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0 neighbors: {19}
- Node 1 neighbors: {3, 8, 13}
- Node 2 neighbors: {11, 15}
- Node 3 neighbors: {1, 4, 11, 16}
- Node 4 neighbors: {3, 5, 18}
- Node 5 neighbors: {4, 13, 14, 18, 19}
- Node 6 neighbors: {9, 10, 14, 19}
- Node 7 neighbors: {11, 13}
- Node 8 neighbors: {1}
- Node 9 neighbors: {6, 16}
- Node 10 neighbors: {6, 15, 16}
- Node 11 neighbors: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 12 neighbors: {13, 15}
- Node 13 neighbors: {1, 5, 7, 12, 18}
- Node 14 neighbors: {5, 6, 19}
- Node 15 neighbors: {10, 12, 2}
- Node 16 neighbors: {3, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 18 neighbors: {4, 5, 13, 19}
- Node 19 neighbors: {5, 6, 14, 18, 0}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<3, 4, 11>
<3, 4, 16>
<3, 11, 16>
<4, 5, 13>
<5, 13, 18>
<6, 9, 16>
<6, 10, 15>
<6, 10, 16>
<6, 14, 19>
<10, 15, 12>
<13, 5, 18>
<13, 7, 11>
<13, 7, 12>
<13, 12, 15>
<13, 18, 4>
<14, 5, 19>
<18, 4, 5>
<18, 4, 19>
<18, 5, 13>
