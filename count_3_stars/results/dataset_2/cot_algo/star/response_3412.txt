Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 4}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total = 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
