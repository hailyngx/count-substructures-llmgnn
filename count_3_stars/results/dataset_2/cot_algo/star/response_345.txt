Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 9, 4, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 6, 8, 1, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 9, 4, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 6, 8, 0, 1, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 4, 0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 2, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 2, 0, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 9, 6, 2, 0, 3}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 54

Therefore, the final answer is [54] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 4, 5, 9>
- <2, 4, 7, 9>
- <4, 0, 9, 5>
- <9, 2, 4, 6>
