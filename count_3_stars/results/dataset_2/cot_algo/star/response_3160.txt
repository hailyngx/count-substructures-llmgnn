Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 5) (8, 13) (8, 19) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 7) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 4) (15, 0) (15, 1) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 4) (19, 16) (19, 8) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 3) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 17) (4, 10) (5, 16) (5, 18) (5, 17) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {4, 9, 15}
- Node 1: {9, 15, 17, 18}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 10, 18}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 10, 17}
- Node 5: {16, 17, 18}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 11, 17}
- Node 7: {6, 10, 12}
- Node 8: {13, 19}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 7, 13}
- Node 11: {6, 16}
- Node 12: {7}
- Node 13: {8, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {3, 9, 13}
- Node 15: {0, 1}
- Node 16: {5, 6, 19}
- Node 17: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 18: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 19: {8, 16}

Next, we look for nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 5 (neighbors are: 16, 17, 18)
  - Number of 3-stars from Node 5: 1

Nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
- Node 1 (neighbors are: 15, 17, 18, 9)
  - Number of 3-stars from Node 1: 4 (inom{4}{3} = 4)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars gives us 1 + 4 = 5. So, the final answer is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <5, 16, 17, 18>
- <1, 9, 15, 17>
- <1, 9, 15, 18>
- <1, 15, 17, 18>
- <1, 9, 17, 18>
