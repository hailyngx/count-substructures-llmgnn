Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 28) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 15) (21, 14) (2, 29) (2, 11) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 19) (22, 23) (22, 6) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 6) (4, 27) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 3) (15, 21) (15, 8) (15, 19) (20, 3) (20, 19) (20, 28) (20, 10) (6, 22) (6, 23) (6, 28) (28, 1) (28, 20) (28, 6) (28, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (24, 26) (26, 24) (26, 17) (27, 21) (27, 4) (27, 25) (27, 14) (19, 29) (19, 15) (19, 20) (19, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 17) (16, 4) (16, 10) (10, 20) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 9) (25, 2) (25, 23) (25, 27) (25, 9) (7, 29) (7, 19) (7, 9) (9, 10) (9, 25) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 13) (17, 26) (17, 0) (18, 10) (18, 11) (3, 8) (3, 20) (3, 9) (14, 21) (14, 27) (14, 13) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 12) (12, 11) (13, 28) (13, 9) (13, 14) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 30 nodes and 90 edges. 
Let's first identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 5, 17}
- Node 1: {0, 21, 28}
- Node 2: {11, 25, 29}
- Node 3: {8, 9, 20}
- Node 4: {5, 16, 27}
- Node 5: {0, 4}
- Node 6: {22, 23, 28}
- Node 7: {9, 19, 29}
- Node 8: {3, 11, 15}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 13, 25}
- Node 10: {16, 18, 20}
- Node 11: {2, 8, 12, 18}
- Node 12: {11}
- Node 13: {9, 14, 28}
- Node 14: {13, 21, 27}
- Node 15: {8, 19, 21}
- Node 16: {4, 10}
- Node 17: {0, 26}
- Node 18: {10, 11}
- Node 19: {7, 15, 20, 29}
- Node 20: {3, 10, 19, 28}
- Node 21: {1, 14, 15, 27}
- Node 22: {6, 23}
- Node 23: {6, 22, 25}
- Node 24: {26}
- Node 25: {2, 9, 23, 27}
- Node 26: {17, 24}
- Node 27: {4, 14, 21, 25}
- Node 28: {1, 6, 13, 20}
- Node 29: {2, 7, 19}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 1 forms 3-stars: <1, (21, 28, 0)>, <1, (21, 15, 8)>, <1, (21, 14, 27)>, <1, (21, 14, 28)>, <1, (21, 15, 19)>, <1, (21, 27, 25)>, <1, (21, 15, 19)>
- Node 9 forms 3-stars: <9, (3, 7, 19)>, <9, (3, 13, 28)>
- Node 10 forms 3-stars: <10, (16, 18, 20)>, <10, (16, 10, 20)>, <10, (18, 11, 12)>, <10, (18, 11, 2)>, <10, (18, 11, 8)>, <10, (18, 11, 20)>, <10, (18, 11, 12)>, <10, (18, 11, 8)>
- Node 11 forms 3-stars: <11, (2, 18, 12)>, <11, (2, 18, 12)>, <11, (8, 11, 2)>, <11, (8, 11, 20)>, <11, (8, 11, 18)>, <11, (8, 11, 18)>, <11, (8, 11, 12)>, <11, (8, 11, 18)>
- Node 13 forms 3-stars: <13, (9, 14, 21)>, <13, (9, 13, 28)>
- Node 15 forms 3-stars: <15, (8, 19, 21)>, <15, (19, 15, 21)>
- Node 18 forms 3-stars: <18, (10, 11, 20)>, <18, (10, 11, 12)>, <18, (10, 11, 20)>, <18, (10, 11, 12)>, <18, (10, 11, 2)>, <18, (10, 11, 2)>, <18, (11, 18, 2)>, <18, (11, 18, 2)>
- Node 19 forms 3-stars: <19, (15, 20, 8)>, <19, (15, 20, 13)>, <19, (7, 29, 2)>, <19, (7, 29, 25)>
- Node 21 forms 3-stars: <21, (1, 14, 27)>, <21, (1, 14, 28)>, <21, (1, 27, 25)>, <21, (1, 15, 8)>
- Node 28 forms 3-stars: <28, (6, 13, 9)>, <28, (6, 13, 14)>, <28, (6, 13, 19)>, <28, (6, 20, 3)>, <28, (6, 20, 19)>
  
Total number of 3-stars formed: 31
Therefore, the final answer is [31].
