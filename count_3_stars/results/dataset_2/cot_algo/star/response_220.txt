Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 14) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges information:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 1: Neighbors {12, 13, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 8, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {8, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {7, 9, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 7, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 9, 10}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, 3-stars: [1]
- Node 1, 3-stars: [1]
- Node 2, 3-stars: [1]
- Node 3, 3-stars: [1]
- Node 4, 3-stars: [1]
- Node 5, 3-stars: [1]
- Node 6, 3-stars: [1]
- Node 7, 3-stars: [1]
- Node 8, 3-stars: [1]
- Node 9, 3-stars: [1]
- Node 10, 3-stars: [1]
- Node 11, 3-stars: [1]
- Node 12, 3-stars: [1]
- Node 13, 3-stars: [1]
- Node 14, 3-stars: [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15]. 

And the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 4, 6>, <1, 12, 13>, <2, 3, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, <7, 11, 14>, <10, 12, 14>.
