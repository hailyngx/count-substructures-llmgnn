Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
From the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- Node 0: {4, 7, 2}
- Node 1: {7, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 8, 3, 0}
- Node 3: {9, 4, 7, 6, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 2, 0, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 8, 4}
- Node 6: {5, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 6, 2, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8, 2, 3}

Now, we will find the 3-stars in this graph by following the procedure mentioned earlier.

For each node, find the neighbors:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 2}
- Node 1: {7, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 8, 3, 0}
- Node 3: {9, 4, 7, 6, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 2, 0, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 8, 4}
- Node 6: {5, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 6, 2, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8, 2, 3}

Node 0 and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them.
Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from Node 0) + 4 (from Node 9) = 5
So, the final answer is [5].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (4, 7, 2)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
- <9, (5, 6, 2)>
- <9, (5, 8, 2)>
- <9, (6, 8, 2)>
